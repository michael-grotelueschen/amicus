CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  We'll hear argument
now in Arthur Andersen v. United States.
Ms. Mahoney.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. MAHONEY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Government concedes that the destruction of
documents in anticipation of a proceeding was not a crime
in the fall of 2001 based upon a statutory rule that
Congress had preserved for over a century.  The central
question in this case is whether Congress, nevertheless,
intended to make a polite request to engage in that lawful
conduct, a form of witness tampering punishable by ten
years in prison.  We ask this Court to reject that
interpretation of the statute and to hold that Arthur
Andersen did not commit a crime.
I'd like to turn first to the term "corruptly
persuade" as it's used in Section 1512 and explain why
Arthur Andersen's interpretation represents not only a
reasonable reading, but the best reading of the language
in the statute.
The first thing that we see when we look at the
statutory context is that Congress did not prohibit -- did
not prohibit -- all persuasion to destroy documents for
the specific purpose of making them unavailable for use in
an official proceeding.  It did not, because it did not
simply say, "Anyone who persuades a witness to do this has
violated the statute."  It added a very important
limitation, and that is the word "corruptly" -- "corruptly
persuades."
So what kinds of requests are excluded from the
definition?  When is it that it's okay to persuade someone
to destroy a document for use in an official proceeding?
And the answer, we think, based on the traditional meaning
of the term "corruptly," is that "corruptly" means that
you have persuaded someone in a fashion that uses improper
means, such as bribery, or you've asked the witness to
violate duties imposed by other law, whether that's the
duties imposed by contempt or the duties imposed by a
whole range of statutes that govern the obligations of
people in our society.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But suppose you persuaded --
and I know that is not this case -- suppose you persuaded
the person to destroy the documents in order to conceal a
fraud.  Would that be corrupt?
MS. MAHONEY:  If -- Your Honor, if it was a
crime, then, yes --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in order to -- let's say
it's a revenue audit, and you know that it's a fraud, and
you persuade somebody to destroy the documents in order to
conceal the fraud.
MS. MAHONEY:  Okay, if this is in a -- in the
course of a proceeding, of course, it's obviously going to
be a crime, it's obviously going to be prohibited by
Section 1512.  If it is in advance of a proceeding -- and
let's assume that you know that a proceeding --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
MS. MAHONEY:  -- is likely, then the answer
depends on whether you know that you are concealing --
that you know a crime has been committed.  And if you know
that a crime has bee committed, then you are violating a
federal statute, 18 U.S.C. --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  My question is, Does that give
-- would that give some content to the meaning of
"corruptly," in your view?
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, in that case, if the witness
knows that you have committed a crime, and you are asking
them to violate, they have a duty, under those
circumstances, not to assist you in concealing your
offense.  That's a duty that's imposed by criminal law.
So if you ask them to violate that duty, then you are
corrupting that witness; and, very definitely, that would
fall within the interpretation of the statute that Arthur
Andersen is advancing here.
And it fits, Your Honor, with what Congress
really did for a hundred years before 2002.  What it did
is, it said that -- under the Pettibone rule, that it is
not a crime to simply destroy documents in anticipation of
a proceeding.  But if you know that -- if you know that a
crime has been -- a crime has been committed and you
destroy documents, that is a crime.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  May I --
MS. MAHONEY:  That's a crime --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  -- may I ask you about
another provision, Section 1515(c)?  And that says, this
chapter -- and it -- and it's referring back to Section
1512 -- "does not prohibit or punish the providing of
lawful bona fide legal representation services in
connection with, or anticipation of, an official
proceeding."
Now, how -- did Ms. Temple invoke that provision
in this case?
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, the -- that section
was not argued to the District Court, but it was invoked
in the following way, in two ways.  First of all, there
was evidence introduced in the case that she was providing
legal advice.  And since it is not in affirmative defense,
it really was the Government's burden at all times, at
least once there was evidence introduced that she was
providing legal advice, to get a finding from the jury
that she was not engaged in bona fide and lawful services,
particularly in this case, Your Honor, where the
Government argued, told the jury, that Nancy Temple was
the, quote, "central figure," end quote, in this -- in
this episode.  And in addition --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do you know it's not an
affirmative defense?
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, it doesn't read like an
affirmative defense, Your Honor.  It doesn't say
"affirmative defense."  It simply -- and in -- when it was
introduced, it was listed in the legislation as a Rule of
Construction.  And I think that's exactly how it reads.
It doesn't purport to put the burden of proof on Andersen,
or on Nancy Temple.
And, Your honor, I think, actually --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, of course, it has the
word "lawful," "the providing of lawful bona fide legal
representation services."  So, you know, it could be
argued that if she violating the other provisions, she's
still in violation.
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, Your Honor, under the
Government's definition of "corruptly," she couldn't have
been providing lawful bona fide services.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, that's what I want to
know, is, in light of the Government's position and the
way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what
does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision?  I'm
just curious how it all plays out.
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I think it negates it
in its entirety, because what the jury was instructed in
this case was that any intent to impede the fact-finding
ability of a possible future proceeding, even if the
Andersen employee had a good-faith and sincere belief that
their conduct conformed to the law, was corrupt.  They
were instructed that they must find that.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, does that have the
effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your
view?
MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely.  But I think, Your
Honor -- because I think it would be impossible to satisfy
it under this instruction.  In addition, I also think that
the -- that this provision really just demonstrates that
the Government's interpretation of "corruptly" is wrong,
to begin with.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  What's the effect, in
1512(b), of the word "knowingly"?
MS. MAHONEY:  I think, Your Honor, that
"knowingly" means, in this context -- just as it means
"knowingly intimidate," "knowingly threatened," "knowingly
corruptly persuade" -- that means that you have to know
that your persuasion is asking the witness to violate
their duties, to violate the law.  You have to know that
it's corrupt.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Isn't that satisfied at least
by the part of the definition that refers to "subverting
an official proceeding"?  I mean, that certainly carries,
to me, the implication that you realize that you're doing
something wrong.  An official proceeding is, prima facie
at least, lawful, and you are subverting it.  Doesn't that
satisfy the "knowingly" requirement?
MS. MAHONEY:  I don't think so, Your Honor,
because the definition that was given to this jury was
"subvert, undermine, or impede," and not just the
integrity of the proceeding; but, rather, the fact-finding
ability of a future proceeding --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I --
MS. MAHONEY:  -- including a governmental
inquiry.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- I think I would go far in
agreeing with you if the -- if the instruction had been
"merely to impede" or "merely to undermine."  Now, I guess
that gets to a question I wanted somebody to answer, and
you can probably do it.  Did the -- did the Court, in
giving the instructions, ever refer -- in defining the
term, ever refer to any of these three possibilities,
separately, or did it do it simply as "subvert, undermine,
or" -- what was the third? -- impede"?
MS. MAHONEY:  Impede.  I believe -- I believe it
was done as a -- as a -- as a group.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Okay.  It did --
MS. MAHONEY:  But it says "or."
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I -- one other question.  In
anticipation of that instruction -- I assume the counsel
new what was coming -- did the Government ever argue to
the jury that "merely impeding," alone, or "merely
undermining," alone, would be sufficient, as distinct from
saying, "If he subverts, undermines, and impedes"?
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, I'm not certain of the
answer, except that I do know that the Government did
argue that simply -- the mere idea that David Duncan
testified that, you know, he thought that the -- somebody
at the SEC might want to look at this information someday
was sufficient to satisfy the instructions.  And so, I
think it is a fair inference that the way that they argued
this case to the jury was that any intent to keep any kind
of information away from the SEC was enough to satisfy the
definition in this case.  And, in fact, Your Honor, when
the instructions were being debated, the pattern
instruction for the Fifth Circuit for "corruptly," under
1503, actually is -- includes the words "knowingly or
dishonestly to subvert the integrity of the proceeding."
The Government insisted that the word "dishonestly" not be
used, that the word "impede" be added, and they changed
"fact-finding" a bit -- changed it from "subverting the
proceedings" to "the fact-finding ability."  They did
everything they could to strip this instruction of any
mens rea, and then went beyond that and said, "And in
addition, even if the Andersen employees had a good-faith
and sincere belief that their conduct did not violate the
law, it's still a crime."
So, what we have here is an array of testimony
from people who say, "We honestly believed that this was
permissible conduct," but the jury was told that they had
to convict anyway if there was any possible partial
motivation to impede possible future fact-finding --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How does --
MS. MAHONEY:  -- of an inquiry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- how does -- how does David
Duncan's guilty plea -- he entered a plea of guilty to a
charge of obstruction, and he confessed the intent to
impede the SEC investigation by shredding documents.  So,
what were the elements of that offense that are absent in
this one?
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, he plead guilty to the
offense, as described to him and agreed upon between him
and his lawyer; in other -- and the Government -- which is
basically the instruction that was given in this case.
When he testified in this proceeding, he repeatedly said,
despite his guilty plea, that he did not believe, at the
time, that he had done anything unlawful or improper.  He
said, "I thought my conduct was perfectly appropriate.  I
plead guilty because I was persuaded that it didn't matter
what I thought at the time."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What sentence did he get, by
the way?
MS. MAHONEY:  He's not been sentenced yet, Your
Honor.
And he was explicit throughout.  He also said --
he never testified that he even thought that an SEC
proceeding was probable at the time; he just thought it
was possible.  Nor did he say that he ever consciously
tried to hide the truth or hide the facts.  What he did
say is that, "Yes, part of what was on my mind at the time
that I asked for compliance with this policy was that the
SEC and others might want to look at these files someday,
and I'd better get them in compliance with our retention
policy, because I know that drafts and notes are the kinds
of things that could be misused and misconstrued at some
point in the future."  That was the basis of his guilty
plea, that was the basis of his testimony in this case.
And the Government's interpretation, the instructions that
were given to this jury, deprived the term "corruptly
persuade" of any of its ordinary and traditional meaning.
Under the Government's view, for instance, of
"corruptly," bribery becomes irrelevant under this
statute.  I mean, if you look at this statute, and you
say, "What was Congress trying to prohibit here when it
says" -- it's a got a list of wrongful means of
interfering with witnesses.  It says "intimidate" and
"threaten" and "use of physical force," and it says
"corruptly persuades."  The first thing that would come to
your mind is bribery.  But bribery is irrelevant under the
Government's interpretation, and let me explain why.
Because they say that, "Well, yes, it's true, it says
'corruptly persuade,' but all that means if you -- is if
you had any intent to impede the fact-finding ability of a
proceeding, then you're guilty, just for asking.  It
doesn't matter whether you used any money -- monetary
compensation in order to extract this behavior; you're
automatically guilty.  But if you use bribery --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume it also would make
"intimidate," and so forth, quite superfluous.
MS. MAHONEY:  It absolutely would, Your Honor,
because it would basically cover any kind of request.
But, in addition, they say that under their
definition what it really means is that if you did it for
some other motive, if you got them to destroy the document
so that it couldn't be used in an official proceeding --
and that was your intent, that it couldn't be used in an
official proceeding -- and you bribed them to do it, but
your motive was to avoid embarrassment, it would not be a
crime.  Under Andersen's interpretation, it would still be
a crime, because of course you have corruptly persuaded
them to destroy a document for use in an official
proceeding, even if -- at the appropriate time, if there
is a nexus -- because it doesn't matter whether you were
trying to avoid embarrassment; if you were bribing them to
keep it out of the -- of the proceeding, of course that
would be covered by the traditional definition of
"corruptly persuade."
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose you're anticipating a
revenue audit from the Internal Revenue Service or from
the SEC, and you destroy certain documents that you're not
required to keep, but that would make the officials' task
easier; he you could perform the audit in just a couple of
days, instead of -- it's going to take him a week.  Can
you make it harder for him?
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, under Section 1519,
now, it may well be that that is criminal behavior,
because it -- Congress has now, basically, required you to
preserve documents.  But, at the time, no, that would not
have been a crime.  And if you could do it yourself, then
asking your wife to throw them out instead can't be what
Congress really had in mind under Section 1512.  You know,
hypothetical, the man could throw it out himself and not
go to jail, but if he asked his wife to do it, then he
goes to jail for ten years.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There is, in the case, this
lingering feeling that something's wrong out there.  I
know that we don't -- we don't convict people on that
basis; we require something more specific.
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, and I think that this
statute, reasonably read, Your Honor, tells you exactly
what that specific thing is.  If you intimidate them, if
you mislead them, if you use physical force, if you
corruptly persuade them.  And that means either you've
used unlawful means, like bribery, or you asked them to
violate their independent legal duties.  And that
definition, Your Honor, is quite consistent with the
traditional interpretation of the term "corruptly," even
in the obstruction statutes.
And I'd like to just emphasize, for instance, in
a tampering case, a juror tampering case that preceded the
congressional adoption of the term "corruptly persuades,"
the Jackson case, the jury was specifically instructed
that "corruptly" means "knowingly and willfully, with the
specific intent to influence a juror to violate his duties
as a petit juror."
Similarly, in Aguilar, in the District Court, the
jury was instructed -- that was a tampering case -- quote,
"an act is done corruptly if it is done voluntarily and
intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or
a lawful result by some unlawful method," end quote.
This is exactly parallel to the interpretation that
Andersen is asking this Court to adopt.  And if that if
that interpretation is adopted, it makes sense of this
statute.  If this statute isn't read in reference to the
violation of other legal duties, than it covers a whole
range of conduct that is unquestionably innocent --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I just don't like the
IRS, and I know they're coming.  I have some very detailed
summaries which will give them the answer they need right
away.  I throw away those summaries and make them go back
to the original records just to make it tough for them.
Can I do that?
MS. MAHONEY:  Section 1519, I don't think you
can.  Could you have done that in the -- in the fall of
2001?  Yes, Your Honor, you could.  What that really
reflects is the Pettibone rule.  The Pettibone rule, for a
hundred years, was that destruction and other kinds of
acts of potential obstruction in advance of a proceeding
were not a crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. Mahoney, we -- you know, we
all know that what are euphemistically termed "record-
retention programs" are, in fact, record-destruction
programs, and that one of the purposes of the destruction
is to eliminate from the files information that private
individuals can use for lawsuits and that Government
investigators can use for investigations.  And there has
been nothing unlawful about having such a program, even if
one of your purposes is not to leave lying around in the
file stuff that can be used against you by either the
government or a private individual.
So, I would have thought that your argument was
very persuasive, except for the fact of 1519.  I think
that 1519 gives me cause to believe that Congress could,
indeed, say, "You can't have record-retention programs."
How else do you interpret 1519?
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, they certainly hadn't said
it in the fall of 2001, Your Honor.  And so, for that
reason --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but I -- well, yeah, but
--
MS. MAHONEY:  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- but your argument is, you
know, "It's inconceivable that they would have meant
that."  But, my -- they said it in 1519 --
MS. MAHONEY:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- -- in 2002.
MS. MAHONEY:  -- let me put it this way.  If
they're gonna -- if they're going to say it, though, they
have to say it with very clear language, because,
otherwise, there would be no fair warning.  You couldn't
conclude from the language of the witness-tampering
statute, which is designed to protect witnesses, that
Congress had made all record-retention programs unlawful.
I also think, Your Honor, that when it comes
time to construe Section 1519, some kind of nexus will
have to be, you know, reasonably read in there, because,
otherwise, you are correct, all document retention
policies, or virtually all of them, are fatally doomed.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  And what is a
"document"?  I mean, in Justice Kennedy's example, is it
just some handwritten notes?  Do they become "documents"?
MS. MAHONEY:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  And, in
this case, the evidence was quite clear that, you know,
Andersen retained its work papers, and the work papers
were extremely extensive, and they were required to fully
document the audit.  The only things that were thrown away
were notes and preliminary drafts, which had already been
incorporated, in effect, into the final conclusions in the
work papers; and yet that was the whole theory of this
case, is that there were some documents that were
destroyed.  They were precisely the kinds of documents
that document-retention policies are designed to
eliminate, in part -- for a variety of reasons, but, in
part, because they are preliminary in character and they
can be misconstrued.
For instance, Your Honor, the FBI agents,
generally speaking, have the practice of not keeping their
notes of interviews.  They take those notes, they make a
file memorandum, they throw away the notes.  Why do they
do that?  Of course they know the defendant would love to
have those notes when it comes time for a trial.  They do
it because they feel that they have written it up in an
accurate way, and enough's enough.
That's what we're talking about here, Your Honor.
And there was nothing in the language of 1512 that would
have put Andersen on notice that its document-retention
policy was -- well, in fact, the Government doesn't say
its document retention was a crime; it says it wasn't a
crime.  Instead, the crime was when David Duncan asked his
secretary to throw away documents that he could have
thrown away, lawfully, himself.  This statute does not
give fair warning that that --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Was Section 1519 at issue?
MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  Section 1519 did
not get passed until the year 2002.  It did not exist.
Instead, the rule that was in force then was the Pettibone
rule, the one that's reflected in the text of Section
1505; and that is, "the proceeding must be pending."
That's, no doubt, why the Government didn't charge
Andersen with a crime under Section 1505.  I mean, they
make it sound like the culpability here is the destruction
of records.  Well, if so, then you would think that they
would have charged Andersen with destroying documents --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait a minute --
MS. MAHONEY:  -- but they didn't.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- wasn't there another
provision in effect that said it doesn't matter whether
the -- whether the proceeding is pending?  I forget which
one it is.
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, that -- no, that's just 15-
-- that's 1512, for witness tampering.  But for the act of
destroying documents to interfere with a proceeding --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MS. MAHONEY:  -- that's Section 1505, and the
proceeding must be pending.  And that is -- that is still
the rule today, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I -- just to make it
clear, I take it you would still have the same objection
to the deficiency of the corruption instruction, even if a
proceeding were pending, or am I wrong about that?
MS. MAHONEY:  Well, if a proceeding is -- yes,
we would, in this case.  Yes, absolutely.  But, you know,
if a proceeding is pending, then it changed the -- changes
the way that you apply the definition of "corruptly."  But
you're certainly right that the definition is the same.
The question is, under the proper definition of
"corruptly," did you induce the witnesses to engage in
this activity through improper means, such as bribery, or
did you try to get them to violate their independent legal
duties?  For instance, if they had duties, under Section
1519, not to destroy, then it makes perfect sense, because
what you have done is, you have asked the witness to
engage in conduct which violates the law, and that
corrupts them, it harms them, it fits with the purposes of
the statute, it fits with the structure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, it was proper, then, for
Michael Odom to tell the Andersen personnel when he's
encouraging them to follow the policy -- he said, "If it's
destroyed in the course of normal policy and litigation,
and litigation is filed the next day, that's great.  We
followed our policy, and whatever there was that might
have been of interest to somebody, it's gone and
irretrievable."
MS. MAHONEY:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's fine for him to make
that linkage between, "Destroy it.  Maybe there's going to
be litigation filed tomorrow."  "That's great.  It will be
gone"?
MS. MAHONEY:  Your Honor, at the time that he
made that statement, what that statement actually reflects
is the Pettibone rule.  He was accurate in his -- in his
statement about what the law was governing document
destruction at the time.  That's a good-faith reasonable
belief that was absolutely supported by the law.
But, more importantly, Your Honor, if we look at Mr.
Odom's remarks, he wasn't working -- he wasn't -- this
wasn't in connection with the Enron engagement; there were
only, I think, ten people, out of, like, 80, at that
training seminar that had anything to do with Enron.  He
was talking about the firm's document-retention policy.
The jury asked to see that videotape.  They may have
actually convicted Andersen based upon his remarks about
the document-retention policy.  They, similarly, may have
convicted Andersen based upon Nancy Temple's memos that --
one of which was a reminder to the engagement team that
they were supposed to applying -- complying with the
document-retention policy.  That's legal services.  This
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Odom wasn't saying this in
the abstract.  There were other proceedings, weren't
there?
MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor, it was just a
training session that was just a -- a section of the
training session.  It has -- literally, I think there were
89 attendees, only about ten of them --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  At the time of that training,
were there not other proceedings involving Arthur
Andersen?
MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  No, I don't
believe so.  That's --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  There were, involving Enron, at
that point, isn't that correct?  The -- Enron had gotten
the letter?
MS. MAHONEY:  No, Your Honor.  That was on
October the 10th.  The letter did not come until October
the 17th.  Andersen learned about it on October the 19th.
I'd like to save the remainder of my time for
rebuttal, please.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Very well, Ms.
Mahoney.
Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Arthur Andersen's conduct in this case explains
why Congress enacted a statute like Section 1512 that
protects against the anticipatory destruction of documents
when a proceeding is --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, Section 1519, enacted
subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than
1512?
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice O'Connor, Section 1519 was
enacted after the events --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Right.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- in this case in order to plug
the loophole that Arthur Andersen has pointed out existed
in Section 1512 at the time.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So you think it's superfluous.
1519, if you win this case, really is just an exercise in
futility, because the law already did what 1519 said.
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  The law did not already do
what 1519 says.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wherein does it go further?
MR. DREEBEN:  It reaches single-actor
obstructive conduct.  What Ms. Mahoney has said --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what about the
Pettibone interpretation that has been outstanding for a
long time?
MR. DREEBEN:  Pettibone applied, Justice
O'Connor, to a specific statute, Section 1503, and it's
similarly incorporated in 1505.  Those statutes protected
against obstruction of pending judicial, administrative,
and congressional proceedings.  The innovation in Section
1512 was to reach beyond the existence of a pending
proceeding and to ensure that basically the store doesn't
get robbed before the proceeding starts.
If Arthur Andersen is correct, the anticipation of a
grand jury investigation that is thought to occur the next
day, a corporation can send out a directive to its
employees and say, "Shred all the smoking guns."  It's the
corporate equivalent of seeing something that looks like a
crime scene and sending somebody in before the police can
get the yellow tape up to wipe down the fingerprints.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  When can they do it?  When can
they do it?  You didn't allege here that it was in
anticipation of any particular proceeding.  You say they
can't do it once they know that the investigation is on
the way.  But your theory in this case is that they can't
do it, whether they know the investigation is on the way
or not.  They can't destroy any evidence that might be the
subject of an investigation.
MR. DREEBEN:  No, that's not our theory --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is your theory?
MR. DREEBEN:  Our theory is that a person acts
corruptly when anticipating a reasonable possibility of an
investigation into a specific matter, directs another
person to destroy documents that are potentially relevant.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "A reasonable possibility of an
investigation."
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you want criminal liability
to turn upon that.
MR. DREEBEN:  I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether or not there is a
reasonable possibility of an investigation.  You want
somebody to go to jail on how a jury decides that
question.
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think there's anything
unusual about the decision of that kind of question at
all.  It's a analogous, but different and quite
distinguishable nexus requirement from the kind of nexus
requirement that this Court interpreted Section 1503 to
have in the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I have a company and I
know that the pattern is, I'm going to be audited every
five years by the IRS.  And in year four, I -- one year --
one year before the investigation, I instruct my
bookkeeping staff, "Keep everything you need to document
our expenses, but destroy everything that's remotely
related to that, or indirectly related to that.  Give them
just a clean, simple file.  Destroy anything that's -- all
supporting documentation.  Give them what they need and
what they're entitled to have, but nothing else.  And
step up that policy, because they're going to be here next
year."  Under your -- it seems to me that that violates
your rule.
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Kennedy, it turns on
whether the intent there is to subvert, undermine, or
impede the proceeding.  And the answer is, if it is yes,
then it would be prohibited by this statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, it would be prohibited to
tell somebody to do it.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you could do it.  The doing
of it is perfectly okay.
MR. DREEBEN:  That was a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Doesn't that seem strange to
you?
MR. DREEBEN:  It seemed strange to Congress,
too.  And when this case threw a spotlight on that
omission in the statute, Congress didn't react --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would suggest that it throws
a spotlight on the fact that your theory is wrong.  It
doesn't --
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- it doesn't make -- it
doesn't make any sense to make unlawful the asking of
somebody to do something which is, itself, not unlawful,
so that the person could do it, but if you asked them to
do it, you're guilty, he's not guilty.  And that's -- that
is weird.
[Laughter.]
MR. DREEBEN:  What was weird about it, Justice
Scalia, is that it allowed the person to do it himself.
And when Congress --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, let me ask you about
this precise thing.  Is it Mr. Duncan?  If he had,
himself, shredded the documents, or destroyed them, that
was perfectly okay at the time it was done.
MR. DREEBEN:  It wasn't --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Is that right?
MR. DREEBEN:  -- prohibited by this statute.
And when --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It would not have been a
violation.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But the Government got the
conviction, got him to plead guilty, apparently, on the
basis that if he asked somebody else to do what was
perfectly lawful for him to do, it would violate the
statute.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, Justice O'Connor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, what -- how do you read
that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor
provision for legal advice and so on?
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that the safe-harbor
provision substantially bears on this case at all.  First
of all, Arthur Andersen never raised the safe-harbor
provision, so that the Government would --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  And the woman lawyer never
raised it, is that right?
MR. DREEBEN:  Nancy Temple was not a defendant
in this case, but her conduct was at issue, because, after
having immediately recognized that an SEC investigation
was highly probable, Nancy Temple sends out a document
reminder saying --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well --
MR. DREEBEN:  -- basically, "purge the files."
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But under this statute, with
the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her,
as a lawyer, to say, "You can destroy these documents"?
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it is, in this case, if her
intent was to subvert, undermine, or impede the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But your definition of
"subvert, undermine" is, if you destroy any document that
might raise a question, say, in the IRS audit.  It seems
to me that is a sweeping position, which will cause
problems for every major corporation or small business in
this country.  I just -- I just don't understand it.
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,
because the Government's position here has never been that
the mere existence of a document-destruction policy used
under routine circumstances is a violation of the statute.
What the Government focused on in this case was using a
document-destruction policy as a pretext and a cover to
clean up and purge files when a government investigation
was anticipated and it was perceived that these materials
would be relevant.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that's like in -- the
old -- the rule in the Army, "Make two copies of
everything you throw out."  I mean, that's what they're
going to have to do.
[Laughter.]
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You used words --
MR. DREEBEN:  Under this statute, Justice
Kennedy, that's not the issue.  I think the timeline here
is critical.  This was not a company that was routinely
exercising a document-destruction policy, or document-
retention policy, to maintain only that which was
necessary for its ongoing business.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, it was.  The training
session that you introduced in evidence was precisely
that, a general training session for all employees,
saying, "This is our document," quote, "retention policy."
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, but that was triggered, in
part, by Nancy Temple's recognition -- in the midst of
serving on a crisis response team, recognizing that Enron
was in the process of imploding, Arthur Andersen, which
was basically on probation with the SEC -- because it had
been previously sanctioned, twice, during the prior
summer, and was under a cease and desist order -- and
seeing the SEC coming down the pike, at that moment, she
decides to remind the Enron team, which had not been at
all compliant with this document-retention policy, "It's
time to get the files in line."  This wasn't because all
of a sudden the company had become preoccupied with
neatness; it was so that it could document, in its audit
work papers, those things that supported its conclusions.
That's what its document policy said.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  He says that occurred before
Enron had even gotten a letter.
MR. DREEBEN:  But not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That meeting.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- not before Enron's problems had
begun to become -- surfacing in the Wall Street Journal,
in the financial press, the stock price was sliding.
Everybody who was sophisticated in this environment -- and
surely Arthur Andersen was -- knew that when a Fortune 500
company is looking at a potential need to restate its
income statements because the accountants have been --
proved a black-and-white violation of GAAP, and they all
knew that that was true, that SEC proceedings are likely
to occur.  Even the witness --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you -- if you had alleged
that they did this in order to cover up a fraud, there
would be no problem.  But what you're doing is to say it's
illegal to do what every other company in the country can
do if they don't have an audit immediately on the horizon.
I just don't understand it.
MR. DREEBEN:  No other company in the country
would do this, Justice Kennedy.  This is an extraordinary
case precisely because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say that it would be
perfectly okay for this company, or any other one, to
destroy their documents.  What's bad is telling somebody
to destroy the documents.
MR. DREEBEN:  But in an organizational context,
that's the only way that directives like this can be given
out and implemented.  This wasn't a case of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know you know that the --
you've put your finger on a problem for me.  You have
said, Would it be the case that a person, before the
proceeding begins, could simply tell somebody else to
destroy the smoking gun?  I understand that you fear that
Andersen's approach would lead to that result.  And it's
bothering me.  Therefore, I'd like you whether the word
"corruptly" could include a person who knows three things:
one, that the investigation, which has not yet started,
almost certainly will want this document; two, there is no
legal right to withhold it; and, three, that if I tell him
to do it, it will be destroyed -- I mean, that it's
important to the investigation.  Important to the
investigation, they want it, it's cover-up, and they will,
in fact, have no legal right to take it back.  Now, would
that be "corrupt"?
MR. DREEBEN:  Yes, it would --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- be "corrupt."
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  IF that's "corrupt,"
then does that cover this case?
MR. DREEBEN:  I think that it does cover this
case, and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  How?  Because it seems to me
there was quite a lot of -- by the way, the person who's
doing the persuading has to know this.  They have to know
that it will be wanted, that it's important, and there is
no legal right to withhold it.  So it seems to me that, on
the one hand, that does cover your problem, and, on the
other hand, it does not cover this case.  Now, that's what
I'd like you to reply to.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, Justice Breyer, I think that
the facts of the case are subsumed within the description
that you've given.  The jury instructions did not require
findings on all of those features; and that is, in large
part, because of the kinds of instructions that Arthur
Andersen --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The jury instruction left
out the word "corruptly," as far as I can see, in the part
that was critical.  They define "corruptly" as simply an
intent to impede.  And the word "impede" goes well beyond
what I've said, both because it does not cover the three
things, but, most particularly, because it does not say
that it was dishonest or that the person who did the
persuading knew that the jury or the grand jury or the
investigation would have the legal right to get the
material and there was no right to withhold it.  The words
that Arthur Andersen suggested, while they don't say
precisely that, were at least a step in the right
direction.
MR. DREEBEN:  The jury instruction said less
than what you have suggested, Justice Breyer, no question
about it, but what they did require was that there be an
intent to undermine, subvert, or impede the investigation.
I think --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Wasn't -- wasn't that
instruction, itself, undermined by what I understand to be
the instruction that good-faith belief in the legality of
what was being done was no defense?  I mean, if you had an
instruction that depended upon the word "subvert," I could
-- I could understand your argument.  But it seems to me
that the difficulty with your argument, and the difficulty
with your answer to Justice Breyer, is that it went beyond
"subvert" to merely "impede," and it included an
instruction that good faith was no defense.
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Souter, this is to
statute, and the word "corruptly" is not a word, that has
been ever construed to require consciousness of
illegality.  That is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Yeah, the word "knowingly."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about "knowingly"?  Does
that -- does that usually connote knowledge of the
illegality?
MR. DREEBEN:  Definitely not.  The word
"knowingly" usually connotes knowledge of the underlying
facts.  And, in this case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Knowingly corruptly."
MR. DREEBEN:  The word "knowingly" does not
travel down the statute to modify "corruptly."  It --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I don't see why it doesn't.  I
mean, there's no grammatical break.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, there is a logical break,
because if it travel down the statute and reach all the
way to "misleading conduct," what Congress would have
written is a statute, when you read the definition of
"misleading conduct," that says, "whoever knowingly
knowingly makes a false statement," because the definition
of misleading conduct includes "knowingly making false
statements," "knowingly omitting things," "intentionally
engaging in deceptive behavior."  And you'd end up with a
-- in a redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever.
It makes sense for Congress to have said,
"knowingly used force or intimidation."  But then when you
get to the word "threat," there is inherent knowledge in
it.  "Corruptly" inherently embodies knowledge.  And the
definition of "misleading conduct" inherently --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, it's certainly --
MR. DREEBEN:  -- embodies knowledge.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  I mean, I will -- I will grant
you that the definition that the Government asked for, and
got, for "corruptly persuades," does have that
implication, so far as the "subvert" prong is concerned.
But when you get beyond the "subvert" prong, and you get
down to the third one, "merely to impede," you're getting
pretty thin, so far as the -- as the implication of
knowledge of wrongdoing is concerned, and you've still go
the problem of the instruction that negated good faith is
a defense.
MR. DREEBEN:  Let me try to address each of
those.  First of all, the words were used as a definition
of "improper purpose," and they were used together,
"subvert, undermine, or impede," and they logically have a
relationship to each other.  When the Court of Appeals
looked at those words and defined them, which it did, it
talked about subversion and undermining as being a ruining
of the proceedings and an overthrow of the attempt that
the Government was anticipated to make.  And I think,
"impede" has to be read logically in that group.  Now, I
will acknowledge that "impeding" can have broader
connotations, but it's not a word that's is foreign to the
obstruction --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why did -- if that is so, why
did you need it?  In other words, you had a -- you had a
pattern instruction, apparently, that was -- that was
keyed to "subversion," which I think would be an easy
argument for you.  If the addition of "impede" really
wasn't adding that much, why did you ask the Court to put
it in there?
MR. DREEBEN:  Here is what it adds, Justice
Souter.  "Undermine" and "subvert" have a connotation of
completely preventing the performance of the official duty
in the proceeding.  "Impede" removes any implication that
you need to totally thwart the government activity in
order to be guilty of this crime.  It's enough to
"interfere" with it, which is the word that the Court of
Appeals used to define it.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  But you could
undermine and be unsuccessful.  It's not as though
undermine means that you're necessarily going to succeed.
MR. DREEBEN:  No, but it was to avoid any
connotation that the jurors might put on the linkage of
those words that the Government sought the use of the word
"impede."  And I should note that it appears, in Section
1503, Section 1505 --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  But not in 1512.
MR. DREEBEN:  That's correct.  That's correct.
But what --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  It's not there.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- what the Government was doing
in this instance was attempting to give content to the
word "corruptly" that would enable the jurors to know that
they can convict if the purpose that the defendant had in
dusting off this document policy and using it as a pretext
to destroy documents was to interfere with the fact-
finding ability of an anticipated proceeding.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, but it sounds like --
actually, I'll grant you that it appears in the statute,
but that's, in a sense, my problem.  The statute talks
about "corruptly persuading another person to destroy a
paper with the intent to impair that paper's availability
for use in an official proceeding."  So, then we look at
the instruction, and the instruction speaks of "destroying
the paper with the intent, at least in part, to impede."
Fine.  It sounds like it's just the same as the statute,
but for one thing, the omission in the instruction of the
word "corruptly."
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Breyer, it's a definition
of "corruptly" that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So to define
"corruptly" as "doing the same thing that the rest of the
statute does" seems a little strange.  If I were a juror,
I might think that there is missing here any dishonesty of
purpose.
MR. DREEBEN:  The Court of Appeals addressed the
argument, which Petitioner makes, that the definition of
"corruptly" that was used in this case is redundant and
superfluous in light of the additional intent that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's not perfectly redundant.
One can imagine driving a wedge between making something
unavailable, which the jury would find relevant, or the
investigator would find relevant, and impeding the fact-
finding ability of the investigator.  They're not
logically identical, but they do strike me as so similar
that it's hard to expect a juror to make much of a
difference between those two phrases.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that they have a
very significant difference, an important function in
ensuring that this statute is not applied beyond the scope
of protection of the integrity of proceedings, which is
what Congress intended it to do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Dreeben, would you indulge
me to go back to a previous answer you gave?  I'm sorry, I
didn't quite get it.  In responding to Justice Souter's
inquiry concerning the word "knowingly," you said the word
"knowingly" appears later, so that it would be -- it would
be reduplicative.  What later appearance are you talking
about, in 1512(b)?
MR. DREEBEN:  Justice Scalia, on page 5(a) --
or, I'm sorry, on page 3(a) --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  3(a), right.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- of the Government's appendix --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- to its brief, at the bottom of
the page, subsection (b) --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- appears, "Whoever knowingly
uses intimidation or physical force" --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. DREEBEN:  -- et cetera.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. DREEBEN:  The last phrase in the sequence is
"engages in misleading conduct towards another person."
That phrase is, in turn, defined in the statute on page
11(a) and 12(a) of the same appendix, the Government's
appendix.  It's Section 1515(a)(3).  And it says the term
"misleading conduct" means "knowingly making a false
statement; intentionally omitting information from a
statement; with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or
inviting reliance on a writing; or, with intent to
mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a
sample;" and, finally, "knowingly using a trick scheme or
device."
So, "knowingly" is to be read in as if it were
part of Section 1512 when it comes to defining the term
"engaging in misleading conduct," so you would end up with
a statute that Congress have, for some reason, drafted
that includes the word "knowingly" at the beginning, and
then "knowingly" later as the definition of one of the
terms that the initial "knowingly" --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I don't know how you can
avoid that.
MR. DREEBEN:  You avoid it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "Whoever knowingly engages in
misleading conduct," which is later defined as --
MR. DREEBEN:  No.  It's, "Whoever knowingly uses
intimidation or physical force."  That's what "knowingly"
applies to.  And then the words "threaten, corruptly
persuade, and engages in misleading conduct," have
inherent knowledge in them.  In other words --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  The "knowingly"
only applies to "uses intimidation or physical force."
MR. DREEBEN:  That's right, because "corruptly"
is, and always has been, a scienter term, and its
appearance in Section 1512 is a direct lineal descendant
from the fact that that word appears in Section 1503.
When Congress enacted this statute, it had every reason to
believe, because it intended to do this, that the
definition of "corruptly," that had been fairly widespread
in the use of the word in Section 1503, would be applied
to 1512.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  Why --
MR. DREEBEN:  And, in that context --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- why isn't the answer to your
argument that the requirement in (b) -- "knowingly"
requirement in (b) doesn't travel all the way down through
the series, but it travels at least as far as "corruptly
persuades"?
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, that's sort of reading the
statute just to achieve a result.
JUSTICE SOUTER:  No, but we know it --
MR. DREEBEN:  I think it's contrary to --
JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- applies to something at the
beginning of the series.  It's got -- it's got some work
to do.  You've made an argument that it doesn't apply, or
it would be logically absurd to apply it, to something at
the end of the series, and we're somewhere in the middle.
And why isn't the answer to your argument simply to say,
"Okay, it doesn't travel all the way to the end, but it
travels up to the end, and it travels as far as this"?
MR. DREEBEN:  Because a "threat," itself, which
is the third term in the series, and the one that precedes
the term that's at issue here, also involves an element of
scienter or knowledge.  You can use intimidation
inadvertently.  You could be a very heavy, dangerous-
looking guy, standing out in front of the grand jury room,
and a witness might come along and see you and realize, to
himself, "Uh-oh, I'm in trouble if I testify."  If you
haven't done that knowingly --
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that big, heavy guy
would violate the statute just by standing there?
MR. DREEBEN:  He wouldn't, Chief Justice
Rehnquist, precisely because it requires that he knowingly
use intimidation.  So that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think you can -- you
can use intimidation unknowingly, any more than you can
threaten unknowingly.  If they felt it necessary to put
"knowingly" before "use intimidation," I think they would
have felt it necessary to put "knowingly" before
"threaten."  The two terms are just about identical.
MR. DREEBEN:  Well, I think that they're
actually quite different in the context of this statute,
but even if the Court were to conclude that "knowingly"
did travel down and produce a phrase, "knowingly
corruptly," the word "knowingly" generally in the criminal
law refers to "knowledge of the facts that make your
conduct unlawful."  Arthur Andersen here is asking for a
very --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, the --- in general terms,
when you speak of "general interpretation," I suppose I
think it possible to approach ambiguous criminal statutes
with the following idea.  Congress did not intend to try
to make of the statute a highly general weapon for the
Justice Department to pick and choose.  That's a
notification problem.  It's also because we don't want one
law, "It is a crime to do wrong, in the opinion of the
Attorney General."  You know, I mean, we want to have
narrow criminal statutes.
Now, is it reasonable to start with that frame
of mind?  And if it is, doesn't that tend to cut against
you in this case?
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that it does,
Justice Breyer.  There are, of course, contexts where the
Court concludes that a statute, after applying all the
tools of statutory construction, is ambiguous, and then
rules of construction do apply to narrow it; but there is
no provision that says that the Court should approach the
question of construction with a view to narrow it.  I
think --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:  Well, how about the rule of
lenity in the criminal statutes?  If this thing is so
confusing, how's the business person supposed to know what
they can do?  How's the lawyer supposed to know?
MR. DREEBEN:  I don't think that it is that
confusing, Justice O'Connor.  This is a statute that was
enacted against the backdrop of Section 1503 in a well-
understood meaning of the word "corruptly."  The same word
appears in Section 1505.  When the D.C. Circuit concluded
that that provision was vague, as applied to a particular
case, Congress came back with a definition that
legislatively overruled the D.C. Circuit decision and said
"corruptly" means "acting with an improper purpose."  The
"improper purpose" in an obstruction-of-justice case has
traditionally been "the purpose to obstruct justice."
That definition logically applies to Section
1512, because Congress enacted the corruptly-persuades
provision to remedy a deficiency in prior law, because it
had not included non-coercive, non-deceptive witness-
tampering in the statute, originally.  And some courts
concluded that it was no longer punishable under Section
1503, either.
To fix that situation, Congress looked to the model
of Section 1503 case law, where there had been a variety
of acts that are covered that under Petitioner's test
would not be, such as secreting a witness, or sequestering
a witness, in anticipation of a subpoena so that the
witness would be unavailable to testify, or destroying
documents before a subpoena had been issued, but in an
anticipation that the subpoena was likely.  Those kinds of
acts were considered to be unlawful.
Similarly, giving advice, even as a lawyer, to
an individual to assert the Fifth Amendment in bad faith,
not to protect that individual's own interest, but to
obstruct justice by protecting other members of a criminal
organization, or, indeed, the lawyer himself, lower courts
had recognized could be prosecuted; not uniformly had
recognized, but they had uniformly recognized it at the
time of the enactment of this statute.  And Congress
specifically said, "We want 1512 to be able to pick up the
kinds of cases that some courts have said are no longer
prosecutable under Section 1503, and that had not been
included in the original version of 1512."  So that there
is history here that explains how these terms should be
applied.
And as far as Petitioner's contention that the
word "corruptly" does nothing and leads to a series of
horrible hypotheticals, actually a sensitive and
appropriate use of the word "corruptly" solves those
problems.  Petitioners talk about how people should be
able to urge each other not to cooperate with a voluntary
investigation, that it's part of citizenship to be able to
engage in those conversations.  But if an entity has
subpoena authority and it doesn't invoke it, and it simply
invites people voluntarily to cooperate, it is not going
to be an intent to subvert, undermine, or impede that
proceeding to invite them to exercise that right.  If the
agency wants their testimony, it can get it through
compulsion.
Similarly, Petitioners argue that document
policies are, per se, made unlawful under the Government's
approach.  But as the Court of Appeals specifically
recognized in this case, a sound application of the word
"corruptly" would look to whether there is a threat of
some kind of specific proceeding that might trigger an
obligation not to destroy the documents before the
proceeding gets started.
And, as well, there are intents that are simply
not intents to subvert the administration of justice, that
may result in rendering certain evidence unavailable.  And
if a person engages in that conduct, it may well violate
another provision of criminal law, but it doesn't have to
violate 1512.  And a sound use of "corruptly" prevents all
of those hypotheticals from materializing and leading to
the conclusion that the statute is unduly broad.
Now, Petitioner in this case, in addition to
attacking the word "corruptly," also has advanced a number
of arguments that there was inadequate instruction on some
connection that had to be required between the Defendant's
intent in a possible future proceeding.  But the reason
that there was no adequate instruction on those issues is
largely because Petitioner, itself, deliberately decided
to ask for two instructions that were contrary to the
statute, and never asked for what it's asked this Court to
impose today.  It never asked that the Defendant must be
shown to believe that some particular proceeding was
likely to occur in the near future.  Instead, what it did
is say that the Defendant had to have an intent to impair
an object's availability for use in a particular
proceeding.  And what the Court of Appeals said is that if
there was any problem in that, it's not reversible error;
it's harmless, because everybody knew that the proceeding
that was anticipated was an SEC investigation of Enron.
And the other instruction that Petitioners asked
for in the District Court is that the official proceeding
must be ongoing or scheduled to be commenced in the
future.  But that instruction is flatly contrary to the
statute.

Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. MAHONEY:  Thank you.
I'd like to first address the fact that much of
the Government's argument is focused on this nexus, the
imminence of the proceeding, that sort of thing, but
actually the jury was not required to find any nexus
whatsoever, and was told the wrong definition of an
"official proceeding," to boot.  It was told that the
informal inquiry by the SEC staff was an official
proceeding, and that an official proceeding was already
going on at the time of the events at issue here; in fact,
even before Nancy Temple even knew about that informal
inquiry, which, in and of itself, is reversible error.
And --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you think it should
have been?
MS. MAHONEY:  The "official proceeding," at
worst, Your Honor, it was the formal investigation of the
SEC, which is commenced by a vote of the Commission and
has compulsory process available.  It is certainly not a
staff person sitting in their office in Houston opening a
file and doing some Internet searches.  That's the
Government's definition.  That's in -- a matter within the
jurisdiction of an agency, and that's not the language
that appears in this statute.
Also, in terms of whether Andersen raised this
argument, of course they did.  They asked for an
instruction that the proceeding be ongoing or scheduled,
because that was Fifth Circuit law at the time.  Andersen
wasn't supposed to guess that the Fifth Circuit was going
to change what it had held in case called Shively.  And
the Fifth Circuit understood that Andersen had preserved
the argument, and expressly says in its opinion that the
issue is, What is the concreteness of the Defendant's
expectation of a proceeding that should be required under
this statute? -- and found that "feared" was enough.
That's not enough.  "Possible" is not enough, especially
if a broad definition, like the one the Government wants
to have -- there's got to be a serious nexus.
Nexus problems can be avoided, though, if the
more traditional definition of "corruptly" is used in the
first place, which is not only required by lenity, but,
frankly, is required even by the witness-tampering cases
under Section 1503.  As I read to you, the definitions of
"corruptly" are completely consistent with Andersen's
definition.
The Government says, "Oh, no.  In fact, all it
meant under 1503 was an intent to obstruct justice."  That
can't possibly be what Congress intended for Section 1512,
because this Court had held, for -- a hundred years ago,
that you necessarily lack the evil intent to obstruct if a
proceeding is not pending.  And 1512 does apply even
before proceedings begin, so the definition had to be
tailored to the precise circumstances of Section 1512.  It
couldn't import the precise thing.
Plus, the definition under 1503 has never been
any intent to impede the fact-finding ability is a
prohibited intent.  That would require lawyers and clients
all over the country to go to jail.  It's that you intend
to subvert and undermine the integrity of the due
administration of justice.  And that term does not mean
simply to impede the fact-finding; it means that you
intend to disobey those duties that are imposed upon you
in the course of a proceeding.  And cases, including the
Howard case cited in our brief and cited by the
Government, make that crystal clear.  It is not translated
to what this jury instruction was, which is that -- any
intent to impede fact-finding.
Just take a look at the examples, if the
Government were correct about this.  If I were to ask my
lawyer to assert, let's say, a reporter's privilege that
is debatable, under the Government's -- and I do it,
because I know that that document is harmful, and I want
to keep it out of the proceeding -- under the Government's
definition, that is corrupt, because I am trying to get
another person to withhold a document in order to impede
the fact-finding ability of the decision-maker.
It makes no sense to define "corruptly" that
way.  If you, instead, define it with reference to duties,
it makes perfect sense.  That's not corrupt, because there
is no duty to provide a document when you have a good-
faith claim of privilege.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:  Thank you, Ms.
Mahoney.  The case is submitted.
