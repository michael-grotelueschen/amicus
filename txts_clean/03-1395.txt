JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in the
case of Tenet against John Doe.
Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
This case, like the Totten case almost 130 years
ago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain
additional compensation for services rendered.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, do you take the position
that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision
of such an agreement either?
MR. CLEMENT: That's correct. That's correct,
Justice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage
arrangements and contracts we're talking about.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, suppose -- suppose
somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to -- by the
Government to have breached the agreement by writing and
publishing a tell-all book about it.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think
that actually points up the important differences between
the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way
that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents
are alleged to be.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, okay.
MR. CLEMENT: With respect to espionage
agents --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would the Government be
without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
MR. CLEMENT: I believe that's true, Justice
O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign
prepublication review agreements. They do not receive
formal security clearances the way that an employee does.
And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad
swath of classified information that raises attendant
counterintelligence concerns. And so if you think about
the course of dealing that the agency has with its
employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in
court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can
turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like
the prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at
issue in this Court's Snepp decision. So in the
employment context, I think it's very difficult to say
that there's an implied term of the employment contract
that either side will not have judicial recourse.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the employment
contract is with an American citizen to act as an
espionage agent and nobody else knew about it. Would --
would that -- would he be treated as an espionage agent or
as an employee?
MR. CLEMENT: If I understand your hypothetical,
Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated
as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a
one-off assignment.
And I think that -- that is illustrated by this
Court's decision in Totten. I mean, William Lloyd, for
example, was a U.S. citizen. He agreed with President
Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south.
And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr.
Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there
was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement,
and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's
contingent fund.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I'd like your help on
this. Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that
there is just no actionable contract, or does it say
there's no jurisdictions like political question? I mean,
you win under any of those theories, if we accept them.
But which is it?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a
difficult question to answer because I think there are a
lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision,
and I think there is --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but you need to get to
whether there is -- do you urge dismissal for lack of
jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the
merits? It's not clear to me at all.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, I think
it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that
it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect. It's been
referred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a
rule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded
us recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use
terms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not going
away with a clear idea of your position.
MR. CLEMENT: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I -- do I -- does the
Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction,
(b)(6), no cause of action? Of course, you'd probably
do both, but I -- I want to know --
MR. CLEMENT: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what your best thinking is
of what Totten means. It seems to me that this just means
that there can be no contract formed under these
circumstances.
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, I think the
general practice of the Government is to file under both.
I believe that's what happened here. I think the fact
that we file under both suggests that there is a little
bit of confusion about it. I would tend to agree with you
it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under
(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision,
there's really two strains to the decision.
One is a recognition that the claim to relief
necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always
regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't
proceed. And that's very analogous to this Court's
holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action.
There's a second strain to the case, though, and
that is that the very idea of walking into court and
filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of
the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage
relationship. And I think particularly if you emphasize
that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's
better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what
you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and
they are effectively pleading themselves out of court
because as -- if you look at this complaint here, it
starts out with a recitation of the fact that these
individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and
that they were denied certain promises that were made to
them after they carried out, quote, their end of the
bargain.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there's no cause of action,
there's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the
closest analogy? Is it like a promise to make a gift,
which is unenforceable? Is there kind of a contract
analogy that we can use?
MR. CLEMENT: I -- I mean, I -- you know, one --
one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very
rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract.
It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. And
I think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of
these cases, which is there is something inherent in an
espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage
relationship, you understand that you have no protected
status under the law.
I think that has, with respect, been clear in
the -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very
beginning of the republic. I mean, ever since Nathan Hale
agreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood
that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that
was not recognized at the law. And I think that is -- it
has always been thus, and I think there is no reason to
revisit the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Does -- does that mean -- the
no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an
agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?
MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't believe that's true,
Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a
constitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged
agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage
relationship. As I would understand your question, I
mean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due
process claim that anybody could bring if the Government
tortured them. They wouldn't have to allege that I had a
secret espionage relationship with the Government and then
they tortured me. That would be irrelevant to their
claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- could I bring you
back to your -- your earlier discussion of a spy who is
also a -- a Government employee? Are you telling me that
he -- he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because
the work he was doing was -- was espionage? I mean, he's
-- he's a GS-whatever, GS-16, and the Government just
doesn't send him his monthly check.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He has no recourse for that
check just because he's been doing spy work?
MR. CLEMENT: No, that's not the position, and
-- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in
answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical. I understood to
be the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who
engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then
tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that --
for that particular endeavor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, not -- not for his
regular GS salary.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No. My -- my hypothetical was
an individual who's not a Government employee but is hired
by the Government to engage in espionage activities.
MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. And as I indicated to
you earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not
a hypothetical. That's the Totten decision itself.
William Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was
employed by President Lincoln to engage in those services.
And in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William
Lloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the
Comptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue
to get whatever remedies he had --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus
for being a spy. Right?
MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right. No bonus
dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you clarify on the
employment question something else? It's -- it's in your
reply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of
claim with a title VII claim which -- in which you say
that the Court in Webster relied on the CIA's historical
practice of litigating employment disputes. The CIA's
historical practice, not the Court's rulings. Are you
suggesting that even with respect to employment
litigation, it's up to the CIA to decide what its practice
will be?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice
Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I
think that the Government would have had almost no ability
to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title
VII case is because of its course of dealing with its
employees. And I suppose that if the agency completely
changed its course of dealing with respect to its
employees or entered a very different course of dealing
with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might
become available in those circumstances.
But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look
at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and
rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones,
that's a very different relationship than the agency has
with respect to espionage agents. And again, that's
because they enter contracts with them. Each side has
certain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit
of a stretch for the Government to come in and say that
there's an implied term of that employment agreement that
forecloses a judicial remedy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the Government can't
enforce -- cannot enforce these contracts either. Right?
I mean, you take the good with the -- the bad with the
good?
MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You've never sued a spy to --
who hasn't carried out his mission?
MR. CLEMENT: Certainly not -- I'm not aware of
such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's
impossible. And I think it just reflects the nature of
these agreements, and it does -- it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- can we go back to the
-- another threshold question? You did press below and
Judge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in
the district court in California, or wherever, is it has
to be in the Federal Circuit. This is a contract claim
against the Government. Are you abandoning that position?
MR. CLEMENT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we
have abandoned it. We abandoned that position at the cert
stage. We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari
papers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional
objection at this stage.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you free -- are you free
to abandon it? Is the -- is the Government's surrender of
its immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the
suit is brought in the Federal Circuit -- is that
something that you are free -- Congress having said that,
that the executive is free to say, well, we could take
advantage of that, but we don't want to?
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think the
answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in
the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our
view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court
could reach that issue and send the case back on the
Tucker Act grounds. So maybe I could explain to you why
it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem,
at least at this stage of the litigation.
The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a
little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two
parts to it. First of all, that there might be some kind
of substantive due process claim here that did not depend
on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact
that there was some endangerment of these individuals and
that gave rise to some substantive due process right. And
even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is
not one that is formed on the contract or an implied
contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's
clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because
it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the
individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where
they will be endangered.
And I think that was certainly true of William
Lloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern lines,
he was very much endangered, and that's something that
wasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our
opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln
about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the
need for secrecy to protect that.
So that's why I think that claim is properly
understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not
being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but
nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine.
The other point they made was with respect to
the specific regulations that the agency has internally,
and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was
based on the regulations independent of the contract. But
in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would
have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations.
And even if the Court is right that there's a
need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no
sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the
Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there
is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually
requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized
is -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the
outset before any discovery because of the nature of the
suit.
So for those two reasons, we thought that the --
that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was
either not presented because of the substantive due
process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the
Totten act.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would make a lot
of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is -- is a
dismissal on the merits, just saying there's -- there's no
contractual claim. I -- I mean, if you didn't believe
that, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we
have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we
could resolve all of the questions.
But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is
based mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said
the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be
reaching the contract issue. We should simply say that if
-- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due
process claim here and -- and no claim based on the
regulations.
How do we get the authority to decide the -- the
contract question?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think whatever the status
the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or
(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I
think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach
that issue at the outset. And I think it would be
particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that
when we have a suit that we know on the face of the
complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are
going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to
determine first which court it properly belongs in, when
that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified
information that we know at the outset the suit should not
involve in the first place. And I think there is enough
flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the
Court to reach that threshold question first.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you're saying that if
there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty
to protect under the -- under due process procedures.
MR. CLEMENT: I -- I think that follows, Justice
Kennedy. I think one of the difficulties with the
constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is
it gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal
procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know
there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at
all. And it seems odd that this would develop in a way
where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive
rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance
here that can be brought forward in the courts.
I think in this respect it is also important to
recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's
negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the
broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to
seek assurances not just about compensation but about how
-- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how
they're going to get their compensation. And I think
there's no particular reason to think procedural
assurances should be judicially enforceable when the
substantive assurances are not.
Now, one other point to make about the nature of
these agreements. Not only because of the nature of these
agreements does the agency end up in a position where it
cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial
actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may
have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't
have to give and the like. So there are consequences to
both sides of dealing in this way with these espionage
relationships as effectively outside the law. But again,
it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle
in -- in any recent development that requires this Court
to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests
an -- it reflects an understanding that date backs --
dates back much further.
If I can make one other point, which is I think
even though the Totten decision reflects something more
than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more
fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an
espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to
compromise secret information, it is true that applying
the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear
mechanism that protects confidential information.
And I would analogize it to this Court's
decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive
trust arrangement. The Court adopted that arrangement
where -- where an employee who violated a -- a
prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the
proceeds to the Government. And -- and the Court adopted
that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court
did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there
is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these
agreements. In the same way, having a clear rule of
dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that
there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the
first place. It will simply be dismissed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead. I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I just wanted to ask one. I
don't remember whether the briefs discuss it or not, but
is there a statute that prohibits the disclosure of secret
agents like this and does that -- if so, does that have
any relevance to this case?
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, there is such a
statute. There's a statutory provision that gives the
authority. It had been with the -- with the Director of
Central Intelligence. The recent Intelligence Reform Act
has transferred it to the Director of National
Intelligence. But it gives a requirement that the -- that
-- that the director protect sources and methods. I think
that that -- that statutory provision is consistent with
the general notion behind the Totten doctrine, but I don't
think it's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: And does the statute impose a
penalty on anyone for revealing the name of a secret
agent?
MR. CLEMENT: I don't think it -- it certainly
doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. There are,
under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the
disclosure of classified information, but I think that
the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But is the identity of an
agent a -- a type of classified information protected by
the statute?
MR. CLEMENT: I think it is. It's protected
both by the sources and method provision, and I think
revelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal
prohibitions in the statute as well. And I think that
this statute -- I think you can see the extent to which
this -- this case implicates the core of the secrets that
the agency has. This Court in the Sims case described the
sources and methods protected by the statute as the heart
of the intelligence community.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement --
MR. CLEMENT: And this case involves both.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the -- the argument made by
the other side, which seems to me has some plausibility to
it, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were
not as flexible as they are today. We -- we have
procedures for matters being kept confidential by courts.
We -- we allow hearings that are closed in matters that
never would have been done before. And since, the
argument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to
preserve the secrets, why can't we preserve the secrets
that way? If and when it turns out that the prosecution
of this -- of this suit would require a secret to be
disclosed, we will terminate it or -- but -- but up until
then, why -- why decide in advance? Why not take a --
take a run at it and see?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, there's a
couple of points to be made about that.
One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in
the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the
provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations
have been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and
handling classified information necessarily involve risks
that the information will be disclosed.
In the first place, both Totten and the state
secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that
the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld
from the case. It's an absolute privilege. So the idea
is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to
the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the
case and that's somehow all consistent with the state
secrets privilege. To the contrary. Once a determination
is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further
disclosure of the information. You -- the whole premise
of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate
disclosure to the general public. It's that once
something is privileged, you -- you treat the matter as
privileged and you take it out of the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not making that
statement with respect to anything that's classified.
There was something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and
in which you -- you cite Reynolds and you say the
proper response to classified information in civil
litigation is to disregard the classified information, not
to order partial disclosure to court personnel. Are --
are you saying then in all of civil litigation if
information is classified, then it's just out of the case?
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think there
can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation
where the Government can agree with a party to proceed --
as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the
basis of classified information, but that would involve a
very different way of -- of proceeding than the normal
default rules. And I think absent some kind of agreement
for the Government to proceed in that way, the default
rule in civil litigation has always been that the
privilege is just that. It's -- the matter is -- the
matter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But you lose. I mean,
if -- if that matter is necessary for your case,
don't -- don't you lose?
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia,
not in civil litigation. And that's why the state secrets
privilege is, I mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the
civil side of the case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about civil
only.
MR. CLEMENT: Only civil.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm thinking of gray mail.
Certainly in the criminal -- criminal area, that isn't the
case.
MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You either cough it up or you
lose.
MR. CLEMENT: Right, and a different bargain has
been reached in the criminal context, and in that context
to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult
choice of revealing classified information or proceeding,
the Congress has come through with the Classified
Information Procedures Act. That only applies in the
criminal side, though.
JUSTICE BREYER: I just want to ask one
question. Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably
to them that this has nothing to do with a contract,
totally nothing? Okay? But there happen to be some rules
over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which
we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign
person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him
something. We have some procedures. Now, we don't have
to do that as a matter of contract. We don't have to do
it at all, but we do it. And so there's a claim here that
we want to see that they're following their own rules.
They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is
about contracts. Our claim isn't about contracts.
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I have two
responses to that. The first is I think the -- that the
Totten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow
confines of the contract.
JUSTICE BREYER: But it doesn't extend to torts,
does it?
MR. CLEMENT: I would -- I mean, I would need a
specific hypothetical. I can't imagine a tort that by its
nature --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you go --
MR. CLEMENT: -- depends on the relationship.
JUSTICE BREYER: You go ahead. You go ahead.
MR. CLEMENT: I can't imagine a tort that
depends on its very nature on the relationship.
But we're talking about regulations that, as I
understand the other side's allegations, are regulations
for handling secret contracts. So unless one can allege
that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a
secret relationship, there's no point in that individual
even being in a position -- they wouldn't even have
standing to challenge the regulation.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you're saying if in
fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about
regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a
contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it
has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a
way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example,
or someone like that. It has nothing to do with it, you
see. Then could they -- what would be the rules then?
MR. CLEMENT: I still think the answer would be
that there would be no relief under that circumstance
because their -- their -- still their claim to having any
entitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you
know, total strangers don't have rights under those
regulations. Alleged spies would have rights under those
regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and
asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent
with the entire relationship and the contract that gave
rise to it.
I would also point you to the Weinberger
decision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because
there this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to
produce an environmental impact statement even though
there were regulations on the book -- and the concurring
Justices focused on those regulations -- where the
Department of Defense said we do produce an environmental
impact statement even if it's classified. So I think on
the authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that
there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire
subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to
judicially enforceable rights.
If there are no further questions, I'd like to
reserve the time for rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Burman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BURMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BURMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please
the Court:
First, with respect to the question about the
due process rights below, I would note that the Government
does not challenge, and specifically said so in footnote 2
of the petition for cert and footnote 1 in their brief on
the merits, whether there is a due process claim here. I
would encourage you -- and I will come back to the due
process question if you're interested.
I'd encourage you to look at the respondents'
appendix, pages 72 to 74, where the CIA employee described
the fact that there are, in fact, regulations that are not
limited to enforcing a secret contract. That is not our
claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But they are regulations that
the -- that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal
relationship --
MR. BURMAN: Actually we don't believe that's
correct, Your Honor. We believe that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you claiming that
your -- your people are -- were not spies?
MR. BURMAN: We allege that they were coerced
into that relationship, but we do --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, however got there --
MR. BURMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- they -- they -- your claim
is that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your
procedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due
process rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon
the assumption of a spy-principal relationship.
MR. BURMAN: We do not agree with that, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?
MR. BURMAN: We believe that PL-110 allowed the
admission of people essential to the United States without
any comment on whether they had formerly been spies and
that these regulations do not require us to prove as an
essential element even to the CIA, much less to the
district court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You --
MR. BURMAN: -- that they were spies for the
CIA.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you don't have to prove that
they were spies, but you have to prove that -- that they
had a contractual relationship with the United States.
And the only contractual relationship you're asserting is
the relationship of a spy.
MR. BURMAN: We disagree with that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh --
MR. BURMAN: We do not believe -- and in fact,
the Ninth Circuit went out of its way to make very clear
to the district court that if we try to plead around and
base a claim on a contract, the district court should
dismiss that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, wait. What -- what is the
basis on which you assert these regulations are applicable
to you --
MR. BURMAN: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to your client?
MR. BURMAN: -- we say that the -- we believe we
can show, once we are allowed to proceed -- and it's
premature at this time to decide whether we'll be
successful in this or not. We believe we can show that
the CIA has internal regulations that say as to PL-110
resettlees, we will provide continued financial and
security support in these circumstances, a need-based
standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the agency comes in
and says, prove that you're a PL-110 resettlee.
MR. BURMAN: The agency --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and what is your
response to that?
MR. BURMAN: The agency has never --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Your response is I was
resettled because I was a spy.
MR. BURMAN: No. We don't have to say that. We
can say we were resettled under PL-110, which they have to
inform at the time the INS Commissioner that they were
bringing in people as PL-110 resettlees. They're not
required to tell the INS Commissioner that they were
spies, just that they're essential.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What if -- what if the
Government takes a slightly different tack and -- and you
bring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the
Government says, the only relationship upon which this
claim can be based by these particular Does is a spy
relationship? We claim privilege, and on the basis of
that privilege, we -- we claim dismissal. What is your
response to that?
MR. BURMAN: If that were an essential element
of our claim, which we believe it is not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they're not saying it's
an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make
a 110 claim. They're saying that the only basis upon
which you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship.
You have no other. How do you respond to that?
MR. BURMAN: Hence the reason we brought the
case as Does. A procedure that was not known for that
purpose at the time of Totten, that their own information
officer and their brief and their position in Webster
admits preserves the identity, preserves the secret. They
acknowledge --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But, look, you're talking about
procedural means. I want to know what your immediate
response to their claim of privilege is. Are you going to
say we weren't spies?
MR. BURMAN: The advantage of the Reynolds
procedure is if they had made the claim of privilege, we
would know what they were claiming was privileged.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They are making the claim of
privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110
claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your
clients were spies. Do you respond by saying, yes, we
were spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?
MR. BURMAN: We respond by saying we have an
entitlement to a fair process within the agency, a
confidential process --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that you have a
really obnoxious court --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that wants a substantive
response, do you respond by saying they're right, we're
spies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?
MR. BURMAN: If their position is that they
can't confirm or deny to the district court whether we
were spies --
JUSTICE SOUTER: They are claiming a privilege
on the grounds that the only basis for your claim can
possibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to
them. In order to defeat that privilege, you've got at
least to start by saying, no, we weren't spies and we
don't claim to be. Are you going to say that or aren't
you?
MR. BURMAN: We are not going to say we were not
spies. We are going to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I don't know why you're
not out of court on Totten.
MR. BURMAN: Because we are not claiming the
benefit of a bargain to be a spy. We are not seeking
compensation --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is a PL --
JUSTICE SOUTER: You are -- you are --
JUSTICE BREYER: What is a PL-110 settlee?
MR. BURMAN: A PL-110 resettlee allowed the CIA
and the FBI to bring in up to 100 people per year that
were deemed essential to the U.S. They could have been
simply very important scientists who wished to defect.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you would say this --
MR. BURMAN: They could have been any --
JUSTICE BREYER: Are -- are you claiming that
your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume
for purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether
it's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not
spies --
MR. BURMAN: We believe --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- because we win even if we're
not spies because we are essential persons?
MR. BURMAN: If we had made the Totten mistake
of suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we
have sued as Does and we have said we are satisfied with
the CIA concluding internally whether we are entitled to
PL-110 status.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but my guess is --
well, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me -- that
the only basis on which you could say you were an
essential person is that you're a spy.
MR. BURMAN: We don't --
JUSTICE BREYER: He's -- he's not a scientist.
He's not a --
MR. BURMAN: Since they have not contested our
PL-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the
reply brief, we have never had to face this question
because there has been no question that we are PL-110
resettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our
identity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike
Totten, there is no state secret that is -- is at risk.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if the question comes up,
you're going to have to disclose the identity. I mean, if
-- if it is controverted whether indeed you're -- you're a
spy or not, then what do you do? Do you say, well, we'll
-- we'll do it in camera? That's right? I mean, you --
you think that -- that a United States district court has
all of these security facilities available as Langley? I
mean --
MR. BURMAN: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- trust me, it doesn't.
MR. BURMAN: We do not believe that we have to
have -- that we have to disclose anything to the district
court to have standing as Does to seek a fair procedure
within the CIA. At the time of Totten, the idea of having
a Doe being able to sue was not recognized for a plaintiff
who wanted to protect his identity. We have that now as
of the last --
JUSTICE BREYER: Do we have to change Totten?
Because, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're
suing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you
win. If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win
because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on PL-
0, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on
due process, you win because you're a spy. So no matter
what, you can't win unless you're a spy.
Now, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it --
that sounds to me as if you're there. And do we have to
overturn Totten for you to win?
MR. BURMAN: I do not believe so, but you should
not expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks.
And it does not counsel for you to expand Totten when they
cannot define a clear line as to where this
jurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon
here -- they cannot explain to you why in Webster -- they
argued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the
same interpretation of Totten that they are arguing now.
They specifically said that it should not be up to the
courts to look behind the scene of the privilege in
Reynolds, and yet the Court rejected that position.
In Hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret
proceeding with due process and the courts cannot review
whether we've made that available, and the Court rejected
that.
Things have changed since the time of Totten.
That does not require overruling Totten, but it certainly
does not counsel expanding Totten in the dramatic way that
the executive asserts, a way that basically says to the
Court you have absolutely no role in determining whether
our assertion that the state secret is an essential
element here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a
state secret.
We -- if there's anything we ought to be able to
decide it's what our case is about. We may have loosely
used bargain in the complaint, but the district court and
the Ninth Circuit have now made it very clear that we
cannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due
process, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a
contract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim. The
Ninth Circuit has decided all of that against us.
What we still have, though, is a claim to a
fair, internal agency procedure.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Attached to what? I mean,
you can -- a fair procedure leading nowhere is not a
claim. You have a right to a fair procedure because it's
attached to some substantive right.
MR. BURMAN: That's what we haven't yet had the
opportunity to prove as to what it is in these
regulations. But if you would look at -- again, at the
respondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that
they voluntarily made available, did not make any
assertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that
this was confidential asked, are there agency regulations
that you know of that relate to the resettlement of these
PL-110 people who are resettlees from foreign countries?
Yes. Are there regulations that deal with the
determination of the level and extent of benefits to be
given resettlees? Yes. And are there agency regulations
that deal with grievances by resettlees? Yes.
We think no minimal due process allows them to
tell us the wrong standard and not to give us notice and
an opportunity to be heard in a confidential proceeding --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You still have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what's your best case for
that? What's your best case for that proposition?
MR. BURMAN: Well, certainly Matthews v.
Eldridge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it sounds to me like
due process in -- in the air.
MR. BURMAN: We don't believe it is, Your Honor.
We -- we don't know for sure until we are entitled to
litigate the regulation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. We know enough at the
summary judgment stage for us to -- to decide whether the
case can go forward or the dismissal stage.
MR. BURMAN: Well, there has been no summary
judgment --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or dismissal stage.
MR. BURMAN: At -- at the dismissal stage, our
pleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that
the pleadings sufficiently assert that there are
regulations there that create a -- a property interest and
that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That create a property right?
MR. BURMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the property right is the
contract with the United States. I mean, you can't get
away from the contract by calling it a property right.
MR. BURMAN: We do not believe there is a
contract and we do not believe we have to rely on it. We
were -- the Does were coerced into what they did. They do
not seek compensation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: What is your strongest case?
I don't think Matthews addresses it. What is your
strongest case for the notion that you have a property
interest even though you don't have a contract?
MR. BURMAN: Probably Perry v. Sindermann in the
sense that there was clear that the contract was over but
the Court indicated that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was the firing of a
school teacher. There was --
MR. BURMAN: It was a nonrenewal.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there was -- there was an
interest in having your job, contract property, and
interest in getting back salary, contract property. Not
this case.
MR. BURMAN: The -- what the Court actually, I
believe, focused on there and in Goldberg v. Kelly was the
question of whether there were regulations --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare
benefits, money.
MR. BURMAN: We believe this is in a sense the
equivalent of a welfare benefit.
JUSTICE BREYER: Perry v. Sindermann. Is that
-- that's the nontenured teacher?
MR. BURMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: There's no property right
there, I don't think. I've always taught that as a ground
that it wasn't compared to Roth where there was. All
right. So -- so -- but there was a First Amendment
interest of some kind.
MR. BURMAN: And I believe the Court indicated
that it would be possible if there were practices and
policies that had been established that set substantive
standards for continuing that there would be a property
right in a fair procedure for determining that internally
at the school.
JUSTICE BREYER: You're probably right if they
have -- I see what you're saying.
MR. BURMAN: We also believe there is a liberty
interest. These people came to the U.S. in danger. The
mere fact of labeling them essential to the United States
and bringing them in in the PL-110 status, taking away
their identity, giving them a false identity, false
references, changing their occupations, all of those
things we believe -- we have an argument -- created a
liberty interest in continuation of the protection. It's
the special relationship, the Dushane-type argument that
the -- that the Ninth Circuit relied on.
But I would hasten to add it is premature to
determine whether we win on the merits, and the Government
is absolutely wrong in their brief in suggesting that
unless we can prove at this point that we can win on the
merits, that we don't have standing. We have standing to
make a claim for fair procedures. Those procedures may
include confirming internally to the CIA our identity and
they may include confirming whether we satisfy whatever
the need-based standard is that the CIA has identified.
We have made every possible effort to comply
with the covenant that Totten imposed in a contract, a
contract that we don't believe we have. We sued as Does.
We have sought preapproval of every single filing. We had
-- counsel that learned any confidential information were
precleared by the agency. That is not what happened in
Totten. Those are procedures, as Justice Scalia has
suggested, that did not -- were not recognized at the time
of Totten just like the due process claim was not
recognized at the time of Totten. And it is a claim that
can be done internally to the CIA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that Totten would be
decided differently today because of the -- our due
process jurisprudence?
MR. BURMAN: We believe that Totten didn't know
to make a claim other than contract.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- that's not my question.
MR. BURMAN: Yes, we do.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose Mr. Totten is here
today.
MR. BURMAN: And if there were regulations in
the Totten situation that created some sort of meaningful
standard that would be applied by an internal procedure,
which the record shows here the CIA has an internal
procedure, not just regulations setting out the standard,
but a review process. We simply want to have a fair,
internal procedure.
This case really is not about the protection of
state secrets, but the limits of the executive authority
to unilaterally assert without any review by the court --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How would the court -- a
court go about monitoring this fair procedure --
MR. BURMAN: We -- we don't believe the court
would have a role in monitoring the fair procedure. It
would simply determine whether the procedure that the CIA
has described in the court record already satisfied
minimum standards of -- of due process. If the court
found that it did not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then you -- you said that
-- suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you
wanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave
us. They said that in their regulations, but they gave us
something much less.
MR. BURMAN: It's possible that the CIA would
assert that there is some reason that it gave less than
its regulations that would be a state secret. It's hard
for us to imagine what that would be, but in fact that is
open on remand for the -- for the CIA to argue that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do these regulations just set
forth a procedure or do they set forth some substantive
entitlement?
MR. BURMAN: They seem to do both. They -- we
haven't, of course, seen them in full yet, but they set
forth a procedure and then they also say that there is
some sort of need, age, indigency, and health-based
standard for continuing the support. And if you'll
notice --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then it will be worse for them.
I mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the
names of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our
procedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the
United States. It will take someone who reads those about
minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies.
That will be a terrible disaster.
MR. BURMAN: If that was an external process,
but we agree it should be internal to the CIA, that the
process for applying that standard must remain internal to
the CIA. The Does share the interest in protecting their
identity and the identities of others like them.
We -- we believe that the Government --
JUSTICE BREYER: What's your answer? What is
your response?
MR. BURMAN: That there's no external -- there
-- there will be no public knowledge of that information,
that they can explain their -- they can apply their
process internally, apply the need-based process
internally, and that will not be litigated in the courts
if they assert executive -- or state secret privilege as
to that, and we assume that they would at that point. But
we -- we agree --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the court would say you
don't have a cause of action unless it knows what -- what
these regulations say. Surely the regulations have to be
disclosed to the court at least.
MR. BURMAN: We -- we believe that's the case
and they have not yet said that it would hinder the state
secrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed
quite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding
back only a need-to-know basis. They have not asserted
any state secret privilege with the remaining regulations.
And we know, in fact, from the letter that is in
the record from -- between the CIA and the Justice
Department in which the -- there was basically an
understanding that there would be regulations like this in
order to make sure that these PL-110 resettlees did not
effectively become wards otherwise on -- on the Government
and that the CIA would continue some responsibility for
them.
The -- we are not aware of any case in which
this Court has suggested that there is an obligation of
the district court to look behind the use of Doe and
determine in a public manner the identity of the person.
That -- the Government seems to assume that they have some
entitlement to have a self-inflicted harm that they would
demand that the identity of the Does be disclosed publicly
and that they're entitled to do that. We do not believe
that that's a required part of the use of Does.
And in any event, we think it is somewhat
similar to the criminal context where, if the Government
is going to insist on moving forward in some way that is
an affirmative defense like that, they may well have a
responsibility for not being able to defend their position
if they, at the same time, say that the state secret
privilege applies. But at this point, anyway, that has
not been presented to the district court.
We -- we find it strange that the Government so
quickly now says, unlike what it argued in Webster, that
there is this type of contract which is not subject to the
jurisdictional bar, and that is a contract with their own
employees when they tell us that those same employees are
going to know a much broader swath, as Mr. Clement said,
of secrets. If their rationale made sense as something
that was so compelling that the Court should create a
jurisdictional bar for what the courts would otherwise
have the capacity and the competence to do, you would
think it would apply in that situation as well.
But the fact is they lost Webster, and so they
have to try to say that there is something still very
broad about Totten but explain away Webster, and they
simply cannot convincingly do that. Webster was the same
argument by them. Reynolds was the same argument by them,
and they lost.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you what is
probably a stupid question? Why isn't the contract barred
by the statute of frauds?
MR. BURMAN: Well, we haven't thought about that
because we haven't proceeded on -- on the contract. There
may well -- we -- it probably is.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. BURMAN: And there -- we -- we -- but we do
not proceed on the contract.
The Does, in fact, do not underestimate the
risks of disclosure of their identities and of their
relationship with the CIA. Perhaps they put too much into
the complaint describing at some length what they did, but
the reason for that, I suggest, is understandable. It was
subject to preapproval by the agency. Why not put the
equities in there even though they're not essential
elements of your claim and see if the agency approves
them? The agency approved them. We should not be thrown
out of court because we put into the complaint allegations
which the agency admits using the Doe, do not threaten any
secrets, and which are not part of the essential elements
of our claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are all of these what you call
0 resettlees -- are they all CIA resettlees?
MR. BURMAN: It does not appear that they are.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them State Department
and --
MR. BURMAN: At -- at least -- my understanding
is at least the FBI and perhaps the Commissioner of INS at
the time for -- perhaps at the request of other agencies.
It appears that all three agencies had the ability to
create this exception to the normal immigration procedure.
If the Does can show on remand that the CIA's
regulations are as they allege and that PL-110 status
generally, which is what the CIA witness McNair basically
said, that many PL-110 resettlees are in continued danger
because of the nature of which we brought them in,
regardless of what they did before we decided to bring
them in, or if they can show that in their particular
situation there is a -- a special relationship of danger
created, we believe we would have a substantive due
process argument and a procedural due process argument.
That is not today's question.
The Government has agreed that for purposes of
today's question, it should be assumed that we can make
out a due process claim. That claim is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not quite sure where the
Government has said that. You talk about footnote 2. All
it said was that they're not appealing the point that you
have to go to the Court of Claims.
MR. BURMAN: And also in footnote 1 in the -- in
their brief on the merits to this Court. I think it's on
page 7. My reading of that is that they are not
challenging the due process analysis, and it would be
premature to challenge the due process analysis at this
time, which is what the Court said in Webster. We believe
that our due process argument is stronger than the due
process argument that was made in Webster, but the Court
in any event said that's not what is -- what is before us
at this time. And -- and we believe that that's the same
situation now.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just wondering what --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Do you agree your
due process argument does depend on having either a
property interest or a liberty interest?
MR. BURMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just wondering what's, you
know, some foreign -- I don't know who -- who the Does
spied on, but let's assume -- you say they're in danger.
Somebody may be interested in -- in the subject. What
kind of security provisions do you have in your law office
that would -- that would make them immune from the kind of
intrusion that foreign espionage services --
MR. BURMAN: In -- in general, we have not been
allowed to take information outside of the agency. Even
when we're in the clear --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the
agency. Just about the name of your clients. I think
it's -- there are countries interested in -- in, you know,
who was spying on them.
MR. BURMAN: That was their decision to trust us
with that, and ironically under the Government's theory of
this case, the Does --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it may lead -- it may
lead to other agents and -- and one of the problems about
allowing suits like this is that this information about
who the agents are will be brought to a lawyer, kept in
his law office, and much more readily accessible to -- to
foreign powers than -- than it would be at Langley.
MR. BURMAN: And under the agency's theory of
this case, there is nothing that stops the Does from
making their identities public because there is no
enforceable contract that the agency can enforce. The
agency wants to keep Snepp. It wants to live with
Webster, and the only thing it has left is to somehow
carve out a rule that applies to these people who have
done everything they possibly could, including not telling
me who they are.
Our files within our office do not identify them
in writing, is my understanding, by name. I certainly am
not aware of who they are. I know what's alleged in the
complaint and nothing more than that.
But certainly the risk of gray mail, the risk of
the Does -- people in the Does' position disclosing
something is totally irrelevant to the question of whether
Totten creates some sort of bar that applies not just to a
contract claim but to a claim where there is no contract,
where it is not alleged that it is based upon a contract,
and where the parties have done everything possible -- the
Does, the plaintiffs, have done everything possible to
honor the confidences that the Government wants to keep.
Thank you, Your Honors.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Burman.
Mr. Clement, you have about 4 and a half minutes
if you need them.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, just a few
points. And may it please the Court, just a few points in
rebuttal.
First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's
question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process
argument. If you look at those footnotes, the only thing
that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked
about earlier.
Second of all, I think in thinking about this
PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think
Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim
to the CIA. And as I understand their argument, it
depends on their being a significant difference between
coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and
I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I
am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against
the CIA, please hear my claim. I would say there's no
material difference in terms of all of the policies that
undergird the Totten doctrine between those two. And I
would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a
and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents
would have to establish a relationship with the agency.
The final two points I would make is, first of
all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that
they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case. I
would make two points about that.
First of all, presumably the reason that William
Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it
was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't
have a concern about retaliation.
(Laughter.)
MR. CLEMENT: I would also say that the
difference between suing under Doe and suing under your
name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation
start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this
litigation turns on a secret. They don't want their name
revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that
just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as
in Totten.
The last point I would make is they asked you to
take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the
litigation, and I would ask you to look at those
pleadings. The complaint is replete with references to
the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites
Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times. I
would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred,
then no claim is.
With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the
