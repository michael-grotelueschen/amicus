CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare
v. Symczyk.
Mr. Mann.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The decision of the court of appeals
deprives the Defendant of the ability to free itself
from litigation, even when it is willing to pay complete
relief to the sole Plaintiff; thus, as long as the
Plaintiff refuses to accept full and complete payment, a
putative collective action must continue onward to
certification.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that offer include
admission of liability?
Or was it just that it was going to pay the
amount of damages requested?
MR. MANN: That's a good question,
Justice Ginsburg. Because it was an offer of judgment,
if the offer had been accepted, the result would have
been a judgment by the Federal court imposing liability
under the statute, under the Fair Labor Standards Act,
on the Defendant, and requiring the Defendant to pay
full and complete relief, including costs and attorneys'
fees, to the Plaintiffs. So there would have been a
judgment of the Federal court imposing liability under
the statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if there were
judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for
all other people similarly situated?
MR. MANN: Well, I think there is rules of
issuing claim conclusion that would flow from the
judgment, and it would have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- so the next
case is another employee who claims uncompensated work
time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated
people. Then that next case, the employer would be --
would be subject to summary judgment because the
liability has been established.
MR. MANN: Well, there would be a variety of
fact questions that would have to be resolved to
determine the extent of the preclusion from the first
judgment. But the rules of issue and claim preclusion
would apply. And to the extent those rules call for
matters that were comprehended within the judgment to
bind, in a later case, they would.
I think the way that I would put it, looking
back to Justice Kagan's opinion in the Smith v. Bayer
case, it's common for there to be a preclusive effect of
a judgment in one case against people that are not
parties. And this would have been a judgment imposing
liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, based on
the allegations made in the complaint. And that's
what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, so what am I to
make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer
itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear
that the offer of judgment, quote, "was not to be
construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in
this action or that Respondent has suffered any damage"?
What -- what are we to make of that --
MR. MANN: Well, let me --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when you're now
claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of
liability?
MR. MANN: Well, I don't think that you have
to rely on my statements here, to say that we would have
accepted judgment of liability at that time. The -- the
offer itself has a formal offer of judgment on a form
promulgated by the trial court.
The offer itself is not an admission of
liability. The offer itself is not a judgment against
the Defendant. The offer is a statement that, under the
ordinary rules for Rule 68, if -- if they accept the
offer, there would be a judgment against our client.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did you pick the
$7,500?
MR. MANN: That's detailed later in the
Joint Appendix, at pages 77 to 79. But, essentially,
what our client did is they took the amount of time for
breaks during the Respondent's period of employment and
offered her full wages for all of the break time, so
that whatever amount of break time was appropriately
charged for her --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see in the -- in the
FLSA, that it also requires an amount for liquidated
damages. Did you include that amount as well?
MR. MANN: Yes, Your Honor -- yes, Justice
Sotomayor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if the
district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the
suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge
says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also
want to address the certification issue, the mootness
argument is scheduled for three months down the road,
the certification issue for two months down the road;
isn't this just a question of what order the district
court wants to address these two issues?
MR. MANN: Okay. So there is two things I
want to say about that. The first one is to talk about
what happened in this particular case, which is the case
that's before the Court; and, the second is to discuss
the practical consequences of what could have happened
in some other case.
So what happened in this case is that it was
uncontested that the offer provided complete relief.
And so the Respondent suffered a judgment to be entered
against her because of the conceded acts of the offer.
And at the time that judgment was entered, nothing had
been done about certification. At the time the offer
was entered -- had made -- nothing had been done about
certification.
So what we --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not possible
for anything to be done about the certification because
you moved immediately. The complaint is filed, and then
you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment
that you did.
MR. MANN: Well, I think there is two
questions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in
both what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what
you're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg.
One is the question that was presented in
the petition, which is: What is the effect on a
collective action if, before certification or any motion
for collective process has been determined, the sole
plaintiff loses the case.
The second one is: How do you deal with the
housekeeping issues of terminating the interest of a
plaintiff when there's no longer controversy between the
plaintiff and the defendant?
And so --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it seems as though
it's more than a housekeeping issue that's involved here
because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument
about what happens when the plaintiff's individual
claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff
continues to want to represent other individuals.
But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims
had not been fully satisfied. She walked away with
nothing. She walked away with no judgment, and she
walked away with no $7,500. And the question is: How
can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot?
MR. MANN: Okay. So I think there is two --
again, there's two things to say. One is: We view it
as a housekeeping question because it seems to us clear
that, if the defendant no longer wishes to contest
liability and formally offers to pay all of the relief
that the person could possibly win in any formal
litigation, it has to be the case that the individual's
interest is moot.
Now, it might be that the appropriate
response is, as is consistent with the Third Circuit, is
that the district court should just dismiss the case
because, if the person won't take yes for an answer, the
Federal court doesn't need anything further --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing in
Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule
that provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff
continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then
the plaintiff has to pay the costs. Rule 68 doesn't say
anything about dismissing suits.
MR. MANN: Well, I don't think our position
depends on Rule 68 at all for the mootness. Our
position for the mootness is that, if there's no further
controversy about the relief that is created by the
cause of action, there's nothing more for the trial
court to do --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you
this --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you just this
question -- just tell me as a matter of common practice,
do district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs
routinely when a full offer of settlement has been made
and the defendant just is silent? I mean, does this
happen?
I just can't remember seeing a -- but
this --
MR. MANN: There's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may -- it may be that
it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't
reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court,
the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to
enter judgment.
MR. MANN: I think -- I think that the
courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to
what I'm characterizing as a housekeeping question of,
if there's no further controversy between the plaintiff
and the defendant, how do we move the case off our
docket? One approach, which is followed by some of the
courts of appeals, is that you enter a judgment against
the plaintiff, whether they like it or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a matter of
housekeeping, you could --
MR. MANN: In favor of the plaintiff -- you
enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- that needs
to be clear -- in favor of the plaintiff --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.
MR. MANN: Whether they want a judgment or
not, you say, here's everything you asked for; you must
take it.
Another approach is to say, if they're
willing to give you everything to which you're entitled
and you won't take it, then there's no reason why we
should continue to adjudicate your case because there's
not really a controversy. Our --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what -- here is
what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it
said, "What makes a case moot?" It says, "A case
becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant
any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party."
Now, here, the judge says, okay, is this
case moot? Well, it's not moot because I could give --
at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500,
but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has
her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the
collective side of this action. I mean, she hasn't been
satisfied.
MR. MANN: Okay. So let -- let me respond
to that. I think Knox flows naturally from Friends of
the Earth, and I think they're both saying exactly the
same thing. And the -- the -- what's going on in those
cases -- and I suppose in the Nike case from last
month -- is this general problem of a defendant is faced
with a piece of litigation, and they no longer wish to
contest it.
If the action seeks prospective relief, it's
quite difficult, once the case has begun, for the
defendant to convince the court that they are going to
change their conduct in a way that moots the claim for
prospective relief. And this Court's had a series of
cases and has often not been convinced of that.
In a case that only seeks retrospective
relief, it's somewhat easier to convince the court of
that. One way would be to formally offer to pay
everything the person could get.
What happened in this case and what's before
the Court is simply if that happens. So what happened
here is there was an offer that was conceded to be
adequate, and the plaintiff suffered a judgment to be
entered against her on the premise that she had no
further claim.
And the question is, if that interest is
gone, which has been conceded at all stages of the
litigation, until the bottom side briefing on the merits
in this Court, what's the consequences for the
collective action?
And so what the parties have litigated
about -- because this was conceded repeatedly over the
course of several years, is what happens when that
interest is moot.
Now, we believe that it is correct that a
defendant, faced with litigation that it does not wish
to contest, can terminate the litigation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do when --
when you have a governing statute that says that an
employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and
other employees similarly situated? Can you use a mere
rule, Rule 68, to cut out what the statute authors --
authorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief
on behalf of himself and others similarly situated?
Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory
provision to work, which you didn't. By filing
immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of
inviting opt-ins to occur.
MR. MANN: I think that the language of the
statute, Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
provides compelling guidance for the case that the court
of appeals ignored.
In this case, because it's under the Fair
Labor Standards Act, the very paragraph you're looking
at, Congress has opined -- and I'll say it's only an
opinion because the lower courts ignored it. But
Congress at least has opined as to how you tell when
people that are not yet before the court can be treated
as relevant.
And the answer is the non-party plaintiffs
cannot be part of the case until they formally opt-in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to give
the plaintiff an opportunity. That --
MR. MANN: The -- the statute does not say,
if a plaintiff files a case and alleges that other
people are similarly situated, the case shall not be
dismissed until the court has proceeded to conclusively
determine the propriety of certification. It doesn't
say that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose the
plaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the
complaint, moved to have it first preliminarily
certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so,
instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a
collective complaint, separate from a motion for
certification, they came together, that the plaintiff
filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for
certification and a request to discover the names of
other people similarly situated.
MR. MANN: I think the answer to that would
flow directly from this Court's decision in Geraghty.
The first question would be: At the time that the
defendant's interest becomes moot, who is a party to the
case? And the answer would be: Well, there's just this
one person.
The next question would be: Has the
district court ruled on certification in a way that
could have erroneously caused the mootness? Well, the
answer would be, no, because it became moot not because
of an erroneous district court ruling on certification,
which was the situation in Geraghty --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer is it
wouldn't make any difference?
MR. MANN: It wouldn't make any difference.
What Geraghty turns on, and -- and I encourage you to
look at the portion of footnote 11 that -- the last two
paragraphs of that footnote that goes over onto page
7, the court emphasizes -- all we're saying here, all
we're saying here is that, if the basis of mootness is
an error by the district court and if we later ascertain
that error, we will not only correct the error about
certification, but we will forgive the mootness that
flowed from that error.
In this court case, there's no suggestion
that the district court error caused mootness to occur.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't
know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but
what -- if the judge can simply order the two
determinations in a way that certification is addressed
before mootness, does that take care of your problem?
Obviously, if you grant certification, there
is an ongoing controversy. And under Roper and
Geraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back
doctrine applies.
MR. MANN: I think that -- that those cases
provide a way to analyze that situation. So one
possibility is that the district judge grants
certification at some moment after the complaint is filed,
and then later in time, the sole person who is in the
case at that time loses their interest in the case for
one reason or another. But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's no
doubt that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There's
no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes
forward, right?
MR. MANN: There is doubt in that case. And
we would suggest that it's clear that it doesn't go
forward.
Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as
opposed to Rule 23, which was at issue in Geraghty, even
after the district judge signs an order saying, pursuant
to Justice Kennedy's opinion in Hoffman, we should send
notices out to see if we can find some new plaintiffs,
if none of those people have yet appeared before the
court and signed into the case, there is still only one
plaintiff.
So in Geraghty, it was important to the
Court that, when the case got here, although the
interest of the named prisoner had been vitiated, there
were several people who had filed motions to intervene.
And so it appeared that, at all times, there were other
people.
In this case, by contrast, there's every
reason to think that, after the person's interest was
vitiated, there were no other plaintiffs because --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask a
fundamental question under Rule 68? I mean, when I was
a district court judge, if parties told me about their
settlement discussions, I would get quite upset. But,
it says explicitly -- explicitly, "Evidence of an
unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a
proceeding to determine costs."
What authorizes you to use evidence of that
offer to argue anything --
MR. MANN: So, again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- especially when a --
the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory
right to refuse it at a specific penalty? What permits
you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness -- I
don't care what you're using it for -- except in cost?
MR. MANN: Okay. So I would say two things.
The first thing is, of course, the plaintiff did not
challenge the use of the offer in the trial court.
The second thing, responsive to your
question on the merits is, trial courts have considered
this question, have generally considered that the offer
is admissible by analogy to Rule 408, which deals with
settlement discussions more generally, and the Advisory
Committee Notes discuss this.
And the general idea is the offer is being
admitted for a purpose other than to prove the validity
or amount of the disputed claim. And so --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This makes no sense to
me because, if the offer is for judgment, it has to be
proof of validity and amount because, at least you
have -- you should be able to get a judgment.
MR. MANN: Well, I think that the offer is
not being admitted to prove the validity of the
plaintiff's claim or the amount of the plaintiff's
claim. The offer is being admitted to prove that the
plaintiff has no --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But didn't you just tell
me that an offer results in an admission of liability
and a judgment for a particular amount?
MR. MANN: If the plaintiff accepts the
offer, then the district judge will enter offer -- will
enter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the
offer.
The district courts that have considered
this have ordinarily concluded that, in cases where the
offer is not accepted and the defendant contends that
the offer is complete, that the offer can be admitted
for the purpose of proving that there is no controversy
between the parties, which is distinct from admitting it
for the purpose of proving the validity or amount of the
claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mann, could -- could I
come back to your response to the question of Knox --
the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court
can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is
no standing. That -- I would have thought your answer
to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it
on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be
exclusive, that that's the only situation in which
there -- there is no standing.
It was addressing just the third prong of
our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that,
where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the
remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of
standing is the court has to be able to provide relief.
But there are other elements to standing as well,
including whether there is injury, in fact, and whether
the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that
is challenged. And those -- those prongs would continue
to exist.
I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to
be all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in
which standing can be eliminated.
MR. MANN: I think that's correct,
Justice Scalia. And so the problem that we face here is
the -- the questioning relates to something that has --
was not disputed below. And our position is a
relatively simple one, which is that, under the doctrine
of mootness, it has to be correct that, if there is not
a controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant
about a cause of action that's authorized by law, then
the case is over.
And that was all conceded below. The
plaintiff suffered a judgment to be entered against her.
She did not challenge that judgment on appeal.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Mann -- excuse me.
JUSTICE ALITO: Does the -- can I ask this
question? Does the district court have the authority
when an offer of judgment is made to hold a hearing as
to whether the offer of judgment actually gives the
plaintiff everything that the plaintiff could possibly
get under the complaint?
MR. MANN: We think that's the appropriate
response. We think that what should happen is that, if
the defendant makes an offer of judgment and -- and
files a motion to dismiss, suggesting that it provides
complete relief, that if the plaintiff doesn't concede
that the case should be dismissed, the district judge
should hold a hearing, as the district judge did here --
JUSTICE ALITO: But where -- where does it
say that in Rule 68?
MR. MANN: The proceeding isn't under
Rule 68.
JUSTICE ALITO: What is it under?
MR. MANN: The proceeding is under
Rule 12(b), as a motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction because the case is moot.
See, we don't think that it matters that the
offer happened to be made under Rule 68. There are
obvious --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- your offer
says, you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under
Rule 68.
MR. MANN: But -- but we don't think that
the mootness of the case flows from Rule 68. The
mootness of the case flows from the fact that there is
not a dispute between the parties about anything a
Federal court can handle.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the
question from Justice Alito was, what happens, does the
court have authority to have a hearing?
MR. MANN: But the court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you said, oh, well,
this is not under Rule 68; but -- but you offered to
allow entry of judgment under Rule 68.
MR. MANN: And the -- and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally, you
never did follow up and say that you wanted an entry of
judgment. You just wanted a dismissal. And that's
another point.
MR. MANN: Well, because -- because the
plaintiff didn't accept the offer.
One course of action is we make an offer
under Rule 68, and the plaintiff says, all right, let's
have a judgment under Rule 68; in which case, there
would be a judgment under Rule 68.
In this case, the plaintiff said, I'm not
interested in Rule 68. And we said, all right. Well,
now what we see is a cause of action under Federal law
Congress has created that specifies certain forms of
relief that are available to the plaintiff. And in this
case, there are damages, some liquidated damages, some
attorneys' fees and costs. There is no injunctive or
declaratory relief.
And we have a defendant that is willing to
give more than you could possibly get if you win.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there attorneys' fees
in that offer? I thought there wasn't in --
MR. MANN: Yes. Yes, there were. The offer
specifically provides for attorneys' fees. And even if
the offer didn't provide for attorneys' fees, they would
be available under Section 216(b) --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But this, I
take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case.
That is, do you have any constitutional objection if
Congress had said, in 216(b), that Joe Smith and other
people similarly situated to Miss Laura Symczyk have a
genuine dispute with the employer, and the way they file
their case is Miss Symczyk's case will be deemed to be
their case as well, though it ceases to be their case,
unless they confirm within 60 days of such-and-such, in
writing, that it is their case.
If Congress passed that statute, there
couldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could
there?
MR. MANN: Well, I think there could be
constitutional objections, depending on the details of
the statute --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Do you see
what I'm driving at?
In other words, if Congress had explicitly
said, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is
the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his
case in such circumstances, if they had said that
explicitly, is there a constitutional objection? If so,
what could it be?
MR. MANN: I think the constitutional issues
that proposals like that might raise would flow from the
decision in Vermont Agency. And the question has to be
whether there is a person before the court --
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, we know at least, since
we are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article
III is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in
1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a
court of equity, I found at least two instances. A
person dies, there is no case with that person, but it
remained in equity on the docket until the other person,
the -- the estate, came in.
A woman could not bring a case if she was
married. She starts as a single person. She gets
married. Lo and behold, the case remains on the docket
until her husband comes in. That's not a happy example,
but nonetheless, it's in point.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I could find nothing
the other way, so I thought of the canon of
interpretation that equity deems to have been done what
ought to have been done -- or something like that.
Others on the Court will know -- but the -- the point
is that there are instances --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Equity is wonderful.
JUSTICE BREYER: What? Yes.
It remained on the docket in the Westminster
courts, even though there was no plaintiff.
So I would ask you again: Is there any
counterexample? Is there any instance from equity or
elsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection,
had they said it, at which point our question is have
they said it?
MR. MANN: I think the problem is, in that
case, there is an identifiable person to substitute. In
this case, it's not substituting somebody for the
plaintiff. It's leaving the Federal --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's Mr. Joe
Smith, if he confirms it in writing.
MR. MANN: The -- the problem in this type
of case would be that the Federal proceeding would be
moving along for a substantial period of time with no
plaintiffs. And the district judge's role would be
simply to assist the plaintiff in trying to find --
plaintiff's counsel in trying to find new plaintiffs.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll bet you equity could
have considered the husband to have been substituted
automatically and could have considered that -- the
estate to have been substituted automatically. That --
that happens when -- when that particular element is --
is eliminated. But there is nothing automatic about
discovering some new plaintiff who -- who is out -- we
don't know who is out there.
MR. MANN: On that note, I'd like to reserve
the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Katyal.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin with the question of
whether a withdrawn Rule 68 offer could moot a case. It
cannot. This Court has said that Article III's case and
controversy requirement demands both a plaintiff with a
concrete injury and a matter where the Court is fully
capable of -- of providing relief.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like to begin
with the question of whether or not you waived that
argument.
MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- did you waive
it or not?
MR. KATYAL: We -- We did not waive -- we
did not waive the -- we did not waive it. We do think
that the brief in opposition should have pointed it out,
absolutely. It was a mistake on our part not to -- not
to bring to the Court's attention the -- the impact of
an unaccepted Rule 68 offer. However, we do think that
this Court can -- can consider that, and the reason for
that is that it is an answer to the question presented.
Indeed, it is literally the question presented.
Here is the question presented as -- as my
friend Mr. Mann wrote it, whether a court -- "whether a
case becomes moot and, thus, beyond the judicial power
of Article III when the lone plaintiff receives an offer
from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's
claims." And we submit that the answer to that question
is no, that the mere receipt of an offer, without more,
cannot possibly moot a case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that was not
the way the case was presented in the body of the
petition, and I would suppose, if that were your
objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we
might have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest.
MR. KATYAL: And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if, in fact, we
thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68
offer was not accepted, we might have thought
differently about whether to grant it.
MR. KATYAL: I -- I completely understand
that, Mr. Chief Justice. I guess I would say, however,
this Court, in Lebron, confronted a similar situation,
in which the matter of whether Amtrak was a State actor,
was not present in the cert papers; indeed, it had been
disavowed, as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court
said.
Nonetheless, the Court considered it and --
and got into the merits of that question. And we think
here, actually, it's an easier case for the Court to get
into than Lebron. Both --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a question for
you, counsel.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you rely on
the question presented. Your reformulated question
doesn't have that feature in it.
MR. KATYAL: It does have the unaccepted
offer feature in the -- in the question, and of course,
this Court's decision in Bray does say that it is the
question presented as the Court -- as the Court granted
it, that controls.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is --
from the beginning, you never accepted the offer.
MR. KATYAL: That's exactly right, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you appear to have
conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would
settle your personal claim.
MR. KATYAL: I don't quite think we conceded
even that. That's a separate matter. That's about what
the terms of the offer were. And our first point to you
is to say this offer wasn't even accepted. Mr. Mann is
waxing nostalgic about an offer that literally has not
given Ms. Symczyk a dime. She is as injured today as
she was the day she filed her complaint.
JUSTICE KAGAN: What do you think the court
should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes
forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire
claim? What should happen?
MR. KATYAL: If -- we think that, just like
the Solicitor General, we think that, in that
circumstance, it is possible for a court to enter a
default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff.
And we think --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Is this under Rule 68? Or
is this under some inherent authority?
MR. KATYAL: I think it could work either
way, so long as the forcing happened within the time
period of Rule 68. I don't think like -- the court can,
like Lazarus, raise this after it has already been
withdrawn. The text of Rule 68 says the offer is now
dead. If they had, I imagine, moved for the court to
enforce that order -- enforce that offer and enter a
default judgment within the 14-day period, then I think
that would have been something that might have been
possible to do.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what benefit
does this -- why are you arguing so much? You -- you
will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your
client who is, according to you, similarly situated to
lots of others.
Why don't you just -- if somebody comes
forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for
$7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and
you can do that as often as you want.
MR. KATYAL: For two reasons, Your Honor.
The first is, of course, that is precisely what didn't
happen here. Ms. Symczyk has zero, not even the
$7500 --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. But
that's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept
the offer. And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on
the record, as presented to us, where she did accept the
offer, if you waive that argument. So -- so assume the
case where the offer is accepted.
MR. KATYAL: And I think it goes back to
what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper because what
he said is it's not then just about the individual
plaintiff. You can't force an offer onto a plaintiff
that doesn't have all -- it doesn't award complete
relief because, if you do so, it undermines the
collective action aspect of the claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it undermines the
collective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the
first place. I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not
terribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she
drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for
these other people. There is also no collective suit
for these other people if she never appeared in the
first place.
I don't -- I don't know that the law demands
that there be a collective suit. If she doesn't bring
suit or if she brings suit and -- and is given
everything she wants, the case is over, unless other
people have come in.
MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, we think that
the Congress has answered that question, at least in
216(b), by providing for both the opportunity to file a
complaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that
are similarly situated. And so I think that, as Justice
Ginsburg said to my -- to my friend, if you adopt their
rule, essentially, you truncate that process and
eliminate the ability of people to opt in, in any given
situation.
And that -- for that reason, it's very
much -- assuming that we get to this question, that it
is very much like Gerstein or Sosna or Roper in that
circumstance --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, I'm a little
troubled that you have given up or argue that the
ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under
Rule 68. There is nothing in that rule that gives the
court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or
even implicitly, because it talks about an entire
procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of
it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the
entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only
after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing.
So I can't see anything but an inherent
power. So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it
has to be under a default judgment because the other
side is saying, I give up.
MR. KATYAL: Exactly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.
MR. KATYAL: That -- that's precisely right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go from there, at
least with me, and that may answer an earlier question
about an inquest on damages because that is a part of
the requirements for a default judgment, so that if
there is a dispute about damages, that can be resolved.
But my point is that liability is admitted.
Now, let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice
Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this
comparable to a shared cost, like what motivated our
decision in class actions, that the settlement of one
existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action.
How is this similar to that?
MR. KATYAL: So we think that the corpus of
cases that this Court has handled in the class action
area, such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we
don't think that they absolutely control this question.
I don't want to say that.
But we think that they set up two principles
that help inform the Court's judgment. The first is
that, when you have circumstances like this, in which a
claim has gone away as moot because the named
representative of the claim has gone away for one reason
or another, there is play in the joints.
Essentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff
who acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting
the class unfold. That's really what then-Justice
Rehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper. And
we think there is a lot of force to that because,
otherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective
action mechanism doesn't even get off the ground.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- you don't
accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 --
216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you
can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly
situated, and implicit in that is that there be some
decent interval for you to find similarly-situated
people?
MR. KATYAL: We absolutely agree with that,
and we think that's precisely the problem. And this
case illustrates it, Justice Ginsburg, because they --
we filed their complaint, and 75 days later, they filed
their preemptive Rule 68 offer. And now, they are
coming before the Court and saying something even more
radical than I think any court has accepted, to my
knowledge, which is even filing a class certification
motion along with the complaint wouldn't be enough.
That is something that would essentially cut
the heart out of the collective action mechanism
altogether.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't -- why didn't
you file the -- the motion for certification, along with
the complaint?
MR. KATYAL: Because the text of Rule -- of
6(b) provides for two different processes, both the
filing of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in
process. I suppose we could have done that. That's
what the Seventh Circuit has said to do in a case called
Damasco, but this Court's decision in Hoffman-LaRoche
says the entire collective action mechanism depends on
notice and discovery to find out who those people are,
to find out and make sure that they are similarly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could -- you
could have done that with the complaint and I don't --
you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to
wait? Why -- why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most
logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a
collective action, and now, we want to start the ball
rolling in getting certification?
MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, that is what we
did. You know, we -- we asked the district court, right
after the Rule 68 offer expired, within 4 days, to say,
please set up a class certification process. And that
process was then interrupted by their subsequent motion,
after the Rule 68 offer had expired, to say, this case
is moot.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter in
terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your
motion to certify, if nobody else is in the case? I
mean, isn't that one of the factors?
I don't know if it's even a sort of
good-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification,
but there is no nobody else there.
MR. KATYAL: That's precisely, Mr. Chief
Justice, why we think the Seventh Circuit rule doesn't
make much sense. To come in and to ask for
certification before you've conducted the discovery and
gotten the names, we think is really not the right way
to go.
Rather, I think this Court's decisions in
Iqbal and Twombly suggest that you've got to have some
good-faith belief before you go and file a motion for
class certification. And I'd be very hesitant for this
Court to -- to recommend a rule to litigants that says
go and file your motion for class certification right
away.
This Court, in McLaughlin, I think,
essentially said that it's not about the timing of when
that motion for certification unfolds. At 500 US page
, the Court said, "The fact the class was not
certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had
become moot does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction.
We recognize in Gerstein that some claims are so
transitory" -- "inherently transitory that the trial
court will not even have enough time to rule on a motion
for class certification."
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're
interpreting -- I think it's true that we're
interpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look
at what document are we interpreting? Is there a
different rule or a different -- what -- what rule?
So I could come back to the statute. And
Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the
system that you suggest. I don't see anything
unconstitutional about it. But isn't it a little hard
to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since
what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it
says what it says in the last two sentences.
How do we read that to foresee the mechanism
that you're talking about?
MR. KATYAL: Right. I take it this is
Mr. Mann's point, that people who aren't yet opted into
a class are not parties, and, therefore, the Court can't
properly consider them. And I think that's the same
exact thing in the class action context, is this
question --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, he says the
difference in the class action context is, in the class
action context, you can consider them there, but there
isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which
says, no one shall be a party unless he signs in
writing.
MR. KATYAL: Your -- Your Honor, I think
nothing turns on their designation as party status or
not; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent
the Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where
we got nothing, somehow, they want to deem it against
us, but if it does and wants to get into the
relation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is
based on the idea that the cases would otherwise go
away, and that you need a bridge plaintiff --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why?
MR. KATYAL: And it's a very important
reason --
JUSTICE BREYER: Because that's -- why?
Why, is my question?
MR. KATYAL: The reason for that goes back
to this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which
it said that, in the kinds of cases we're talking about
here, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in
which relief is going to be imposed against one party
and possibly trench on the separation of powers.
Rather, the worst that happens, if you rule
for us, or if you rule for the plaintiffs in those
cases, is that the case goes back down on remand to find
out whether or not any of those parties can be
identified and come forward. If they do, then you can
reach the merits.
But this is a very different separation of
powers inquiry than the one -- in the case in
controversy inquiry than the one that the Court
traditionally handles.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's hard for me to
accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes
when -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if
parties come in beyond the statute of limitations
period, they're not in. Their -- their entry is not
deemed to relate back to the filing of the original
complaint, is it?
MR. KATYAL: It -- for purposes of the
statute of limitations, exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA: For purposes of the statute
of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the
statute and a different one for what we're discussing
here.
MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And we think,
actually --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know you do.
MR. KATYAL: And -- and, Justice Scalia, we
think that that statute of limitations argument cuts the
other way.
So the statute of limitations provision,
which is Section 255, says that, "in determining when an
act is commenced for purposes of the statute," and so we
don't think it bears on the question or not of whether
relation back applies.
Much to the contrary, the real worry in the
class action context -- and, indeed, my friend's opening
line is, "These cases are going to linger forever, and
the defendants are going to have no tool."
But in the Fair Labor Standards Act context,
actually, it's the very reverse because every day counts
against the plaintiffs and their counsel. They are
incentivized to bring these cases quickly because the
clock is literally ticking.
And so you don't have, I think, the same
worry that you do in the regular class action context of
one plaintiff, who can essentially save the day for all
of the different -- for all of the different parties.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, if we do get to
the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend
a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about
Gerstein. Those cases were about prospective relief.
You're asking for retrospective relief. Why doesn't
that make a difference?
MR. KATYAL: We think that it is a
difference, but we don't think it's enough to change
this. And it's for the reasons that then-Justice
Rehnquist said in Roper.
Here -- here is what he said -- this is at
445 US 341. "The distinguishing feature here is that
the defendant has made an unaccepted offer. The action
is moot in the Article III sense, only if this Court
adopts a rule an individual seeking to proceed as class
representative is required to accept a tender of only
his individual claims acceptance need not be mandated
under our precedents since the defendant has not been
offered all that has been requested in the complaint
(i.e., relief for the class), and any other rule would
make the questions unreviewable."
And it's the same point. He is talking
there about a retrospective action for damages. The
rule that we are seeking here is no different than what
then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take this case on
the premise that you would have objected if a judgment
had been entered in your favor for the full amount, plus
attorneys' fees?
MR. KATYAL: I think you should. And this
is in response to what Justice Alito had said in the
first part of the argument. It is not as if we didn't
ask for a hearing. Absolutely, we asked for a fairness
hearing at Joint Appendix page 110 in the district court
and then, again, at the Third Circuit.
And what we asked for specifically was
review of the contours of the offer. This is at Joint
Appendix page 110. We said, quote -- excuse me, 111 --
"There has been no review and/or approval by this Court
of defendant's offer of judgment to the plaintiff," and
for that reason, we said, quote, "Dismissal is
inappropriate at this early procedural juncture."
So this case comes to the Court having asked
that particular question about the contours of the
offer. We think that an offer that never gave
Ms. Symczyk anything is one that didn't make her whole,
and for that --
JUSTICE ALITO: If I were to -- I'm sorry.
If I were to think that the individual plaintiff's claim
isn't moot until a judgment is entered into her favor,
but that -- but that -- that issue, was not preserved,
can you give me an analog that I should think about,
with respect to the second question?
MR. KATYAL: Sure.
JUSTICE ALITO: Should I -- yes.
MR. KATYAL: I think that the best way to
think about it is the -- the category of cases from
Geraghty, Gerstein, and Swisher suggest that if the --
if you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you
would then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back
doctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in
this specific area because, otherwise, the 216(b)
collective actions won't work the way Congress intended
them to work.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, should I assume that
this is the same -- the case would then be the same as
if a default judgment had been entered in your favor for
that amount?
MR. KATYAL: I think -- well, it's hard to
know how you'd hold that offer against us, in that --
and the way in which you did so, I think, informs that
second question. And that's part of the reason why we
think it is a predicate question.
I suppose that, yes, you could say -- one
path available is to say it is a default judgment now
that is imposed on us, along the lines of the Second
Circuit decision; and, if so, then, as the Solicitor
General says, at pages 15 to 18, the then-appropriate
course would have been for the district court to
evaluate whether other people could opt into the class
using the procedures of Hoffman-LaRoche.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you could get the step
-- the Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually
met your personal damages claim, too.
MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely, Justice
Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what you're
saying --
MR. KATYAL: We were proceeding on the
hypothetical.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in those pages is the
Court didn't even do that.
MR. KATYAL: Exactly. I was proceeding on
the hypothetical that -- that, for one reason or
another, the Court can't reach that question.
And we think Lebron absolutely permits this
Court to do so. And we think it's prudent for this
Court to reach that question first because you can
sidestep and avoid what is, undoubtedly, a very
difficult constitutional question about exceptions to
Article III mootness and the relation-back doctrine.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
We'll hear from Mr. Yang now.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Respondent has never been compensated for
her individual damage claim, nor has she received a
court judgment favorably adjudicating that claim. It
follows that her individual claim remains live, as does
this collective action.
More generally, a settlement offer does not
moot a claim, if it is not accepted. Individual freedom
of contract is basic to our legal system, and mutual
assent is always a necessary element for any settlement.
Rule 68 embodies those principles.
JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from
an employee who says that he is annoyed for a variety of
reasons at the employer, and he sues the employer for
his pay -- for his pay for the month of October. The
employer says, He got his pay, I -- I sent him the
check, I mean, he gets it every month. And he says,
yes, but I didn't cash the check.
Is there a case for controversy? He can go
sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?
MR. YANG: Well, if you're -- you're -- I'm
not sure what the injury would be in that case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it any
different when the -- the defendant -- employer says,
here's the check.
MR. YANG: Well, there's a difference --
JUSTICE BREYER: And he says, oh, I didn't
cash it.
MR. YANG: This -- this I think speaks
somewhat to Justice Scalia's point earlier on, which is
there -- there are three elements to Article III
standing, and it also carries through a bit to mootness.
One is an injury in fact. When we are
talking about retrospective claims, there is a past
injury. If you get a payment or court redress, it
doesn't eliminate the injury. The injury continues to
exist. Redressability --
JUSTICE BREYER: Now, we have a case if the
employer, for some reason -- a mistake in bookkeeping or
something -- didn't send the check on time, so it
arrived 3 days late. And he says, ha, I'm not cashing
the check; now, I can sue him. Right? That's your
theory.
MR. YANG: Well, if there is a violation of
the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and I'm not sure that
that would be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards
Act --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He -- he -- it's a
contract -- you know. He -- he is paid every month, the
end of the month.
MR. YANG: Well, if there is a breach of a
contract, that is an injury. And it is a past --
JUSTICE BREYER: Even though the -- the
employer gave him the paycheck. He just didn't cash it,
plus the damage is for the 3 days.
MR. YANG: If I can just finish, I think it
is a past injury. It is traceable to the defendant, and
it is redressable because the requested relief would
redress it. There may well be a defense on the merits.
It may well be that there was payment. It could --
there could be accord and satisfaction --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I
understand. You think there is a live case, not if he
doesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was
asking, if it's a day late? You -- you said, well,
there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it --
you know, could be redressed, by telling him what? Pay
him again? Or --
MR. YANG: Well, no. I -- I guess there is
a few questions. If they -- if the defendant had paid
the plaintiff, then you would have what is traditionally
known as -- and it's accepted -- you would have accord
and satisfaction. It is an affirmative defense in
Rule 8(c).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would also
have what's usually known as no injury.
MR. YANG: Well, again, I think it's
important to distinguish between injury and something
that redresses an injury. Redress of an injury, like a
court redress, which is the only question that's
relevant in Article III, whether the requested relief
from the court would redress the injury.
Now --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a court
has to go through the whole process of a trial if the
check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry,
here's -- you know, whatever the interest is on the
check?
MR. YANG: No, certainly not. And this is
what -- what we say is the right approach, although it's
not a question of mootness, if an employer comes in and
throws up their hands in court and says, it's not worth
it, I want to forfeit, I want to just pay the
judgment -- and -- and by the way, this would not have
the issue preclusive effect, notwithstanding my friend's
statement earlier --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could
you directly answer my question about --
MR. YANG: The court can simply enter
judgment. It can simply enter judgment to -- to stop
pointless litigation. That's the normal course, is
that, if there is a past injury, it's redressable, but
the defendant comes in and either says accord and
satisfaction and says that there is no merits claim --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.
MR. YANG: -- or I just give up on the
merits --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or the plaintiff
says no -- no standing.
MR. YANG: Well, no. Again, I -- I don't
think it's a question of standing because there is two
issues going on. Standing has to exist at the beginning
of the suit. It's assessed at the date that the
complaint is filed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and, as we've
said, at every stage of the litigation.
MR. YANG: Right. That's the -- the
mootness inquiry, then. It has to continue to persist
throughout the litigation.
Now, the fact that you have had some redress
of some sort in the form of a private contract, that
doesn't eliminate the past injury, nor does it mean that
the court could not, if the court were to give
additional damages relief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you're due --
if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late,
he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another
dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't
eliminate the past injury?
MR. YANG: It doesn't eliminate the injury.
It might be compensation for the injury. The injury
would -- once a past injury occurs, it's there.
It's unlike a prospective injury, which can be stopped.
When you -- when you seek injunctive relief, you need
have to have an imminent on ongoing injury. If the
defendant stops, that can eliminate the injury, and then
you go into questions of voluntary cessation. But with
respect to past injury, it's quite different.
Now, I think the possibility of courts
wasting their time on this cases is quite small. There
is all kinds of incentives for a plaintiff not to bring
these suits. There is questions of vexatious
litigation. But that's not what we have here. We have,
in the Fair Labor Standards Act, a judgment by Congress
that employees are to have a right in the -- to -- to go
forward in the collective form.
And as Justice Kennedy's opinion for the
Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes, Section 216 imposes
upon district courts a managerial responsibility to join
plaintiffs in an orderly way. And the -- the collective
action ties in with other aspects of the Fair Labor
Standards Act. The action is designed, as
Hoffman-LaRoche says, to serve the important function of
preventing violations.
It also says that the -- the collective
action is to be enforced to the full extent of its
terms. These are judgments that Congress made because
they were trying to protect particularly vulnerable
employees in our society. These are nonunionized,
generally, low-wage employees without bargaining power.
Congress created liquidated damages in order to provide
a strong deterrent for employers to comply with the law.
And also --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, would -- would
you continue with what you started speaking to, issue
preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's
questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on
the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of
the defendant.
MR. YANG: Yeah. This -- this is page 14,
footnote 2 of our brief. Issue -- there might be claim
preclusion, in that the defendant would not be able to
bring other claims associated, res -- traditional res
judicata.
But for a judgment entered by a concession,
the actual issue is not litigated and necessary to the
judgment. And so it's well established that that would
not serve any issue preclusive effect. And in fact, I
think, if it did, it would put a chill on the ability of
people to settle their disputes through offers of
judgment.
So our solution that we provide the Court,
we think, is the only solution that provides a practical
way to accommodate the very important interests that are
at issue in this case.
One, it recognizes the district court's
discretion to resolve the case in a sensible way, in
order to --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Yang, do you think
it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely
that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here.
But if the judgment had been rendered against
Ms. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had
done so prior to looking at the whole class question --
MR. YANG: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you think that that
would be an abuse of the court's discretion? Do you
think that the court has to look at the class question
before rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?
MR. YANG: In the context of a collective
action, yes, because of the Congressional policy that
gives plaintiffs a right to proceed collectively.
That said, the collective process does not
have to be a burdensome one. There are certain small
claims, idiosyncratic claims, that a court can simply
look at the -- the allegations and say, there are not
going to be similarly situated people here.
But when we have an allegation like we have
here, which there is a widespread policy of deducting 30
minutes a day, notwithstanding the employer's knowledge
that the employers -- employees are working through that
lunch break, there is every reason to think that there
is a substantial body of -- of employees similarly
situated.
And it would be an abuse of discretion for
the Court not to proceed at least down that road,
provide some discovery, facilitate class notice -- as
the Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes is the
appropriate thing to do under Section 216 -- and at the
end of that process, which could be short for some
cases, a little longer for some, should be, of course,
always exercised in the Court's sound discretion.
At the end of the case, if there are more
plaintiffs who opt in, then it proceeds as a collective
action. If it remains the single plaintiff, the Court
might decide to enter judgment.
Now, we don't think that follows, Justice
Sotomayor, from Rule 68. It simply follows from the
fact that a defendant is willing to just to pay, to
give up. It won't have issue-preclusive effect, it
resolves the dispute, judgment in the amount of $7,500,
attorneys' fees, costs.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're talking
about is imputing into this process, a fairness hearing,
essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine
whether this is a quirky case where you entered a
judgment and you don't need a collective action or
whether or not this is a genuine case that requires
joining plaintiffs.
MR. YANG: May I answer the question,
Mr. Chief Justice?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.
MR. YANG: I don't think it's a fairness
hearing. I think what it does is -- it -- it's a
question about whether there are people similarly
situated. And if there are plaintiffs similarly
situated, the case should proceed. If, at that point,
the defendant wants to pay everyone, it certainly could
do so.
But my guess is, usually, the -- the claims
would be litigated on the merits of that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. YANG: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mann, you have
four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
I think the most useful thing to do is to
address the point that Justice Breyer has raised several
times because I think it's important to discuss the
relationship between what I would call the statutory
facts and the constitutional questions that they might
raise. And so I do think it's fair, in a sense, to
think about this as a statutory case.
When a plaintiff files suit in a Federal
court, often, the cause of action rests on a statute
that Congress has adopted. Those statutes have a lot of
attributes that Congress can control to make it easier
or harder for a defendant to make an offer of complete
relief.
They can provide for mandatory shifting of
attorneys' fees, as this one does. They can alter the
rules for shifting costs, as perhaps the Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act does from last month. They can
provide for injunctive or declaratory relief, which
makes it basically impossible.
But Congress gets to decide, when they write
a statute, whether they want to make it a statute for
which it --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's true.
And so what we would be reading into this statute is a
relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the
week in class action cases and has historical analogies.
So I understand the difference you're
pointing to, but why not read that in? It would be
fair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets
up in the statute. That's the argument the other way.
MR. MANN: Well, that leads me to the second
point I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the
constitutional problem. And I think the way to get to
it is when my colleague, Mr. Katyal, refers to the worst
that happens, well, the worst that happens, I think
it's -- it's important to understand what the worst
thing is that happens.
The worst thing is -- that happens is the
case is on the docket of the Federal district judge, and
there is no plaintiff with an interest, and the
procedure in the district court is we should spend some
time, have some discovery, look around to see if we can
find another plaintiff.
And so I think that that's a different
problem from how the district court should decide the
order of hearing -- of deciding motions. If the problem
is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Mann, if this is --
if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be
no issue preclusion because there has been no -- been no
adjudication of anything. Then it seems to me that this
case falls into a classic exception to mootness, which
is defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a
controversy. And this controversy is capable of
repetition yet evasive review because every time -- so
the plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive.
The employer continues in the old ways. The
plaintiff sues again. This seems to me to fit exactly
into that category of cases. If there is no issue
preclusion, defendant doesn't have to stop the practice,
can continue the practice, and then every time there is
a suit say, okay, we'll pay the judgment.
MR. MANN: So I spoke unartfully before.
Obviously, there is a difference between claim
preclusion and issue preclusion. And what I was
attempting to say, unartfully, I will agree, was the
extent of preclusion will depend on the issues that are
actually litigated in the proceeding.
And so I don't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing
litigated when you have --
MR. MANN: Claim preclusion is going to
apply because there's a judgment by --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Claim preclusion, but the
claim is, for this period of time, I wasn't given the
compensation. That's the claim.
MR. MANN: But it is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then there is another
period of time, and there is no issue preclusion.
MR. MANN: But in this particular case,
there's no further dispute likely to occur between these
parties. These -- she no longer works for us. There is
no reason to think she is going to work for us again.
The Court has extended the "capable of
repetition, yet evading review" to class actions in
three cases: Gerstein, Riverside, and Swisher. In --
but in those cases, what happened was the plaintiff
sought prospective injunctive relief. The case became
moot.
If the Court had held that those cases were
outside of Article III, the result would have been that
the defendant could have been -- could have been
engaging in the conduct that allegedly violated Federal
law and would never have had to change.
In this case, what happened -- in this case
and in the cases like this, what happens is someone
seeks purely prospective -- retrospective relief for
something, an injury that is complete. Except for their
attorneys, she would have received complete relief. We
didn't engage in our conduct any longer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
