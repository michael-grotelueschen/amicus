(10:10 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first today in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corporation.
Mr. Joseffer.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Schwartz.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schwartz. Excuse
me. Mr. Schwartz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
A Federal court has subject matter
jurisdiction over a claim brought under title VII
regardless of whether an employer has 15 employees.
This is so because when Congress enacted title VII, it
included a specific jurisdictional grant and that grant
provides that jurisdiction will exist in the Federal
courts over all claims brought under the act.
This specific grant of jurisdiction is
consistent with the more general grant of jurisdiction
contained in 28 U.S.C. 1331 wherein Federal question
jurisdiction exists over all claims that arise under a
Federal law. Title VII is a Federal law.
The Fifth Circuit erred when it -- when it
determined that the employer numerosity issue went to
the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.
Indeed, when title VII was passed, Congress
actually expanded jurisdiction, the Federal question
issue of title VII, because at that time 28 U.S.C. 1331
had a $10,000 amount in controversy requirement that
Congress did away with because the jurisdictional grant
contained within title VII made no mention of the
$10,000 requirement.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say -- so now it's
essentially redundant. Now that 1331 has no
jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the
jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going
over the same territory. It doesn't add or detract.
Is that so?
MR. SCHWARTZ: I would agree with that.
Indeed, the question --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the first sentence, but
not in the venue part.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Not in the venue part and --
and certainly -- because it does apply to which
district court a case should be brought. I would say
it -- it's redundant to the extent of conferring
jurisdiction to a Federal court, but not on the venue
provision --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is not subject
matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with
here.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Right. It's not an issue in
this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the
argument, though, that when you're talking about a
threshold question like coverage, who the statute
covers, and it's quite different from the cause of
action cases, many of which you rely on in your brief?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, we're talking here about
a question of whether or not coverage is subject matter
jurisdiction, and it's our position that once you go
beyond the text and you start evaluating the various
aspects of title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, you are going
down a -- a slippery slope.
An example would be a case perhaps where a --
in fact, a case that I'm currently involved in where a
plaintiff is alleging that they were discharged
discriminatorily. And the reality is from the
employer's perspective, that that person was never
terminated. They're still an active employee. That is
an essential issue of a cause of action. The coverage
of title VII --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's more a question
of -- of whether or not the -- there's been a violation
of title VII. It seems to me that the number of
employee issue is whether you're covered at all,
whether you have to conform your conduct to that law.
Your question -- your -- your case of whether someone
has been discharged or not just goes to whether there's
been a violation.
MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct, Mr. Chief
Justice, but I believe that the analogy applies because
it still goes to whether or not you start reading the
act beyond the jurisdictional grant. It's unnecessary
to go beyond the jurisdictional grant because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in City of -- in
City of Kenosha, of course, the Court went beyond the
jurisdictional grant and it said that the definition of
the term person in 1983 raised a jurisdictional
question.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I would not
necessarily agree that that goes beyond the
jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant
of -- contained in 1334 -- 1343 requires that -- that
jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color
of State law. And that's an example which Congress has
done many times of putting qualifiers within a
jurisdictional grant.
An example of -- of that we have -- we attached
such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but
a specific example, which I think is applicable here, is
the Uniformed Service Employee Reemployment Rights Act
wherein Congress put in that the act would only apply
jurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally,
against employers. And then there's a subsequent
definition of employer further on in -- in the statute
which is missing here because title --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the practical
consequence of the one or the other? Number one, if
you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on
appeal if it's jurisdictional. Right?
MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And number two, the -- if
it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by
the -- by the judge rather than by the jury?
MR. SCHWARTZ: That's correct as well. And I
would go further that the practical problem is what
happened in our case where it wasn't raised in the
trial -- in -- in the case until after a trial on the
merits and after the jury returned the verdict, and we
wasted a lot of time. It -- it could have been brought
up beforehand as a -- a substantive motion for summary
judgment or a 12(b)(6) motion if the pleadings resolved
the issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's always the case.
I mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages --
those disadvantages will always exist. So why would
Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than
simply making it an element of the cause of action?
You understand what I'm saying? I mean, that's always
a consequence.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, you -- you
acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I -- I think if I'm --
if I'm an attorney representing a plaintiff and I want
to make an evaluation of whether or not I have a claim,
I want to first evaluate do I pass a jurisdictional
threshold. If a come -- a person comes into my office
and says, look, this happened to me, I want to bring a
cause of action, and I know that they employ less than
people, then I'm not going to waste my time.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what's the rule
that you suggest we look to in deciding whether a
provision is jurisdictional? Because, as the Chief
Justice pointed out, in 1983 cases where the question
is whether the defendant is a person, we've held that
is jurisdictional. So what is the rule in telling us
when we should treat something as jurisdictional?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, the rule that has
existed for some time now, going back to Bell v. Hood,
is a -- a fair way to look at this. If a statute, a
Federal law, creates a cause of action, then a cause --
a cause of action lies absent Congress expressly
limiting or qualifying an -- a jurisdictional element
within its grant contained within that law, which is --
which is missing completely in title VII.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you call this?
Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your
claim that you must prove?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or there could be an
affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.
MR. SCHWARTZ: It could be an affirmative
defense.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're -- you're
accepting that it is your burden rather than the
employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15
employees.
MR. SCHWARTZ: More than 15, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: More than.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. That -- that's the
plaintiff's burden just like it's the plaintiff's
burden to prove that they were terminated --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you establish that in
the course of the proceedings?
MR. SCHWARTZ: We did not plead it with
particularity. We pled that the employer sexually
harassed the plaintiff, and then thereafter in the
pretrial order, it was not raised as a contested issue
of fact. And I believe the law of the case doctrine
would control in that instance because the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask what --
how does the waiver work? Suppose the judge pre-
verdict says, you know, I'm concerned that there are
less than 15 employees. Can the plaintiff say, oh,
well, now, Your Honor, you can't get into that? They
waived that. They didn't raise it. I mean, how does
that work?
MR. SCHWARTZ: If it's -- if it doesn't go to
the subject matter jurisdiction --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your theory of the
case?
MR. SCHWARTZ: -- then I would say that it is
waived, if it's been answered --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but if it's your
burden to prove it, how can it be waived by the
defendant? I don't understand your theory.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the judge just has
to watch the case sail over the waterfall and --
MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, let's talk about two
different examples. If we have pled with particularity
that the employer has 15 or more employees and is
subject to title VII for liability purposes and the
defendant in their answer admits that fact, then that
becomes a -- a admission --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in my case nobody
mentions it but the judge.
MR. SCHWARTZ: All right. So we have alleged
in our lawsuit that the employer terminated or sexually
harassed the plaintiff and the -- there is not -- it's
not particularly pled. Is that the hypothetical,
Justice Kennedy?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and the -- and the
judge calls it sua sponte to the attention of the
parties.
MR. SCHWARTZ: I would think that if the
judge in a -- in a Federal cause of action was troubled
by any element of the claim, based upon his or her own
review of the factual setting, it's conceivable that --
that the court then could entertain motions on that
particular issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. You -- you
pleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was
-- was an employer under the act. Right?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's the definition of
employer that says he has to have more than -- more
than 15 employees. So, in effect, you -- in making
your complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe
said that this person is an employer under the act. So
it seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts
to the other side to say -- the burden of going forward
of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the
act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted
what -- what your complaint on its face says.
MR. SCHWARTZ: I agree with you, Justice
Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I knew you would.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but maybe --
but that doesn't sound like a reasonable agreement.
All you -- so you file one sentence saying this person
violated title VII. Are you impliedly including all of
the allegations of what constitutes a violation of
title VII because if you didn't allege every particular
element, it wouldn't be a violation of title VII?
That's not how pleading works.
MR. SCHWARTZ: No. And -- and I can -- I can
tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I have probably handled
0 causes of action for discrimination cases, and I've
never seen anybody plead the issue of whether or not
somebody has 15 employees. It's just not done.
JUSTICE SOUTER: In your pleadings, did you
say he's an employer?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Did you use the term
employer?
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and it was admitted and
then it was never challenged thereafter until after the
verdict.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it -- you -- you
told us of your extensive experience. How does the
numerosity requirement usually come up? You've
accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than
an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and
prove. So how does it ordinarily come up? Does it --
because defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer
than 15 employees?
MR. SCHWARTZ: I can give you one real-world
example, Justice Ginsburg. I represented a defendant
in a case that didn't employ 15 people, and when I
attempted to convince the plaintiff -- plaintiff's
lawyer of that fact after the litigation commenced and
they weren't willing to -- to go ahead and voluntarily
dismiss, I simply filed a motion for summary judgment
attaching affidavit material, including payroll
records. And then once the plaintiff's attorney
reviewed that, they voluntarily gave up and the case
was dismissed. That would be the way it would normally
play out, provided it's not held to be an issue of
subject matter jurisdiction.
Another reason why this should not be a
subject matter jurisdiction goes to the practical
elements of the way this would progress in litigation
and title VII's admonition, which is a rare admonition
in legislation, that title VII cases be heard in an --
is in an expedited way. In enacting that particular
language, it appears to me that Congress was
acknowledging that this is a very important law. We're
trying to remediate a terrible wrong, that is,
employment discrimination. So we don't want these
cases to languish. It's almost as though it's being
processed like a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
injunction proceeding, that this is a case that should
move very quickly.
And many courts, like the one across the
river in Virginia that are known as so-called rocket
dockets, process these cases on a very fast track. I
know that -- that court does it. Other courts that I
practice in do it as well where it is not uncommon that
from the pleading that a trial is set as quickly as
months thereafter. If this was to be subject matter
jurisdiction and we had to initially litigate the
question of whether or not the person is an employer
and putting aside all other issues in the case, it
would invariably result in a dragged-out process.
In our case, as we -- as we noted --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true in a lot
of areas. I think of admiralty. If there's an issue
of admiralty jurisdiction that questions whether an
injury is caused by a vessel in navigable water, you
often have extended litigation over that jurisdictional
question.
MR. SCHWARTZ: And -- and in those cases, the
jurisdictional grant in the Jones Act does include
elements of jurisdiction. So it's -- it's required.
But I don't -- I don't believe that the Jones
Act has the same type of language, Mr. Chief Justice,
that title VII has, requiring that these cases be heard
expeditiously. So --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it have to
be resolved preliminarily? Why can't you leave the
jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion
of the trial with all the other questions? Is there
some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional
question must be confronted before the trial and before
the merits?
Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are
reexamined as the trial proceeds. That is, you know,
initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be
jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading. Then if
there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there
appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the
affidavits. But then if the trial proceeds and it
turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the
court dismisses. So why couldn't this jurisdictional
question always be handled that way? Just -- just
leave it to be resolved during the trial. It wouldn't
slow anything up.
MR. SCHWARTZ: There -- there's a few
problems with that. One is that it is not uncommon in
title VII cases that there are supplemental State
claims brought in the cause of action, and so we would
have a situation where there would be a lot of wasted
effort on the pending claim if, at some point, Justice
Scalia, at the end of the day the case was dismissed on
subject matter jurisdiction.
That was s situation in our case where we
had a pendant tort claim for battery, and we also had a
pendant claim under the ancillary Louisiana
discrimination statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So this is a third
consequence of the jurisdictional issue.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If the issue is
jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't
belong there and they've got to be chucked out;
whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant
claims are properly before the court.
MR. SCHWARTZ: That's right, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an important
consequence.
MR. SCHWARTZ: In addition, the Court's
recent opinions addressing subject matter jurisdiction
have all gone back, it seems to me, to this question of
what does the text say. The -- the issue of not
conflating the use of the word jurisdiction, which has
been referenced in a number of the Court's opinions,
Steel Company, Kontrick, Eberhart, Scarborough, all
point to the fact that where the text is clear, as it
is in this case, and there is no ambiguity, then
subject matter jurisdiction lies if a claim is brought
under a Federal act.
If there's no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Schwartz.
Now Mr. Joseffer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PLAINTIFF
MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Justice O'Connor, we think the rule here,
because it's a question of congressional intent, is
simply how to best interpret the relevant statutes.
Here, Congress twice unambiguously conferred
jurisdiction over all title VII claims, at least twice:
first in section 1331 and again in the title VII
jurisdictional provision which confers jurisdiction
over all claims brought under title VII.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, maybe you
can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works
better. The other way.
MR. JOSEFFER: Sorry. Is that better? Thank
you.
As I was saying, the question is -- is --
because it's a question of congressional intent, we
think normal rules of construction apply.
And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about
whether the title VII subject matter jurisdictional
provision is now redundant in light of the reduction of
the amount of controversy from section 1331.
Technically we think the answer is yes, but it still
has great interpretive value because it shows that when
Congress meant to address the jurisdictional question
in title VII, it expressly said so and it did so by
conferring jurisdiction over all title VII claims.
The definition of employer, which is the
relevant issue here, does not itself speak in
jurisdictional terms and does not modify in any way
title VII's broad jurisdictional provision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about the
EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for
administrative processing purposes?
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, as the Court has
remarked on multiple occasions, the word jurisdiction
is a word of many, many meanings, and the EEOC has
never said that it's a question of the subject matter
jurisdiction of the Federal courts. It was -- until
about 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC in an administrative
context used the word jurisdiction to refer to the
definition of employer, statutes of limitations, and a
variety of other matters that are clearly not subject
matter jurisdictional.
But after this Court held in Zipes that
another provision of title VII is not one of subject
matter jurisdiction, EEOC realized that its
administrative use of the broad term jurisdiction was
confusing. So 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC amended its
compliance manual and no longer refers to any of these
questions as jurisdictional. But I guess the key point
is it never said it was on subject matter jurisdiction.
And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about
whether a threshold question of coverage could be
considered different than another element of the cause
of action. I think the important thing here is that
the place where Congress used the term person is in
setting forth what conduct is unlawful. Title VII says
that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for a
person to discriminate in various ways. So the way the
definition is irrelevant is in setting forth the scope
of unlawful conduct which is a quintessential merits or
cause of action inquiry as opposed to a jurisdictional
one.
The City of Kenosha is different because, as
petitioner's counsel recognized, that interpreted not
section 1331 but section 1343 which --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Interpreted section
-- the use of the word person in section 1983.
MR. JOSEFFER: Interpreted the word person in
section 1983 not to apply to municipal corporations,
but with respect to the jurisdictional inquiry, it said
that the -- that 1343 did not confer jurisdiction.
In Mt. Healthy several years later, the Court
held that although section 1343 was narrowly limited to
actions that are quote, authorized by law, which
connoted somewhat of a merits inquiry, section 1331's
jurisdictional provision is not so limited and is not
limited by the definition of person, which is what the
Court held in section 1331.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So City of Kenosha
was just kind of a silly waste of time.
MR. JOSEFFER: Well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 1331 was applicable
there as well. Right?
MR. JOSEFFER: At the time section 1331 had
the amount in controversy requirement, and I think
that's why now that section 1331 no longer has the
amount in controversy requirement, this Court's section
43 cases have more or less petered out because
plaintiffs can now just go under section 1331.
And Justice Scalia, you asked about the --
the practical consequences. I agree there are three
practical consequences, and from that perspective, it
makes little sense to believe that Congress would have
thought that this requirement should be jurisdictional.
The first is whether the issue can be raised at any
point in the litigation. The second is who decides the
issue, and the third is whether, after dismissal of the
Federal claims, the State law claims must be dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction.
And given that this is just one of many facts
that arises in determining whether a plaintiff can
state a valid title VII claim, it's hard to believe
that Congress would have thought that this is the one
fact that should be raised at the end of the case
instead of at the outset where it can be adjudicated in
an orderly manner with all of the other facts.
Also, common law juries have been deciding
for centuries whether a worker is an employee or an
independent contractor for purposes of agency and tort
law. And since that is the ultimate dispute here, it
seems remarkable to think that that's the one fact that
Congress would say should not go to a jury.
And similarly --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What have
juries been determining?
MR. JOSEFFER: Well, the question as to
whether there are 15 employees here --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. JOSEFFER: -- turns on whether some
workers are independent contractors or employees. And
for agency law purposes, which becomes relevant in tort
law in terms of vicarious liability, the question
whether someone is an employee or an independent
contractor is a -- is a longstanding jury question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the question was
whether the truck drivers counted as employees because
if they did, they'd have enough?
MR. JOSEFFER: Right. If the -- if the -- if
those -- if the delivery drivers were workers -- were
employees, there's no question there were 15 employees.
So the question was whether some workers count as
employees and whether a worker is an employee or an
independent contractor is -- is a longstanding question
for a jury when there's a disputed issue of -- of fact.
And then the third consequence -- I mean,
here, there -- the jury rendered a verdict on the State
law claims, found in favor of respondent on one,
petitioner on the other. And it seems highly unlikely
that Congress would think that that jury verdict should
be vacated and the case retried in State court because
the defendant has 14 instead of 15 employees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the --
that's a consequence of a determination that it's
jurisdictional in any case. Right?
MR. JOSEFFER: That's correct, and there --
there are circumstances --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, if you had a
case where you didn't dispute that the issue was
jurisdictional and there had been a jury trial on the
pendant State law claims, we'd still have to throw that
out. Right?
MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, but I think that's one
reason that Congress does not ordinarily make
jurisdiction turn on those types of facts. In the
admiralty concept -- context that you recognized, it's
necessary to distinguish between admiralty jurisdiction
and general Federal question jurisdiction. So Congress
had to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was
by saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a
vessel in navigable waters or elsewhere.
But ordinarily when -- a distinction does not
have to be drawn like that. In section 1343, it was
the same because Congress didn't want that to be
conflated with section 1331 at the time. When
jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual
factors, Congress ordinarily just lets the broad
jurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear,
simple threshold inquiry so parties can determine
they're in the right court, and then the case can be
proceeded -- can be litigated on the merits from there.
Justice Kennedy asked whether a court could
raise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a
merits issue. And I think the answer is that although
the defendant waived the issue here and therefore has
no right to insist that it be raised, most waiver
doctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts
retain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in
some circumstances. That discretion would be greater
at the outset of a case where a Federal court decided
it should not be deciding a case than it would be once
a jury had already decided the case, which is what
happened here.
Finally, respondent relies on a number of
this Court's title VII decisions for the proposition
that this requirement is one of subject matter
jurisdiction. The basic point is that this Court has
never opined in dicta or in holding on whether this
requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction of
the courts. This Court's only title VII subject matter
jurisdiction case is Zipes which held that a
requirement was not jurisdictional because it was not
-- did not textually modify title VII's broad
jurisdictional provision and in light of other relevant
canons of construction. And for precisely the same
reasons, the definition of employer does not textually
modify the definitional provision and therefore it does
not limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction to
adjudicate this claim either up or down based on its
merits.
If the Court has no further questions, I have
nothing further.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Joseffer.
Mr. Prendergast, we'll now hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRETT D. PRENDERGAST
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PRENDERGAST: Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
I have to start off by disagreeing with my
learned colleagues on at least three areas.
First of all, Mr. Schwartz indicated that the
plaintiff pled that the defendant Y & H was an employer
in this matter. That is inaccurate. What the
defendant actually pled and which became the subject of
the subsequent post-trial motions was that the court
had jurisdiction, and when the matter of the number of
employees was raised, that was the pleading -- the
allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff raised
to say this issue has been waived. There was no
specific pleading in the complaint that said that Y & H
qualified for the definition of an employer under title
VII. There was no pleading that Y & H had 15 or more
employees for the 20 or more weeks that were necessary.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was
no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your
client?
MR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,
Your Honor, that the plaintiff was employed by the
company, but there was no allegation that Y & H was an
employer as the term is defined in title VII.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Was the word employer used
in the pleadings?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I don't recall, Your Honor,
whether or not the word employer was used. I think it
was clearly stated that -- and -- and there's no doubt
Ms. Arbaugh was, in fact, employed by Y & H.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking the
really formal question. Was the word employer used to
refer to your client at any point in the pleadings?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I'm -- I'm not sure, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have the complaint
in --
MR. PRENDERGAST: In the record, yes, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Was there an allegation that
the company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that
they violated the act?
MR. PRENDERGAST: There was an allegation,
Your Honor, that --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right -- I guess that --
they must have thought that there were 15 or more
employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Right. And -- and
naturally, though, Your Honor, that was denied.
The -- the admission that the plaintiff
relied upon in the post-trial motions was the
allegation that this Court has jurisdiction under title
VII, under the relevant provision.
JUSTICE BREYER: Was that denied?
MR. PRENDERGAST: That was admitted. The
jurisdiction was admitted, and -- and in the post-trial
motions, that was the issue that the plaintiff hung
their hat on to come back and say this issue is -- is
established and stipulated. There was clearly no
admission that the --
JUSTICE BREYER: You denied it. Then they
presented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D,
E. And I guess then you presented some contrary
evidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he
wasn't an employer. So I guess the odds are he was.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Well, there was -- but --
JUSTICE BREYER: And if the odds are he was,
they win in the absence of any evidence.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Breyer, if an
employer -- and -- and I disagree with the position
that it's -- I -- I think it is an element of the
merits in addition to being an element of jurisdiction.
But if a plaintiff has that as part of their burden of
proof, then the plaintiff naturally has to introduce
evidence --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess maybe you could
have appealed on that point. So did you?
MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, because --
JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess it's waived
unless it's jurisdictional. 	 So we're back to the
jurisdictional question.
MR. PRENDERGAST: And which we maintain that
it is jurisdictional. I'm not sure, Your Honor,
whether or not there is, in fact, any waiver because --
JUSTICE BREYER: I never heard of a point on
the merits that if you -- you think you're right. It's
right on the merits, the element of the offense. You
don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you
don't raise that in the appeal.
MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor, we didn't
raise it in the appeal, the reason being that while the
matter was still pending in the trial court, in
addition to the motion to dismiss for jurisdiction,
which was granted, there was a motion for a renewed
judgment as a matter of law, which included the
plaintiff's failure to maintain their burden of proof.
JUSTICE BREYER: And did you win or lose on
that?
MR. PRENDERGAST: That was dismissed as moot
because of the jurisdictional issue, Your Honor. So
whether or not that is waived or not -- I agree with
you. It's not before this Court today, but I don't
think it's a matter that can be decided by this Court
either. It's a matter, if this Court should decide
that it is a merits issue, that goes back to the trial
court on remand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other aspects of
title VII do you think are jurisdictional?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think the other aspects
-- and clearly, this has not been the subject of as
great a research -- would be the other ones that
designate the scope or the coverage of the act, for
example, especially as it relates to employer.
At least three circuit -- and in addition to
excluding small companies as employers, the act also
includes as -- excludes as employers private membership
clubs, the Government, the United States, agencies of
the United States, wholly owned corporations of the
United States, and also Indian tribes. At least three
circuit courts have held that Indian tribes and their
status is a matter of subject matter jurisdiction.
That's the Fifth Circuit in Thomas v. Choctaw, the
Tenth Circuit in Duke v. Absentee Shawnee Tribe, and
the Ninth Circuit in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do they hold that the
plaintiff must allege the employer is not an Indian
tribe? I'm over here.
MR. PRENDERGAST: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Over here.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE STEVENS: I say in -- in those case
that you just cited, did they hold that the plaintiff
must allege that the employer is not an Indian tribe?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I don't think they got into
that matter, Justice Stevens. Instead, what they
simply decided was whether or not the -- the employer
was an Indian tribe. There was a question concerning
some of the structures and just the business
organizations that the Indian tribes were using and --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you interpret those
cases as, in fact, holding that if there was a trial
and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against what
turns out later to be an Indian tribe, that after the
case is taken up on appeal, the Indian tribe can have
the judgment set aside?
MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, because
the -- the cases did clearly hold that the matter of --
as an Indian tribe was a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction. And as a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction, it is completely established law that
that may not be waived. It may be raised at any time.
So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it, in fact, come up
in that posture in the case? It has already been
mentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many
uses. Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian
tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully
tried and after there was a jury verdict for the
plaintiff?
MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. Those were
cases where there were motions to dismiss based upon
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- if -- if it's
brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it,
whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6),
failure to state a claim? It goes out either way.
When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as
you did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.
MR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I think the effect
could be different when you raise it. I think there
can also be a difference in effect in how it will be
treated, even if it was promptly raised. I think, for
example, on a 12(b)(1) motion, I don't believe the --
the court is obligated to accept all the plaintiff's
pleadings. It's allowed to look outside the pleadings
to actually determine the jurisdiction. Whereas, in a
(b)(6) motion, if the plaintiff says it's an Indian
tribe, it's an Indian tribe.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Prendergast --
MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- my problem with -- with
your -- your contention is that I don't know how it is
that you -- that you intuit that this one definition is
jurisdictional. I mean, the definition -- the -- the
employee limit is -- is part of the definition of
employer in section 701.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There are 13 other
definitions in section 1701. For example, it defines
on the basis of sex. Now, if -- if you contest whether
a particular remark or a particular practice of the
employer was -- fell within that definition, was on the
basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had
no jurisdiction?
MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Will you challenge -- well,
why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're --
when you're saying the -- the definition of -- of
employer has not been met, but you are not challenging
jurisdiction when you say the definition of on the
basis of sex has not been met. Why -- why pick on one
rather than the other?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think the distinction is
similar to an Aldinger/Kenosha type distinction. And I
think the question goes back to it requires an
interpretation of whether or not Congress wanted to
give the lower Federal courts the type of jurisdiction
being discussed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I -- I understand that.
MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's what it comes
down to.
MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But how do you know --
MR. PRENDERGAST: Well, how --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If both definitions in
section 701 --
MR. PRENDERGAST: How -- how do you know --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why does one of them
express one thing and another not express --
MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice Scalia, the way you
know is because you look at the logical deductions that
can be drawn from the congressional statutes, as this
Court suggested in Aldinger.
And with respect to the other definitions, I
cannot speak categorically with respect to those other
definitions because that's not the matter before this
Court. I can't suggest to this Court a wholesale
general policy of these definitions are jurisdictional
and these definitions are not jurisdictional.
--
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the practical
consequences of affirming here are severe in terms of
handling these cases. And we've pointed out in some
recent cases of ours that we've been a little sloppy in
the past in using the word jurisdiction. So it looks
to me like there are many indicators that would point
to not treating the 15 employee requirement as one of
subject matter jurisdiction.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Justice O'Connor, I would
say the -- the consequences of not affirming are even
more severe. Congress, in 1964, made a clear decision
that it wanted small businesses not to be burdened with
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but it's entirely in
the hands of the defendant to raise some objection.
Who knows better than the employer how many employees
the employer has had? I mean, it's totally within your
capacity to say, wait a minute --
MR. PRENDERGAST: But one --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- we didn't have 15.
MR. PRENDERGAST: -- one -- one of the -- one
of the concerns, I believe, that Congress did have with
respect to small employers was the fact that in the
terms of small employers, you are dealing with less
sophisticated litigants, less sophisticated litigants
with less access to legal resources that bigger
companies have.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Were you representing this
employer at the time?
MR. PRENDERGAST: No, Your Honor. I handled
this matter only post-trial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's -- what's
wrong with the rule? We're not dealing with article
III here. What's wrong with the rule that if Congress
doesn't put it in the jurisdictional section, it's not
jurisdictional?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would make the
future cases a lot easier to decide.
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think that would be
contrary, however, Mr. Chief Justice, to the previous
holdings of this Court where they say you do look to
the logical deductions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --
MR. PRENDERGAST: -- and you look to all the
statutes. For example, petitioner makes note of Zipes,
but if -- if the jurisdictional statute is going to be
the be all and end all of -- of the analysis and the
discussion, then Zipes would have merely looked and
said, oh, well, the statute of limitations is not in
the jurisdictional provision. End of discussion.
But Zipes didn't do that. Zipes said we need
to look at the -- the jurisdictional statute, the way
it's structured. We need to look at congressional
intent and the legislative history, how they referred
to this matter. We need to look at our prior cases how
we referred to this matter.
So I think to say just, okay, let's look at
the jurisdictional statute -- one, I think there are
two problems with it. One --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to Zipes?
In Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word
jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of
limitations. I think that was true of the way the EEOC
spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory
and jurisdictional. And then the Court explained in
Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's
jurisdictional. You can have a rule that's rigid, but
it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction. And
that's what Zipes tried to explain. The Court in Zipes
was faced with a number of cases that had used that
term to describe the time in which you must bring the
action, mandatory and jurisdictional.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. But
Zipes also dealt with a legislative history where they
referred to it as a statute of limitations period.
Zipes also said, okay, we have other cases where we
have used the term jurisdictional, but more often than
not, we've referred to this as a limitations period.
Zipes looked at the whole context and said, yes, we're
not going to be held by a few random, maybe casual or
careless uses of the term jurisdictional, but we are
going to look at the whole thing.
Here, the legislative history has
traditionally referred to this as a jurisdictional
provision. The '72 amendments, which increase --
decrease the number of employees necessary from 25 to
, referred to it as an expansion of jurisdiction.
This Court has had the matter come up before it always
in jurisdictional terms. This Court has referred to
this. EEOC has referred to it as jurisdictional.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now we know it's
-- EEOC has changed.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Seeing the errors of their
ways, I guess.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- now that we do
have Zipes, why should the number of employees be
treated any differently than that rigid time line in --
in Zipes?
MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I think the
reason that the number of employees should be different
-- treated differently is because we go back to the
Aldinger question, and the Aldinger question is this
Court has to decide did Congress want to give this type
of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a pendant
jurisdiction case. Wasn't Aldinger --
MR. PRENDERGAST: Aldinger dealt with a
pendant party issue, yes, Your Honor.
Kenosha, however, dealt with -- as the Chief
Justice has indicated, Kenosha dealt with a definition
that excluded counties from section 1983 and that was
found to be implicitly brought into the -- the
jurisdictional grant for civil rights actions.
So I think the mere fact that something is or
is not in the jurisdictional statute cannot be
determinative because ultimately you do need to go back
to the question of did Congress want to give this type
of jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts.
My question would be why would Congress seek
to give this type of jurisdiction to the lower Federal
courts for a whole category of cases where, in the
words of this Court in Hishon, it has granted these
businesses complete immunity from title VII?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just used an
interesting word because there are litigants who can
claim complete immunity from liability, but that
immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't
go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction. It has
to be raised in those cases as a defense.
MR. PRENDERGAST: True, Justice Ginsburg.
The difference, however, between the immunity in those
cases and the type of immunity here that the Court
talked about in Hishon -- immunity for a police officer
in a civil rights case with qualified immunity will
depend upon a police officer's particular actions in
that particular case. The police officer, in general,
can be sued under section 1983.
The immunity that's present here, with
respect to small employers, has no relationship
whatsoever to the actions of that employer. An
employer who employs 12 people at most can engage in
the most egregious employment discrimination and
harassment possible, and the Congress of the United
States has said, as a policy matter, on balance we
would rather accept that kind of awful conduct because
we don't want to impose these burdens on small
businesses.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or leave it to the States
that often do cover smaller shops.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Yes, Your Honor, or leave
it to the States and let the States do it. But we
don't want the Federal Government to be intruding into
the operations -- into the culture of these small
businesses, and that I believe is the difference
between the immunity that you mentioned, the qualified
or prosecutorial type immunity, which depends upon
actions, and this immunity here which depends upon
simply the status of the defendant, the whole class --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that argument
doesn't apply to absolute immunity cases, and yet in
absolute immunity cases, once again, it's clear there's
jurisdiction. There's simply immunity. The immunity
doesn't depend on any particular facts.
MR. PRENDERGAST: The absolute immunity,
Justice Souter, that I'm most familiar with would be
prosecutorial immunity. I think there can still be
exceptions for prosecutorial immunity. I think a
prosecutor, depending upon the type of actions he's
engaged in, can still be subject to liability.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But we have to determine
whether he's acting as a prosecutor. Sure. We have to
determine whether the President was acting in a
presidential capacity, but that's not the kind of fact
inquiry that you were talking about with respect to the
--
qualified immunity.
MR. PRENDERGAST: It certainly -- yes, Your
Honor, I will concede it's a different kind of inquiry.
But I -- I do think, though, here the categorical
exclusion of small businesses is a clear indication of
congressional intent of what Congress wanted to have
happen.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see why the
same argument can't be made with respect to
prosecutors. It is clear that if -- if an individual
is acting in a prosecutorial capacity and enjoys the
appointment as a prosecutor, that at least the -- the
system -- we're not necessarily talking about Congress
here. The system says there -- there should be, as a
categorical matter, an -- an immunity from prosecution.
And yet, that does not go to subject matter
jurisdiction. And it seems to me that that is
essentially the exact argument that you're making here,
and I don't see why it should be any more sound here
than it would be in the absolute immunity case.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Another -- well, Your
Honor, I'll offer another distinction then. The other
distinction is prosecutorial immunity and qualified
immunity, for that matter, are court-created entities
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.
MR. PRENDERGAST: -- court-created defenses.
And as this Court is well aware, this Court nor any
other court has the power to define subject matter
jurisdiction. That is Congress' purview and power.
Only Congress can limit the court's jurisdiction and
define the court's jurisdiction for the lower Federal
courts.
Here, Congress has spoken with respect to
small businesses. It's a different matter, I would
suggest, with respect to prosecutors, which is an
immunity that is -- is a product of common law and --
and a judicial creation.
I would also want to point out that --
another thing. The Solicitor General indicated that if
you look at the structure of the -- the liability
section, he implied that it just imposes the employer
definition into the -- all the other causes of action.
In fact, it does not. It says, it -- it shall be
unlawful for an employer to, and then it defines what
is unlawful. So I think there again it's indicating a
difference between other elements of the cause of
action and the employer relationship and the employer
existence under title VII.
Ultimately, what this boils down to is
whether or not small businesses are going to continue
to receive the protection that Congress has indicated
that it wanted them to have.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why can't get they get
the protections through summary judgment?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think they would be
offered some level of protection, Justice Souter,
through summary judgment. The problem is summary
judgment offers its own unique hurdles to a defendant.
And again, it's a difference --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Among other things, you --
you've got to do it up front.
MR. PRENDERGAST: It's -- it's a different
standard as well, Your Honor, because under summary
judgment, a plaintiff has it within their capability --
have to view all the inferences in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff, and -- and the small
business could end up being dragged into the litigation
further and further than I think Congress intended.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- if we're worried
about dragging people into litigation, I presume
Congress didn't intend, as a -- as a general matter, to
allow the -- the situation that we've got here. One
party has been dragged through a piece of litigation
and, having lost, has decided it wants to take another
shot at getting out of the case. Surely you can't say
that was within the contemplation of Congress' intent.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, actually I -- I
would not have viewed it as outside of Congress'
contemplation or intent because Congress -- and I think
this is an important part of legislative history.
Congress in 1990 enacted the ADA, and they adopted the
employer definition from title VII. And at the time
that Congress adopted title VII's employer definition
for the ADA, all but one circuit court had decided that
this was a matter of subject matter jurisdiction. And
if you decide something is a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction, you take with it the unfairness. And I'm
not going to contend that it's not sometimes unfair to
parties, some of the consequences of subject matter
jurisdiction. But you take that with it when you
decide that it's a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction. And Congress in 1990 adopted for the ADA
the title VII definition. So it's implied that they
understood what was going on.
In 1991, they -- they had the Civil Rights
Act and amended and provided for jury trials in these
types of matters. And again, Congress was aware of the
state of the law.
JUSTICE SOUTER: My -- my point --
MR. PRENDERGAST: And Congress did not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not --
MR. PRENDERGAST: -- seek a change.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- my point is not that
Congress in some specific sense, when it establishes a
jurisdictional requirement, does not intend the
occasional costs that the system has to bear by virtue
of treating that requirement as jurisdictional.
My point simply is that if we are in -- in a
situation in which it is not clear whether it's
jurisdictional or not, and the issue can be raised, in
effect, up front effectively through summary judgment,
and in the alternative, can be treated -- and -- as --
as an ineffective fact element, and in the alternative,
can be left, in effect, forever to be raised as a
jurisdictional element. The fact that it can be
treated effectively up front is one reason to think
that Congress would probably have wanted that fact
issue to be regarded not as jurisdictional but as
elemental so that it can be gotten out of the way and
the parties are not going to go through entire trials
only to have the whole thing upset by a belated
jurisdictional argument. That's my only point.
MR. PRENDERGAST: And -- and, Justice Souter,
I understand that point. However, I -- I tend to
believe that this is, after all, an aberration case.
Petitioner has suggested and the Solicitor General has
suggested that businesses may tend to sandbag this
issue. I simply do not believe that that is a
realistic danger at all. In this case, quite frankly,
the matter was overlooked, and that's how we ended up
here. But in most cases, these small businesses are
not going to be looking to spend a lot of money and go
through a whole trial and then say, oh, well, I had my
shot at it. Let me see. If -- if it doesn't work out
now, I'll get out as a matter of subject matter
jurisdiction. Most cases, small businesses are going
to say, make this case go away from me as fast as you
can. And so I don't think that that's really much of a
danger to suggest that this is a pattern that's going
to be repeated, especially after a decision from this
Court. If this Court, as we believe that it should,
comes down and holds that this is a matter of subject
matter jurisdiction, I think parties will raise the
matter and get it disposed of.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, it doesn't
make a whole lot of difference.
MR. PRENDERGAST: I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that helps your
case.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a
difference on the -- the -- does the categorization
make a difference on the relevant time of the inquiry
for the 15 employees? You have 16 employees when the
discrimination takes place. By the time the lawsuit is
filed, you've only got 14. Does it matter whether
that's called jurisdiction or going to the merits?
MR. PRENDERGAST: I -- I believe that the --
the case law has uniformly held that you look at the
time of the discrimination to determine the number of
employees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even if it's
a question of jurisdiction.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Even if it's a question of
jurisdiction, yes, Your Honor.
And I do think ultimately, though, it does
matter because it does become a matter -- it doesn't
matter for the plaintiff. It doesn't matter for the
plaintiff whether or not it's a matter of subject
matter jurisdiction or a matter of the merits because
the bottom line is they're going to lose in either
event.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters for
plaintiffs in this situation.
MR. PRENDERGAST: In this particular --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It certainly matters from
the defendant's point of view too. In many of these
cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been --
as in this case, you have delivery drivers. You have
owners whose wives are employed in the business.
MR. PRENDERGAST: And, Your Honor, and I
would urge that those kind of matters that need to be
addressed are best addressed by the court as opposed to
by a jury. I think to the matter of determining
whether or not someone is a -- is an independent
contractor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: From the -- from the point
of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight
this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have
this ace up my sleeve.
MR. PRENDERGAST: I just -- Your Honor, I
simply do not believe a defendant would generally do
that because, as I pointed out in my brief, the problem
with that is if I'm representing the defendant, all
right, and I'm going to defend my case on the merits
and I know I got this 15 employee question here, I go
to trial, let's suppose I win. I win at trial in
Federal court. Subject matter jurisdiction can be
raised by the plaintiff. Now, after I've won at trial,
the plaintiff stands up and says, oh, this court didn't
have subject matter jurisdiction. I get a do-over.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds like a good
reason why a court should think long and hard about
categorizing this as a question of subject matter
jurisdiction.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, but again, I --
I simply don't believe that that's going to be a
problem that's going to come up. I think the
importance of -- of categorizing this as subject matter
jurisdiction is to avoid -- among other things, is
adding another complicating factor to a jury trial
because, if you make this a matter of the merits now --
counsel for petitioner describes in his brief extended
hearings to determine the number of employees. We're
now -- if you make it part -- just a part of the
merits, now before you can get to the actual issue of
discrimination, a jury is going to have to sit through
and try to decide how many employees there were.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would be
simultaneous. The jury -- the jury would have that
question. Didn't I understand the attorney for the
United States to say this is typical of what juries
decide, was this person an independent contractor or an
employee?
MR. PRENDERGAST: Your Honor, I -- I heard
that argument as well. All I can say is given the
number of factors that are laid out under, for example,
the Fifth Circuit law to determine whether or not
somebody is an independent contractor or an employee,
that seems to me to be more like the function of a
judge than a jury because it's a matter of balancing of
the relevant factors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Prendergast.
MR. PRENDERGAST: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schwartz, you
have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. SCHWARTZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHWARTZ: If there are no additional
questions, I -- I have nothing further.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think -- do you think
it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be
jurisdictional but an employer couldn't? I mean, it
seems to me the two the questions are quite different.
An Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe. Right?
And you're -- you're excluding -- just as a prosecutor
is always a prosecutor. You're excluding a whole
category of people. But you're -- you're not excluding
a category of employers here, are you? Because it's a
-- it's a factual question, whether at the time of the
alleged offense, the particular company was employing
more than 15 people. It isn't that this company
forever has immunity.
MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, I agree with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're -- you're not
arguing for the Indian tribes here.
MR. SCHWARTZ: As -- well, my -- I leave that
to other people.
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHWARTZ: But the -- I could -- in
answer to that question, I can see an interesting
scenario where a plaintiff working for a casino on an
Indian tribe, there might be a question of who the
actual employer is. And -- and that could come up and
that would certainly involve some litigation.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if the
practice of law has returned to normal in New Orleans?
MR. SCHWARTZ: No. It's -- it's a struggle
somewhat for jury pools. The State court in
particular, because it only covers Orleans Parish, is
-- is really struggling with pulling in jurors. The
Federal courts have a larger number of parishes to draw
from.
I'm actually still living in Atlanta.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
