CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 13-719, Dart Cherokee Basin Operating
Company v. Owens.
Mr. Berreth.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOWELL D. BERRETH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BERRETH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In Section 1446(a) Congress established a
pleading standard for the notice of removal, not a
demand for proof.  The plain language in Section 1446(a)
tells us this.  The plain language of Section 1446(a)
provides that a notice of removal shall contain a short
and plain statement of the grounds for removal.
And that mirrors language that has been used
in Rule 8 for more than 80 years and that has never been
held to require evidence with the complaint.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, how do we know that
the reason the court of appeals did -- did not -- or
sustained the refusal to take it, how do we know that
the reason was that they disagree with you on what the
standard -- what the court of appeals' reason was?  How
can we --
MR. BERRETH:  Well, we know that the court
of appeals let stand a district court decision.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right, and so your --
your -- your job is to argue that that was an abuse of
discretion, because the statute says that they may,
right?  They may take it--
MR. BERRETH:  Well, an abuse of
discretion -- an abuse of discretion is not necessary to
be shown here.  It can be shown here, because what the
circuit court did here was let stand a decision that did
many things.
And it's an unusual situation in the law,
Justice Scalia.  It let stand a decision of the district
court that flouted the plain language of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it always an abuse of
discretion for the court of appeals to let an erroneous
decision stand?
MR. BERRETH:  Not necessarily always.  In a
case like this, however, when the decision that was
let -- let to stand flouted the plain language of the
statute, is a situation where if it's not corrected by
this Court, it may never be corrected.  And what the --
the problem that will never be corrected is this lack of
uniformity among the circuits on a matter that's so
clearly established by Congress.
Congress does not require there to be
evidence in a notice of removal.  And defendants in
Florida or defendants in California don't have to
include evidence within 30 days in their notice of
removal.  Defendants in the six States at issue in this
case do.  They are treated differently.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems a little
extreme to say it may never be corrected.  I mean, this
was a decision that was made by eight judges.  There are
now twelve judges.  Maybe the additional four will make
a difference.  Maybe even those eight will think twice
about it the next time around.  I mean, in fact we just
don't know, right, because we don't know why they acted
the way they acted.
It might have been because they thought that
the district court's decision was right, or it might
have been because they thought it -- that -- that
question is better -- was better decided in some other
context, or it might be because they were just feeling
too busy that day.
And -- and an abuse of discretion standard
would go, you know, to the -- just the decision whether
to take it, not knowing what that decision was based on.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, Justice Kagan, in this
situation, given what the Tenth Circuit has done and
given that the case has made it this far, as Judge Hartz
pointed out in his dissent below, it's highly unlikely
that a situation like this would arise again.  It's --
it takes an unusual confluence of circumstances to have
a case get here in the first place.
But now that we are here, lawyers in the
Tenth Circuit are more unlikely than ever to -- to allow
this problem to happen in the future, to allow this
to -- to re -- recur.
And so that is a main part of why this is an
unusual situation.  It's not a garden variety decision
by the court of appeals that we are faced with.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm not sure you're
joining issue with the question Justice Kagan asked.  Do
we really not know why the Tenth Circuit did what it did
in this case?
MR. BERRETH:  Well, the Tenth Circuit did
not explain the reasons for its decision.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the dissenters
in the case thought -- explain why they thought it was
wrong.  Don't you think if the Tenth Circuit relied on a
different reason they would have said so?
MR. BERRETH:  Well, they may have, they may
not have.  They're not required to.  But they're not
allowed to insulate their decisions from review simply
by -- by not explaining them, especially in a situation
like this involving the unusual situation and involving
a circuit that -- that is -- that is wayward, a circuit
that is not applying the plain language of Section
1446(a).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, I'm not sure
what --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Go ahead.  Has there been
any suggestion at any point in this case -- in the
district court, in the court of appeals, in the papers
that have been filed here -- that the decision was based
on anything other than the reasoning of the district
court?  Any other reason been given?
MR. BERRETH:  There has not been another
reason that's been given, and the reason that the
district court gave was clearly erroneous.  The district
court clearly thought that she was constrained to ignore
evidence that all parties agreed is sufficient to
establish removal of jurisdiction in this case.
This is a case where there's no dispute
about whether all of the elements necessary for Federal
court jurisdiction exist.  The only impediment to
Federal jurisdiction right now is that the district
court felt constrained to ignore that evidence solely
because of -- of a timing restriction that is not found
in the plain language of the statute.  And when --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm wondering in
some later case, could attorneys who want to remove
within the 30-day period seek mandate from the Tenth
Circuit to mandate the judge not to require the
evidence?
MR. BERRETH:  Well, they could -- I suppose
they could try something like that.  I think that
they're not required to.  Congress has told us that
they're not required to go to such extreme measures.
Congress has told us that what defendants are supposed
to do is, within 30 days of receiving the complaint or
another paper, either of which would put them on notice
that -- that there is the amount in controversy in play
here, that they are required to file their notice of
removal.
And in the Tenth Circuit, they have to go
get affidavits.  Perhaps the CEO of the company is in
Hawaii or something.  And frequently, lawyers aren't
even hired for a couple of weeks after a complaint is
filed.
And so you can have a situation where, in
the Tenth Circuit, unlike in other circuits, maybe
there's only 10 days to go find the CEO to get the
affidavit that thought â€“ that is thought to be necessary,
when that requirement simply does not exist in the plain
language of the statute.  And it doesn't exist -- it's
not enforced in any of the other circuits.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Berreth, I -- I
apologize for going back to this not merits question,
but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it
did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from
denial, made reference to the fact -- and I'm just
quoting here -- that the judges were very busy, and the
appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a
decision in short order.
So even he, who was trying to suggest that
an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting
that the court did what it did because the court agreed
with the trial court.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, in a case like this
where all parties agree that there's a case in the court
of appeals, so that there is jurisdiction under Section
1254, the Forsyth v. Hammond case confirms that this
Court has the power, the certiorari power to -- to look
to the whole case, to look to any aspects of the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought Hohn, which
I think you used as explaining why the case is in the
court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you
can review is the COA, certificate of appealability.
You can't use that handle to get to the merits.
So the only question is whether the
certificate was improperly denied and not the merits.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the
difference in that case was that the government conceded
error.  Government conceded that the merits question was
not in dispute.  So this Court didn't need to go ahead
and reach the merits.  This Court has reached the merits
in a similar situation in the Nixon v. Fitzgerald case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But I thought -- are you
saying that all parties concede that this case is in the
court of appeals, both with respect to the proper
exercise of the court's jurisdiction in taking the case
and as to the merits?
MR. BERRETH:  That's right.  Once the case
is in the court of appeals, under Section 1254, Forsyth
confirms that this Court has the power to review any
aspect of the decision --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I -- I think that's
contrary to Hohn, as Justice Ginsburg has just
indicated.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, Hohn did not purport to
overrule Nixon v. Fitzgerald --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  And one's a
COA, and then the other's -- is the statute
there.  There may be a difference thereâ€™s, but I don't
see the difference.
MR. BERRETH:  Justice Kennedy, this -- this
case presents different issues than were in play in
Hohn.  And a case that presented issues very similar to
this is Nixon v. Fitzgerald.  And in that case, the
court did both steps.  The court took both steps.
The court, number one, confirmed that it had
jurisdiction under Section 1254, which exists here; all
parties agree.  And number two, the court in Nixon v.
Fitzgerald went ahead and addressed the merits question,
which is what we asked the Court to do in this case,
because if the Court doesn't go ahead and address the
merits question in this case, there is a high likelihood
that the merits question won't be addressed, and that
we'll have one circuit alone that has this requirement
out there that flouts congressional intent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The reason is that any
careful lawyer in the Tenth Circuit will -- will know
that we -- we'd better put the evidence in the notice of
removal.  So a lawyer is not going to risk failing to do
that to make -- to correct the Tenth Circuit's error.
MR. BERRETH:  That's right.  And -- and this
sort of belt and suspenders approach is not what
Congress tells us defendants have to do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the district court's
opinion is not -- certainly not circuit law, so I think
you exaggerate when you say it establishes bad law for
the circuit.  It just doesn't.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The circuit let the
district court decision stand, but that doesn't make the
district court decision circuit law.
MR. BERRETH:  The district court was relying
on circuit law in making its decisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And maybe it was wrong.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, the circuit law, which
started this, the Laughlin case from 1995, is wrong, we
would submit.  And that is the case that got the Tenth
Circuit off on this track.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.  You're just not
relying on this case; you're relying on the fact that
the district court relied on an earlier case.
MR. BERRETH:  That's right.  This -- this
so-called Tenth Circuit rule, which came into effect in
about 1995, what set this circuit off its -- off track,
and this is the case that can bring this circuit back on
track.
And to -- to not require the district courts
to feel constrained as the district court here felt --
the district court here felt that she was constrained by
Laughlin and by a couple of other cases in the Tenth
Circuit that established this Tenth Circuit rule.
And based on that constraint, which, again,
finds no basis in the text of the statute, she refused
to consider evidence that all parties agree establishes
the amount in controversy.  The amount in controversy in
this case as established is more than four times the
amount in the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  How -- how
would you answer this question:  How did the circuit
abuse its discretion?
MR. BERRETH:  The circuit abused its
discretion by letting stand a decision that so plainly
violated the plain language of the statute that exists
in a case in which further review is highly unlikely, so
that if it's not corrected now it may never be
corrected.  And in doing so, it -- it -- it ran counter
to this Court's desire for uniformity among the circuits
in the law, especially uniformity in a matter this
important and this -- and in which Congress has spoken
as clearly as it has.
JUSTICE BREYER:  To put it more simply, you
think that the circuit abused its discretion by relying
upon an improper legal reason.
MR. BERRETH:  We do believe it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's classic, right?
MR. BERRETH:  We do.  We don't believe --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, it isn't quite clear
that they did, because they didn't say .  But you
think there's a good chance they did.  So then I guess
that you would like us to say, if that was your reason,
it's improper and wrong.
Now, we'll send it back to see if there is
some other reason.
MR. BERRETH:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's your position.
MR. BERRETH:  That's right.  And this Court
reviews --
JUSTICE BREYER:  There is nothing more to it
than that.
MR. BERRETH:  This Court reviews judgments,
not rulings.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  That's a different
point.
MR. BERRETH:  And --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What we reviewed is the
word "denied," and the question of the word "denied" is
we're not certain why, but we have a good suspicion.  Is
that -- I mean, that's the argument.  Is there anything
else to it?
MR. BERRETH:  What else is in the argument
is that this Court is not required to find an abuse of
discretion to rule in our favor in this case.  Because
this Court's certiorari power is broad enough so that
this Court doesn't even have to wait for a circuit court
to act.  So if this Court doesn't have to wait for a
circuit court to act, it shouldn't be restricted from
doing what is right merely by a circuit court's decision
not to explain its reasoning.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In other words, you win
either way.  We say they abused their discretion if they
relied on the wrong law, or we go right to the law
because we have that power to do it.
MR. BERRETH:  That's right, Justice
Sotomayor.  We ask you to review the Tenth Circuit's
decision.  There is choices the Court can make in how to
handle this.  We think the most logical way for the
Court to handle it is to review the Tenth Circuit's
decision, and in doing so, to look through that, to what
the Tenth Circuit did.  And when you do that, you find
this clear error of law, this failure to appreciate
Congress's plain language, this failure to appreciate
the fact that this is not a case that's likely to come
up for review in the future.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't know what the
Tenth Circuit did.  You say the Tenth Circuit's
decision.  The Tenth Circuit made no decision.  It
declined to take the case, didn't it?  It may -- the
statute says it may, and it said we won't.  And we don't
know why they said that.  Even the dissenters in the
petition for en banc didn't say, oh, the court was wrong
to stand by our earlier decision which you â€“ which you
complain about.  No, they said, you know, this was an
important issue and we should have taken it.  Now, you're
saying we are going to review that decision as an abuse of
discretion that you should have taken it.  Right?
MR. BERRETH:  I'm saying that once the
application for an appeal was filed, there is a case in
the court of appeals, therefore, this Court's power is
so extensive it can review any aspect of a decision.
It's not hampered by a lack of an explanation for the
decision by the Tenth Circuit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that right?  It seems to
me the statute gives the power to the court of appeals.
It says the court of appeals may decline to take it.  We
can't override their judgment not to take it unless
there is something unlawful about that judgment.  You
give us too much credit, you know, we don't have total
power to make decisions, the courts of appeals are
supposed to make.
MR. BERRETH:  Justice Scalia, under Forsyth,
though, this Court does have the power to not be
constrained by the district court's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought your answer would
be, of course, he is right.  But there is something
unlawful about this decision.  Suppose the decision had
rested on his religion.  Unlawful, wouldn't it have
been?  Suppose they didn't tell us but the dissent told
us.  So the question is you're arguing, yes, there was
something unlawful.  The unusual thing about the case is
the person who tells us what they were doing is the
dissent.
Now, I don't know why the dissent says that
was a reason -- as I read the dissent.  Maybe other
people read it differently, but as I read the dissent,
the dissenter was telling us that that was a significant
factor in their decision.  All right.  As found in the
other case, we find out what they did by reading the
dissent, it doesn't sound to me to be totally unusual.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you agree with that
description of the dissent?  Do you think the dissent
said that that was the reason?
MR. BERRETH:  The dissent said that the
district court felt constrained by this pre-existing
Tenth Circuit precedent to refuse to consider the
evidence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  But the dissent
didn't say why the court of appeals refused to take the
case, did it?  It didn't say the court of appeals
refused to take it because it agreed with that prior
decision.  It didn't say that, did it?
MR. BERRETH:  It did not explain that.
That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You have different judges
who possibly read different language in the dissent to
suggest what the dissent is thinking.  So he doesn't say
it literally, but when I read it, I thought that's what
he means.
MR. BERRETH:  But based on what happened
here, there is just simply no way that the Tenth
Circuit's decision can satisfy an abuse of discretion
standard.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let me give you an example
of something that happens quite frequently and maybe you
can tell me if this situation is any different from
that.
A district court has to make a decision on
something as to which the district court has discretion.
A party urges the district court to make a particular
decision based on one ground.  And the one ground is
based on a legal error.  The district court rules in
favor of that party but says absolutely nothing.  Now
the issue is raised on appeal, the argument is that the
trial judge abused his or her discretion.
Now, would that be insulate it from review
for abuse of discretion on the ground that, well, we
really don't know why the judge did what the judge did?
The judge didn't say anything.  So the judge might not
have based the decision on this one -- on this legal
error, the only ground that was urged upon the court.
It might have been based on something else.
MR. BERRETH:  No --
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would be -- is that
different from this situation?
MR. BERRETH:  It's not very different from
the situation.  A classic abuse of discretion is an
error of law.  And there was an error of law here
because the district court felt constrained --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Berreth, that assumes
that when an appeals court decides whether to take an
appeal, all they are doing is making a merits
determination.  And if that's all that appeals courts
were doing when they decide whether to take an appeal,
then you would be right.  But, in fact, we know from
everything we do every day that when a court decides to
take something or not to take something, they are not
just making a merits evaluation.  They are doing a
thousand other things as well about how they think it's
best to arrange their docket.  And what we don't know is
whether the Tenth Circuit here did one of those things.
MR. BERRETH:  I believe that what we do
know, what we can glean from this, though, is that by
failing to correct this clear error of law, that was an
abuse of discretion.
I don't believe an abuse of discretion was
necessary here because this Court isn't constrained
under the Forsyth case by what the district -- by what
the circuit court did because this Court can act before
the circuit court acts.  But an abuse of discretion is
shown here.  We can show abuse of discretion.  It's the
classic abuse of discretion, of a clear error of law.
But there isn't a floodgates problem here, I think, with
respect to every time a circuit court commits a clear
error of law that it has to be appealable.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I guess it's an abuse
of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error
of law on a petition for certiorari.  Right?  And I'm
not going to mention any names, but is that the case?
It's an abuse of discretion.  I thought we just had the
power to say we don't feel like taking it.
MR. BERRETH:  I don't believe it would be an
abuse of discretion for this Court.  This Court's power
is different than the circuit courts'.  The circuits
courts do not have the benefit of the broad, nearly
unlimited power of Forsyth --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this statute gives the
appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area.  It
says it may take an appeal, it may not take an appeal.
Think of the thousand things that you want to think
about, not anything invidious, not anything permissible,
but, you know, whether to take an appeal.  And that's
the only thing we know about it.
Here's a question for you, because I
sympathize with you.  Because the next half-hour is
going to reveal that, actually, most of us agree with
you on the merits.  Right?
JUSTICE ALITO:  That might be a little
premature.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  All right.  I will limit it,
I agree with you on the merits.  All right?  But I just
don't see how to get around this.  Here's my suggestion.
Would it be sufficient for your purposes,
you're worried about the sort of continuing effect of
this, to just sort of get rid of this case, dismiss this
case, but to -- we often explain why we dismiss cases
and to suggest that we are dismissing it because we
don't know whether the Tenth Circuit made a decision on
the merits.  And if and to the extent that the Tenth
Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the
merits, and if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit
wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits
when it denies an appeal, it should say so, so as not to
insulate that decision from review.
That seems like a fair thing to say to the
Tenth Circuit.  Don't insulate your merits decisions
from review.  But it also seems to be, you know, to
reflect what is true about this case, which is that we
don't know whether it made a merits decision.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, this Court doesn't need
to know whether the Circuit Court made a merits decision
to reverse in this case.  This Court's discretionary
power, this Court's certiorari power, once there's a
case of the court of appeals doesn't require this Court
to know why the circuit court did what it did.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you think it's
appropriate for this Court to dismiss certiorari, in
other words, the case is not before us, and then opine
on the merits of the case?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  No.  No.  I was not
suggesting that we opine on the merits of the case.  I
would think that that would be not appropriate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the
suggestion was that we tell the Tenth Circuit that this
was wrong?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  No.  No.  That is not
my suggestion, it might be your suggestion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, if we simply
dismiss certiorari, what do you think we have the
authority to say other than the reasons for dismissing
certiorari?
MR. BERRETH:  Well, I think number one, you
have the power to rule in favor of my client in this
case.  I think you have the power perhaps to remand the
case to the Tenth Circuit, this case, and require the
Tenth Circuit to consider the appropriate factors.
I don't think it would be appropriate, given
where we are, given how far we've come, given the fact
that all parties agree there's a case in the court of
appeals, given that Forsyth teaches us that this Court
need not know why the circuit court did what it did to
find abuse of discretion, if an abuse of discretion is
necessary, I would submit at a minimum, that this Court
would remand the case to the Tenth Circuit for an
appropriate balancing of the factors.
But I don't believe that that is necessary
because I believe that because of Forsyth and because of
this Court's power, this Court has the power to reverse
this case similar to what happened in the Standard Fire
case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can -- how can
we remand for an appropriate consideration of the
factors if we don't say that what took place was
inappropriate?
MR. BERRETH:  That's -- a decision on the
merits would cover all those bases, Mr. Chief Justice.
A decision on the merits here would correct the error;
it would correct the error in this case, and it would
correct -- keep any errors from happening in future
cases in the Tenth Circuit.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is the only way that we
can do that is by granting cert before judgment?
MR. BERRETH:  I don't believe that that's
the only way that that can be done.  I think that it
happened in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, let's assume that we
think the case that Hohn controls and this case is in
the -- in the court of appeals only for the purpose of
determining whether the appeal should be taken.  If we
make that assumption, then isn't the only way for us to
reach the merits to grant cert before judgment?
MR. BERRETH:  Justice Kennedy, the Court's
certiorari power is broader than that, I believe.  So I
don't believe a cert grant before judgment is the only
way because this Court does not need to wait for the
circuit courts to act.  But if this Court does wait for
the circuit court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, do we grant it on
the ground that it's interesting?  I mean, I don't know
what your -- what your standard is.
MR. BERRETH:  You grant cert on cases of
national importance, on cases in which there is one
wayward circuit that's so flouting the plain language of
the -- of the statute that it -- that it -- that it
should -- needs to be corrected, that defendants in the
heartland of the country, in these six states, should
have the same benefits as defendants in those other
states.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In other words, we grant
cert to the district court?
MR. BERRETH:  This Court can grant cert to
the district court in very rare circumstances.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that's the only way we
can do it, it seems to me, if you assume that the case
is in the court of appeals only for the purpose of
determining whether to take an appeal.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, the Nixon v. Fitzgerald
case, though, confirms that the court is not so
constrained.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but we would sort of
frustrate the statute, wouldn't we?  The statute gives
the court of appeals the discretion to decide whether
there will be an appeal or not.  And you're saying, oh,
no, if they decide there won't be you -- you just reach
in, and you have cert before judgment.  I think that's a
real frustration of the purpose of this statute, which
says these matters, you know, are not all that
significant.  So it doesn't come to federal court.  It
stays in state court, who cares?  We trust our state
courts.
I mean, the whole purpose of the statute is
to make this, you know, a quick and dirty judgment.
That's why they don't have to state reasons.  They just
say no appeal, or appeal.
And you're saying, oh, no.  It suddenly
becomes laden with -- with all sorts of requirements
that if they're not observed, we -- we grant cert before
judgment.  I wouldn't think of doing that, well, with
this statute anyway.
MR. BERRETH:  Well, when Congress provides
in 1453 for appellate jurisdiction over the remand
orders, Congress is providing for jurisdiction in this
Court because Congress didn't legislate to the contrary.
When -- when Congress wants to prevent this
Court from having the ability to take up a writ of
certiorari, it does so, as it did in the AEDPA context,
when it explicitly restricted this Court from hearing a
petition for a writ of certiorari or granting one.
Congress didn't so legislate here.  This
Court has full power to address both the -- address the
merits question in this case.
I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Sharp.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX A. SHARP
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SHARP:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The remand order should stand for at least
two reasons.  First, 1447(d) bars this Court's
jurisdiction to review this case at all, on appeal or
otherwise, because the Tenth Circuit did not accept the
remand appeal under 1453.
Consequently, this Court has no jurisdiction
at all to review this matter on appeal or certiorari or
any other way.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so if the
court of appeals said we are not accepting this petition
because of the race of the person seeking removal,
that's just too bad?  We can't review that?
MR. SHARP:  If they give a reason, I think
this Court can review a reason.  But if it doesn't give
a reason, it just simply does as this Court sometimes
does with a petition for certiorari -- denied -- there's
nothing to review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if every case in
which parties seek removal, a particular race of a
person seeking removal, their case is denied 100 out of
100 cases.  We still don't have any basis and they know,
gosh, the one thing we -- we can't do is say why we are
doing it.  They have a blank check?  They can do that
forever without any review by this Court?
MR. SHARP:  No.  I don't think you have a
blank check, because at the time it goes back to state
court, then comes up on final judgment, and this Court
would review the final judgment on whether the remand
was proper.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it was just pointed
out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to
take that risk.  The Tenth Circuit precedent, which the
district court followed, says you must produce in the
notice of appeal evidence.
So what lawyer is going to say to his
client, now, we can easily do that, but I won't because
I want to test whether the Tenth Circuit precedent is
wrong.
As a practical matter, this will be
unreviewable because the lawyers will simply conform to
what the Tenth Circuit says is the law.
MR. SHARP:  Your Honor, I think that's what
the dissent pointed out, is that, what lawyer would not
put on evidence after having that Tenth Circuit rule set
forth as it has been for the last 20 years.  But yet, we
do have this case where evidence wasn't presented.  Why
their evidence was not presented, no one knows, but it
was clear that Dart had the evidence to present at the
time of this notice of removal but didn't present it.
Perhaps it wanted to challenge this issue to
the Tenth Circuit --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Maybe -- maybe because it
thought there wouldn't be any controversy.  Maybe they
thought the defendant thought the plaintiff would agree
that the amount was over the jurisdictional order.
MR. SHARP:  That's a good point, Your Honor,
and that's entirely possible.  That, as it turns out,
would not be this case, because as we get deeper into
the evidence in this particular case, this one doesn't
meet $5 million.  It's not going to get close to meeting
$5 million.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You actually started out by
saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with
this case.  That is, I thought that they -- they were
going -- the relevant statute is 1453(c)(1), which says
a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding
Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court
granting or denying a motion to remand.  All right?
So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are
talking about 1453(c)(1).
Now, what they did is they said they have an
order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it.  And
the question is, is that order reviewed in this Court?
I didn't think there was disagreement that it is
reviewable.
If they had said, We will not accept it
because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in
transitu cases, they would have their reason.  Their
reason would have been wrong, and I guess we could
review it.  Is that right or not?
MR. SHARP:  Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes or no?
MR. SHARP:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, we can't review any
case when they turn it down, no matter what their
reason.  Do you have any authority for that proposition?
MR. SHARP:  1450 -- as you pointed out,
1453(c) and 1453 in total adopts the entirety of 1446
and 1447, with limited exception.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  It doesn't adopt it.
It says notwithstanding Section 1447(d), a court of
appeals may accept an appeal.  So please accept my
appeal; court of appeals says no.
My question to you is, does this Court have
the authority to review the order that says no?
MR. SHARP:  And my answer is still --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't --
MR. SHARP:  -- still the same --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No matter how terrible the
reason, it doesn't.  That's your answer?
MR. SHARP:  No.  My answer is because they
did not accept the appeal, then you go back to
1447(d) --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  I'm saying my
hypothetical is they do not accept the appeal.
MR. SHARP:  As in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  They say we do not accept
the appeal because 1453 only applies to stoppage in
transitu.  Okay?  A totally wrong reason.
Now, are you saying we do not have the
jurisdictional authority to review that order which says
"denied"?
MR. SHARP:  Denied for some clearly improper
reason?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, denied for some
clearly improper reason.  Are you saying that?  And if
so, I'd like to know the authority for that because we
have plenty of cases that go with the analogous
certificate of appeal in habeas cases -- cases where we
take it.
MR. SHARP:  I understand, Your Honor, and I
don't think I have any cases, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If you don't
have any cases, we might file the other way.  If you
agree, and you don't -- all right, I don't know where to
go from here because if you're going to say we can't
take authority where they absolutely can't hear the
case, where it's absolutely clear they're wrong, then I
don't know where to go.
MR. SHARP:  Well, let me see if I can --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't do that, but, I
mean, but I'm not going to get you to say anything more.
MR. SHARP:  Let me see if I can address it,
Your Honor.  Hohn and Miller L. are not remand cases and
Nixon was not a remand case.  1447(d) expressly deals
with remand cases and Section 1453(c)(1) says when there
is an accepted appeal under 1453, then 1447(d), it
doesn't apply.  But all the rest of 1447(d) applies and
all of 1447 applies if the appeal is not accepted.
That puts you right back into the 1440(c)(d)
realm and 1447(d) says this Court doesn't have any
jurisdiction under Gravitt.  This is a similar case to
like Kircher v. Putnam Funds where this Court basically
said the district court got it wrong, but we don't have
jurisdiction to hear it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think it's -- it's
constitutional for Congress to say that certain minor
issues or what it regards as minor issues shall not be
appealable for any reason whatever?  So even if it's
decided you're going to do it for a plainly improper
reason, like religion or race or something, still and
all it ain't -- it ain't worth our trouble, right?
Could Congress do that?
MR. SHARP:  Your Honor, I don't think
Congress can -- no, I don't think Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't think Congress
did that here.
MR. SHARP:  I don't think they did that
here.  I think they made a --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think you're going to
lose then.
MR. SHARP:  I think they made a simple
declaration in 1447(d) that remand orders are not worth
the time of the Court to handle on review, and with
respect to class actions, we're going to let the court
of appeals make that choice of whether it makes -- if it
merits any attention on appeal.  And if the court of
appeals says it does --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you pay any attention
at all to the obvious purpose of the Class Action
Fairness Act, which was to get cases out of the State
courts and into the Federal courts?  Usually, we don't
have that strong Federal policy of having the
adjudication in the Federal court.
MR. SHARP:  Yes, Your Honor.  CAFA, I think,
made clear that certain larger cases, interstate type
cases, belong in Federal court.  This isn't that kind of
a case, but if it was, you also have --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that you would
argue that the amount in controversy was not satisfied
and it seems to me that most plaintiffs who are bringing
class actions are not going to be argued, oh, we can't
prove $500,000.
MR. SHARP:  Your Honor, as much as my client
would like to see this be a bigger case than it really
is, this particular case, as the Court knows, when the
original allegation was made on a conclusory basis of
$8.2 million, that was made on the basis of all of the
potential damages for all of the royalty owners.
But in this oil and gas context, about 62
percent of all of the oil and gas leases were express
deduction leases; in other words, they expressly
authorized the deductions that we complained about.
There goes about 40 percent of our damages right there
as a matter of law.
The second thing is that it turns out, as we
get deeper into this case, that Dart doesn't have all of
the working interest in this particular oil and gas
patch.  They have more along the lines of half.  There
goes another half of our damages.  Now we're down to 20
to 25 percent of the total damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You had alleged in your
complaint that the damages that you were seeking were
under $500,000.  If that's what you thought, then you
would be --
MR. SHARP:  We -- we had no idea at that
time, Your Honor.  We didn't know how much.  We just
didn't have any information whatsoever at that time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But when they -- when
they did allege in the notice of removal that the amount
in controversy was met, you didn't contest that.
MR. SHARP:  We didn't need to at that time.
We already had taken on the issue long before any
evidence was presented to us that they had not proffered
any evidence with the notice of removal.  Under -- under
the JCV's -- the JVCA --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what you didn't say
is that there is no such evidence and that our damages
are less than $500,000.
MR. SHARP:  We -- we didn't know -- we
didn't have any evidence at all as to what the amount in
controversy was so we didn't allege it in our petition.
And when that was removed without anything other than an
allegation that it was worth 8.2 million, we couldn't do
anything other than say how do we know?  Where's your
evidence?  We have nothing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But there's a peculiar --
this State doesn't require the complaint to state the
amount in controversy.  But if you were bringing this
case in the Federal court in the first instance would
you have said as plaintiff, the damages that we seek are
under 5,000 -- 500,000?
MR. SHARP:  In -- if I had been in -- in
the -- in the know at the time this case was filed, I
would have alleged what the amount of damages were.  I
also may have alleged the case in a completely different
way than I did.  But I didn't have that evidence.  So
consequently, when the removal was made without any
evidence at all from which we could determine what the
amount in controversy really was, we said let's remand
this case because you haven't come up with the actual
evidence.
They should have waited and presented all of
the damage evidence and waited for another paper, like
most of the -- other defendants do, but they didn't.
They wanted to jump the gun and get it into Federal
court and they didn't come with their evidence like they
were supposed to.  The JVCA is not governed by --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If there's only one
circuit then, I mean, that is so antithetical with the
whole notion of the Federal rules that you don't plead
evidence.  Plain statement doesn't include evidence and
it is quite an extreme interpretation and counter to the
whole thrust of the Federal rules, which you make a
plain statement and then the evidence comes later.
MR. SHARP:  Well, the -- the way I read the
JVCA in 1446(a) is that the grounds must be just plainly
stated, just like a regular pleading.  The grounds are
diversity.  The grounds are a Federal question.  And
then (c)(2) specifically addresses the amount in
controversy.  (A) does not say anything about the amount
in controversy.  (C) and (c)(2) addresses the amount in
controversy.  And (c)(2)
says --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I just have never -- I'm
a little hard-pressed to understand why the district
court would be without power to decide this question.
They came in with evidence afterwards.  Why couldn't you
have come in with evidence and the district court decide
which one is right?
MR. SHARP:  Certainly, that could have been
done if they had gotten over the procedural hurdle to
begin with.  The Tenth Circuit rule is pretty simple and
it also follows the JVCA, which basically says if you
want to jump the gun into Federal court and you're not
going to wait on the plaintiff to virtually admit their
way into Federal court, then you're going to have to put
on some evidence.  In the Tenth Circuit, they require
prima facie evidence.  If plaintiff looks at that prima
facie evidence and does nothing, under Wilson, you're
in.  There's nothing more that need be done.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I don't see where you
get that.  You know, you say (c)(2), which is the
preponderance standard, but that's just a standard that
the court is going to use to make the determination
about whether to be in Federal court or not.
But it seems to me that the statute is best
read -- is really only read to comport as Justice
Ginsburg said, with the rest of the Federal rules.  It's
notice pleading, then the original plaintiff has a
choice.  The original plaintiff can contest the -- the
removal and present evidence and in that case, the
defendant comes back with evidence and the defendant
bears the burden of proof and the court makes its
decision on the basis of that two sets of evidence.
But why one should think of the original
notice as needing to contain evidence is just -- I guess
I don't understand where that comes from.
MR. SHARP:  Well, the reason for that, I
think, is that the original notice is not a pleading.
It is not like plaintiff originating the case in Federal
court.  It's not a pleading.  It's actually a motion.
And as with most motions, you generally have to submit
your evidence, you have to prove a motion, and you
usually have to submit your evidence with the motion.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But this is -- this is a
provision for removal.  It tracks the language of Rule
8(a).  And so you're asking for -- oh, even though it
copies Rule 8(a), which certainly doesn't require that
you plead evidence, we do have to do it for notice of
removal.
MR. SHARP:  You have to for the notice of
removal because (c)(2) does a couple of things.  (C)(2)
says if plaintiff alleges something less than the amount
in controversy, that's golden and conclusive.  It
doesn't matter that defendant thinks it's different or
that it's higher and would meet the Federal
jurisdictional amount.  It's done.
But under (c)(2)(a), if there's a silent
petition in the State court, defendant can jump the gun
and say, you know what, I want to allege.  I want to say
how much I think is at issue.  You can allege that under
(a).  But that's not conclusive.  There's nothing in
(c)(2)(a) that says what defendant says is conclusive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If -- if the plaintiff
wanted to challenge that, I could understand your
position and then you would have the respective parties
putting in their evidence.
But if the defendant makes an allegation
amount in controversy is met and the plaintiff doesn't
say no, doesn't say that we don't have the amount in
controversy.
MR. SHARP:  Justice Ginsburg, in this case
as in most class actions, plaintiffs have no evidence
that they could possibly put on.  They couldn't dispute
anything that the defendant actually said.  But this
particular issue as to when the -- when the evidence
must be presented, the reason it's done with the notice
of removal is so that the evidence is out there for the
court to make a sua sponte decision if the court wants
to or plaintiff to make --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But when you bring a
class action, you're looking for big bucks and the
likelihood that it's going to be controverted, that the
plaintiff who's brought a class action in the State
court is going to say, oh, no, we can't -- we can't make
the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to
me.  Most class action plaintiffs are not going to
contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000.
MR. SHARP:  Well, in this particular case,
this case really isn't worth $5 million.  So there was
nothing -- no way, though, at that point for us to
contest one way or another.  If the plaintiff is going
to make any kind of a contest, there has to be some
presentation of evidence to begin with.  There's not
going to be anything other than a plaintiff saying if --
if the simple allegation is, well, it's worth more than
$5 million, plaintiff has nothing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, I don't follow that
because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the
plaintiff's damages are.
MR. SHARP:  Plaintiff in a class action
generally does not have the evidence of how many class
members there are or how much they've been damaged.
It's the defendant that deals with all of the class
members on a class-wide or company-wide basis.  The
plaintiff generally does not have that information
available, defendant does, and it usually has to be
determined through a discovery process which usually
occurs in State court, at which point the defendant
sends a request for admissions or ask at a deposition.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  In -- in the -- let's
take a case in the Federal court, a class action case.
Plaintiffs don't state what the amount in controversy
is?
MR. SHARP:  If they know what the amount in
controversy is, they could state what the amount of
controversy is.  But they generally do not.  I certainly
did not in this particular case.  And in most class
actions that get filed that I'm aware of, plaintiff
doesn't know what their damages are before they filed
the suit.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you would say that
all that the plaintiff would say is we meet the amount
in controversy?
MR. SHARP:  They could say the amount in
controversy is 5 million or it's 7 million or whatever
it may be.  Whether that has any validity at all after
this Court's ruling in Knowles v. Standard Fire, I don't
know.  It's clear that you can't allege something lower
to try to stay under the limit.  I don't know whether
you can say something over.  I'm not sure that you have
the authority to bind the class until you're already a
class representative, have already been appointed as
class counsel.
Nonetheless, these particular cases end up
in which the defendant has the evidence, plaintiff does
not, and this particular case and this particular
statute shows that that evidence has to come in at the
time of removal.  If it doesn't come in at the time of
removal, their suggestion is it comes in at the time of
remand.  If that were the case, you would find this
evidentiary requirement in the text under 1447 where the
remand rules are found, not in the removal of 1446.  You
wouldn't find it at all there.  You'd find it --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.  I just -- you
said if it doesn't come in at the time of removal, it
comes in at the time of remand.  But there's an
alternate position, which is the notice of removal is
just the allegation, if the plaintiff wants to contest
that, the plaintiff can contest that, and then the
defendant has to come forward with something because the
defendant has the burden of proof.
Likewise, if the court thinks that the
allegation is not appropriate, the court can sua sponte
say, you know, you have to show me more because I'm not
sure I have jurisdiction over this.
But either way, it all happens in the
Federal court after the notice of removal, which is
merely an allegation, is filed.  And that makes perfect
sense.  It means that most allegations will just be
accepted as is and the only ones that everybody will
have to come forward with evidence are when there's some
reason to contest it, when either the plaintiff or the
court has some serious doubt about it.
MR. SHARP:  Well, plaintiff usually has
absolutely no idea what the allegation may be.  For
instance, when they came forward and said the amount of
damages is 8.2 million, we had no way to contest that
with any evidence of any kind.
Now, if all we had to do to contest it was
say, we contest it, we don't think it's worth $8.2
million, prove it, every plaintiff would say:  Show me
your hand; you've got to show your cards.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Not necessarily.  I mean,
it's the same as a complaint.  They allege paragraph 1,
paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and the defendant comes in and
says admitted, denied; admitted, denied; not enough
information.  All right.  So you do the same thing.
What's the problem?
MR. SHARP:  It -- it could be -- if 1446 was
written such that 1446(a) was the end of it and there
was no further part of the statute, then all they would
have to do is make an allegation and that would be the
end of it.  And under 1447 --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They have to allege the
facts.  They have to allege facts.  They have to say the
allegation is and so forth.  And you say they're not.
MR. SHARP:  Yeah.  And that was part of the
district court's opinion.  There were two parts.  One
was that there wasn't any evidence; and the second part
was that it was conclusory, that there were no facts.
All you said was 8.2 million.  And so both of those were
possible --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't that a fact?
MR. SHARP:  Excuse me, Your Honor?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't 8.2 million a fact?
MR. SHARP:  It's a conclusory fact.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, it's a fact.  They
said in their view --
MR. SHARP:  It's a conclusion.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  I don't know
what a conclusory fact is as opposed to a regular fact.
That seems like a lot of money to me, but I --
MR. SHARP:  I would agree with Your Honor.
And it sometimes is difficult, but I think we deal with
those a lot now that Twombly has been adopted by this
Court.  Conclusory -- conclusions are not sufficient in
terms of pleading for the plaintiff.  And if this
particular Court were going to find that evidence is not
required under 1446, we urge the Court to at least say
go -- go the distance and -- and treat the 1446
allegation like a Twombly allegation and conclusory
would not be sufficient.
That's what the district court found, both that you
should have put on some evidence, if you had it you
should have put it on; and secondly, that what you did
say was conclusory.
But let me -- let me draw back to this --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Where -- where was that
said about conclusory?  I thought that the district
court's position was, sorry, you're too late; I won't
entertain anything about 8.2 million or whatever it was.
MR. SHARP:  The district court did both,
Your Honor.  You are exactly correct.  It said:  I see
you've got some evidence, but you didn't put it on when
you were supposed to; and secondly, she said the 8.2 was
not sufficient by itself because it was conclusory.
That's consistent with Tenth Circuit law and I think she
followed the Tenth Circuit law.
What the Tenth Circuit ultimately decided I
have absolutely no idea.  They simply denied it.  We
don't know whether they denied it for constitutional
grounds, whether they denied it because their docket was
too busy, they denied it because they didn't think this
was a clean vehicle to -- to change their Tenth Circuit
rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, one thing we
know is that they denied it upon careful consideration
of the parties' submissions as well as the applicable
law.  Was there anything in the parties' submissions
other than the question on which we granted cert?
MR. SHARP:  The -- no, I don't think so,
Your Honor.  I think the issues that were provided to
the court there in the Tenth Circuit were very similar
to what you see here in this Court, with the exception
of whether this Court has jurisdiction under either
1447(d) or, as this Court has suggested, maybe under
Hohn; and under Hohn, then, that this Court would have
some type of review of whether that was an abuse of
discretion to simply say, denied.
But no one has come to this Court and said,
we want certiorari granted on -- what should be the
factors, what should the Court decide, when it says
we're not going to take that appeal under 1453.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do I remember it wrong
in -- in thinking that in your briefing you didn't raise
this question?  You just argued what the notice of
removal must contain and it wasn't until there was one
green brief Public Citizen that brought up this
question.  So you were content until a friend of the
court made the suggestion to argue this case on the
merits.
MR. SHARP:  Your Honor, I'm comfortable and
have argued this case on the merits as -- as you know,
but nonetheless, I think I'm duty bound, as all the
parties are, to determine whether this Court has
jurisdiction and what the extent of that jurisdiction
is.  You are correct that the amicus first raised the
issue of jurisdiction.  In the reply brief, they had the
opportunity to say what they thought was the
jurisdictional issue which they believed was under
Nixon.  I don't believe Nixon or Hohn, either one of
those cases, govern here because neither of those cases
are remand cases.  I think 1447(d) controls on the
remand side only because of the limited exception, not
because of the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Briefly, the Court has
jurisdiction of cases in the court of appeals.
MR. SHARP:  Certainly, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, when in
fact a party appeals a district court's remand, he files
that appeal paper in the court of appeals.  The case is
there.  Before they decide it, we could take it.  After
they decide it, and if they affirm it, or if they decide
to hear it, we could take it.  It's there.
But suppose they say no.  Does that remove
it from the court of appeals?  If the answer to that
question, which is your position that you're arguing, is
now this Court can't take it, then it can't take
anything.  It can't take the same things down in the --
in the habeas cases.  It can't take the attorney's fees
things.  It can't take anything, I would guess because
it would say where a court has discretion and says, no,
we are not taking it, it's not reviewable in this Court
because it's no longer in the court of appeals.
Now, what's -- is that your position?  You
can see I don't think it's a very good position from my
tone of voice.  But if there's something else, maybe
there's a better one.
MR. SHARP:  Well, then I won't take that
position, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, no, you -- I mean,
I'm often wrong in these things.
MR. SHARP:  But the position I would take is
that there is a clear distinction in 1447(d) that
addresses remand and has nothing to do with Hohn or
Miller L or Nixon.  And so this Court was not wrong in
Miller L or Hohn or Nixon because, of course, those
cases, as the Court points out, were in fact in.
But so was Gravitt and so was Kircher.
Those cases were in fact in the court of appeals when
the Court granted certiorari.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Maybe you answered this
before, but is it your position that under the Class
Action Fairness Act the court of appeals has absolute
discretion, unlimited discretion, to decide whether to
take an appeal or not?
MR. SHARP:  I believe that's correct, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Any reason whatsoever is
okay?
MR. SHARP:  Any reason whatsoever is okay,
as long as -- I would guess, as I think Justice Scalia
pointed out, as long as it's not a constitutional
violation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So what if the court of
appeals says, we are not taking this because we just
don't like the Class Action Fairness Act.  We think it's
bad public policy; we are never going to take one of
these.  That's okay?
MR. SHARP:  I don't know if that would be a
constitutional violation, Your Honor.  I think if it's
not a constitutional violation, I think it probably
would be okay.  But if it is a constitutional violation,
it probably would not, and I think that's a question
that I'm ill prepared to answer.
But I do think that there is that discretion
and that discretion is -- is relatively absolute.  It's
not completely absolute because the Tenth Circuit is
bound to honor the Constitution before it does any of
the congressional issues.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I was going say -- and this
is not certainly true of the Tenth Circuit -- but
suppose things change and we get to the point where each
judge on the Tenth Circuit is sitting on ten cases a
year, and so they can have a ten- month vacation.  And
they say, well, we don't want to take this, because, you
know, we may not have a ten-month vacation, we'll have a
nine-month vacation.  Would that be all right?
MR. SHARP:  Again, I think it -- it's that
line of what -- when the judge is doing his job, when he
is not doing his job, and whether there's a
constitutional violation.  But that's the necessary evil
with respect to discretion in an -- in an appeal.  You
have that discretion and that discretion is fairly
absolute.  There are no -- in 1453 there's no --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, all the Class Action
Fairness Act says is, I believe, is that the court may
take the case.  It doesn't -- it doesn't specify the
scope of discretion.  It doesn't say it's absolute.
MR. SHARP:  It doesn't, Your Honor.  You are
absolutely correct.  It doesn't provide any parameters
whatsoever as to whether that is an absolute discretion
or how that discretion is to be exercised.  And so
consequently, the circuit courts have no -- they have no
direction from Congress and at this point no direction
from this Court as to how much discretion they have
under 1453 when they deny that particular appeal, and
whether this Court then has anything from which it can
say, well, I've seen why you denied it and we would like
to review that.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Outside of the Class Action
Fairness Act, may a district court -- is a court of
appeals barred from reviewing a decision of the district
court to remand the case based on docket control?
MR. SHARP:  Not under Thermtron as it exists
at this point, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Can we infer anything from
that as to whether Congress thought that that would be a
proper reason under the Class Action Fairness Act?
MR. SHARP:  Your Honor, I see my time is up.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You can't escape
that easily.
MR. SHARP:  Thank you, Your Honor.
I think that indicates that it's not
absolute.  I know that this Court has suggested perhaps
Thermtron needs to be revisited, but nonetheless
Thermtron is the law of the land as we stand today,
which indicates it's not absolute and that discretion
probably is not absolute, but how to review that without
something more is not clear.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. SHARP:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Berreth, you
have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NOWELL D. BERRETH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BERRETH:  It's -- it's simply improper
to allow courts of appeals to insulate their decisions
from review by not giving reasons for -- for their
decisions.  If -- if Congress wants to prevent this
Court from exercising its power to review decisions,
Congress can.  It knows how to do it.  It did it in
AEDPA, as I mentioned before.  And it didn't do it here.
Instead, through 1453 Congress enacted a statute that is
a grant of jurisdiction to this Court.
It's one of the unusual -- the rare
instances where Congress granted jurisdiction over
remand issues.  And the Forsyth case answers a lot of
questions in this case.  It provides that the power of
this Court, the certiorari power of this Court, after
the Court has jurisdiction of a case, which it does
here, the certiorari power of this Court may be
exercised before or after any decision by that Court and
irrespective of any ruling or determination therein,
irrespective of any determination or ruling therein.
This Court's power is comprehensive and it
should result in a reversal in this case.
If there are not any more questions, thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
