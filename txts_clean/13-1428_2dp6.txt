CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next this morning in Case 13-1428, Davis v. Ayala.
Ms. Urbanski.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. URBANSKI:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
The California Supreme Court's harmlessness
determination was an adjudication on the merits because
it denied relief on the basis of the intrinsic rights
and wrongs of Mr. Ayala's claim.
A Federal habeas court is authorized to set
aside that final State judgment only if Ayala can show
two things.  First, a legal error as a matter of this
Court's clearly established laws; and second, actual
prejudice under Brecht.
As to the first point, the Ninth Circuit
took the view here that there was no adjudication on the
merits, and it proceeded to review the entirety of Mr.
Ayala's claim under the de novo --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, your -- your
brief confused me, and it took me a while to pull it
apart.  All right.
I don't know that there's a dispute -- or at
least there's a dispute in the application.  But really,
the deference here was given to the harmless error
finding or purported to have been given.  So there's
no -- there's no dispute that the court below committed
an error, meaning that the court below didn't apply the
right standards, a factual question.  The issue, I
think, that you're trying to arrive at is under the
circumstances of this case, that the Court also reached
the performance prod of Strickland, and that's really
where the dispute is, isn't it?
MS. URBANSKI:  Well, the issue before the
court was a Batson issue.  It was whether the procedures
employed by the trial court had in fact -- were the
proper procedures in terms of excluding defense counsel.
And the Ninth Circuit in this case took the view that
there was no adjudication on the merits with respect to
the State court's finding of harmlessness.  And it
proceeded to review the legal claim de novo.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Urbanski, let's say that
they -- that the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect.
Let's say that there is an adjudication on the merits
here.  All right?  But I think that that doesn't solve
the basic problem of this case.  There's an adjudication
on the merits, but there are these two prongs; there's
the harmlessness prong, and then there's the substantive
violation prong, whether a Batson violation occurred.
And what the court here said was if a Batson violation
occurred, it doesn't matter.  It would be harmless.
So if you -- for whatever reason, right or
wrong -- if you take that harmlessness determination out
of the picture, if you say that that was an unreasonable
application of law, all right, we're left with
essentially a vacuum; right?
And so what happens?  What does the court do
where there's been no finding as to a Bat -- Batson
violation?  And you're saying that it should kind of
make up a reason why there might not have been a Batson
violation and -- and go with that.  And why is that the
proper approach?
MS. URBANSKI:  Your Honor, the reason why
that is a proper approach is because on Federal habeas
corpus, what the Federal court is doing is deferring to
the State -- the final State court judgment of
conviction.  Even in the case that Your Honor has
presented, the State court has ultimately denied relief.
It simply did so on harmless error grounds.  Had the
State court done precisely the same thing as a matter of
a silent denial, that decision would have been entitled
to deference.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why is -- why is the
harmless error thing out of -- out of the picture?  I --
I don't really understand that.  I mean, if in fact the
State court found that whatever error there was, if
there was any, was harmless and if that's a merits
determination, why do we even have to get to the point
of whether there was a violation?
MS. URBANSKI:  The problem, Your Honor --
that is correct.  But the problem, Your Honor, is it
leaves us with what the Ninth Circuit did here, which
was to look at the underlying constitutional issue from
a de novo perspective.  That is not the proper start for
--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm saying you don't have
to look at the underlying constitutional issue.  Once
there's been a determination that it's harmless --
whether there was a violation or not.  If there was one,
it was harmless.  Once there's been that determination,
why do you have to investigate whether there was one or
not?
MS. URBANSKI:  And that's correct, Your
Honor.  The harmlessness determination would resolve the
claim.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you only do if the
harmlessness determination is an unreasonable
application under AEDPA.  So if that is an unreasonable
application, you face the quandary of what you do with
respect to the substantive violation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It obviously doesn't arise
if the harmlessness determination is perfectly fine.
MS. URBANSKI:  Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And -- and don't you
contend that it was fine?
MS. URBANSKI:  Yes.  Certainly in this case,
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that ought to be the end
of the case as far as you're concerned, right?
MS. URBANSKI:  In this case that isn't an
issue.  However, in the case where the State court has
left unresolved the issue of the underlying
constitutional error, we still do have the problem for
future cases of how are we going to review that aspect
of the claim.  The Ninth Circuit took the approach here
that the proper standard --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We review judgments.  We
don't review legal issues.  I mean, you'd like us to
answer that question even though it's unnecessary to
this case, right?
MS. URBANSKI:  Well -- and I don't disagree
with Your Honor that if the finding of harmlessness is
a -- is a reasonable application of the Chapman standard
in this case, then that certainly is the end of the
inquiry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- if we were to find
that it wasn't a reasonable finding, then we would have
to reach the first issue .
MS. URBANSKI:  That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So assume that it was
unreasonable.  Let's go back to the first issue.  Yes,
in Williams and Harrington, we have said that if there
are multiple claims and the State court just says
everything's denied, you assume that means Federal and
State.  If the State claim is the same as the Federal
claim, we say, they -- they -- they -- we assume they
meant the Federal claim as well.  But this is sort of an
interesting case because the -- they said there was
constitutional error under State law, but they
studiously avoided Federal saying there was one or not
under Federal law.  And they dismissed the Federal claim
just on the harmlessness prong.
And what the Ninth Circuit said, as I
understand, they didn't reach it.  Constitutional
avoidance made them decide that it was easier for them
to just say there was State error.
Why do we reach a different conclusion?
MS. URBANSKI:  That's correct, Your Honor.
The State court here did not resolve the underlying
constitutional aspect of the claim.  And it proceeded to
under -- to resolve the claim based on the harmless
error grounds alone.  That is an adjudication on the
merits.  What the Ninth Circuit could not do is
precisely what it did in this case, which was out the
gate look to the underlying constitutional issue and
simply resolve that based on what it would have done on
the issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Why not?  If
the State court didn't reach the Federal constitutional
error, you're asking us to assume it did when you've
admitted it didn't?
MS. URBANSKI:  No.  I'm not asking the Court
to assume that it did.  What I'm saying is that on
Federal habeas corpus, the deference that is owed is to
the final State court judgment.  And in this case, the
final State court judgment was a denial of relief.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, suppose -- I mean,
that's a very broad kind of rationale.  It would apply
even if the State court said that there was a violation;
right?  Then you would -- there's a violation, but no
worries, it's harmless.  And then you decide that the
harmlessness issue is -- is out because that's an
unreasonable application.  And then you're going to have
a reviewing court say, notwithstanding, that the State
court found that there was a violation, we think that
there's a credible argument that there wasn't such that
we can support the judgment.  Is that what you're
asking?
MS. URBANSKI:  And that is correct.  That is
how the scenario would play out, Your Honor.  And I
recognize that that is a more --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a little bit
counterintuitive.
MS. URBANSKI:  A little more challenging
case for sure.  However, again, what a Federal court is
deferring to is the finality of the State court's
judgment.  And on Federal habeas, the question is
whether the habeas can -- petitioner can meet his very
high burden of showing both clear error under this
Court's precedence and actual prejudice under Brecht.
And that does not depend on what the State court may
have thought about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why do we bother
saying in Williams that there are circumstances -- I
happen to think this one of them -- where -- and you do,
too -- where a State court hasn't reached an issue, that
we don't give it deference.  Under your judgment, we
made a mistake when we said that in Williams.
MS. URBANSKI:  No, your Honor, because
the -- what this Court also said in Richter is that you
look to the -- the decision of the claim as a whole.
You do not parse it into its components.
And here the decision on the claim as a
whole was that no relief was warranted because any error
did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation
such that the Defendant suffered sufficient harm to
grant relief.
So that is the decision that the -- that
resolves the claim, and that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why do we apply AEDPA at
all?  Meaning -- I think we've said repeatedly that
Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the --
the AEDPA standard.  So why are we applying it at all?
MS. URBANSKI:  Your Honor, if -- if the
Court were to proceed directly to the question of
prejudice, then yes, Brecht would be the standard that
applies.
However, before you even get to that
question, the Court should look to what the State court
did here first and determine whether that was
reasonable.  If it was unreasonable or if there was no
adjudication on the merits to begin with, then you reach
the second question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, you've -- you've
already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the
State court says there was a Federal violation but no
harmlessness and we say, "Yes, there was harm."
MS. URBANSKI:  No, your Honor.  I don't
think there's an illogic.  I actually think that the
rule is all the more logical when you look to the facts,
if there is a decision denying relief, and that is the
decision that is owed deference under AEDPA standard and
that is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't give it
deference that there was a Federal error.  We don't say
it was a reasonable mistake but they found error and we
accept the error.
MS. URBANSKI:  Correct, Your Honor, because
the -- what the State court may have thought about the
underlying issue on de novo review is not controlling
for purposes of AEDPA.  That is a different standard.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, would that -- would
that also apply -- I'm just sort of trying to figure out
the reach of this claim.
Just take a case where there was no
harmlessness determination.  There was just a single
decision about a Batson claim, but it was an egregious
decision.  It was, Hispanics aren't entitled to make
Batson claims, something like that, egregiously wrong.
But I guess under your theory, we just look
to the judgment and then we decide, there is a credible
way in which to say that this Batson claim was not a
good one and that we should defer to that; is that
right?
MS. URBANSKI:  That's correct, Your Honor.
If there is a denial of relief, then that is all the
Federal habeas court needs to look to and then look
backwards and ask whether there was a reasonable basis
to support it, and that follows directly from this
Court's decisions in Richter and Williams.
There is no principled way to distinguish
between where a State court does precisely that in
silence and where the State court does it with a
reasoned decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We didn't do that in
Wiggins, Rompilla, or Porter, did we?
MS. URBANSKI:  No, your Honor.  Those are --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we would have to
overturn those cases to accept your proposition.
MS. URBANSKI:  The results in the cases
would not have to be overturned.  However, to be sure,
this Court did apply a de novo standard of review to one
prong of a multiprong claim where the State court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That the State had not
addressed?
MS. URBANSKI:  Where the State court had
left it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Identical to this case.
The State had not addressed one prong, and we said
de novo review.
MS. URBANSKI:  Correct, Your Honor.  And
those decisions, I would agree, cannot be reconciled
with this Court's later decisions in Richter and in Tara
Williams, which precisely addressed the issue of, what
do we do when the State court says nothing at all?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We added the question,
whether or not -- and the Court of Appeals properly
applied the standards set forth in -- in Brecht.
Do you want to address that briefly?  And
I -- if we get into the details of this case, it seems
to me that the key person is Olanders.
MS. URBANSKI:  Yes, Your Honor.  First of
all, with respect to the -- did the Court have a -- a
particular question about Olanders D.?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I want you to -- to
discuss that -- this argument.
MS. URBANSKI:  Yes, Your Honor.  Well, first
of all, with respect to the standard that is to be
applied in this case, the -- this Court did make clear
that it is the actual prejudice standard of Brecht that
is to apply in virtually all 2254 cases, and that is to
be the case regardless of whether the State court
conducted a Chapman analysis.
What the Ninth Circuit did here was take
this Court's language and say that it could apply the
Brecht standard without regard for the State court's
very careful analysis in this case.
Fry makes clear, though, that in order to
give effect  to AEDPA's purpose in limiting the
availability of this extraordinary remedy and preserving
the finality of State court judgments, the Brecht
standard, properly understood and applied, is to be the
most protective of final State court judgments .  It is
more protective than the AEDPA Chapman standard.  It
subsumes that standard.
So what we were ask -- asking this Court to
clarify in this case with respect to how a Federal
habeas court is to apply the Brecht standard is that in
a case such as this one, where the State court has, in
fact, conducted a Chapman analysis and found an error to
be harmless, then the Federal court has to be able to
fairly say that the State court's Chapman analysis was
unreasonable.
If the Court cannot find the Chapman
analysis objectively unreasonable, then the prejudice
inquiry is at an end.  And in this case, the Ninth
Circuit misapplied the Brecht actual prejudice standard.
The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a bit of a hard
time with the -- this -- assume I accept your
proposition that it's actual prejudice.
In a process claim, generally, we don't talk
about what the outcome was going to be.  We talk about
what the process was and whether there was an
opportunity for you to make arguments you couldn't have
made.  All right?
That's our normal jurisprudence in a due
process claim.  And we basically say you get a do-over
because you weren't permitted to have the process you
were entitled to.  So you're saying we've got to treat
this differently under Brecht; this person wasn't
permitted to be there.  I think there's some very
convincing arguments, potentially, on at least one
juror, Olanders.  There, the comparison was not
speculative.  It was based on the answers provided by
jurors who had both questionnaires and voir dire that
was available.
And the briefs point out -- and so does the
Ninth Circuit, very convincingly -- all the excuses
given by the prosecutor are rebutted by either identical
answers by one juror, Ana L. -- Ana or Ana L., or other
jurors who did exactly the same thing and were permitted
to sit on the jury.
So why are we doing anything different with
this actual prejudice standard?
MS. URBANSKI:  Well, first of all, Your
Honor, anytime counsel is absented from a portion of the
proceedings or anytime a portion of the record winds up
missing, it is often going to be the case that you might
had a very different record had those things been
present.  But the question before this Court on Federal
habeas is whether the California Supreme Court believed
that it had sufficient information before it from which
to meaningfully address the issue on appeal.
And with respect to Olanders D. in this
case, the prosecutor felt that Olanders D.'s answers
were not particularly responsive to the question, to the
questions being presented.  The prosecutor's primary
concern was with Olanders D.'s ability to vote for the
death penalty, and the trial court conducted a
meaningful inquiry with the prosecutor and gave a
firsthand credibility determination.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But don't -- don't --
don't talk to me generally.  Ana L. said more equivocal
things about the death penalty than Olanders D., so did
another juror, and they still went on.
MS. URBANSKI:  Ana L. expressed that she had
changed her mind about the views on the death penalty,
similar to the fact that Olanders D. did.  However, what
Ana L. said was that she hadn't given it a great deal of
thought until being called as a juror.  And once she was
called as a juror to sit on a -- potentially, on a death
penalty case, she now sat down and considered the issue.
And after careful thought and consideration, she
believed that she, in fact, could make that decision if
called upon to do it.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what Olanders D.
said, essentially.
MS. URBANSKI:  To the -- I would disagree
with that, Your Honor.  Olanders D. specifically said on
the death -- on the questionnaire that he did not
believe in the death penalty.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So did she.
MS. URBANSKI:  But now called into voir
dire, Olanders D. could not provide the prosecutor with
a satisfactory explanation for why his views had
changed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He thought -- "I thought
about it and realized I -- I could."
MS. URBANSKI:  The -- the -- Olanders D.'s
response at page 178 of the Joint Appendix, when
specifically asked what caused the change was, "I mean,
examining it more closely, I think -- and becoming more
familiar with the laws and the behavior, I mean, the
change in people, I think."
That is a far -- a significantly different
response than somebody coming in and saying, "This case
caused me to think about it, and now that I have been
forced to think about it, I believe that I can choose
this as the penalty. "
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That -- you see the two
of them substantially different?  One said, "I thought.
I've listened to what the law is.  I've done" -- it's
hard for me to imagine how they're substantively
different.
MS. URBANSKI:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And do you think that
defense counsel wouldn't have been able to point that
out to the judge?
And, you know, there were a lot of people
questioned in this.
How many days of voir dire was there?
MS. URBANSKI:  I believe it was three --
three weeks of voir dire.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Three weeks of voir
dire.  Do you suspect that the judge, or think that the
judge had clearly in mind every set of questions, and
their responses.
MS. URBANSKI:  Well, the California Supreme
Court did credit this judge as being very diligent, very
well-respected --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's clear he was.  I'm
not doubting that.  But my point is simply, do you think
that pointing this out to the judge could not have had a
substantial influence on his decision?  Because all
three prongs, he could have pointed to almost identical
comments by other jurors.
MS. URBANSKI:  I would disagree that the
comments would have been identical.  I think that there
are substantial differences between Olanders D.'s
unconvincing answers and the very convincing answers of
the other jurors.
And in any event, what we look to is what
the trial court, and then subsequently, the California
Supreme Court, had before it at the time that this
decision was made.  The trial court, as the
prosecutor -- while the prosecutor is making these
race-neutral proffers, is -- has the benefit of the
questionnaire responses right in front of him.  The
trial court has all of the information in front of it,
from which it can make a credibility determination based
on this record.
There is no reason to believe that the trial
court was considering anything less, than all of the
information available to it, and there is no reason to
believe that defense counsel would have had any
substantial impact in pointing things out that the trial
court already had before it.
The Ninth Circuit here, in its application
of Brecht, demonstrating that it was not applying that
standard in a manner consistent with this Court's
opinions.  Brecht speaks to actual prejudice.  It does
not speak to the kind of prejudice analysis like the
Ninth Circuit did in this case, which was marred by
speculation and hypothesis, where the court of appeals
is hypothesizing about what a prospective juror might
have been wearing, or whether he was gathering
prospective jurors for a social outing.
The Ninth Circuit used a debatable set of
inferences in this case, to set aside the conclusion of
the State court that a prospective juror's following of
a very controversial trial out of San Diego, where the
very D.A.'s office and police department that were
investigating and trying Mr. Ayala's case, were the
subject of serious misconduct allegations and suggesting
that somehow a prosecutor basing his reasoning on that,
was a pretext for a racial discrimination challenge.
The trial -- the Ninth Circuit gave no
credit to the trial court's firsthand observations in
which the trial court found this prosecutor to be
credible, and this was not a trial court that simply
accepted the prosecutor's reasons at face value.  This
was a trial court that was discerning and critical of
the prosecutor's reasons, and even disagreed with him at
times.
And when you look -- compare what the
California Supreme Court did here, the California
Supreme Court did it right.  It credited the trial
court's firsthand observations.  It looked at the
colloquy between the prosecutor and the trial judge and
found support for each of those individual's assertions
in the record.
The court was confident that the prosecutor
had not exercised challenges based on race in this case.
The State court analyzed the very same --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How can you be
confident?  I mean, the whole purpose of an adversarial
system is so that the other side of an argument is
presented to the judge.  Was he playing defense attorney
too?  Is that -- and defense attorney with the same
purpose?
MS. URBANSKI:  Not literally, no, Your
Honor.  However, certainly the trial court must consider
all of the information before it.  And so it was looking
at the very same things for --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then I -- why don't we
just have a trial ex parte?  Presumably that's what
you're arguing.
MS. URBANSKI:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We should have the
entire trial ex parte, because the judge can do that.
MS. URBANSKI:  No, Your Honor, certainly we
would prefer the counsel --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought  you were arguing
the much narrower point that the absence of counsel for
this one incident was harmless.
MS. URBANSKI:  That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not arguing
for ex parte trials?
MS. URBANSKI:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think so.
MS. URBANSKI:  We certainly don't condone
that approach here, and there is -- we certainly don't
condone that approach here.  The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Anywhere -- anywhere
else?
(Laughter.)
MS. URBANSKI:  No, no.  We would certainly
prefer the defense counsel be present, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess my question is,
the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror -- I'm not
talking about the other things, I'm talking about this
juror -- as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two
situations that were almost identical to the one that
the op -- the prosecutor pointed to with this juror.
Anna L. also said something that was totally
nonresponsive to a question; it was like, "that's
correct," rather than answering the question.
So you can say with complete confidence that
that would never have made a difference to the judge?
If he had had a real adversary able to point all of
these things out, you're confident the judge would not
have made up his mind.  That's what you're saying.
MS. URBANSKI:  Based on the record in this
case and what the trial judge had before him and the
fact that this was a critical trial judge, yes.  I think
the California Supreme Court had an ample record before
it from which to conclude that defense counsel's
presence would not have made a difference in this case,
and I would go back --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, there -- there's a
real problem here, you do understand.  We're only
pointing to the things for which there is a record.
There is another component to this, which is that all
the other questionnaires and the entire transcript
wasn't available.
MS. URBANSKI:  That is true, Your Honor.
And certainly, anytime counsel is absent or anytime a
portion of the record is missing, it will be the case
that it is possible that the record might have been
different.  But what we should look to is what was left
in the record, and what was left was a -- was thousands
of pages of a voir dire transcript.  It was all of the
questionnaires of the seated jurors, which are the most
important ones for purposes of comparative analysis, and
the firsthand observation --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Three weeks, is that
standard?  Three weeks?  Is that standard out there?
MS. URBANSKI:  It's a lengthy voir dire,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good Lord.
(Laughter.)
MS. URBANSKI:  If I may -- can reserve the
remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Dain.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY J. DAIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DAIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Let me start by answering the question that
Justice Scalia, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan
asked when this first began.  And, that is, yes, this
was an adjudication on the merits, based on the
harmlessness determination.  The reason the State wants
to address the first prong in the first instance, is
because it wants to create the fiction that by treating
this holistically, the California Supreme Court actually
found no Federal error, and that is what this Court must
grant deference to.
So let's start with the second question.
The second question is the question at heart:  Was
Brecht applied appropriately?  And we only get to that
in the -- the general context, if there was an
unreasonable determination of Chapman by the State
Supreme Court.  And the Ninth Circuit said, we grant
deference on that point to the California Supreme Court.
I'll address Olanders D., but let me even
show you why this is case closed in an overarching
pretext by the prosecutor, that led to all the harm in
this case.
When the trial court asked the prosecutor to
State his race-neutral reasons, the first words out of
the prosecutor's mar -- mouth, were pretext, active
pretext, using a shield as a sword.
The prosecutor said, and I quote, We can do
that but we will do it in chambers, because they have no
right -- the defense -- to our strategy.  That was
pretext.
The prosecutor was stating on an overarching
level for Olanders D., Galileo S. -- or Galileo,
Barbara S., Gerardo O., and the others, that his primary
reason for challenge was strategy.  And that was
pretext.  The trial court, which the State says we
much -- must give great deference to because it
conducted credibility determinations, didn't question
that.  Defense counsel was primed to question that
because defense counsel responded:  But we have a right
to be present, to hear that statement, in case the
prosecution is misstating the facts.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't -- I don't really
understand what you're saying.  Maybe it was wrong to
have this in camera, but why was the statement that we
don't want to disclose our strategy a statement that --
that challenges that -- that the challenges that I'm
going to make are going to be pretextual?
MR. DAIN:  Because when the prosecution
said, I'll give you my reasons, but I don't want my
adversary -- I don't want my adversary to be present to
test this in the crucible of an adversarial situation,
which is what the Constitution requires.  When he says,
my reasons for challenging these jurors involves
strategy, it's a pretext.  It did not involve strategy.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't understand that.
When you -- when you're trying a case and you're
deciding which jurors to exercise peremptory challenges
against, do you not take into account what your defense
is going to be?  What your defense strategy in the case
is going to be.
MR. DAIN:  You might -- you might, but from
Georgia v. McCollom to -- in this case, the State court
analyzed it under its own State law equivalent.
Strategy is not why you would say I don't like this
person or I don't trust this person, he doesn't dress
right, he doesn't fit in.  The courts have said all of
those are reasons for which the defense counsel can,
should participate and respond.
Strategy involves a much more deep analysis
that is very rare as this Court has said in prior cases.
It's in the rare instance.  It's very rare.  This isn't
a general argument that everything I do is strategy, but
the prosecutor was saying it involves strategy which is
a very rare situation.  And in none of -- as the
California Supreme Court recognized, none of his
statements involved strategy.
So at a minimum, the State says we must
credit and give deference to not only the trial court,
but the California Supreme Court's credibility
determinations.  If, as the California Supreme Court
found, in determining error that it was not credible,
that we -- that strategy was not involved, then a
credibility determination was not made.  And
furthermore, the trial court missed that.  Defense
counsel said, I don't want to be involved in their
strategy, but I want to hear the statement because I
want to be present to tell you it's a misstatement.
Why have we instruct our --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give an example of a
strategy.
MR. DAIN:  The trial strategy might be I'm
calling -- in near cases of this -- might be calling an
informant, and this informant might be living in the
same neighborhood as this person.  I don't want this
person on there.  Trial strategy might be that I'm going
to be calling a witness who dresses in exactly the same
way as that witness and again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  As that juror.
MR. DAIN:  As a juror.  I'm sorry.  There
could be very deep levels of that.  But the California
Supreme Court astutely recognized that was not the case.
More importantly, it specifically, in opposition to
Chief Justice George in dissent, said that the
strategy -- that -- that the lack of strategy was error.
What it didn't recognize -- and this is why there was an
unreasonable application of Chapman.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me give you an
example.  Let's say your defense strategy is going to be
that the police officers planted incriminating evidence.
All right?  And if that's going to be your defense
strategy, will you not be particularly diligent in
exercising your peremptory challenges to try to get rid
of anybody who seems to have sympathy or an
identification with the police.  That's a strategy.
It's not pretextual.
MR. DAIN:  Two --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, there may not have been
that here.  The prosecutor may not have had a strategy
like that.  I -- but I just don't understand this
argument that you're making, that merely stating I don't
want to disclose to my adversary what my trial strategy
will be is a confession that I am going to exercise
peremptory challenges pretextually, and I just don't
want defense counsel there to call me on it.
MR. DAIN:  Well, let me take that from the
beginning.  The answer to your question is, no, that's
not a trial strategy in the context of the cases.
Everything's a strategy.  How -- you could argue
strategy is what order I'm going to call the witnesses
in.
The reason it's not a strategy, and
certainly not a reason for an ex parte communication, is
defense counsel would already know that.  The witness
would have been listed; discovery would have been given.
That would have been in the police reports.  So let --
I -- I want to be careful we don't confuse just the
general strategy every attorney has in approaching a
case with what --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Prosecutor doesn't have
to say, it's because of planting of police, the pros --
of planting of evidence is going to be at issue.  He
could just say, I don't like people who distrust the
police.
MR. DAIN:  He absolutely could, and that
could be heard by the defendant.  It is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Actually, it's said
quite often.
MR. DAIN:  It is a strategy, but that's not
the trial strategy we're talking about that in the rare
instance, as this Court has said, would require an ex
parte communication.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Could you at the
other side -- I understand the idea that you're saying
that just, you know, basically you'd like jurors who are
going to be sympathetic with your case.  You say that's
not a strategy, but what's the -- what is a strategy?
An example of that?
MR. DAIN:  No.  And again, that's why I'm
saying trial strategy isn't in the broad sense.  Trial
strategy is something that really is truly confidential.
Like, I have -- you could say in a domestic violence
case, I have a witness that is afraid to testify but may
have some connection or knowledge that pay -- that
person may know the witness.  I need to tell the judge
that in camera and say, I can't take that risk.  It
could be a gang case where you have informants.  It's a
rare situation is what they're talking about.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, even -- even if the
strategy was an overblown statement by the prosecutor.
Suppose that in this case defense counsel is absent, but
what the juror says is clearly grounds for the
prosecutor to -- excuse me, the juror says I've thought
about this.  I can't -- I don't believe in the death
penalty supposedly.  That's the hypothetical.  That's
not this case.
MR. DAIN:  Of course.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then we still look to see
whether or not there was harmless error.
MR. DAIN:  And I'm going to get to that.
Absolutely.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And it's true that the
harmless error in this case loops back in your -- your
concern that there was not full cross-exam.  So they
come together a bit.  But it does -- it does seem to me
that this district judge exercised care in listening to
the answer.  And we are required -- the Federal courts
are required under Brecht to give very substantial
deference to that finding.  So if you could address
that.
MR. DAIN:  And that's what -- what I'm going
to say in addressing that.  You do start with the
premise that, as the California Supreme Court said,
there was no strategy.  So -- so that's the pretext I'm
talking about.  If you start with that, that was missed
by the trial court and only discussed in terms of error
by the California Supreme Court, the California Supreme
Court should have said in its harmless error analysis, I
start with the reason defense counsel was excluded was
pretextual whether -- or was false.  Was false.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That goes to whether there
was a violation --
MR. DAIN:  No.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- not to whether the
violation was harmless or not.
MR. DAIN:  I disagree.  And let me -- and
let me state why.
The fact that you're assessing, as the State
says, the credibility of the prosecution's reasons, if
the prosecution starts with the reason that is false,
saying, I don't even want my adversary in the room.  And
he didn't say it like, Your Honor, I have concerns.  Can
I discuss them?  He said, we'll do it, but not in their
presence.
The State caused the removal of defense
counsel, and if we just take Olanders -- Olanders D.
Anna L. not only had questions, she responded to
virtually identical, she actually said she would be a
holdout.  She made a statement if the other jurors voted
for death, I might not.  In fact, I think she said I
would not.  Olanders D. --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But the problem with
that -- I mean, you're looking at -- and we have said
this often in Batson type cases.  You're looking at a
cold transcript.  You don't know what the difference in
intonation was.  You don't know if Olanders is saying,
yeah, you know, I thought about it, and blah, blah,
blah, blah.  And the other one is saying, I thought
about it -- about this trial, and now -- I mean, you
know, we don't know that.
MR. DAIN:  But that serves our purpose.
That serves our purpose because what we didn't have is
the adversarial crucible.  We didn't have defense
counsel saying exactly what you said, well, wait a
minute --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose the defense
counsel were present and the -- a transcript said
exactly what it says here.  Defense counsel made no
objection.  It seems to me that that's how you have to
analyze this case because we're -- we're assuming no
error.
MR. DAIN:  The -- what you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, I -- I understand
that it would have been a much better record if the
counsel were there.  That's the reason why there's a
likely error here under a matter of law, but we're
talking about the harmlessness, the -- the deference that
must be given to the State judge.
MR. DAIN:  Absolutely.  And the deference
under Brecht, and I would even say under Richter,
requires a fair and balanced playing field.  At least
you have to start every case from Feltner -- every case
that has addressed Batson has had a level playing field.
All the participants have contributed, and there was a
complete record.
But the reason I'm saying this is prejudice
is it was the State that actively corrupted the record.
The State excluded the defendant.  So now the State
turns around and says, well, you're speculating.  It
caused the need to speculate.  And what I'm saying is if
the California Supreme Court had taken into account in
its prejudice analysis that it was the State, through a
pretext, that excluded the defendant, we wouldn't have
to speculate.  We wouldn't have what -- what is a
corrupt record.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we're speculating
the judge would not -- that defense attorney remained
silent or that defense attorney --
MR. DAIN:  No.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Either way.  We would be
speculating if defense attorney remained silent, or we'd
be speculating that the judge would have ruled the same
way. The question is on this record.
MR. DAIN:  Had he ruled the same way -- had
defense counsel participated and he ruled the same way,
we would have a Batson challenge in substance, not, as
Your Honor has recognized, a procedural issue.  At that
point, all this Court has said, all we can do is say
would it have likely changed the outcome, we can't
speculate either way.  But the problem is it's the State
that caused that and that's the prejudice.  The State
caused the inability to have a complete record,
actually, in two ways, it also lost, inadvertently in
that instance, it lost the Miller-El v. Dretke
opportunity through the questionnaires.
But the State actively caused the exclusion
of defendant, it caused the inability to have a complete
record, and that's different from merely saying that
there was an ex parte proceeding but we followed it
up --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I'll go back and
look at this.  I did not think that this was really the
basis for the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Olanders'
testimony showed that he was improperly excused, I just
don't see --
MR. DAIN:  Or it's -- I can give you that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, it's a long
opinion but Page 678 talks about Olanders just in the
term that we're talking about.
MR. DAIN:  It said -- the prosecutor had
said that he was not responsive -- the Ninth Circuit, to
address your question, Justice Kennedy.  The Ninth
Circuit said that in its review of the existing
transcript, he was very responsive.
So there -- there was a disagreement there.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  He meant --
MR. DAIN:  The Court disagreed with the
statement that he wouldn't fit in.  The Court said, I
believe he would fit in with the rest of the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the trial court
said that.
MR. DAIN:  I'm sorry, but the Ninth Circuit
pointed out the trial court said that.  So the reason
Olanders D is so compelling is because the trial court
itself questioned some of the prosecutor's reasons, but
there were others.
For instance, the prosecutor said the
questionnaire indicated he opposed the death penalty.
We actually don't have the questionnaires because
they're gone.  We have to take it at its word that it
did.  Defense counsel again, had the prosecutor not
proactively excluded him, might have said, well, the
questionnaire said A, B, C.  We might have had a
complete record --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's speculation.
What the Ninth Circuit did with Olanders B is point to
the actual existing record --
MR. DAIN:  Understood.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and show that there
were contradictions to -- in the record as it existed.
MR. DAIN:  And that's what our argument --
you can even take the existing record and show the
inconsistencies that show Chapman was not appropriately
applied.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Of course it's speculative
that defense counsel, had defense counsel been present,
would have been able to point to the other juror, Anna.
We've had a number of cases where defense counsel was
present at the voir dire, which I think should be the
rule in almost every situation, and only later, years
later on appeal when -- as particularly when you have
many, many jurors questioned, as apparently was the case
here, does somebody realize, well, this juror who was
dismissed, has answers seem to be somewhat similar to
this other juror who -- who wasn't challenged.
MR. DAIN:  And then had that been the facts,
we lose, under AEDPA, we lose.  Because you do have to
give deference under AEDPA to the California Supreme
Court.  I agree.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But what reason is there to
think that defense counsel would have had better recall
of this than the trial judge who was there?
MR. DAIN:  Defense counsel -- first of all,
there were two of them.  First of all, they're more
focused on each of the jurors that were excused.  The
judge had -- as the Ninth Circuit noted, there were 70
questions for each of these questionnaires, they
involved 17 pages.  The judge had to take -- and he may
have had his own notes that he thought were important,
they may have been complete or not incomplete.  A judge
certainly has many more tasks that don't involve just
the direct advocacy, as defense counsel has.  But that's
when I add, it's the prosecution, the State that caused
that.  And then uses its sword to say, well, now you're
speculating.
We can do nothing more.  But with Olanders D
on the existing record, we can show that was wrong.  The
reason I'm saying it was unreasonable is because the
Court should have taken into account in prejudice that
there is a lack of credibility when a prosecutor comes
in and causes all these problems and the State Supreme
Court says, and that wasn't correct.  There was no
strategy involved here.  By the way, they use -- the
Courts use the term "strategy" and "confidential
information."  Those are generally tied.  They're used
where you have informants, they're used where you have
gang activity, very rare circumstances that occurs.
But how -- even if you said under Richter,
how can any reasonable judge or justice disagree that if
the State, through a false basis, excluded defense
counsel, eliminated defense counsel from challenging the
questions and assisting the judge where the judge didn't
recognize that -- that strategy was not involved,
prevented further voir dire which might have corrected
the situation, prevented a proper record and then later
lost all of the ability to do a comparative analysis,
could be harmless, I'm -- and let me even use in the
Brecht standard, this Court has eloquently said that --
and if you'll give me a moment of unprofessionality
while I shuffle my pages -- but this Court has said that
it undermines the very integrity of the court system.
And in McCollom, it actually described that
it -- it may be obvious to the jury, it undermines the
parties' understanding and the Court's ability to -- to
maintain integrity through the entire trial.  So under
Brecht, this error caused injury to the jury verdict.
And, moreover, the questionnaires are lost, even Brecht
can't address that, because they were lost post verdict.
But under any standard, there was an
unreasonable application of Chapman by the State Supreme
Court and it had actual prejudice in this case.  Justice
George in his dissent was correct.  How can anybody
credit this record?  It wasn't accidental.  It wasn't as
though defense counsel were arguing defense counsel was
in -- ineffective.  The State caused this.  And it
didn't cause it through inadvertence, it actively
insisted that it would do this only in chambers, in
camera.
And going back to Cronic and going back to
Wade, this was a critical portion.  Forget ex parte,
there are many times you can do ex parte proceedings if
you make a proper record.  They're all rare, but there
are times you can do them.  But in this instance, in the
critical Batson phase, to exclude the defendants -- I
use pretext -- it's a false statement that the
prosecutor gave that it was strategy.  That's
prejudicial.
It's prejudicial under Brecht, and it's
certainly prejudicial under Richter.  Thank you, Your
Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This doesn't relate to the
issues you've been arguing.  This crime was, what,
30 years ago and the trial 26 years ago?
MR. DAIN:  1996, yeah, very close.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has he spent time in
solitary confinement, and, if so, how much?
MR. DAIN:  He has spent his entire time in
what's called administrative segregation.  When I visit
him, I visit him through glass and wire bars.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a single cell?
MR. DAIN:  It is a single cell.  They're all
single cells.  Well, San Quentin is on the most -- it's
on Heaven's land in Marin County.  It's a 150-year-old
prison and their administrative segregation is single
cells, a very old system, very small, and -- and – you’re
not allowed
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it the same thing as
solitary confinement?
MR. DAIN:  No, it's 23 hours out of the day,
that probably is the same.  They generally --
administrative segregation you're not allowed in the
general yard anymore.  But you are allowed an hour a
day --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One hour.
MR. DAIN:  -- of activity.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MR. DAIN:  Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Four minutes,
Ms. Urbanski.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. URBANSKI:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice:
Just a few brief points.  First of all, with
respect to the prosecutor stating that he believes he
would reveal trial strategy, there is no reason to think
that that was any kind of a pretext for then exercising
peremptory challenges on the basis of race.  The trial
court never found this prosecutor to be anything less
than credible, and that determination is entitled to
great deference in a Federal habeas collateral
proceeding.
With respect to Olanders --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What was the trial strategy
that displayed itself in his strikes?
MS. URBANSKI:  I cannot tell the Court what
it was, but I don't think there is any reason to take
the trial -- the prosecutor at anything less than his
word.  We don't have anything in the record to refute
it.  Certainly that is not what ended up happening, but
it is also not a reason to suggest that this was a
pretext for race.
With respect to Olanders D, this juror gave
responses that were not only not responsive, but they
were responses that would cause any prosecutor to have
doubt about that particular juror serving on a capital
case.  There were clearly grounds for the prosecutor to
have wanted to excuse that juror.
But most importantly, the California Supreme
Court looked at this record and it found support for the
assertions in the record; with respect to Olanders D.,
that appears at Petition Appendix page 203a.
What we have here is the Ninth Circuit
substituting its own view without ever showing how the
State court was objectively unreasonable in its
analysis.  We have a State court here that analyzed the
very same harmlessness question under a much higher
standard, the Chapman standard, and found no harm.  And
to proceed without regard for the State court's very
careful determination in that regard seems antithetical
to the spirit of AEDPA.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the
