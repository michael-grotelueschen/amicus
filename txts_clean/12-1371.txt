CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear

States v. Castleman.
Ms. Sherry.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Section 922(g)(9) was enacted to protect
battered women and children and to close a dangerous
loophole in Federal law that allowed domestic abusers to
possess firearms.
That loophole existed because many domestic
abusers were only convicted of misdemeanor offenses, and
the misdemeanor offenses they were most often convicted
of were assault and battery crimes.
Respondent asks this Court to adopt an
interpretation of 922(g)(9) that would indisputably
exclude the assault and battery laws of almost all of
the 50 States and the District of Columbia.  That would
render the statute a virtual dead letter from the moment
of its enactment until today, and it would leave that
dangerous loophole wide open.
The statutory text does not compel that
implausible result.  To the contrary, this Court
ordinarily presumes that common law terms of art bear
their common law meaning, and here, the common law
meaning of force is a natural fit.
It makes perfect sense to define a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm a little bit
concerned about going to that common law meaning.  Why
don't you go to what the common law meaning of domestic
violence is?  I thought that was your strongest
argument.  Because isn't that different than just
violence?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Oh, it certainly is.  Though
the connotation of the phrase "domestic violence" is
very different than the word -- the word "violence"
standing alone.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Exactly.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And it's certainly
different than "violent" when it's modifying the word
"felony."  Domestic violence describes a broad spectrum
of abusive behavior --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Misdemeanor domestic
violence.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence.  So both the word "misdemeanor" and
the phrase "domestic violence," itâ€™s a broad spectrum of
abusive behavior.  It's characterized by a pattern of
escalating abusive conduct.
It may start with something like emotional
abuse, include isolating the person from friends and
family, include threats of violence, threatening to take
away the kids.  And it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are threats of violence
domestic violence?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  They are, not in this --
not with respect to this particular statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I hope not.  I hope not.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  No, and in this particular
statute, Congress focused on a particular form of
domestic violence.  It's well-accepted within the
community that threats are a form of domestic violence,
but Congress here --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we have to think that
domestic violence is different from violence?  Wouldn't
the simple term "violence," without the "domestic"
adjective cover any physical abuse that causes harm?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It would, but, I mean,
domestic violence -- my point here is that domestic
violence has a different connotation, even if you were
to move away from the phrase "domestic violence," Your
Honor, this statute does talk about misdemeanor crimes
of domestic violence, and that's the term that we are
defining here.
In Johnson, this Court recognized that it
normally does presume that common law terms of art bear
their common law meaning, and if --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If I punch somebody in the
nose, is that violence?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I'm sorry, if you punch
somebody in the nose?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If I punch somebody in the
nose.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Yes, that is violence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So do you have to
have a special rule for if I punch my wife in the nose?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  No, and we're not
arguing --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Any physical action that
hurts somebody is violence, isn't it?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It certainly is, and we
are not arguing for a special rule here.  What we're
saying is that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about pinching or
biting, hair pulling, shoving, grabbing, hitting,
slapping; would those be violence or would they be
domestic violence if you are doing it against a spouse?
Would they in all situations be violence?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  If you are doing it
against a spouse it is domestic violence, but I'm not
sure it is any different.  And the reason that domestic
violence is different is because it is different than
stranger-on-stranger violence.
These are not isolated instances.  This is a
pattern of abusive behavior, and it may start with more
slight injuries.  It may start even without any physical
violence at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't understand
that point.  Are you saying the first episode of
domestic violence wouldn't qualify?  You keep talking
about a pattern of behavior.  I assumed your argument
would be the same if it is the very first incident of
misdemeanor domestic violence.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It -- it certainly would
be the same as long as it fit within the scope of that
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why are you talking
about -- why are you talking about patterns of domestic
violence?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Only to focus on what
Congress was doing here.  Congress recognized what
domestic violence was and it wanted to intervene at an
early stage before the violence escalated and certainly
before it turned deadly, before the offender reached for
a gun.
And the fatal flaw in Respondent's argument
is it doesn't accomplish any of those objectives.
Respondent acknowledges that Congress passed a statute,
and it intended to accomplish something.  It intended to
close the dangerous loophole.
It intended to take guns away from people
who beat and batter their wives.  Respondent cannot
explain --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I have no problem with
the description of what Congress had in mind, reaching
conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor.  But
the -- the words that Congress used has, as an element,
the use of physical force.
Under the Tennessee statute, as I understand
it, you don't have to have physical force.  You have to
cause bodily injury to another, which could be caused by a
means other than physical force.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And our view is that it
cannot be caused by a means other than physical force,
if you understand the definition of physical force at
common law.  At common law, physical force included not
only direct uses of force by the aggressor himself, but
also indirect or subtle uses of force.  So things like
poisoning, for example, were considered to involve the
use of physical force at common law.
Respondent doesn't dispute that
understanding of the common law at page 40 of their brief.
Instead, what they ask this Court to do is to depart
from that common law meaning with respect to the
statute.  The Court normally does presume that common
law terms of art bear their common law meaning, and
there is no basis to depart here.
This case is quite different from Johnson in
that respect.  In Johnson, the Court was defining a very
different term, violent felony, and it concluded that
because misdemeanor -- rather because battery was a
misdemeanor crime both at common law and today, that it
would be a comical misfit to adopt a definition of force
that was used in the context of a misdemeanor and apply
it to a felony offense.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Maybe I am missing
something here, but I thought Justice Ginsburg's
question was not addressed to the Federal statute, but
to the Tennessee statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it's the Federal
statute that uses physical force, right?  What does the
Tennessee statute say?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  The Tennessee statute
talks about causing bodily injury --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Causing bodily injury.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  -- but you cannot cause a
bodily injury without using physical force, and that is
our point.  There are different gradations of force --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, you
cannot cause bodily injury without using physical force?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  You cannot intentionally
cause bodily injury without using physical force.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the victim is
at the top of the stairwell and you go "boo," and he or
she falls down and is injured, is that physical force?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It is physical force.
It's not -- and I am talking about intentional conduct
here.  It is not physical force from the aggressor
himself, but it is physical force when that individual
hits the ground at the bottom of the stairs, and that is
how common law understood the term.
If that were not the case, crimes like
murder, for example, would not have as an element the
use of physical force.  Crimes like murder, crimes like
aggravated assault, that, like battery here, are defined
in terms --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You take the position that
the person with the camera says, "Back up two steps," so
that the other person falls over the cliff, that's
physical force?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Instances where it is
intentional, absolutely, because it includes not only,
again, direct applications by the aggressor, but when
the aggressor sets something in motion and causes
physical force to act against the person of another.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So then it's not a
limiting term at all.  Anytime anything happens, you
would say there is physical force involved.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  If there is bodily
injury.  And that's key here, the Tennessee statute
requires there to be bodily injury.  Respondent here was
convicted --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if I did the same
thing to two different people and one is injured and the
other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not
the other time?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  You are using physical
force one time and not the other time because there is
the actual physical force being applied against the
person of another, and contrary --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is the actual
physical force being applied?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  When the person is
injured, when the person hits the ground.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So if they
bump against the wall and that injures somebody but
doesn't injure another person, it's use of physical
force in one case but not the other?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I take that back, I
didn't realize they both hit the wall.  If they both hit
the wall, yes, that involves the use of physical force,
but --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But only one was
injured.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And then they wouldn't be
covered by the Tennessee statute.  The Tennessee statute
requires the intentional causation of bodily injury.
And if I could go back to the murder example, I think
that reveals why a contrary interpretation doesn't work
here.  Crimes like murder are defined in terms of
results. Itâ€™s an intentional killing, it doesn't matter how
that killing occurred.
And under Respondent's view, murder, the
quintessential violent crime, would not have as an
element the use of physical force.  Now, Respondent
doesn't dispute that.  He says it doesn't matter,
because murder is a felony and felons can't have guns
anyway.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I -- I'm
having trouble grasping the concept.  If somebody is
lying down and somebody goes behind them and says boo
and they have a heart attack and die, is that physical
force?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I -- I think that's --
that may be a bit different.  The way the common law --
and we're going back to the common law on this.  The way
the common law described it is it included direct force.
It included indirect force.  It included any time that
the aggressor intentionally set something in motion that
caused force to be used; in other words, directed
something to act according to the -- the individual's
will.
And so at common law, for example, it would
not distinguish between a husband who hits his wife, a
husband who whips his wife with a belt, a husband who
poisons his wife, whether he shoots at his wife with a
gun or whether he lures her into the middle of the
street so she's -- so that she's hit by an oncoming bus.
At common law, all of those different -- all of those
different examples of conduct were forms of common law
battery.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But it might not
include scaring the person and the person having a heart
attack.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I'm not sure if the
common law would include that.  And our argument here is
that if it was common law battery, that it would be
included within the scope of this statute, because the
common law defined battery as the unlawful use -- or
unlawful application of force and that's precisely how
Congress chose to define misdemeanor crime of domestic
violence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So your position is
whenever -- whenever somebody is injured by reason of
the intentional act of somebody else, that has been an
application of violent force.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  That has been an
application of violent force.  That is our position.
That was the position at -- at common law, although
common law didn't require violent force.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
physical force.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:
Not violent force.
And we don't --
The statutory term is
Right.  And we -- we
obviously do not think violent force is required here,
but we think whether or not violent force is required,
that yes, the intentional causation of bodily injury
does require the use of force.
And if I could try again to go back to the
murder example.  If you look at, for example, a Federal
statute, 18 USC 373(a), we cite this at page 15 of our
reply brief, it is solicitation to commit a crime of
violence and it uses language very similar to the
language we have here in that it requires the felony
that has as an element the use of physical force.
Now, we use that statute to prosecute
murder-for-hire cases, cases in which individuals
solicit the murder of Federal officials, of Federal
lawyers, of Federal judges.
Under Respondent's interpretation, those
offenses cannot be prosecuted under that statute because
murder would not have as an element the use of physical
force.  That defies common sense.  And it's not just
murder.  Things like aggravated assault, aggravated
battery causing serious bodily injury would not count
under Respondent's view under a variety of different
statutes, including the Armed Career Criminal Act.
Violent acts like -- against a person like
murder, like aggravated assault, are precisely what
Congress intended to cover under the -- as an element
clause in a variety of different statutes, including the
Armed Career Criminal Act.
In coming back to this particular statute,
922(g)(9) again was intended to accomplish something,
and Respondent's interpretation would read all meaning
out of its statute.  It would be inoperative nationwide.
Respondent does not dispute that.  He comes
up with perhaps 6 States that may have assault and
battery laws that may be covered under his definition.
On further inspection, most of them are not covered
under his definition.  But even accepting that a few
States remain, Congress did not pass this statute to
ensure that domestic abusers are disarmed in Idaho, in
New Mexico, in Utah and those that happen to strangle
their wives in Iowa.
Congress was trying to solve a nationwide
problem, a serious problem.  As the Court recognized in
Hayes, domestic strife and guns are deadly nationwide,
and Congress wanted to solve that problem with a
nationwide solution.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  Domestic strife?  I
mean, my goodness.  All we have to find is domestic
strife?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  No, that's not what
I'm --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whenever there's domestic
strife, guns are dangerous?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  That -- that is not what
I'm saying.  What I'm saying is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Clearly, that's not what
Congress had in mind.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Congress certainly had in
mind assault and battery offenses.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  The quintessential
domestic violence --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know why you have
to tie this to domestic -- domestic violence.  Why do
you -- it's no different from physical abuse of anybody
else.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  In this statute, Congress
was focused specifically on people who harm their family
members, the very people that they're supposed to
protect.  And the problem that Congress was trying to
solve is because these were family members, these
individuals were often not prosecuted as felons, they
were prosecuted and convicted of misdemeanors offenses;
and that is why they were able to get a gun.
When Congress passed this statute, it sought
to close that loophole.  It was well accepted that
assault and battery offenses are the types of offenses
that domestic abusers are most often convicted of.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And one of Respondent's
arguments is that Congress may have enacted this on the
assumption that we were not going to go off with this
modified categorical approach that we have created.  Is
that correct?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I don't think it can be,
because I think the Court has adopted both the
categorical approach and its modified categorical
variant, largely at least starting in Taylor, as a means
of statutory interpretation.  And so it seems odd to me
to say that the enacting Congress would have been
surprised when a court actually interprets the statute
according to Congress's intent.  It chose element
language in the statute.
And Respondent certainly does not argue that
courts should be plying -- applying a fact-based
approach.  That's not what this Court said in Hayes.
And so if you think Congress didn't enact a fact-based
approach, it seems a little bit odd to say that Congress
may have thought that is actually what it did in this
case.  And Respondents do not dispute that the modified
categorical approach wouldn't mitigate any of the
practical harms here.
Respondent's argument is not specific to
offensive touching statutes and includes the statute we
have here, which is a bodily injury statute.  If you
look at the laws of all -- nearly all 50 States, it's
one of the two variants.  It's either offensive touching
or bodily injury, and in most cases both.  And
Respondent's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask you about that Ms.
Sherry?  If -- I mean, suppose we accepted your argument
as to bodily injury, but offensive touching just went
too far.  What happens?  How are the laws of the 50
States constructed?  Are we going to have -- are you
going to have, a terrible difficulty prosecuting real --
you know, punch-in-the-nose kinds of incidents of
physical violence, because there are indivisible
statutes that apply to both?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  We are you're going to
have real difficulty prosecuting in about 28 States and
the District of Columbia.  28 States and the District of
Columbia define their assault and battery laws with
reference to common law battery.
And in those States, there will -- the first
question will be whether or not the statutes are
divisible.  Some of them are codified in the statute;
some are still common law crimes that are defined by the
courts in those States.  So --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, presumably, if they're
divisible, you don't have a problem.  The only time
you're going to have a problem -- and, again, I'm
assuming that the Court will say physical touching goes
too far, that that's not included under 922.
So you'll have a problem as to any State
statute that indivisibly makes illegal both -- both
offensive touching and more violent forms of activity.
How many statutes are like that?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It -- it depends on what
you mean by -- by divisible.  And I think that's going
to depend in part on -- on case law in those States as
to whether they treat them as separate crimes, in other
words, separate elements, or whether they treat them of
different -- different means of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, how many -- how many
include?  Just how many include mere touching as --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  28 States and the
District of Columbia include mere touching.  And even if
the statutes were divisible, we would still have a
serious problem, because in a lot of those States, the
State record is not going to make it clear the basis for
the conviction.
That was true in Johnson.  Florida was a
statute that had different prongs, including bodily
injury and offensive touching.  The reason the court in
Johnson focused on offensive touching was because the
State court record there did not make clear the basis
for conviction.  It was true in Hayes with respect to
the West Virginia statute.
And if you look at most of the court of
appeals decisions that have dealt with this issue, it is
true in many of those cases as well.  It is certainly
common for States to charge the least common
denominator.  Now, just because someone --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of the 28 States, if I could
just understand this --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Sure.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of the 28 States, how many
separated out on the face of the statute as between --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I believe --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- offensive touching and
bodily injury?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I think there's 14 that
separated out on the face of the statute, and 14 that
are -- are common law.  Whether those -- those --
whether those States actually separated out in terms of
the case law, I'm not entirely sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you want us to do
with those 14 that don't separate it out?  And let's
assume the case law doesn't -- what do you want us to
do?  Are they covered by this statute or not?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Well, we -- yes.  We
think they are -- we think they are all covered by this
statute, because we think that violent force is not
required, which is our -- our first argument in this
case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just touching.  Just
touching, is it --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Just touching is.  And
we -- and the reason just touching is, as this Court
recognized in Johnson, is that was the common law
meaning of force.  In this statute, common -- Congress
did track the common law and adopted the common law
definition of battery.
And in a statute that's designed to protect
battered women, in a statute that's dealing with
domestic abusers who are routinely prosecuted under
assault and battery laws, and in a statute that does
track the common law definition of battery, it makes
perfect sense to adopt the common law meaning.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I realize that in this
area we're supposed to forget anything about what we
might actually know about the real world, but are there
really a lot of cases in which one spouse is convicted
for offensive touching of another spouse?  If I search
the books, will I find these?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I think you will find
cases in which that's what the statute says.  I do not
think you will find --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Where the facts --
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I do not think --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- are that there is nothing
more than an offensive touching?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  No, I don't think you
will find cases where a husband tickled his wife with a
feather or tapped his wife on the shoulder for a
couple --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How does marital rape figure
in this?  In a -- is a marital rape considered a bodily
injury, or is that actually -- could that fall under the
offensive touching?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I don't know the
answer -- I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know
whether they're prosecuted under these particular
statutes, or whether they would be prosecuted under rape
statutes.  Either -- I'm not entirely sure which it
would be, but I think it certainly is true that if you looked
at the case law in terms of the facts, you're not going
to find examples of someone tapping their wife on the
shoulder.  You're not going to find examples of someone
tickling their wife with a feather.
I mean, these are wife beaters.  These are
people who are abusing, who are battering, who are
violently injuring those people that they are supposed
to care for, that they're supposed to protect, that
they're supposed to love.
I think it's telling that Respondent can
only cite to one case in Tennessee that was prosecuted
under the bodily injury assault statute, and he says
that that is the one case that shows that Tennessee
prosecutes nonviolent offenses.
There, the man punched his father, strangled
him, swatted at, scratched at his mother, twisted his
wife's arm, knocked her to the ground, all the while
holding their baby in his arms.  If that is the example
of the nonviolent conduct that is being prosecuted under
Tennessee domestic assault, I think it proves Congress's
point and it explains why Congress did not want that
individual to have a gun at the ready so that he could
pick it up in the middle of a domestic dispute and pull
the trigger.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's strictly background
information, but if you have a case of domestic violence
of the aggravated sort, and there's a plea -- an offer
to plead guilty in the State court, as you understand
it, does the State court have the obligation to say that
if you plead guilty to this crime, you cannot buy a
weapon?  Does the State court have the obligation to
give that advice?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Not as a matter of
Federal law, but if I can give two qualifications on
that.  In 2005, VAWA passed an amendment that, as a
condition of funding, said that States need to adopt a
judicial policy to provide that notice.  So it's not as
a matter of Federal law.  It's not required, but States
are encouraged to do so under VAWA to adopt those --
those provisions.  And I believe that all 50 States have
now done that.
The other thing I would point out is that
when an individual goes in to purchase a weapon, he
fills out a form, an ATF form, 4473.  And on that form,
he has to check off whether or not he has been convicted
of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  And the
form contains a definitional section, and in that
section it defines a misdemeanor crime of domestic
violence as a crime that has as an element the use or
attempted use of physical force, and then in parentheses
it says, e.g., assault and battery.
And so any individual who goes to purchase a
weapon -- Respondent here, had he gone to purchase the
weapons himself instead of having his wife do it, would
have seen that form and certainly would have been on
notice that his misdemeanor domestic assault offense is
a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
And Respondent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But doesn't that
assume the conclusion of the case?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I'm not suggesting that
that's how -- that the Court should decide that legally,
but in terms -- if there is any concerns about notice,
what I'm saying is that the ATF form that individuals
fill out when they go to purchase a weapon specifically
refers to assault and battery, and there's a good reason
for that.  It's because assault and battery are the
quintessential domestic violence crimes, and they're
allowed --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How do we get to the common
law meaning of "force"?  I mean, the statute does --
Federal statute doesn't say that, right?  The Federal
statute says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence, right?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And it -- and it defines
what that means.  So it defines a misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence, and this is at 921(a)(33)(A).  It's
on 1A of the government's brief.
And the way it defines misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence is, "A misdemeanor under Federal,
State, or tribal law and has as an element the use or
attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use
of a deadly weapon."
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course, that's the same
language as was in Johnson, but you would be asking us
to apply it differently here.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  It is very similar
language to Johnson.  Certainly the use of physical
force language is the same.  And yes, we would be asking
for an interpret -- a different interpretation here.
Johnson expressly left this question open.
In Johnson, the government argued that an
interpretation requiring violent force would be a real
problem with respect to enforcement of 922(g)(9).  And
when we said it would be a real problem there, it was
with respect to the offensive touching states.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Johnson relied on a
number of things, but the two were the use of felony and
the use of the word "violent force," which is not what
this statute does.  It just -- it uses a common law
term, the use of physical force.  That's why you are
asking us to import the common law in this context.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  In Johnson, ACCA does
also use "physical force."  This Court read physical
force to mean violent physical force, but the reason it
read that to mean violent physical force was the two
reasons Your Honor mentions, the fact that it was a
felony definition there, and the fact that it included
the word "violent," not only standing alone, but violent
defining the word "felony."
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're asking us to use
the terms in their common law sense because of the
nature of this -- of this provision.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Because of the nature of
this provision.  Because of the term that is being
defined in Johnson, the Court relied heavily on the fact
that the term being defined there was "violent felony."
And when it --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, of course.  In
interpreting the meaning of a term in the definition,
you take into account the term that that definition is
defining.  And in Johnson we did that, and we always
ought to do it.
And here the term that the definition which
uses the term "physical force" is defining is "domestic
violence."  And to give "force" in that context its
common law meaning, which would include the mere
touching, it seems to me is -- is an abuse of the
principle that the defining term must be -- must be
interpreted in the context of the term that is being
defined.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Your Honor, if I could
answer quickly, and then reserve the balance of my time,
I'd point out two different things.  In addition to the
phrase "domestic violence," which we think does have a
different connotation, it is referring to a misdemeanor
crime of domestic violence, and a misdemeanor is quite
distinct from a felony when you're talking about a
definition that was used as misdemeanor at common law.
And the last --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It distinguishes Johnson,
but it doesn't get rid of the word "violence," which
is -- which is what is being defined.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  And I think it does --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You are saying violence is
being defined as a mere touching.  I think that's a
stretch.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  Again, I think domestic
violence has a different connotation, and it's also a
fundamentally different statutory scheme.  This is not
ACCA.  This is a gun prohibition.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Rothfeld.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you.
Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
I think the central point is one which was
raised by Justice Scalia's last question.  The
government simply pays no attention to the language of
the statute that's at issue here.  The statute is a
crime of violence.
The government says that this act of
violence, this crime of violence, can be committed
without someone actually --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're suggesting that
you can commit a crime of violence because you have to
use violent force.  You could commit it simply by using
an automatic weapon that requires no force to pull the
trigger.  You're suggesting poisoning isn't covered.
You're suggesting that anything -- that the force has to
be how we defined it in Johnson, which is a given.
But when the misdemeanor -- when the -- when
the State -- when this exemption uses the words or this
requirement uses the word "misdemeanor domestic
violence," why should we stray from the common law
there?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, there are a couple of
things there, and let me try to unpack it.  First of
all, there are two separate textual problems with the
government's approach here.  One is it is ignoring the
ordinary meaning of the word "violent" and "force."
Second is it's ignoring the ordinary meaning
of the word "use," and when you raise the question of
poisoning someone, the government suggests that if
someone is -- if poison is sprinkled on their food, you
have used force because at the molecular level, the
poison is going to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It certainly causes
injury.
MR. ROTHFELD:  There's no question it causes
injury.  But --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Pushing someone lightly
over a cliff causes a lot of injury.  Do you seriously
think that Congress didn't intend to include that common
law meaning of the use of force in their definition of a
misdemeanor for domestic violence?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, again, let me focus
on -- there are two separate arguments.  The question of
whether use of force -- whether force was used in the
ordinary sense is a separate question.  The question of
whether or not physical force, violent physical force,
has a ordinary meaning and whether -- as opposed to -- to
the common law meaning of battery is a separate
question.
Focusing on that first, clearly, we think
Congress intended to adopt in this statute the same
definition of physical force and of violent force as it
did in the Armed Career Criminal Act, which is before
this court in Johnson, because it used almost exactly
the same language.
Something that the government really doesn't
talk about at all is that the language in this statute
is based directly on the language used in ACCA and the
language previous to that, which is used in 18 USC
Section 16, the generic definition of crime of violence.
Congress took that definition and it put it in the
statute.
It modified it in one respect, in a way
which I think is quite helpful to us.  It -- it -- it
narrowed the category of crimes that are covered here.
Under the -- the ACCA definition, it -- a violent felony
is a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force.  Our statute says the
use, attempted use of physical force or a threatened use
of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Excuse me.  If you look at
the history of it, it's certainly true that Congress did
intend to get misdemeanor domestic felonies.  That's
what they said.  And as it works out in the States, if
you take the same definition in, there would be very,
very few States misdemeanor of domestic violence
that would be covered.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, let me say --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I can't believe that
Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, first --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wouldn't be the first
mistake of course, right?  It wouldn't be the first
mistake Congress has made.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Some people who don't read
legislative history don't know that, but if you did read
the legislative history, you would see that they do want
to have an effect with this statute.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I will agree with
sort of both of those -- that Congress does make
mistakes.  But Congress certainly intended to accomplish
something here.  Let me say --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, on your reading, what
would it have accomplished?
MR. ROTHFELD:  First of all, what Congress
meant to accomplish here is -- I have to take issue with
my friend Ms. Sherry.  I don't think what Congress meant
to accomplish here was to incorporate the common law
definition of assault.
What -- Congress was quite clear, if you do
look at the legislative history, what they were
concerned about was that people who engaged in violent
conduct, and every member of Congress who spoke to this
talk about stopping violent people from getting --
getting guns, people who were wife beaters, who are batterers,
and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I agree with you.  I agree
with you on the tough -- what they were thinking.  But
now what I want to know, and you've read all these
briefs and -- and you've actually done a lot of work on
this.
So -- so if you adopt your definition -- you
know, making them parallel, how many State domestic
violent misdemeanor statutes, in how many States would
this cover it, in your opinion.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, if I can, let me finish
my answer to your -- to your prior question.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Please.
MR. ROTHFELD:  It's exactly what Congress
had in mind here, and I think we do agree with the
government on this, that Congress perceived a loophole
in the law at the time because the firearm restriction
at the time applied only to felons and people who
engaged in violent conduct, as Senator Lautenberg, the
principal sponsor said, that because of the outdated
thinking by prosecutors, people who engaged in violent
conduct that would be prosecuted against as a felony, if
committed against somebody else, was prosecuted as a
misdemeanor because a family member was the victim.
And so Congress wanted to close that
loophole by saying people who engage in this kind of
violence against a family member could not escape.  And
so violent misdemeanors were directed -- were defined
here.  And -- and as Senator Wellstone very graphically
put it, if you beat your neighbor's wife or batter your
neighbor's wife, that's a felony.  If you beat or
battery your wife or your child, that's a misdemeanor,
and we have to get past that.
So that's what they were trying to do.  They
were not trying to broaden the category of conduct that
was made criminal.  They were trying to say that if you
engaged in violent conduct that would be -- would be
treated as a felony if committed against somebody else,
you don't get off the hook because you did it against a
family member.
As to which statutes are affected by --
which State statutes remain as predicates, I think it's
not entirely clear.  The government focuses in its
statutory appendices on the generic definitions of
assault.
I think even as to some of those, under a
modified categorical approach some of them would --
would satisfy the statutory standard.  And for
example --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if they wouldn't, once
again, Congress may have miscalculated.  It may have
thought that this language, which it -- which intended,
as you have described, would cover a lot of State
statutes.
And as it turns out, it didn't.  And that
wouldn't be the first congressional statute that didn't
achieve what it thought it was going to achieve, right.
MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is absolutely
right and even if that were the
case -- and I'll get back to you specifically, Justice
Breyer, but if -- but if that were the case, the answer
cannot be that -- that we solve this problem by
extending Federal criminal penalties to people who lie
outside the plain terms of the statute that Congress
enacted and who engaged in conduct --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So in your view, and I
think you said this in your brief, but what constitutes
violent conduct?  So you said not scratching, not
bruising, not slapping.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it -- I wouldn't
categorically say that those things do not qualify.
What I would say, in Johnson, this Court did not define
specifically what violent force means.
And the Court did say that the same language
that appears in this statute was construed in Johnson
and the court there said it required violent force,
substantial force, as to what --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, I thought that
what Johnson said, it defined physical force as force
capable of causing physical pain or injury to another
person.  It didn't say anything about serious pain or
grievous injury.  It just said force capable of causing
physical pain or injury to another person.  That's what
Johnson said.  Why would we adopt a different approach?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think Johnson had no
occasion to -- to specify what level of force was
necessary, what level of pain.  Johnson --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  I mean, it specified it
is not involving any level, that -- that there was no
inquiry into level.  It's force capable of causing
physical pain or injury to another person.
MR. ROTHFELD:  But --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's the clear standard in
the holding.
MR. ROTHFELD:  I guess I would have to
respectfully suggest that the way I read Johnson is
to -- is to say that it was enough for the Court to
decide that case to say that offensive touching, that
mere touching was not enough, that something more than
that is required.
And violent force, substantial force is
required, and force requiring -- having the effect of
some level of pain and injury satisfies that.  I don't
think the Court focused specifically on what level, if
any level were required.
And what Johnson did focus on was the
meaning of the word "violence."  The Court italicized
violence as it appeared.  And if we look at the dictionary, violence is
an extreme use of force, especially severe, especially
powerful use of force.  And it seems to me that if you
get soap in someone's eyes that stings, that causes
pain, I don't think anybody would say in the ordinary
meaning of the term "violence," that's violent force.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Rothfeld, you
still owe Justice Breyer an answer.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I think there are several categories of
statutes we can look at.  One is -- is the generic
assault statute that -- that the government focuses on.
Some of those -- and look at the Tennessee statute at
issue here, for example.  The Tennessee statute makes
causing bodily injury a violation.
It defines bodily injury to include a number
of specific types of harms, which are listed
disjunctively; among them, for example, burning, causing
disfigurement.  It's things like that seem to me would
be violent and if properly charged in an indictment
under a modified categorical approach, I think would be
sufficient to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, and that's
what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that
some of the -- quite a few, actually, of the statutes
that they cite have different categories and some of the
categories would escape being covered by offensive
touching and others wouldn't.  So I thought you might --
on that assumption, if you win this case, then how many
States would be -- how many States would have written
their statutes so generally that it wouldn't fall within
the scope of the provision we are talking about in your
opinion?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I can't give you a precise
number to that.  I think it's a substantial number of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  When you say "substantial,"
I mean, you've read all these and do you have he an idea
of --
MR. ROTHFELD:  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You've thought about this
question, so you must have some rough idea.  You could
put a range on it.
MR. ROTHFELD:  I think at least some dozens
of States that have use of force, that have causing
bodily injury, defined bodily injury to include a list of things
that one can do --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. ROTHFELD:  -- and some of those things
are going to be necessarily violent things, and so in
all of those cases, if the injury is inflicted in that
respect and it's properly charged, it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you give me an
example of that?  I mean, I think most statutes I know
just say causing physical injury.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the Tennessee statute,
which is at issue here says "causing bodily injury" and
defines separately "bodily injury," and this appears
in --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he was convicted of
causing violent injury?
MR. ROTHFELD:  He was convicted of causing
bodily injury, but there was no specific indication.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So we sort of have two
extreme positions here.  The government is arguing that
the statute covers mere touching.  That's one extreme.
And you're arguing that the statute doesn't cover all
bodily injury, but only what, severe bodily injury?
MR. ROTHFELD:  We are saying it covers
bodily injury which --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why isn't there something
in the middle?  It doesn't cover touching but it covers
bodily injury?
MR. ROTHFELD:  That would be an approach the
Court could take.  We think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but you would lose,
right?
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD:  We think that's
inconsistent --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's assume, just to help
for a change -- I mean, not for a change, you help a
lot.  But the question in my mind is, can you imagine
losing this case, hypothetically, just on a
hypothetical, and that the Court were to say, just what
Justice Scalia said, and the offensive touching does not
fall within the definition of physical force, but
touching that produces violent injury does.
Now, were we to say that, then can you give
me a rough answer to my numerical question?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Several dozens of States --
well, I think -- it may well be that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  See, what we do is where
it's -- where it's separable, where it comes in two
separate clauses, then modified categorical approach
applies.  And -- and that being so, the only States
where domestic violence wouldn't be included would be
those that have a crime and use general language that
you can't divide in the statute and cover both bodily
injury and offensive touching.  And are -- are there
some such States?  There must be some --
MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I believe there are some
States that use a common law standard, as -- as
Ms. Sherry said, and -- but --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Sherry said 14.  And is
that your view, too?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I think that that's
right.  I don't take issue with the government's
categorization in their appendix of the statutes.  I do
take issue with what the individual statutes mean
in some circumstances, such as the Tennessee statute
that we're talking about here.
I guess to -- to respond to Justice Scalia,
we disagree with a rule that would say that any degree
of pain or injury necessarily is violent because we
think that's simply inconsistent with the meaning of the
word.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't say any level
of pain.  It says any level of physical injury.  So
assume physical injury has been caused.  We can argue on
the margins of what -- what qualifies as physical
injury.  But assuming somebody, like here, pled guilty
to it, we know something happened that was physical
injury.  So assume that.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, the Tennessee
statute -- I have to take issue with that, Justice
Sotomayor.  The Tennessee statute says bodily injury,
but it defines bodily injury to include pain.  And so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Soap in the eyes.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Soap in the eyes.  You know,
shampooing a child and I get soap in their eyes and it
causes them to sting.  That -- that would be --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You think causing the
pain was intentional there?
MR. ROTHFELD:  In -- in this case, the
allegation --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And you don't think that
if -- have you ever had soap in your eye, that somebody
threw the soap in to cause you pain intentionally?  That
wouldn't be physical injury to you?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that that would be
bodily injury within the meaning of the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about soap in the
mouth?  I've had that.
(Laughter.)
MR. ROTHFELD:  I'll leave that one alone,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do
you think the injury has to be?  What -- what counts as
serious enough injury?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I would -- serious
injury is a -- a recognized standard in the law.
Aggravated battery statutes, many of which are felonies
but not some of which are misdemeanors, use that
standard.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When I asked you the
question, you -- you were hesitant about scratching,
bruising, slapping.
MR. ROTHFELD:  I would -- I would -- my own
view is that a slap in the face, which was something
that the Court in Johnson used as an example, would be
violent.
The difficulty is that because there is no
statutory -- State statutory standard saying what has to
be found, so long as the we have sort of a -- pain in a
generic sense was caused, it could be the pinch, it
could be the soap in the eyes, it could be the stubbed
toe or the paper cut that the Sixth Circuit described.
We simply don't know.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, none of those things
would be done intentionally, so they -- they don't scare
me.  But -- but I do think of a -- you know, a parent
washing out a child's mouth with soap for -- for
improper speech or a -- a mother pinching a child
in -- you know, to bring the child under control in
public.
And that inflicts pain.  It inflicts injury.
And I worry about that being covered by -- by this
Federal statute.
MR. ROTHFELD:  There is no question that
those would be covered under the terms of the test that
the government is adding.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, how -- now, just
drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether
my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false.  That's
what I'd like to know.
The -- the many statutes, which include in
the same section, the physical injury and the offensive
touching, such as Arizona, you intentionally or
knowingly cause physical injury or knowingly touching
another person with intent to injure, insult, et cetera.
What we will find when we look back at the
record of the prior convictions, it will say charge
Arizona revised statute 13-1203(a), pled guilty.  And
we'll have no idea which it was.  And -- and that is a
general problem with this area.  We'll have no idea.
Now, is that generally true what I've just
said, or false?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I think it is generally true.
Not always true, but generally true.  But that is a --
is a -- to the extent that is a problem, it's a
problem --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Then I don't see -- I think
it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out.  I
mean, we'll work it out, I'm sure.  But look, on the --
on the one hand, if you just can't know, as is often
true, then on the one hand, you're not really picking up
serious domestic violence.  You see where there was
serious domestic violence.
And -- and although it was under a general
charge and so the person has a gun.  Even did he really
beat the spouse up and so forth.  Or on the other hand,
you pick up the offensive touching, too.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So what do we do?
MR. ROTHFELD:  It is a consequence -- the
problem you identified of the categorical --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  So what is your
view after all this practice in this area?  What would
you recommend?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Our -- our view is that if
the Court states as a standard what we believe the
language of the statute requires, that there be violent
force used, that people will charge crimes with
sufficient specificity in the indictments so that it
will allow for that to be picked up and qualified as a
predicate offense as appropriate.
I think the answer, as I suggested earlier
to Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice, the answer
cannot be that because we have practical problems in the
application of this in some states, that we're going to
apply significant Federal criminal penalties to people
who lie outside the plain terms of the statutory text
and who did things that Congress did not intend to
criminalize.  It is, I think, quite clear, and this
returns to the question that Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But on you reading, it
seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to
cover, it didn't; that is, the -- the defendant has
brutally beaten the mother of his child.  But under the
Tennessee statute, you would say that that doesn't
qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
MR. ROTHFELD:  I would say that if someone
who did that is prosecuted under a generic assault
statute that does not have as an element the use of
force and the relevance that is violent force, then
that -- that is true.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So that means that on
your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we
know Congress wanted to cover.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I would take issue
with that, Your Honor.  I think that we know Congress
wanted to cover is what it said in the statutory text.
It wanted to cover violent crimes, and it wanted to
cover people who use simple force to commit these violent
crimes.  It had in mind that many people who did this
kind of thing were being prosecuted for misdemeanors.
Some of those misdemeanors -- I think I,
here again, take issue with the government that both the
generic assault statutes and other kinds of both
aggravated assault statutes and specific kinds of
criminal acts that are addressed by individual statutes
could be invoked in situations like that.
And it may well be, as Justice Scalia
suggested, that when Congress enacted this statute, it
had a -- it had a sense that -- it certainly was aware
that people were being prosecuted by misdemeanors.  I
think it may well Congress really was not thinking --
did not have a clear sense of how the language that it
used would interact with modified categorical and
categorical approaches as squared against the state
statute, how that would apply.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would it make any
difference in your view if instead of domestic violence,
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said
misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse?
MR. ROTHFELD:  It -- it would make quite a
difference.  The face -- the fact is, I think it is
crucial to this case and something the government
ignores, that Congress used the language virtually
identical to language that it had used in prior statutes
like ACCA, adopting the language of "violence" as it had
done in ACCA, as it did in 18 USC Section 16 in the
definition of -- the generic definition of crime of
violence.
And I -- I guess this returns to a question
that Justice Sotomayor asked at the outset of Ms.
Sherry's argument.  Did Congress mean something
different when it said domestic violence?  The answer to
that is no.
The Congress used -- defined a specific
crime with elements that are identical to other generic
crimes of violence to the generic crime of violent
felony, to the generic crime of violence in 18 USC 16.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Rothfeld, this might
go back to our difference on what Johnson said.  But
you're asking us to apply a higher standard than
Johnson, which just said force capable of causing
physical pain or injury to another person without any
notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot.
And -- you know, I -- I can see an argument
that says we should apply the exact same standard as
Johnson.  I can see an argument that says actually, we
should apply a lower standard because this is
misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't
see an argument about why we should apply a higher
standard than Johnson.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I -- I do not suggest
that you should apply a higher standard than Johnson.  I
will say two things about that.  First, in fact, the
definition in our statute is a stricter definition.  It
covers a narrower category of crimes, as I said before,
than -- than the ACCA definition does because when we
reach threats ACCA addresses -- you know, any threat of
use of force, and this statute addresses only a threat
of use of a deadly weapon, a much more serious and
narrower category.
So it clear -- it is clear that Congress
thought about the definition it was using here; it
didn't sort of mindlessly take the definition that
appeared in ACCA and in 18 USC Section 16 and just kind
of plop it in there.
It actually thought about it, decided that
it wanted to use that definition, and then decided that
it wanted to -- type in that definition.  So I think for
those reasons the government's suggestion that we
somehow depart from what the Court said was the
definition in Johnson --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I -- really you have no
answer to Johnson, except that -- that statement was
dictum.  And it was -- the case did not have to define
the precise amount of injury necessary, right?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I -- I took that statement to
say that absent some infliction of pain and injury,
that's not enough.  That can't be a crime of violence
and --and not going any further than that.  The Court
then did go on to say in response to other arguments by
the government that a slap in the face could be a crime
of violence.  A slap in the face I think is a painful
thing.
It is not -- it's not a soap in the eyes;
it's not a stubbed toe, it's not -- it's not a pinch.
So I did not take Johnson.  And of course the Court will
tell us what it meant.  But I did not take Johnson to be
meaning to define definitively a crime of violence as
being anything which causes any de minimis level of pain
or injury, which again is not consistent with the ordinary meaning of the
word
of violence, which is extreme, unusual, very powerful
force.
I guess a couple of other small points.  If
the Court were to adopt the government's standard,
because the language that is used here is identical
in -- in our statute and in ACCA, I think it would have
to be a case that whatever the Court says about the
nature of the injury that is inflicted that is
sufficient to be violent force in this statute applies
in the violent felony context as well.
I think it would be quite extraordinary to
think that -- you know, soap in the eyes, which triggers
a -- a State battery prosecution would be sufficient to
qualify as a violent felony, and -- and make someone
subject to a 15-year mandatory Federal prison sentence.
I mean, that is quite a remarkable outcome.
And because Congress did use exactly the
same language in -- in these two statutes, that would be
the consequence of adopting the government's position
here.  That it's not that -- that what they are saying
would be limited to the statute.
It's not -- unless one assumes that Congress
meant radically different things, using the same
language in closely related statutes several years
apart -- unless one -- one takes Congress to have meant that then the
consequence
of the government's reading here, kind of,  washes back into the
violent felony definition in ACCA, and the mandatory 15-year
sentence.  I think that can't possibly be what Congress
had in mind.
In response to a point that Ms. Sherry made
about the Wachtel decision from the Tennessee courts
that we cite, we do not cite that as an example of
something which is not violent, not serious crime.  We
are simply citing it for the standard, the legal
standard that Tennessee courts stated for application of
their assault statute, and the nature of the level of
force that was necessary and the court here said pushing
somebody, scratching somebody would be sufficient to a
working crime of -- that inflicts bodily injury.
It is not theoretical, I should add, that
people are prosecuted for things like this across the
country.  In our brief and the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers briefs cite examples of people
who are prosecuted for nonserious conduct, clearly
nonviolent conduct.  People -- for spitting , for pushing
people's hands away.
In Tennessee, I can't cite cited cases --
reported cases that involve conduct of that type in a
domestic context.  I can say that people are arrested in
Tennessee with some frequency for domestic assault, in
contexts where the allegation is that they pushed, that
they spit, that they pushed somebody's arm away.
So you have to assume that some number of
these people are prosecuted and as in this case, they plead
guilty to make the case go away.  Having done that, they
are under now the government's reading subject to a
lifetime ban on ownership of firearms.  It seems to me
that that was not what Congress had in mind.
Congress, again if one looks at what the
members said as they debated this legislation, they were
concerned with people who engage in acts of violence,
wife beaters, with batterers who are escaping
application of the firearms limitation they manage to
plead down, their crime wasn't taken seriously.  Crimes
involving offensive touching are not what Congress had
in mind.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if you want to send
Congress back to the drawing board, what could they do?
I mean, they are stuck, because they have the laws of
the States that are framed the way the laws of the
States are.
And how are they going to -- and they
can't -- and if they can't, if they are stuck with this
modified categorical approach, how could they identify
those State prosecutions that fall within the parameters
that you just outlined.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well -- they could modify the
modified categorical approach.  I mean that is what the
Court -- as the government says.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Other than that, what could
they do?
MR. ROTHFELD:  I think they could identify
particular types of -- of violence that would qualify.
And --
JUSTICE ALITO:  How would you -- how would
you identify those without changing the assault and
battery statutes of the -- of the 50 States?
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I don't think that
Congress could -- could do it by simply absorbing the
assault statutes as they are written, because they are
overbroad.  They reach well beyond what Congress has --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So all the States would have
to go back and change their statutes in order to -- to
segregate the cases that within the parameters that
you --
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, no, I --
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- that you think are
required.
MR. ROTHFELD:  I think that is not so,
Justice Alito.  I think that if -- if cases were charged
with sufficient specificity in the indictments, both as
I said even -- even under the generic assault statutes, like
Tennessee, which lists types of injury, I think that
would be sufficient to, in a case involving conduct of
that kind, to trigger the predicate --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you remind me of
something which I -- if you interpret this broadly, to
include battery, suppose you do offensive touching.  Then one
consequence is that the person cannot later carry a gun,
is that right?
MR. ROTHFELD:  That is correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it also the case that
there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15-year
prison sentence, or not?
MR. ROTHFELD:  No, it would not.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  The only consequence
is that he couldn't carry a gun.
MR. ROTHFELD:  The consequence of this
conviction in this --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, if youâ€™d say yes,
contrary to your argument, the same words do mean
something differently in the two sentence -- in the two
sections.  Physical force means one thing for this
purpose; the other for the other.  I'm not saying I
would do that.  I just say if that happened.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And if that happened, and
you defined the physical force in the misdemeanor
section as much broader, would in fact there be a
consequence for anyone, other than not being able to
carry a gun?  I just want to have every possible
consequence in my mind.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, I think to the extent
that that definition flowed back to the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  It's different
definitions for the same word in the two
provisions.  And that's what I want to be absolutely
sure; there is no consequence other than the fact that
he would not be able to carry a gun.
MR. ROTHFELD:  Well, and if he did carry a
gun, and --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  There would be a
penalty, but would it be an enhanced penalty?
MR. ROTHFELD:  It would be a -- up to a
10-year Federal --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It wouldn't be the extra
15 years you would get for violent felonies.
MR. ROTHFELD:  That -- that is true if the
Court said that the identical language meant different
things.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I -- I assume that your
point is it's a trap for the unwary, that -- that
someone who has not really been guilty of violent action
would not expect that he's covered by the -- by the
prohibition on carrying a gun.  He is not a violent
person.
MR. ROTHFELD:  If I may, just for very
briefly.  That -- that -- that -- that is correct.  It
is as in this case; it is a trap for the unwary, and it
has the additional consequence of reaching well beyond
what Congress wanted to reach.  It identifies people who
it did not want to reach and it subjects them to this
penalty and this prohibition.  Thank you very much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Mr. Rothfeld.
Ms. Sherry, 5 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:  I have four points.
Number one, Justice Breyer, you are exactly right and it
does mean something different in this statute.  Justice
Kagan, it is a lesser definition of physical force.
There is -- this is a misdemeanor offense,
it's not a felony offense.  Common law misdemeanor,
understanding of physical force applies directly here.
It's a perfect fit, unlike in Johnson.
Also this is a fundamentally different
statute.  This is not ACCA; we're not talking about a
15-year mandatory minimum sentence.  A consequence in
ACCA of saying it's not a violent felony means there's
no mandatory minimum, but the individual still cannot
possess a gun, and a sentence in court can still take
prior convictions into consideration.  This is a gun
prohibition that applies equally to nonviolent felons,
to drug addicts, to the mentally ill, to and other classes of
individuals that Congress thought could not be trusted
to possess a gun.
The second point, we're talking about
criminal convictions here.  These are events that are
serious enough to require police intervention and to
have someone prosecuted to a successful conviction.  And
so if you look through the cases, these are not examples
of husbands tapping their wives or giving them a paper
cut or stubbing their toe.  These are cases of real
domestic abuse.
And the third point is one of the fatal
flaws in Respondent's argument, he acknowledges the
legislative history.  He acknowledges that Congress was
trying to get guns away from violent individuals.  But
these violent individuals who are convicted of
misdemeanors are not convicted of misdemeanors in the
abstract.
They're actually convicted of violating
certain State laws.  And the State laws that exist, the
State laws that are on the books do not qualify as
misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence in his -- under
his interpretation.
And the fourth point is I would encourage
the Court to look at the State statutes that we do cite
in the appendix.  And I would disagree, I do not think
they can be broken down in the way that Respondent
suggests.
Certainly, in their brief, they don't point
to any examples where any of those State statutes would
qualify under their definition, which would exclude not
only offensive touching, but would also exclude bodily
injury cases like the one at issue here.
And we're not talking about just the generic
assault and battery laws.  In Appendix C and D of our
brief, we also cite domestic-specific -- domestic
violence laws, domestic assault, and domestic battery
laws.
And it is quite perverse to think that
Congress adopted a statute that was designed to take
guns away from domestic abusers and chose to define
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in a way that not
only excludes generic assault and battery laws, but also
excludes most domestic assault and battery laws.
The practical effect here is far worse than
in Hayes.  In Hayes, it would have been a dead letter in
two-thirds of the State.  Here we are talking about
virtually the entire country.  Maybe a few States
survive, but at best, that is all that survives.  The
modified categorical approach is no help here with
respect to all of those States.
Now, with respect to the offensive touching
issue, I just want to -- I don't want to leave the Court
with the impression that we're arguing just for bodily
injury assault here.  We do not think the Johnson
definition applies here.  We think a different
definition of physical force should apply, and we think
the consequences of adopting the Johnson definition are
significant.  It's 28 States.  It's the District of
Columbia.  Maybe they're divisible; maybe they are not.
And even if they are, Justice Breyer, you're
absolutely correct that if you looked at the State court
records in this case -- these cases, in most cases, it
is not going to identify the actual crime of conviction.
And so in those cases, it is going to be a
virtual dead letter, in the same way that it was in
Hayes.  In Hayes, it wasn't nationwide; one-third of the
States had domestic violence laws on the books.  So it's
similar to Hayes.  It's similar to Nijhawan.  It's
similar to what this Court said in Taylor when it
rejected the common law definition of "burglary."
And the last point is that this Court has a
choice.  It can either embrace the common law meaning of
force and ensure that people who harm those that they
are supposed to protect do not have guns, or it can
depart from the common law, which it does not normally
do, and render 922(g)(9) a virtual dead letter.
