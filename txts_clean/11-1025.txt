International.
General Verrilli.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether
Respondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to
the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act. Those amendments provide authority to
the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at
foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence
purposes.
Along with that grant of authority, Congress
imposed statutory protections designed --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, is there
anybody who has standing?
As I read your brief, standing would only
arise at the moment the government decided to use the
information against someone in a pending case. To me,
that --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Several points,
Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would seem to say
that the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not
suggesting there is -- but that if there was a
constitutional violation in the interception, that no
one could ever stop it until they were charged with a
crime, essentially.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, under the
statute, there are two clear examples of situations in
which the individuals would have standing.
The first is if an aggrieved person, someone
who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the
government intends to introduce information in a
proceeding against them. They have standing. That
standing could include a facial challenge like the one
here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, can you
be specific on who that person would be? Because, as I
understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the
lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal
offense. It's more probable that their clients would
be; but, according to the government, their clients have
no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who
are noncitizens who acted abroad.
So it's hard for me to envision. I see the
theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person
who would be subject to a criminal charge who could
raise an objection.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, if the
information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the
client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would
be in a position at that point to act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the client is somebody
who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S.
citizen.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's certainly true.
But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that
-- that electronic communication service providers can
challenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there
certainly would be standing in that instance.
There was such a case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it that a
service provider would object?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the service
provider did object to the immediate statutory
predecessor to the 2008 amendments. And the -- and the
FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge. So
there's a concrete context there in which it arises.
But even -- but beyond that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the litigation was
unsuccessful.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that's right. The
Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation
there.
But I think the point here, Your Honor,
is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal
case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the
authority to that plaintiff. In a situation like this
one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a
plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the
application gets into classified information pretty
quickly.
I think what the Respondents have tried to
do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that
difficulty.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, using what you just
mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court
should hold there is standing. Couldn't the government
then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this
information is classified, these are state secrets, we
can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?
GENERAL VERRILLI: That is a possibility.
Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch
would have to go through, but that's a possibility.
But I don't think we can get to that point,
Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is
that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend
on a cascade of speculation. This statute only grants
authority. It doesn't command anything. And in order
for the Respondents to make a claim that they are
injured, in fact, by this statute --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I don't know
that you've answered my question. Perhaps you have, but
I just want to make sure that I'm clear.
Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the
targets of an investigation, if they -- if their
conversations would be intercepted, according to you
they'd never have standing.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it's
appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III
standing requirement of injury in fact based on the
reality that the specific applications of this statute
may involve classified information.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, we've had --
we've had cases in the past where it is clear that
nobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what
is brought before this Court.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's exactly right,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And we've said that that
just proves that under our system of separated powers,
it is none of our business.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That the Court's
authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance. And
the mere fact that a specific application requires
getting into classified matters can't change that basic
Article III requirement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test that you
propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the
word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it
unfair to characterize the government's position as
saying that you're submitting that the injury must be
certain?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No. The key point, I
think, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy.
This is a case in which the speculation is
about the government's conduct, not the connection
between the government action and an ultimate effect on
the Plaintiff.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's assume --
let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be --
that the lawyer would be injured if his communication
with the client were intercepted, or at least that he
would have standing to prove injury. Let's assume that
for the moment.
If that is an acceptable premise, assume
that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to
occur? And another test is there's a reasonable
likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a
substantial likelihood. You have to say -- you say
imminent.
GENERAL VERRILLI: The government conduct
being challenged has to either have occurred or be
certainly impending. And here, we have the polar
opposite, Your Honor. I think it is important to think
about --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Certainly impending.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Certainly impending.
That's the language from this Court's opinions.
And I think -- I think, if the Court thinks
about it, every single case in which the Court has found
standing, there's never been a dispute about whether the
government was going to act or not; the dispute was only
about the connection between the government action and
the plaintiff's injury.
Here, they're fighting about what --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, but in
this case the Complainant can never know. I mean, I
know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim,
but it's not speculative if the government being given
this authority by Congress is going to use it. Isn't
that so?
I mean, are we to assume that --
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's not
speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative
is the connection between the grant of authority and a
claim of injury. I do think it's important --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- you were
talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of
inferences, I think was your phrase.
GENERAL VERRILLI: There's a cascade of
speculation --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want to tell us that
in your view these -- all these inference that we're
required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is
adopted, you were going to tell us about --
GENERAL VERRILLI: I'd like very much to do
that. Thank you, Your Honor, yes.
First, the Respondents have to speculate
about what the intelligence priorities and objectives of
the executive branch are.
Second, they have to speculate about how the
executive branch officials are going to exercise their
judgment to translate those priorities into procedures
and procedures that comply with the statutory targeting
and minimization requirements.
Third, they have to speculate about the
independent judgment of an Article III court assessing
the lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether
those procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there much of a
speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one
time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the
FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but that, Your
Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the
process. It's really very much an iterative process in
which there's a dialogue between the executive branch
and the FISA court in which the court can demand more
information, raise objections. Those get worked out,
and then there's a final order.
So I don't think it's fair to infer from the
fact that there's only one rejection that this -- that
it's a process that isn't rigorous.
But, in addition to the speculation I just
described, once you get through all that, you still have
to speculate about whether the communication that --
whether the persons with whom the Respondents are
communicating are going to be targeted, and that
Respondents' communications will get picked up and --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here is -- I assume
that it is an injury for an American speaking in America
to have his communication intercepted against his will
by the American government. We take that as a harm; is
that right?
GENERAL VERRILLI: It may be a harm, yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the question is
how likely is that to occur?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think the question
under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the
government is going to take an action that makes that
certainly impending.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Fine. That's
why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow.
I mean, you know, nothing is certain. But I see it's
some degree of what you say -- some people say
certainly, some people say likelihood, etc. So put that
to the side.
What I want to know is, we have the
declaration of Mr. Scott McKay. Now, Mr. Scott McKay
says he's represented two of the people who are
allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he
has represented them for some time. One was in
Guantanamo. Another is charged with various crimes and
is subject to many, many civil suits.
In the course of that, he has to phone and
has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the
various Arab states, and in the past the U.S.
intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and
20,000 e-mail communications involving his client.
So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty
certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the
security agencies are doing their job, they will, in
fact, intercept further communications involving this
particular individual, the two that he's representing?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Actually, Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: And why doesn't that meet
the test?
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- I think that gets to
the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in
order for them to make out their chain of causation, and
it's this: They have to speculate that whatever
surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as
opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do
not challenge.
And Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good
example of this. We point out in footnote 11 at page 32
of our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was
subjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000
interceptions of e-mails. Every one of those, it's a
matter of public record, was under the authority of FISA
before it was amended in 2008 --
JUSTICE BREYER: But why can't we get an
answer to that question? I mean, I see your point. I'm
interrupting because I -- I see where you're going. And
it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I
can't imagine what security it would violate, whether
the government were to say, if necessary privately to a
judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new
authority for this purpose.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But he's just --
JUSTICE BREYER: Or it could say the
contrary. And so couldn't we find out whether he has
standing there without jeopardizing any concern of
national security?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think you can't get
there without establishing that there's a case of
controversy. And they haven't --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is if, in fact,
the government is going to use this statute to continue
to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --
GENERAL VERRILLI: But this case is at
summary judgment now, and the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- Respondents moved for
summary judgment based on the declarations that they
submitted. And the declarations that they submitted
contain the information I described.
And so the only information that's in front
of the Court in making a decision now is information
that that surveillance occurred under another authority
that still exists and could still be applied --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how that
is pertinent. What you're saying is they don't have
standing to challenge program A because they may also be
injured under program B. And do you have an example of
a case where we've held that?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's -- I think
the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in
that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty
to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty
is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there again,
it depends how you phrase their injury. If you phrase
their injury as being subject to surveillance under a
particular statutory provision that they think is
facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to
get any relief because you're going to be subject to
surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they
may say, well, we may, or we may not, but we still have
the right to cure the injury of being subject to
surveillance under 1881a.
GENERAL VERRILLI: But they still have to
show a concrete application of the authority they're
challenging. That's what this Court faces --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we parse injury
that finely? I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is
being overheard. Does it -- by the government. Do we
say, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under
this statute, it's another injury to be overheard under
another statute? Do you know any case where we've --
we've cut the baloney that fine?
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't. But -- but
I do think the redressability point is a valid one.
They have to show --
JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the thing is they are
going to be injured by being overheard. And you're
saying that they will be overheard anyway, and,
therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing
them under this statute, we're not redressing their
grievance, which is being overheard by the government.
GENERAL VERRILLI: That's precisely what I'm
saying.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Verrilli, this
statute greatly expands the government's surveillance
power. Nobody denies that. And so if the question from
these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of
being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take,
this statute makes them think about that question in an
entirely different way, doesn't it?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think, as
compared to -- let me make two points about that.
First, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes,
that's fair with respect to the authority that existed
immediately preceding the statute.
I actually think -- a bit of context is
relevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do
is reset the initial balance that Congress struck under
FISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas
communications were carried by satellite and, therefore,
not within FISA.
And, of course, what --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but if you take the
baseline position before this statute and the position
after this statute, these lawyers and other people in
their situation are going to understand that this is
just true, that the government is intercepting more
material, and that they have to take greater precautions
in order to keep their conversations confidential, if
that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do.
So they're going to take precautions that
they wouldn't have had to take the day before this
statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of
commonsensical point of view.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't agree with that,
Justice Kagan. I think -- this statute does not
regulate them. It confers authority on the government.
They take whatever precautions they choose to take based
on their beliefs about how that authority's going to be
exercised. That depends on the speculation I described.
What this Court held in Summers is that you
have to have a concrete application of the authority in
order to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for
Article III standing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now we're back at the
same circle we started with, which is the one that
Justice Breyer started with. He pointed to one person
under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of
thousands of interceptions. Can you really say that the
government's not going to target him under this greater
authority that it sought just for the purpose of
ensuring that it casts a broader net?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I think it is
speculation. I think you do not have a concrete
application of this authority against anyone, and
therefore you cannot meet the basic Article III
requirement of standing that's set forth in Summers.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't see why,
General Verrilli, this case is any different from
Monsanto. In Monsanto, the government deregulates
genetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it.
Now, there were these farmers who were
complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will
contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a
significant risk that it will contaminate our crops.
Because we think that there's that significant risk, we
have to take precautions.
Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening
in this case? We now think, says the -- say the
lawyers, that there is a significant risk that our
conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't
exist before. Because of that significant risk, we have
to take precautions of the exact same kind that the
farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the difference
between this case and Monsanto illustrates our point.
If the plaintiff in Monsanto had come into court and
said, Congress has enacted a statute that gives the
government agency the authority to deregulate
genetically modified seeds, we think there is an
objectively reasonable likelihood that the government is
going to exercise that authority to deregulate
alfalfa --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't see that difference
at all, General Verrilli --
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and then --
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- because, in fact, what
Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but
the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go
plant genetically modified crops.
And then there was the question whether,
because of that, essentially, delegation of authority,
the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened.
And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed,
and we have to take precautions in order not to be
harmed.
So it's the same thing. It's a different
actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a
fear that that delegation of authority will result in
harm leading to a set of precautions.
GENERAL VERRILLI: There is at least two
differences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect.
First, there is an exercise of the
delegation of authority in Monsanto that is not present
here. Here, there is speculation about how the
authority will be exercised.
Second, with respect to the authority, the
record in that -- in Monsanto showed the seeds were in
the ground, and the only question was a question of
scientific assessment about the likelihood that the
plaintiff farmers' crops were going to be affected, and
that was a scientific judgment based on the pollination
radius of the bumblebee, whether it would affect their
crops.
But what we're talking about here is
speculation about how government officials are going to
exercise policy judgments to implement the statute
and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is it really such
speculation, General? I mean, just imagine
that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the
lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a
terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case
of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to
that person's family members and associates and trying
to find out everything that I can.
Now, as a lawyer, would you take
precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start
writing e-mails to all those people?
GENERAL VERRILLI: If I took precautions, it
would be because of a belief that I had to comply with
an ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause
of me taking those precautions. It doesn't change the
standard.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't even think it has to
do with an ethics rule. If you're a good lawyer --
forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply.
Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer,
would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute
and talk to -- these terrorists' associates?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, it seems to
me that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the
argument that the Court rejected in Summers. There
isn't a concrete application.
In Summers, the Court said, even in a
situation where it would be likely that some members of
the Sierra Club would be affected by the exercise of
authority that the statute conferred, that you cannot --
you do not have a case --
JUSTICE KAGAN: In Summers, the Court
said --
GENERAL VERRILLI: -- or controversy absent
the exercise of the authority.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Excuse me. In Summers, the
Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just
going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by
this government action.
I asked you a different question. You're a
lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the
terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this
statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way
that you ordinarily would use the e-mail?
Well, given the availability of traditional
FISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order
12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't
think it depends on this statute.
But -- but, in any event, whatever the
reasonable judgment of a lawyer in those circumstances,
there isn't a concrete application of the statute that
creates a case or controversy here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You never know. There
may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the
Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think the
problem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart
of the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a
plaintiff would challenge the application of a statute,
of the authority conferred under the statute.
Here, that would run into classified
information. So the Respondents have tried to plead a
theory that allows them to avoid that problem. But it
is inherently based on speculation, and I --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you think it's
speculation. The government has a statute that says you
can wiretap in the United States organized crime when
life is at stake and you show it to a judge. Then they
say, that isn't good enough. We pass a new statute, and
it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when
you want, without a judge.
Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime
says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first
statute 400,000 times.
Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets
ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million
times, because they want to suppress organized crime.
I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know.
Okay. So.
Now, the question, which I haven't thought
of before, you are saying no standing, no standing,
can't raise it --
GENERAL VERRILLI: In a case like that, the
lawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to
challenge the application of the statute. Here, you
have the classified information problem.
But I will say --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, you can't. You can't
do that here. So -- so what I'm thinking is, he seems
to be separate from other people. He seems very likely
to have a concrete injury. If they -- if they aren't
wiretapping the people who are described here, who are
they wiretapping? And they passed this statute in order
to have extra authority.
So put those three things together, and they
seem to spell mother, perhaps, you know.
GENERAL VERRILLI: No, they don't.
And the other thing I think that's critical
here is that I think Congress was sensitive to the
probability that you could not have facial challenges of
the kind that Respondents want to bring. And so there
is an entire --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you are
saying that the government has obtained this
extraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have
extraordinary risks that face this country and the
government's not going to use it. That's just, it --
it's hard for me to think that the government isn't
using all of the powers at its command under the law --
GENERAL VERRILLI: I'm not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in order to protect
this country. And you -- you want to say: Oh, well,
don't worry that it's not happening. There is another
statute. That -- that's the problem I have with this
line of argument.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I'm not saying that
at all, Justice Kennedy. But it remains the case that
the way -- that in order for there to be an Article III
case or controversy, a concrete application of that
authority has to be demonstrated and it hasn't
been under the theory of the plaintiffs' case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's Justice Kagan's
hypothetical. The lawyer -- and I don't forget
about the -- I think the ethics problem is, is a very
substantial one. I think the lawyer would engage in
malpractice if he talked on the telephone with some of
these clients, given this statute.
GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- and I think it
would be the ethics rule that caused the lawyer to take
those steps, not the statute. He would still have the
same inferences.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's still the
reality. He still has to change his conduct.
GENERAL VERRILLI: I would like to make one
more point, if I could, Justice Kennedy, that I think
goes to this and then I would like to reserve the
balance of my time.
Congress was aware of the difficultly that
-- of bringing facial challenges, and so Congress put
into place an alternative structure of accountability
here. There are -- this is not unbounded authority.
There are targeting requirements, minimization
requirements, certification by the highest level --
highest levels of the executive, and there is
independent review by an Article III judge to ensure
compliance not only with the statute, but also with the
Fourth Amendment, and there is ample congressional
oversight. So it's not the case that this is a
free-ranging authority at all.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.
Mr. Jaffer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMEEL JAFFER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JAFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Plaintiffs have standing here because there
is a substantial risk that their communications will be
acquired under the Act and because this substantial risk
has effectively compelled them to take immediate
measures to protect information that is sensitive or
privileged. Plaintiffs are lawyers, journalists and
human rights researchers who routinely engage in
communications that the Act is designed to allow the
government to acquire. Plaintiffs communicate, for
example, foreign intelligence information, the kind of
information that the statute expressly authorizes the
government to collect, to retain and disseminate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our cases, of
course, say, do say "certainly impending," not
"substantial risk."
MR. JAFFER: Well, Your Honor, I think that
there is a -- a question even in cases that involve only
a future injury, whether "certainly impending" is in
fact the standard. But leaving that to the side, this
is not a case that involves only an allegation of future
injury. Our --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, let's leave that
aside. You have two arguments; one is likelihood of
future injury and the other is present obligations or
cause. I want to focus on the former. Our standard is
certainly impending, and you articulated it by saying,
substantial risk. There is obviously a vast difference
between those two.
MR. JAFFER: Well, I don't think, Your
Honor, that the Court has settled on certainly
impending. The cases that the -- the government cites
are cases like -- I think that the one that the
government cites, relies on most heavily is Summers.
But in Summers, the distinction between likelihood and
certainly impending was not one that the Court relied on
in -- in that decision. The Court said that plaintiffs
couldn't meet even the lower standard. So I think that
the discussion of certainly impending --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But both in Summers and
Monsanto the government tells us: We knew that the
governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew
that, the question was substantial risk.
MR. JAFFER: Justice Kennedy, the -- the --
the cases that we rely on, Monsanto, Laidlaw,
Meese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court
didn't look to the certainly impending standard at all.
The question that the Court asked in those cases was:
Is there a substantial risk? Is there a substantial
risk that effectively compels the plaintiff to act in
the way they are -- they are acting?
You are right that the government points out
this distinction in Monsanto. They say Monsanto is a
case in which the government was actually doing
something, was known to -- to be doing something. But
even, in this case, first of all, we know that the
government is using the statute. They have acknowledged
that they are using the statute. So there -- there is a
certainty of government conduct.
But aside from that, those cases like
Monsanto and Laidlaw and Meese are not cases that --
that actually turned on the fact that the government was
doing something. They are cases that turned on the fact
that there was a substantial risk of future injury, and
the substantial risk compelled plaintiffs to do
something immediately.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not enough, of
course, to know that the government is using the
statute. The whole question is whether or not your
clients have been injured, not whether the statute's
being used.
MR. JAFFER: I -- I agree with that. I
don't think it would be enough for a plaintiff to walk
into court and say the government is using the statute
and therefore we have standing. But our plaintiffs are
not in that position. Our plaintiffs --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have an
issue --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, do you
want to finish? If it's all right, could you finish the
answer?
MR. JAFFER: Sure. I was just going to say
that our -- our plaintiffs have -- have reasons to
believe that their own communications will be monitored
under the statute. One relates to the kind of
information that they routinely exchange over the phone
and by e-mail, foreign intelligence information. But
it's also that -- that plaintiffs communicate with the
kinds of people the government is likely to -- to
monitor under the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that assessment take
into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon
the government's ability to intercept these
communications?
MR. JAFFER: It does, Justice Scalia. I
mean you -- you are right that there is a court that in
some sense stands between plaintiffs and the future
injury that they -- that they fear.
JUSTICE SCALIA: With the obligation to
apply the Fourth Amendment.
MR. JAFFER: I don't think it's that simple.
The -- the -- the court, the FISA court, is tasked with
assessing the reasonableness of targeting and
minimization procedures. But the statute itself
forecloses the court from imposing the kinds of limits
that plaintiffs think the Fourth Amendment requires. So
for example, the statute itself in section (g)(4) says
that the government is not required to identify the
facilities to be monitored. And the statute itself in
defining targeting procedures defines them to be
procedures intended to ensure that the targets are
outside the United States.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if as you say those
procedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't
matter what the statute says.
MR. JAFFER: Well, the Court would have
to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: If those statutory
provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth
Amendment, they are null and void, right?
MR. JAFFER: Well, I think that's right.
The -- the court --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the FISA Court
would presumably know that.
MR. JAFFER: Well, I think if that had
happened over the last 4 years, the government wouldn't
be seeking reauthorization of the statute now. But even
apart from that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jaffer, could you be
clear on the expanded authority under the FAA? As I
understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a
target was identified and FISA decided whether there
was -- the court decided whether there was probable
cause. Under this new statute, the government doesn't
say who the particular person or the particular
location. So, there isn't that check. There isn't that
check.
MR. JAFFER: That's absolutely right,
Justice Ginsburg. There -- the whole point of the
statute was to remove those tests, to remove the
probable cause requirement, and to remove the facility
of requirement, the requirement that the government
identify to the court the facilities to be monitored.
So those are gone.
That's why we use the phrase "dragnet
surveillance." I know the government doesn't accept
that label, but it concedes that the statute allows what
it calls categorical surveillance, which -- which --
which is essentially the surveillance the plaintiffs
here are concerned about.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you address --
JUSTICE ALITO: If we accept the -- if we
assume for the sake of argument that "certainly
impending" is the, the general standard, if we accepted
your other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing
because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that
undermine completely the -- the "certainly impending"
standard? You have a person who is in a situation where
there is a certain risk, a certain degree of risk of --
of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's
not certainly impending. So then the person simply
takes some preventative measures, and acquires standing
that wouldn't otherwise be present.
MR. JAFFER: I don't think it would
undermine the -- the future injuries standard, Your
Honor, for a couple of different reasons. The first is
that "fairly traceable," which is the standard that the
Court has used when there is an actual injury, is a
standard that does real work.
So if plaintiffs, for example, were acting
unreasonably in taking the measures they are taking, if
plaintiffs were gratuitously buying flight tickets, they
couldn't create standing out of nothing. It would have
to be a reasonable reaction to the risk.
But the other thing is, and this is just to
go back to sort of the -- the basic standing --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, before we go
further. A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it
doesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly
impending risk, does it?
MR. JAFFER: You are right, Justice Scalia.
It doesn't, on -- on our theory.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's his question.
Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?
MR. JAFFER: And the only point I was trying
to make is that if there is a distance between these two
standards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance. But
the other point I want to make is just that the
reason -- to the extent the Court has imposed a higher
standard for cases involving only future injury -- and
again, we don't concede that the Court has imposed a
higher standard, but to the extent it has, it has done
so because it wants to assure itself that the future
injury is sufficiently concrete to warrant the Court's
intervention.
But if there's an actual injury, the Court
is assured of concreteness. The actualness of the
injury makes the case concrete on its own. And so I
think that the standards do different work. I don't
think it's a question of an end-run around the imminent
standard. It's a question of the Court assuring itself
that there is a concrete case before it.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me
that your -- the government's strongest argument goes
something like this -- and I don't think that they would
say it in these words, but you have some clients where
it actually does seem completely reasonable that they
would take precautions, that they would not get on the
phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way
that any old person would.
But just -- those clients, these lawyers of
terrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail
or getting on the phone anyway. Even before the FAA was
passed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe
ethically required to use precautions.
So what does the FAA do? I guess this is a
point about redressability, it's a point about --
MR. JAFFER: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- causation, but that seems
to me the strongest of the government's arguments.
MR. JAFFER: Well, Justice Kagan, this is
something that the declarations address specifically,
the distinction between the burden imposed by FISA,
traditional FISA, and the -- the burden imposed by the
new statute.
And it's true that the old -- under the old
statute, plaintiffs were required to take precautions
with respect to a subset of their communications. And
they acknowledge that in their declarations.
But the new statute reaches whole categories
of people who couldn't have been reached under FISA.
FISA had a probable cause requirement. It had to be a
foreign agent on one end of the phone. And so when one
of the lawyers in this case was talking to somebody who
they thought the government might believe to be a
foreign agent, they took those precautions even before.
But now they have to take those
precautions -- some of which are very costly -- they
have to take those precautions with respect to people
who are, for example, witnesses overseas, of journalists
overseas or human rights researchers overseas. As Scott
McKay says in his declaration, with respect to every
single international communication, I have to make an
assessment of the risk that the government --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have specifics in the
affidavits of things that your clients would have done
previously that they cannot do now?
MR. JAFFER: Yes, Your Honor. So, for
example -- well, I'm not sure that this goes directly to
your question, but in the McKay affidavit, as well as in
the Sylvia Royce affidavit -- Sylvia Royce is another
one of the attorney plaintiffs in this case -- both of
those Plaintiffs discuss the additional burden of the
FAA. They talk about measures that they are taking
because of the FAA specifically. And they mention the
kinds of communications they're having with people who
could not reasonably be thought to be foreign agents.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What other measures
besides having to travel to have conversations?
MR. JAFFER: I think it's a spectrum,
Justice Ginsburg. It begins with just being more
circumspect on the telephone, and it goes to, for
example, talking in generalities rather than specifics.
Let me see if I can give you actual
citations for these. So -- so -- so, the Plaintiffs
have in some cases been deterred from communicating over
e-mail or the phone. Chris Hedges discusses that at
366a of the appendix; Scott McKay discusses it at 371a.
In some instances, the Plaintiffs have
talked in generalities rather than specifics. Sylvia
Royce at 352a.
In some instances, it has even required
Plaintiffs to travel overseas to gather information that
they might otherwise --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the travel overseas
I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount
attached to it.
MR. JAFFER: Right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But these others -- these
other precautions, being more circumspect in their
questions, talking in generalities --
MR. JAFFER: There is no dollar cost,
Justice Ginsburg --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.
MR. JAFFER: -- but there is a professional
cost. And I don't think it's -- it shouldn't be hard to
understand the professional cost. If a lawyer is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you go back to being
a little bit more specific on this?  I think I got it.
There is a class of people that they would
have spoken to on the phone or e-mailed before because
they didn't think they would be covered by other
surveillance measures --
MR. JAFFER: That's right,
Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that were in effect
before this Act?
MR. JAFFER: That's right. The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you talk about what
kinds of people those are? Because if the targets are
always terrorists --
MR. JAFFER: Right. No. Right. Under this
statute, there's no requirement that the target be a
terrorist or a foreign agent, right?
So under this statute, every time, for
example, Sylvia Royce has to make a phone call with
somebody overseas about the representation of somebody
that she is representing, she needs to make an
assessment about the sensitivity of the information,
about the ways that information might be used against
her client.
So, for example, if she is talking to a
journalist in Afghanistan about the detention of one of
her prisoners at Bagram Air Base, that is a conversation
that could not plausibly have been picked up under FISA,
but it's a conversation that could be picked up under
the FAA.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it seems to
me that the concern you're talking about is present in
every area of practice. If you're representing someone
who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail
saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where
you threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to
answer questions on that because, as you know, that's a
real probable.
I mean, you don't send messages like that
through the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone
either.
MR. JAFFER: I think that's -- that's right,
Mr. Chief Justice, that, to some extent, this exists in
every area of practice.
But this is a statute that is focused on
gathering foreign intelligence information, and our
clients include lawyers who represent defendants charged
with foreign intelligence-related crimes.
And this statute, I think for good reason,
makes them especially concerned about the communications
they are engaged in with people overseas who couldn't
have been covered under FISA, but who are covered under
this statute.
If I could just address --
JUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back to a
question that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the
analogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is
alleged to be an organized crime figure.
Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says,
I represent so and so, the government thinks this person
is an organized crime kingpin, I know the government has
a very extensive wiretapping program for people who fall
into this category, I want to raise -- I want to
challenge the constitutionality of the statute under
which some of this wiretapping occurs. Would that
person have stand -- would that lawyer have standing?
MR. JAFFER: I think so. I think so,
Justice Alito. I mean, assuming that the lawyer could
establish that there was a substantial risk that his
communications would be -- would be monitored, and that
the substantial risk had compelled him to take measures
immediately, I think that lawyer would have standing.
Whether he would have a claim is a different
question, but I think he would have standing.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know of any case that
holds that?
MR. JAFFER: Well, I think that -- I don't
think it's a novel proposition. I think that in every
one of -- for example, in a case like Skinner, which was
a challenge to the rules that allowed for blood tests of
railway employees who had been in a -- in accidents,
that was a facial challenge brought to the statute, and
nobody questioned standing in that case.
JUSTICE ALITO: The Federal wiretapping
statute has been around for 40 years. Has there been a
single case that falls into this category that you're
talking about?
MR. JAFFER: No, but I think that that --
that there's a good reason for that, which is under
Title III people who are monitored get notice. There is
a notice provision, a general notice provision. And so
it doesn't -- you know, and people don't have to worry
that this is going on secretly.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there is a notice
provision under this statute.
MR. JAFFER: Only for prosecutions, right?
Only for prosecutions. And the government has made
clear that it's not going to -- that the main purpose of
this statute is not to gather evidence for law
enforcement --
JUSTICE BREYER: I think the -- which I
think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat
unique, so that what you're worried about most is the
definition of foreign intelligence information, which
defines it to include information with respect to a
foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the
conduct of foreign affairs. It's very general.
MR. JAFFER: That --
JUSTICE BREYER: And then, the
Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent
circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going
to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary
wiretapping.
Now, you say, look, if there is any special
group that's going to apply to, that is the group that
they wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have
that authority. And the government is saying, maybe,
maybe not. And there, we have an argument.
Is there a way of resolving it? That is, is
it open to the government, if you prevail, and we say,
you know, they have this extra broad authority, there is
no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm,
these are the most likely people to be harmed and there
is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to
think it will be used for them, that the government --
is there some way the government could say, in camera
even, no, we are not doing it? Here are our procedures.
We are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge.
I mean, is there a way for the government to
show that you're wrong --
MR. JAFFER: Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER: -- and that we're wrong
when we think you're right?
MR. JAFFER: Yes. Absolutely.
JUSTICE BREYER: What?
MR. JAFFER: If the government were to walk
into court either today or after the remand that we are
asking for, if the government were to walk into court
either in camera or -- or -- or not and say that
plaintiffs will never be monitored under this statute, I
think the case would be over. Plaintiffs -- plaintiffs
are here not because they have a general complaint about
the statute, but because they're actually -- they're
injured by it, and they're -- they -- they --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the plaintiffs
aren't going to be monitored under the statute. Other
people are, and your concern is collateral, that the
plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up. But the
plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.
MR. JAFFER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
don't think that's exactly right. I know that the
statute says that the government has to target people
abroad, but in targeting people abroad the government is
collecting plaintiffs' communications. So, you know,
this isn't a situation where plaintiffs are entirely --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I'm
saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the
government could come in and say: We're not going to
monitor these people. Under the statute, you can say
that today. The question is whether or not your
clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental
way.
MR. JAFFER: Right. I -- I guess I'm
disagreeing with the word "incidental." It's -- the
whole point of this statute was to allow the government
to collect Americans' international communications.
The -- the executive officials threatened a presidential
veto when it was proposed that Americans' communications
should be segregated in some way, that in the district
court the government was very upfront about this, that
the statute's whole purpose was to regulate the -- the
surveillance of Americans' international communications.
So there is a sense in which Americans --
the surveillance of Americans is incidental, but it's
a --
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't what you just
suggested as a way of resolving this case rather
bizarre? Someone who is -- whom the government believes
to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country
can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an
American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come
into court and say -- you know, challenge the
constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the
case would be for the government to go into court and
say: Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to
target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great
security threat?
MR. JAFFER: I -- I didn't mean to suggest
something like that, Justice Alito. You know,
ultimately, the authority that the government has
claimed under this statute is what requires the
plaintiffs to take the measures that they're taking.
And I suppose that if all the government were to do at
this point is to say secretly to a judge, "We're not
actually going to use this against plaintiffs,"
plaintiffs would have to take the same measures they're
taking right now. And they would be injured in exactly
the same way. What --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To that point, you're
conceding the government's position that -- on
redressability?
MR. JAFFER: No, not at all, Justice --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That even if they
promise you they weren't going to intercept you under
this statute, that you would still take the same
measures?
MR. JAFFER: No, no, I wasn't talking about
the other programs. I was just saying that plaintiffs'
injuries flow from the authority that they're -- that
they're claiming under the statute. And if the
government were to have a secret -- you know, if there
were some sort of secret government memo that said
plaintiffs will not in fact be surveilled, their
communications won't be picked up, if plaintiffs don't
know about that change to the government's authority,
they're going to have to take the same measures that
they're taking.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's on that branch of
your argument, which makes me more nervous than the
other branch. The other branch, they might say
something like: We're supposed to minimize risks of
catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we
do. And they show that and they say: We go to the FISA
court. Except in these very rare instances where there
are emergencies, da, da, da.
And I guess by that point they might be able
to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where
it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might
be -- be showing it's constitutional. That's where I --
that's why I ask the question. I'm not certain of where
I am going.
MR. JAFFER: So -- so maybe it's helpful to
think of the -- the cases involving pre-enforcement
challenges. So you think -- think of a case like
American Book Sellers Association, which we cite on I
think page 55 of our brief, the case in which there's
uncertainty about how the government is going to
implement the authority. Nobody knows whether this
particular plaintiff is going to be prosecuted. In
fact, in that case nobody knew whether anybody would be
prosecuted. But the authority was out there and the
fact that the authority was out there, the government
hadn't disclaimed it, plaintiffs were required to take
immediate measures to conform their behavior to the
statute, and plaintiffs -- some of the injury there
related to the kind of self-censorship that the Court
has always been especially concerned about in First
Amendment cases.
All of those things led the Court to find
that plaintiffs had standing to bring a pre-enforcement
challenge. And the kind of uncertainty that the
government says is present here, uncertainty about how
the government will actually implement the statute is
the same kind of uncertainty that is present in every
single pre-enforcement challenge.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart
from the government's power that you point out to
conduct some of this surveillance without approval by
the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year,
leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your
challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this
statute can be characterized as a facial challenge,
because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will
mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment
violation, doesn't it?
MR. JAFFER: I don't think that's so,
Justice Scalia. Our concern is not -- not that -- that
the FISA court will make mistakes, although it well
might. The concern -- the main concern is that the
reasonableness inquiry that the FISA court engages in is
a narrowly cabined one.  They court can't say this is
unreasonable because you haven't identified the
facilities. They can't say this is unreasonable because
you haven't identified a specific target.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it can say it's
unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us.
Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what
we're allowed to look into under this statute does not
comport with the Fourth Amendment.
MR. JAFFER: I think in --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We have to look into more.
MR. JAFFER: Right. I think it's within the
realm of -- -- of the conceivable that -- that the court
could essentially subvert the statute in that way or
find it unconstitutional, but the government would not
be pressing for reauthorization now, and plaintiffs have
to act on the basis of the authority that is delineated
in this Federal law. And plaintiffs see that there's a
law that is designed to allow the government to mine
Americans' international communications for foreign
intelligence information. The plaintiffs are people who
report on war zones or they investigate human rights
abuses in places like Syria and Lebanon and the Yemen
and the Sudan, places where the government is likely to
use this power. And plaintiffs include people who
represent defendants who've been charged in -- in --
terrorism crime and foreign intelligence-related crimes.
And so they --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.
MR. JAFFER: In our view, they act entirely
reasonably in taking the measures they're taking and
they are effectively compelled in the same way that the
plaintiffs in Monsanto, in Laidlaw in -- in -- in
Meese v. Keene were effectively compelled to take the
measures that they -- that they were taking.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned
your journalist clients. Do you have any affidavits or
anything else in the record to suggest that those
journalists have simply not gotten information from
third parties that they otherwise would have gotten? In
other words, this would not be a question of what
precautions they took and what precautions were
reasonable.
MR. JAFFER: Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But if you assume that
information is the lifeblood of journalism, that their
sources and their information has dried up as a result
of this statute.
MR. JAFFER: Yes, Justice Kagan. Naomi
Klein's declaration at page 338A addresses that. I
believe that Chris Hedges' declaration addresses it too,
although I don't have a page citation for you. It's
certainly in the lawyers' affidavits that some third
parties are less willing to share information, Sylvia
Royce, 353A.
So -- so -- so the declarations were filed
early, it was a summary judgment motion, they were filed
relatively early. So to some extent, they are making
predictions about how third parties will -- will react,
but I think it's an entirely fair prediction to -- to
predict that third parties who believe that the
communications are being surveilled will react in the
way you just described. And although it's not in the
record, we -- we have spoken to our journalist clients
more recently and they have told us that their
predictions have actually been realized in some cases.
Just to go to -- to -- to address the --
the -- the Monsanto point -- point once more. I mean, I
understand the Court's -- that the Court has to struggle
with the distinction between cases that involve only
future injuries and cases that involve present injuries
as well. I think it's just important to recognize that
the Court has never found the kinds of present injuries
that we are pointing to here to be irrelevant to the
analysis.
In Monsanto, in Laidlaw, in Meese, in
Camreta, the Court looked to -- looked to the present
injuries as well as to the likelihood of -- of -- of
future harm. And we are not making an argument that we
are entitled to a lower -- lower standing -- to lower
standing requirements or less stringent requirements
than the Court has applied in other cases.
JUSTICE ALITO: But in Monsanto, suppose the
challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said,
"I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans,
I'm afraid that they're going to start planting
genetically modified soybeans, but they haven't done it
up to this point, but, you know, this might be something
they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm
going to have to take precautions."
MR. JAFFER: I think that would be a much
harder case than the one that they've brought. I mean,
in part because the Plaintiff would presumably know
when -- when the soybeans had been -- had been planted,
and the Plaintiff would then have an opportunity to come
into court.
And it would be hard to -- to establish, I
think, a substantial risk in those circumstances where
the Plaintiff couldn't point to any evidence that --
that any action had been taken towards the
implementation of this policy that -- that he feared.
But in our case, again, the government has
conceded that the statute is being used. It's
conceded -- or it's acknowledged that the statute has
been used to collect Americans' communications.
It's true that we don't know that our
Plaintiffs specifically have been monitored, and we will
never know that. But that kind of uncertainty was --
was present in Monsanto and in --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe it's a
difference in how we're using the word monitor. You do
know that your Plaintiffs have not been monitored.
MR. JAFFER: Been targeted.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you
don't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right?
MR. JAFFER: I don't --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not monitored
in the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and
that's what we're going to collect information from,
right?
MR. JAFFER: Well, what -- what happens is
that the government identifies some category of targets
abroad. In the course of collecting --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.
MR. JAFFER: -- those targets'
communications, they collect Americans' international
communications. And when they're collecting Americans'
international communications, they are monitoring those
communications.
The statute allows the government to acquire
them, to retain them, to disseminate them. It
requires -- even if it's not foreign intelligence
information, which is, as Justice Breyer says --
recognized, is defined very broadly -- the statute
allows the government to disseminate that information,
just redacting the Americans' name.
The statute also allows the government to --
to retain evidence of criminal activity. And for
criminal defense lawyers, that's -- that's a -- it's a
real issue.
So you're right that -- that our
communications are not being targeted, but they are
being monitored.
I see my time has expired.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
General Verrilli, you have four minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you,
Mr. Chief Justice.
Two specific points and then three broader
points.
First, Justice Kagan, with respect to the
Naomi Klein declaration, what it says on page 338a is,
"Some of my sources will decline to share information
with me if they believe that their communications are
being monitored by the United States."
JUSTICE KAGAN: That's a fair point,
General. What if it said something different? What if
she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from
the source saying, "I have stopped talking with this
journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear
that my communications will be intercepted"?
GENERAL VERRILLI: I think you'd still have
the problem of speculation there.
And if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your
proposed solution. I don't think it's a solution. I
think it's a mechanism for people who think they may be
under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they
may be under surveillance, to find out whether they are
or not. I -- I just don't think that's a workable
solution at all.
Now, three broader points, if I may.
First, the -- in every case in which the
Court has found standing, every one on which the
Respondents rely, the government conduct either happened
or was certain to happen.
In Meese against Keene, the films had been
labeled as political propaganda. It wasn't a question
about how authority to do so would be exercised. In
Laidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in
the water. There wasn't speculation about that.
Monsanto, we already talked about; the
government action was certain. That's true in every
case.
And Summers drew a distinction with those
cases because, in Summers, there was no example of a
concrete application of the authority.
Second, their -- the fact that some of their
clients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change
the injury. It's still speculative. It's the kind of
subjective chill that Laird said was -- was not
sufficient to establish standing.
And I think, if you take a step back,
think -- ask -- think about what they're asking you to
do. They are asking you to invalidate a vitally
important national security statute based not on a
concrete application --
JUSTICE KAGAN: No, General Verrilli, this
is not about the merits of the statute. They might have
no claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no
question of invalidation. The question is only: Can
they make their argument to a court?
GENERAL VERRILLI: But the whole point,
Justice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about
the case or controversy requirement and the
injury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to
preserve the separation of powers.
They are asking the Court to consider
invalidating the statute based on an assumption either
that there is dragnet surveillance or an assumption
that their clients are going to be put under
surveillance, without a single fact to substantiate
either of those assumptions.
I submit to the Court that it would be --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which they can never,
never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there
could be a person in this category who would know, but
the person will never know.
You did mention minimization procedures as
one safeguard against abuse. What are the minimum --
what -- what minimization standards are taken that will
protect plaintiffs in this class?
GENERAL VERRILLI: It's a little bit hard to
talk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're
talking about the process of acquiring foreign
intelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence
method; and, to the extent minimization plays into that,
it's -- it's not public information.
But there are some steps that are publicly
known, and they are, for example, that information
acquired can be retained only for certain limited
periods of time; that whenever -- when reports are done
on information, that the names of U.S. persons or
corporations are redacted. There are other restrictions
on the ability to use the information. So there are
steps of that nature.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there restrictions on
giving the information to other government agencies, in
particular, the Justice Department?
GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that -- that --
again, Your Honor, there are procedures that govern
those issues. They're not public procedures, but there
are procedures that govern those issues, yes.
But -- but, I do -- I understand the point,
Your Honor, but I do think that's why Congress
established this alternative structure of
accountability, with the statutory protections, with the
FISA court review, including review for conformity with
the Fourth Amendment, with very robust reporting
requirements, semiannual reporting requirements -- I see
my time's expired.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
And so the case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
