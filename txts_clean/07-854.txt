CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v.
Goldstein.
Mr. Coates.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case arises from a Ninth Circuit
opinion that essentially creates an exception to
absolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and
supervising advocates. The court's decision in the
Ninth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial
policies that apply to an entire body of cases in a
trial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.
We submit that this is inconsistent with
this Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its
progeny, applying the functional approach to absolute
immunity. There is essentially no distinction between a
chief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a
policy directing that cases be handled in a particular
manner and that particular chief advocate or supervising
advocate actually participating in the courtroom.
Because of the size of the prosecutorial
agencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or
supervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case.
But they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case
through the implementation of policy, through training,
or through other means.
Here the policy at issue concerns compliance
with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information
under Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United
States.
In Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court
recognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial
obligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate
relationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings.
And we submit that that duty, that function, is the same
whether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's
performed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in
terms of formulating policy or when making particular
policy decisions.
Imbler recognized that these core decisions
had to be insulated. Otherwise, it would spawn
litigation that would burden the judicial process. And
it might cause them to hesitate to produce particular
exculpatory information. It might create a burden of
having them involved in more lawsuits than actually
performing their function and prosecuting the criminal
law.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was there an
element in Imbler of the fact that you have to
make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the
moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that
has to be exercised on the spur of the moment?
This is somewhat different. This is -- this
is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the
Respondents are arguing for. It seems to me somewhat
different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler
decision.
MR. COATES: Well, the court in Imbler did
mention a time frame in which decisions have to be made
-- quickly made by individual prosecutors. It also
noted the sheer number of decisions that are often made
in the context of a criminal prosecution.
I would say, with respect to chief advocates
and -- and supervisors, the number of those types of
decisions is the same. They have the same complexity in
determining what is going to come up in every single
case as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a
single case.
Moreover, there is a multitude more that
they have to consider because they are considering the
possibility of its impact on thousands of cases within
the office. I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou,
where the Court extended absolute immunity to
individuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point
was raised. But some of the conduct there was a bit
more drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner --
not the investigative manner, but the -- the
prosecutorial process used by the administrative agency.
And the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame
to be dispositive.
Going back to Imbler, it again looked at
what the basic function was in the administrative agency
proceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial
conduct.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you kind of
perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get
the case law in mind? Supposing a prosecutor wanted to
develop a policy which would keep -- which would create
a bifurcated regime within the office where the people
who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the
people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the
malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved
in this case. And supposing the prosecutor then hired
some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to
develop such a program, and the program, itself, is
desirable from the prosecution's point of view but --
but presumably unconstitutional. Would the person who
developed that program be entitled to immunity --
MR. COATES: The --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in my example?
MR. COATES: The lay person --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. COATES: The layperson, as a private
actor, I think would not be. I think the prosecutor
that developed the policy would be. It would be like
delegating it to a staff member. It might depend also
on how close the relationship is. The Court has noted
in some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes
court clerks can perform functions that are essentially
judicial functions.
In that case, though, under the Court's
jurisprudence with private actors, they might have only
qualified immunity, the private actors. But the
decision to use them would be prosecutorial.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why -- why is it
qualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not
qualified immunity if precisely the same task is
performed by somebody who happens also to be a
prosecutor?
MR. COATES: Because it's not so much the
physical task of doing it. It's carrying out the
obligation of performing that particular function. The
function is compliance with Giglio and Brady. That is
always a prosecutorial function. Whether the data is
kept with a police department or an investigative
agency, the buck stops with the prosecutor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And in my hypothetical is
it or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson
perform or not perform a prosecutorial function?
MR. COATES: If he is just collating data,
then that is -- that's -- that's a task. Our point is
that this isn't about just collating data. It's about
the policy that data must be collated and used. That is
the Brady-Giglio obligation. You can't divorce the --
the information from the purpose for which, why it's
supposed to be used.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm trying to
divorce the information in the particular case from
developing the program.
MR. COATES: Well, I --perhaps I
misunderstood the question. It sounds to me that the
prosecutor has made a decision that he is going to put
this thing in place, this process in place. That's
their way that they satisfy or don't satisfy Giglio or
Brady.
Maybe they don't satisfy. Maybe it's a
terrible decision. But I think that decision ends up
being prosecutorial in nature.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's made by a
layman?
MR. COATES: Setting up the program, no.
But the -- I think the buck stops with the prosecutor as
to whether that's a valid process or not. I mean, the
person may adequately perform their function, or they
may not. But the person at the end of the day who is
responsible for it ends up being the prosecutor.
And he may inevitably -- the person may
inevitably perform something, but at the end of the day
the prosecutor is the one that -- that has the task
under Giglio and Brady of ensuring the accuracy of the
information.
I think that kind of underscores here the
approach the Respondent has taken is to kind of say,
well, this is just a collection of data here, this is
just bookkeeping. But it's not. The core of the
constitutional claim here is that there is an obligation
under Brady and Giglio somehow to collect this
information, to disseminate this information.
And that's the obligation that we are being
sued for, and that's the sort of thing that prosecutors
do. And you can you hire someone to do it, but somebody
is the gatekeeper. Someone has to basically decide what
goes in or what doesn't go in and whether it's
sufficient or insufficient at the end of the day to
comply with -- with Brady and Giglio. And so that can't
be distinguished from the -- the prosecutorial role,
whether it's conducted by a -- a chief advocate or by a
supervising advocate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that
is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory.
They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about
prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher
level of policy.
When -- when they do that, I suppose they
might have the stronger argument if they could show
deliberate indifference. Are there cases that help them
on the "deliberate indifference"? What's -- what's the
best case for them on deliberate indifference?
MR. COATES: I couldn't say what the best
case is for them. I could not say what the best case is
for them on -- on "deliberate indifference." We have
not pushed on the merits part of this case. It was not
briefed down below, and it is not --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is why the case is
hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation
would be before I could determine the qualified immunity
aspect of the case.
MR. COATES: Well, indeed. I mean, several
amici has raise the question of whether there is the
constitutional violation at all, but it has not been
raised below. And of course, under this Court's
decision in Buckley we have to assume the existence of a
constitutional violation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we are
deciding in sort of in a vacuum. It's a little
difficult.
MR. COATES: Precisely. But I think our
point is that -- that if you buy their theory of a
constitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that
is is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim,
because that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady
obligation. They are trial obligations. They don't
have any meaning outside the context of an actual
prosecution.
And so, again we submit that there is really
no difference to the chief advocate or supervising
advocate formulating this particular policy for all the
cases in the office -- this is what we do -- then there
is the individual actions of a particular trial attorney
in a given case or even if it were possible for a
supervising attorney or chief advocate to participate in
everything. They could accomplish the same thing, I
suppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an
e-mail saying: Comply with our policies.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Monell case -- does
the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be
instances where a policy makes the policy of those who
adopted the policy liable?
MR. COATES: I think that's right. Reading
the Monell allegations of the complaint against the
County of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is,
that the deputy -- that the district attorney rather,
acts as a county officer and would be the policymaker
for those policies and customs and practices.
That obviously is not at issue here.
Petitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts
as supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating
a particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and
Giglio.
These sort of cases, opening this door
particularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now
trying to assert, which is this kind of notion of
information management, can spawn all sorts of claims.
Virtually any time that you can't reach the individual
trial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever
you think that person did to the failure to develop a
policy or provide training or to have adequate data
management to allow them to do the job.
This kind of end-run under Imbler will
create the multitude of litigation and drag chief
advocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that
Imbler was designed to avoid. And it has the worse
collateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling
in the individual attorneys, the individual trial
attorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have
individual liability, but they are certainly going to
come in; they are going to testify as witnesses.
So, it's the worst of both worlds, which is
you are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of
litigation which may impact the way they formulate
policy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy
attorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to
protect as well.
Those adverse consequences on the judicial
process are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize
the importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors. We
submit that it's even more important that that immunity
be logically applied to chief advocates and to
supervisors. Otherwise, I think Imbler will be
eviscerated and we will have the very evils that Imbler
was designed to avoid.
If the Court has no further questions, I
will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Coates.
Oh, excuse me. Sorry about that.
Mr. Dreeben.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
This Court recognized absolute prosecutorial
immunity for line prosecutors who are charged with
violating an obligation that falls uniquely on
prosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose
exculpatory evidence. The Respondents in this case are
seeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial
immunity by reformulating the claim as one against
supervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under
the Constitution to collect information that would
enable the line prosecutors to comply with the core duty
under Giglio and Brady.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there such a
constitutional obligation?
MR. DREEBEN: Not in our view,
Mr. Chief Justice. In our view the Brady obligation is
one that falls on the Government. Giglio is an
extension of Brady with respect to impeachment
information. It's designed to ensure the fairness of
the trial. It is violated only when the Government has
suppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is,
evidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial.
It's intimately linked in a way that really
nothing else in the adversary system is to preserving
the fairness of the trial. It's an obligation on the
prosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate
to zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the
advocate in the position of supplying the judicial
system with information needed to be submitted in order
to have a fair proceeding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you have the
flip side of the same problem your friend has. In other
words, the further it is removed from the constitutional
violation or an allegation of a constitutional
violation, the less need there is for immunity. The
closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a
constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is
stronger.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, it certainly is true
that if there were a constitutional obligation under
Giglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately
tied to the judicial process, and it should receive
absolute prosecutorial immunity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the broad ethical
scheme of things, apart from liability under this
statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district
attorney would take seriously the obligation to make
sure that everybody was following Brady.
MR. DREEBEN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,
and I think that a formulation of policies to achieve
that, whether or not required by the Constitution, is
something that relates directly and intimately to the
prosecutor's duties to assure --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the next
point. If I were a prosecutor, I would say: This is my
constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of --
of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.
MR. DREEBEN: Only in the sense, I think,
that -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or
prevent constitutional violations may be under some
obligation not to cause constitutional violations. But
the claim here is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it's more
--
than that. He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices
in the office --
MR. DREEBEN: You certainly should not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- consistent with his or
her obligations to perform their duties.
MR. DREEBEN: But I think that the
deliberated indifference question that you raise,
Justice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the
absolute immunity argument that we are making here. We
are making here the argument that supervisory
prosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad
policies that they have adopted that will directly have
impact on individual cases in the way that Brady and
Giglio obligations are fulfilled.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, what do you
do with my hypothetical? Do you remember it?
MR. DREEBEN: I remember it,
Justice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with
Mr. Coates on this one. The supervisory prosecutor who
formulates the policy is the only one who has the unique
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm -- my hypothetical
is they hire a layman --
MR. DREEBEN: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to develop a policy
that will keep separate from prosecutors information
about the way witnesses are developed. And the policy I
think is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the
policy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by
Giglio and Brady.
MR. DREEBEN: That's the allegation, of
course. And the first thing that I want to say is that
if you allow suits based on allegations that you think
are really bad, you open the door to allegations that
will have to be sorted out throughout the judicial
system.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's true even
without -- without an immunity.
MR. DREEBEN: But I think that the point is
that the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having
to fear that they will be subject to those kind of
suits.
But to answer your question directly, the
layperson, if he causes a constitutional violation,
isn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by
the prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to
prosecutors. And that's because if you go back to the
roots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial
immunity is really --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the next
question is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can
compartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and
he develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just
do that performance, why is that trial-related?
MR. DREEBEN: I think the flaw in
Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the
prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and
a prosecutorial function.  And that's the same, I think,
maneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the
prosecutor is really doing something administrative and
Imbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial;
therefore, we can sue him.
I think the problem with that is illustrated
by a hypothetical about judicial immunity. Suppose --
judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases,
and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of
interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued
for having done so, even if it violated the
Constitution. Suppose that the litigant reformulated
the suit and said: Well, the judge should have had a
policy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases
that the judge sat on. And that would have been an
administrative duty, set up some notebook that has all
the judge's investments and direct some underling to
ensure that no party in any case has an interest where
the judge has an investment. That was purely
administrative, so we ought to be able to sue. The
judge for that. And I think that obviously should fail.
It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being
able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think
that that is identical in form to what the Respondents
are trying to do here. They are trying to divorce the
role of the office in maintaining some sort of a system
to ensure that information is available to prosecutors
to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under
Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process,
which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the
prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to
absolute immunity.
And you just can't do that. If you do that,
you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils
that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself. And
it produces anomalies. The line prosecutor, even if he
intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under
Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if
what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or
perhaps even negligent, could be sued.
The line prosecutor who handles a certain
number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would
ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and
would divert him from performing his role of enforcing
the criminal law. The supervisor, who is responsible
for far more cases and is subject to far more
disappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that
person can be sued. And it would have an even more
disruptive effect on an office if supervisory
prosecutors, who have the responsibility, as
Justice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with
policies that will prevent constitutional violations,
and that will ensure that the office functions in an
efficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones
who are most deterred -- most deterred from acting,
because they will suffer the possibility of thinking of
their own individual liability rather than focusing on
what they are supposed to do, the public interest, both
disclosing information that needs to be disclosed,
bringing suits that need to be brought, and using
witnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is
going to discover information that should have been
disclosed and sue the supervisor, saying, "We know we
can't sue the individual prosecutor, but you,
supervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get
that information to the court." That kind of
circumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the
policies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is
designed to fulfill.
If the Court has no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.
Dreeben.
Mr. Rosenkranz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
This case is not about whether a chief D.A.
can set policies about trial strategy. We could
stipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from
those sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at
all.
This case is about the function of deciding
on an officewide basis whether to track important
historical facts and disseminate them internally within
an office to employees who need to know those facts.
This case is about gathering and preserving information,
certain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever
get into the courtroom, not about how to use those
specific pieces of data once you actually have a
prosecution materializing.
This claim is no different from a claim
against a chief of police, for example, for
systematically destroying 911 tapes, thereby depriving
defendants of exculpatory information.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is creating -- this
is creating a database. And what was the year of this
prosecution?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: The prosecution, Your
Honor, was in 1979, it began. That was the crime; the
prosecution was in '80.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And back in 1979 we did
not have the information-gathering electronic capability
that we now have. So what are we talking about? What
kind of database? How would it operate? Would you --
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so that's
getting to the merits of the actual claim. It could be
as simple as a file cabinet or 3 by 5 cards on which you
list the name of the informant and his prior record of
collaboration.
In the U.S. Attorney's offices that do this,
completely apart from this enormous FBI database, they
do it very simply, the ones that I know about. They
appoint a Giglio czar in each bureau and they say that
when there is contact with the prosecutor's office and
an informant, you make sure you tell this person, "send
an e-mail," and he keeps it all in a file.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that goes
to the merits, doesn't it? I mean, if -- I -- you could
develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys
are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in
this way. But if there is a decision not to -- I mean,
immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there
has been some violation. And so the fact that somebody
else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good
argument to deprive other people of immunity.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, this
Court has said as clearly as it can possibly say that
the location of the injury is irrelevant. I am quoting
now from Buckley. In Kalina, the prosecutor executed
the challenged certification probably the morning before
the morning she walked into court, and it was held to be
not immune because that was not the function of a
prosecutor. She - with the charging document.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You drew a
distinction earlier on between a determination by a
prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is
absolutely immune, and said this was different. But
what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide
prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over?
Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core
function?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, the
answer is quite simple. That is the alleged motive in
this case, in fact. It was intentional or with
deliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the
intention was to cut the flow of information to the line
prosecutor. And the reason that's different is because
while Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer
is compliance with Brady comprises at least two
functions.
There is the front line function of the
prosecutor, the advocate, making the decision, "Do I
turn this information over to the defense?" This case
has nothing to do with that front line function. This
case has to do with the back room function. The
function of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that the
same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't
turn this information over. Here's all -- we are not
going to share informant information because we don't
think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio.
The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going
to turn it over. Why isn't it exactly the same?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, if the
decree comes from on high, "we don't turn over Giglio
information here," which has actually happened in some
cases, that would be a different case, because that is
the chief administrator directing trial tactics.
Here it's the chief administrator looking
entirely inward and saying, like any administrator in
any major agency or business does, how do we get
information from the people who know it to the people
who need it at the front line?
JUSTICE SCALIA: That is certainly -- you
know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly
not the theory on which the decision below was based.
The decision below says "Neither" -- speaking of Imbler
and prior cases -- "Neither the Supreme Court nor this
Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to
train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an
officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation
like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute
immunity."
And I could quote portions of the opinion
they are.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about
supervising prosecutors. They are talking about
training prosecutors and having an officewide policy
regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the passage you
read from was the broad passage that the court was
referring to when it said this sets up a bunch of hard
questions. This case becomes an easy case, the court
said, because we were not dealing with the prosecutor,
the chief D.A. setting trial tactics for the line
prosecutors; we are dealing -- the court says this on
page 5 of the petition -- excuse me, the petition
appendix.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Page 5?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Page 5 of the petition
appendix at the top. It lays out the theories. Number
one theory is exactly the theory we are presenting here.
At the very top line, "They violated his constitutional
rights by purposely or with deliberate indifference
failing to create a system that would satisfy the Giglio
obligation."
JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not talking about
just collecting information.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about, as
they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train
and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding
the Giglio obligations.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, no, they -- the
court was very clear that it was talking about
supervising and training, about the internal function of
circulation of information within the D.A.'s office.
Not --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that's --
that's what they did mean. I have to say I read it as
broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow
down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim
that you are making right now.
Let me go back to the Chief Justice's
hypothetical and add one minor detail.
Let's assume that in a given department they
put into effect exactly the policy that you want. They
have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more
sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the
boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know
what kind of deals are being made and offered at all
times. And they have such a system.
And the boss D.A. also says and don't you
disclose one word of it ever in any case. We are going
to defy Giglio.
If he made that or gave that order so that
in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even
though the facts were known, would he have absolute
immunity?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: And he's directing that
order to trial lawyers?
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The
answer is I don't know. I could imagine a theory, a
very strong one --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know if in a
given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer
comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system
and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation. And
the boss D.A. says: Forget it. Don't tell him a word.
There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't
there?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: There absolutely would,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: And my point is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the -- why would
the answer be any different if he says don't bother me
with particular cases? I am telling you right now what
the answer is going to be in every case in which we have
a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.
Presumably there would be absolute immunity,
wouldn't there?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I can imagine
an argument on either side. I can imagine the Plaintiff
making the argument --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's your answer?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't have an answer to
that hypothetical because it's so different from our
case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is if you don't
have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to
leave open the possibilities as far as your case is
concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that
case. And if he would have absolute immunity in that
case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing
anything less than absolute immunity with respect to
this data collection obligation reduces down to
something like an almost a silly point.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: If --
JUSTICE SOUTER: If you can get everything
you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is:
Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute
immunity and nobody gets anything. What is -- what is
to be gained by that?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that may
well be a consequence of Imbler. But when Imbler talks
about the function, Imbler is very clear that there is a
distinction between trial tactics and strategy on the
one hand in the cases under Imbler, and the sort of
backroom functions about the flow of information on the
other --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the backroom
function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an
immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information
in every case, then I don't see the point of saying
there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function,
because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no
absolute immunity.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. We
can -- if we imagine a corrupt district attorney who
wants to make sure that constitutional rights are
violated and evades the edict of this Court, sure, that
is the consequence of Imbler.
But my point in -- in not answering the
question about the theory under that case, is that the
argument of the plaintiff in that case is so different
from the argument that we are making here. The
plaintiff in that case would be arguing, well, it is
removed in time from the -- the actual prosecution which
is an argument that we, too, can make. The conduct was
before the initiation of criminal proceedings. It's
not -- you know, you could not say it's not unique to
prosecutors.
Here, our argument is that there is nothing
unique to prosecutors or to lawyers about the
information management function, about the function of
tracking information. And by the way, this is not an
exotic theory. This is exactly the line that this Court
has been following in distinguishing between --
JUSTICE ALITO: Can't you say anything about
training subordinates in any office. There is nothing
unique about training or not training subordinates in a
prosecutor's office as opposed to any other government
office or, I would suppose, an office in the private
sector. So does your argument extend to any failure to
provided adequate training or any instance where there
is a deliberate indifference as to the training that is
provided?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: I can see the plaintiff in
a case using our argument to advance that point. But my
point here is we don't even need to get to that argument
because --
JUSTICE ALITO: So a plaintiff could say
that it could sue a -- a district attorney for failing
to have adequate training as to subordinates before
you -- they are sent in to deliver a summation so that
they know they are not supposed to comment on the
failure of a defendant to take the stand --
MR. ROSENKRANZ: As I said --
JUSTICE ALITO: They are not supposed to
vouch for witnesses, that would be a viable theory in
your opinion?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I believe that there
is an argument. It's not the argument that I am making.
The argument that I am making it matters what the D.A.
is training on. If the D.A. is training on trial
tactics, that's one thing. But here the D.A. is
training on how to use a database, and he's not training
the lawyers who are going to be using it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you have,
it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the
theory that the Ninth Circuit went on. I mean, the
Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising
deputy district attorneys. And why do we train them?
Because we want to ensure that they share information.
Now you are cutting out the training and
supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the
supervising attorney is to have this information bank,
which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult,
which, may be a very sound policy. But is it an element
of due process that the supervising attorney has to
devise a system to share information? Where is there
anything -- anything that the Court has held that
suggests that there is a data collection function
required by due process?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, let me
ask -- let me answer the first half first, which is
about what the Ninth Circuit held. And first, I should
say what it is that we argued to the Ninth Circuit.
It's on -- it's in our brief, very clearly
we've presented on page -- excuse me -- on page 17 of
our brief, that big paragraph, the only full paragraph,
we present both what we argued to the Ninth Circuit,
which was about the creation of a database, and what
Petitioners argued to the Ninth Circuit, which reflected
exactly what we were saying. So petitioners were not
confused. They attributed to us the argument that they,
quote, failed to set up a system to disseminate to
deputy district attorneys information about plea deals
and other assistance being offered to informants.
That was -- and that was directly out of our
brief. That was the first line of their brief, and the
first line of our brief also referred to that.
I agree, the Ninth Circuit spoke more about
training than about this information database. But the
Ninth Circuit was also speaking only about --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is nothing in
the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was
presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had
to do with this talk about training?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: There was, Your Honor. In
our complaint we had two what might be called
information management theories.
One -- and you can see it on page 45 of our
complaint of the joint appendix, and so while the Court
is orienting itself -- there were -- there's a theory of
information management that is the most prominent theory
in the complaint. If you look at the bottom of page 45,
about seven lines up from the bottom, you see two
distinct kind of subtheories.
The first is -- so it starts -- the line
starts purposely or with a deliberate indifference --
theory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system
for the deputy district attorneys handling criminal
cases to access information, about informants, of
course.
Theory B, two lines from the bottom, "that
they failed to train deputy district attorneys to
disseminate information pertaining to the benefits
provided to jailhouse informants." That's also about
disseminating it internally. If one turns to page 69,
the specific allegations against Petitioners, you see
paragraph 154, repeatedly talking about this information
system, this information sharing system, both as a
system to create and as a failure to train. But, again,
train on what? Train on the need, when you don't have
the system, to inform the other guy that you've just
made a deal with the informant.
JUSTICE BREYER: But I would like to follow
that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this
difference between what you are arguing now and what you
are arguing then matters. I don't understand it,
frankly. I don't actually understand it, because I
agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you
said: It's a failure to disseminate information. And
then you said: And it's a failure to train and
supervise. You did say that. Now, why that matters, I
don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does
matter, maybe it doesn't. So I have to say I don't
understand it. Now, help my understanding.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't think it does
matter.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I know you
don't, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried
about my understanding of your argument, and that's what
I am trying to get to. Answer this question, please,
because it will help me: The obvious response is the
response the Government made. You can take any -- which
is what Justice Alito said. So I would just like to you
elaborate on it. You can take anything that the D.A.
does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible
thing he did. And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he
is, okay? Or maybe he should be. There we are.
So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but
here's what I claim: You failed to have a system that
did... and now we fill in the blank. And whatever that
blank is, it's going to be something that would have
stopped him from doing this bad thing. In your case, it
happens to be an information dissemination system. In
other case, it would be some other kind of system that
would have the effect of stopping this bad thing. So,
their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so
can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the
end of immunity. Okay?
Now, what is your response? That's what I
want to know.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, my response to
that is very simple: I don't know of any other trial
right -- prosecutorial misconduct, that can be
controlled -- excuse me, where you can evade immunity
under our theory the way you can with a theory that is
based on the management --
JUSTICE BREYER: Sure, it's easy. What the
prosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous
prejudicial argument you'd ever see. So we say: What
you need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all
the time, are classes, or what you need is a special
section of the library where they have horrible
arguments underlined, okay?
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: And so, I can do that. So
can you. You are very good at it. And any good lawyer
can do that. And that's their point. So, if your only
response, that's your response, your point is that a
good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others,
I understand the response. I'm not sure I agree with
MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, and I was
beginning to say before that there is nothing at all
exotic about the theory. The same lines are being drawn
by this Court all the time. For example, in Kalina, a
very fine line between the prosecutor who is creating
charging documents on the one hand, writing them,
submitting them to the Court, and then on the other
hand, signing them. Or, in the investigative cases, the
line between the process of gathering information, the
raw data, on the one hand; and on the other hand, the
assessment of that data for trial.
And so, when you are talking about a
prosecutor and trying to hold the district attorney
vicariously liable for decisions of a trial lawyer, that
is just very different from trying to hold the district
attorney liable for the process of managing data, raw
information, that may or may not ever make its way into
a courtroom.
JUSTICE ALITO: Your theory applies to any
system of data dissemination. Is that -- would that be
correct?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Any one that is
constitutionally based, Your Honor. I mean, one where
you could imagine a prosecution on the other end with a
constitutional right that is violated.
JUSTICE ALITO: If the prosecutor has the
policy of failing to distribute to the line attorneys
the latest Ninth Circuit decision or the latest
decisions of this Court on important issues of criminal
constitutional procedure, because they just don't like
the way the law is developing in these areas. So they
like the law the way it existed at sometime in the past,
and they are just not going to distribute any of that.
Would that be a theory?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, you have to imagine a
world in which the district attorney is depriving people
of the tools of their trade so that they can't get it
elsewhere. There is actually a real case that I -- that
I've heard about where, you know, the district attorney
decided way back when to stop buying supplements for
statutory -- for statute books, and so district
attorneys, line prosecutors were charging under the
wrong statutes.
That, to me Your Honor, is a commissary
function. It is a function of an administrator trying
-- making decisions about how to arm the trial lawyer.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you this
question? I know we have an immunity case, but your
underlying cause of action, the one you just described,
the policy there of not filing supplements, or say you
had a policy of training lawyers how to evade the Batson
issue. There are all sorts of troublesome policies that
might be developed. Are you aware of any case in which
the court has held that such a policy can be challenged
in the abstract, in the -- as, sort of, on its face,
rather than as applied?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: You are asking whether the
policy --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The policy when they --
when they deny someone his Giglio rights or so on and so
on. Have you had any cases like this one in which a
court has held that such a cause of action is available
against an office policy?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: That such a cause of
action --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Can be brought under 1983
for such a general policy?
MR. ROSENKRANZ: In the absence of a
constitutional injury?
JUSTICE STEVENS: That it will produce on a
regular basis constitutional --
MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, I am aware
of any such case, but I will say --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that
in this case the absolute immunity question is harder
than the question that you present on the merits.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's actually
not, and I will tell you why. Our -- we do not have to
allege, for a 1983 case, that the conduct complained of
was unconstitutional. All we have to allege was that
the conduct caused a constitutional violation. So, for
83 purposes, this case is a case -- most clearly, most
prominently our theory would be that this case is a case
in which the district attorney was aware of this market
bazaar atmosphere of trading in illegal -- excuse me --
in perjured jailhouse confessions and did nothing to
intervene. It's sort of a classic Hanton claim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the bottom line would
be, if you are right, that every district attorney in
the country, large or small office, would have to have a
data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors,
informants that are used. That would be the
constitutional requirement for every supervising
prosecutor in the land.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Not necessarily, Your
Honor. First of all, Giglio imposes the -- or puts the
district attorneys on notice as to what they ought to be
doing. But the constitutional requirement would be when
you were aware of strong warnings of this bizarre
atmosphere in which jailhouse confessions are being used
in this way, and you are aware that lawyers on one side
of the office don't know what lawyers on the other side
of the office are doing, then, yes, you are deliberately
indifferent to the constitutional violations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was surprised by
your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I
thought it undermines your case. You said that you
don't have to show that the data system is
unconstitutional. You just have to show that it caused
a constitutional violation. But it would cause a
constitutional violation as applied in a particular
case. And you would object to it in that case, and
perhaps all this data sharing information system would
be very good evidence in that case. Look, he didn't
turn over this document. The reason he didn't turn it
over is because they've got a policy of not giving them
the document. But your objection would have to be based
in a particular case. And we have already held that in
that case there is absolute immunity.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that
is true of almost every prosecutorial immunity case.
The injury almost always happens when the lapse
materializes in injury in the courtroom.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. Now,
doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been
expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the
absolute immunity we recognized at trial.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, not any
more --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the data
system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional
violation. It's the application of it at trial. Now, I
know that's immune. You say, well, I'm going to get
around it.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, not any more, Your
Honor, than Buckley or Burns were circumnavigating
around Imbler. I mean in those cases, the
constitutional violations -- excuse me -- the acts that
were being challenged were fabricating evidence. Why?
The only purpose for fabricating the evidence was to
produce it in the courtroom. Giving legal advice to
extract a confession in a particular way. Why? The
only purpose was to use that in the courtroom.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you began this
dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying --
you don't have to prove that what you are complaining
about causes a -- is a constitutional violation. You
just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional
violation.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Right, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In all the examples
you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be
that --
MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, not -- under Cedank,
Your Honor, it was not -- it would not be a
constitutional violation to extract a confession from
someone until that confession is used in the courtroom.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that gets
-- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case.
When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link
it to a particular constitutional violation. The data
system has to be linked. But when you are talking about
immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do
with the constitutional violation. It's just shuffling
paper.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that's
exactly right. It is because the functional approach --
for purposes of a functional approach, you never look at
the case through the lens of a constitutional violation.
You look at it through the lens of the conduct that's
being challenged. So that's what, for example, this
Court did in Kalina. The constitutional violation
occurred in the courtroom, but the lens that the Court
looked at it through was the specific conduct where this
Court said --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But your client's standing
to challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was
the victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a
particular case for which the prosecutor has
absolute immunity.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that
is always true in an immunity case. It is always true
that the -- that the injury materializes in the
courtroom. And this Court said in Buckley and in Burns
it is utterly irrelevant where the injury materializes.
What is relevant is whether you have a --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But I think you told me
earlier that there are no prior cases in which such -- a
person who suffered such an injury can bring an
independent 1983 case challenging the policy at large.
MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, that's correct, Your
Honor, but it's a rare event that gets discovered.
Thank you, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Now, Mr. Coates, you have eight minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COATES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I think some of the Court's comments have
underscored the tension in this case that the nature of
the constitutional claim here: That the rights that
were actually violated are the Giglio and Brady rights.
But the function we are talking about is the function of
complying with Brady and Giglio.
You can do it in various fashions. Maybe
it's a data base. Maybe it's something else. Maybe in
some cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses
from testifying because you don't trust them. That is
essentially what the district attorney's policy is now.
It -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just,
willy-nilly, using jailhouse informants. They have
--
severe restrictions on what they can do.
It's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is
more directed to courtroom behavior than something
that's caveating the discretion of a particular line
prosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.
I think what we have here is a
constitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw
not just the causation, but the nature of the obligation
itself is tied to the prosecutorial function. Because
it's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the
disclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and --
and Giglio.
And so I would submit that under Imbler this
Court has already held that that conduct by an
individual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity.
And I submit that there is -- there is simply no
distinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in
the courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in
advance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a
chief advocate. If the Court has no further questions
JUSTICE BREYER: I suppose the distinction
he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it
right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems
that maybe administratively an office ought to have.
And where it turns out that this is really an
administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some
don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the
very presence of it would have prevented the -- the
individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he
did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim. That's an
administrative claim.
Just as if, for example, suppose you had no
secretary or assistants. He says, look, everybody
should have secretarial assistance. And if only you had
secretarial assistance, these people would not have
misread everything the way they did or would have gotten
the phone calls or would have done something like that.
That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line
there between something that is pretty purely
administrative and -- and something that is really
supervisory and training. And he is not saying
supervisory and training. He is saying that was a
separate claim.
MR. COATES: Well, I think it's hard for him
to get away from the manner in which he is trying to
characterize it as being just administrative because
it's not information just sitting there in a vacuum.
The key thing is the policy that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Training in today's world
or he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was.
They have information systems. They existed, and every
office ought to have them. And now he says I might lose
on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of
claim that falls within Imbler. I think that's his
point. I'm not positive. He doesn't have to take my --
MR. COATES: I think that is -- that is the
point. But I think our point is that trying to
characterize that as an administrative system strips it
of the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the
data. I mean, according to them, the reason we have the
obligation is because of the prosecutorial obligation
under Giglio and Brady to make sure that exculpatory
information gets out there. So it's -- it's not just
administrative.
And I -- I assume if you look at the Ninth
Circuit decision -- and I -- and one of the main focuses
of the Ninth Circuit's decision in the case was not so
much that it was merely administerial. It kind of
reached that conclusion on this notion that decisions
about all cases are different than decisions about a
particular case.
And I think our point is that, in looking at
the -- at the function performed here, you can't make
that distinction. That it really -- there really isn't
a distinction.  That if you are making a decision for
all cases, then you are making a decision for that
particular case.
There is no difference from making a policy
in advance and saying everybody has to follow it. And
then, as I mentioned before, the criminal complaint is
filed, and you send out an e-mail saying comply with
Brady, or this is how you comply with Brady. There is
no real difference there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case was
