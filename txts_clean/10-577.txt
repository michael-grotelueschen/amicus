CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
next in Case 10-577, Kawashima v. Holder.
Mr. Whalen.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WHALEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima came here to the
United States as legal immigrants in 1985. And later
on, they pled guilty to filing a false statement under a
corporate tax return. The issue we bring to the Court
is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an
aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the
aggravated felony statute.
This Court many times has held that it is
the elements of the crime of conviction that determine
whether a crime is an aggravated felony. And the
elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the
immigration statute. And the terms of that statute is
basically as the Department of Justice has written in
its Tax Manual. It is basically a tax perjury statute.
If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you're
saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's
perjury.
There are other statutes, perjury statute,
which in essence says the same thing. And 18 U.S.C.
1001 is also a perjury statute. And none of them
require the Justice Department or a court to determine
whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How would you prove fraud
and deceit beyond proving that the person lied,
intentionally lied? What -- what is added to
intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or
deceit?
MR. WHALEN: It's the intention to deceive
or the intention to defraud. And simply --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't intentionally
lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?
MR. WHALEN: It does not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't?
MR. WHALEN: It does not mean, because you
are saying a false -- making a false statement, that
that is evidence of an intent to deceive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Whalen, the common
definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a
false impression, intentionally giving a false
impression with the intent that someone will act on it.
So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return
is. You give a false impression of what your income is
with the intent that the IRS will accept it.
MR. WHALEN: Justice Ginsburg, the
difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it
is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit.
Under section 7201, the tax evasion statute, that
includes both a requirement or a finding of fraud and
deceit. Section 7206 does not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why isn't it obvious?
What proof would you need? You submit a document
because you want to convey a false impression for
someone to act on. Why do you have to have anything
more than that to establish deceit?
MR. WHALEN: Because the requirements, Your
Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a
false statement. That's all that's required. The IRS,
when they go after a taxpayer because they have not
provided -- they have not disclosed all of their income,
the IRS comes in, or rather the Department of Justice,
and all they have to prove is that it's false. They
don't have to prove --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that it's willful.
And that it's willful.
MR. WHALEN: Pardon me, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That it's willful.
Whoever willfully makes a false statement.
MR. WHALEN: Yes, Your Honor, but as this
Court held --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's not correct.
MR. WHALEN: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, correct me if I'm
wrong. It would seem to me, just from reading the
statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think
it's true but it's false, from the way you were
indicating, would be a violation. That's not the way I
read it. Now, have we said something other than that in
later cases?
MR. WHALEN: If I may, Your Honor. This
Court has written in the Spies case, and specifically in
the Bishop case, that in order to be convicted of any
tax offense under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS or
the Department of Justice must show it was done
willfully. Willfully is not intrinsic to any -- it's
really intrinsic to all of the tax offenses.
"Willfully" does not mean deceit or fraud. It simply
means that the IRS cannot bring a criminal information
or indictment against somebody who does something
unintentionally. They must do it willfully.
"Willfully," as this Court defined in Bishop, is simply
evidence that -- to commit any of these IRS crimes you
must -- it must be shown to have been done willfully.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You must know that it's
false when you say it. Isn't that what "willfully"
means? You must know that the statement you're making
is false.
MR. WHALEN: "Willfully" means
intentionally. The false, I submit --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want another
adverb.
MR. WHALEN: No. All right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I want you to describe what
it means in the context of a statement. Doesn't it mean
that you have to know that the statement you are making
is false? Isn't that enough for willfulness?
MR. WHALEN: That's what -- that -- yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, you tell me
what deceit involves beyond that.
MR. WHALEN: Deceit involves an intention to
induce somebody to act. And what I'm arguing to this
Court is that simply making a false statement under a
tax perjury statute such as we have in this case does
not meaning and does not evidence an intention to
deceive or a finding.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm a little
bit lost here.
Your definition of "deceit" is a false
statement with an intent for the other party to rely.
And you don't see that when you file your tax returns
that the government is relying on your statement to
calculate your tax and to ensure that you've paid it?
You don't see any reliance by the government on the
truthful statements there and its collection of taxes?
MR. WHALEN: I -- I do see reliance as
generally is what happens. What I'm saying is that 7206
is a perjury statute and the government does not have to
prove, and did not have to prove in this case, anything
more than the -- the income was unreported or the tax --
the tax return was -- was false. If --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it also had to prove
that the government relied? Is that what you're saying
the --
MR. WHALEN: I'm saying that the
government was -- if the government wanted to prove
fraud or deceit, they -- that would be an element of the
crime of tax evasion --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not even sure why,
because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax
evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax. You
don't have to make a statement at all. You can take the
money from the bank, withdraw it openly, and stick it in
your mattress, refuse to pay, and if somehow they find
your mattress, you can be charged with tax evasion.
MR. WHALEN: And the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where's the false and
deceit in that?
MR. WHALEN: The government would have to
prove fraud or deceit, because an intent to evade is --
the Court -- the -- the government has to prove --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there's a -- if there
are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your
argument? Of which there are many that say that the
avoidance of taxes, tax payment, doesn't require an act
of fraud or deceit?
MR. WHALEN: I would be surprised by
those --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose somebody
goes -- he goes to a country where we have no
extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a
postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying
ha-ha-ha.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, why wouldn't that
be an attempt to evade? That's why he went; he didn't
like to pay his taxes.
MR. WHALEN: Then the government would bring
an action under the --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, 7201. Why can't
you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201? I mean, my
simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you
are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section
(43). And you read -- you try to get the fraud and
deceit crimes, okay? So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and
(2). And you see for both of those, you can't be
convicted unless you materially and willfully make a
false statement.
So, you think, hey, I don't need a special
section on that one. But then you go to 7201, and you
say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate
this by going off to some special country, taking all
his assets and writing ha-ha-ha. Now, there's no fraud
and deceit in that. He's totally open about it. But he
sure has evaded it. So, therefore, I better write a
special section.
Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but
what's wrong with it?
MR. WHALEN: What's wrong with it, Your
Honor, is that what we're talking about is the
aggravated felony statute. And the issue -- and it may
be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the
conviction under 7206, which does not require anything
more than filing of a false statement without any intent
to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated
felony. And this Court has said time and again that it
is the elements of the offense that determines
aggravated felony.
If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a
conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as
including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the
Justices have indicated, that, you know, that when
somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be
deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop
a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil
collection action.
So, this is what Commissioner Walters was
concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in
effect would undermine the ability of the government to
get an easy conviction based simply on a false
statement.
Similarly, if you are convicted of tax
evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud.
He is collaterally estopped. And as we know, when the
government goes to seek recovery -- that is, getting the
taxes back in a civil proceeding -- there's no statute
of limitations.
The intention of Congress is also reflected
in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a
person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks
to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding,
Congress particularly said that where there's a
conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of
proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or
rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there
was an attempt to evade the tax. But the conclusion is
the same.
If Congress had intended that proof of fraud
and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at
all for Congress to put that in 70 -- 6501.
Therefore --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That's
U.S.C. 6501?
MR. WHALEN: Yes. To be more precise,
6501(c)(1).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. WHALEN: That is the exceptions to the
running of the statute of limitations.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have that in the
briefs?
MR. WHALEN: I have it in my reply brief. I
don't have the particular statute, but I refer to it in
the reply brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have the text of it?
MR. WHALEN: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't like counsel
getting up here and talking about statutes that they've
never put before us. If you're going to rely on it, we
-- we would like to have the text somewhere.
MR. WHALEN: Yes. I apologize for that,
Your Honor.
I would like to move to the second part of
my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this
Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking
canons of construction. And one of the important canons
is that different words have different meanings.
So, in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or
victims in excess of $10,000, and in (M)(ii), we have a
revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000. And
as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii),
this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct
assessment I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with
injuries or damage to third parties, not to the
government.
If you take the government's position that
fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit
revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be
worthless or pointless.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why? Because it
wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or
defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a
willful lie. It would be adding to the -- to the fraud
and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie.
It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing
postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I
just ain't gonna pay it. There's no fraud and deceit
there. It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to
evade or defeat tax.
MR. WHALEN: Well, anyone who leaves the
country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax
evasion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. That's my
very point.
MR. WHALEN: And that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Without lying -- without
lying -- without making a single lie.
MR. WHALEN: What I'm saying is that fraud,
such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an
aggravated felony. It's the only one that Congress
says -- only revenue offense, only offense under the
Internal Revenue Code which Congress designated as an
aggravated felony.
What I'm saying is that if tax evasion were
also included in (M)(i), then Congress would have
created a useless, pointless provision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And my point is that
it would not have been included within (M)(i). There is
no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it
does not involve fraud or deceit. It does not involve a
lie, as 7206 does.
MR. WHALEN: 7201 involves, I'm suggesting
that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: An attempt to evade or
defeat -- "who willfully attempts in any manner to evade
or defeat any tax." And one can do that without lying.
One can do that by simply not report income, for
example. Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful
example, by going to Cuba. Was it Cuba or somewhere
else?
(Laughter.)
MR. WHALEN: Well, the point I am trying to
make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example
of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime
of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it
would be -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if
the government's position was upheld.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that was
being made is not that it's fraud and deceit. Quite the
opposite. I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,
Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the
evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading
payment where you say nothing. What would be the crime
if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a
return, so you are not filing anything that's false?
Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --
MR. WHALEN: That would be a violation of
one of the other Internal Revenue crimes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it be evasion
simply not to report your income?
MR. WHALEN: If the government chose to
prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would.
The Internal Revenue's statute and crimes all carry the
duty to -- it's a legal duty we all have of fairly
reporting our income, our deductions, what have you.
It's the same legal duty whether it's in 7201 or 7206.
The difference is, in tax evasion, there
must be a proof of fraud or deceit. That's inherent.
From the beginning of this country -- rather, beginning
of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated
revenue statutes from other crimes. In this case,
(M)(i) deals with crimes involving third parties;
(M)(ii) deals with revenue loss crimes to the
government. Only (i) is an aggravated felony.
I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Congress's specific reference to tax evasion
in subparagraph (M)(ii) of the INA's definition of
aggravated felony did not remove all other tax offenses
from the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gannon, do you think
that you can commit tax evasion without committing
either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show
that?
MR. GANNON: The cases that we cited in our
brief on page 34 that discuss this are ones that are
evasion of payment cases as opposed to evasion of
assessment cases. And those -- those are instances in
which somebody could accurately file a tax return and
say I owe you this amount of money and then take steps
to prevent the IRS from collecting on it, usually by
removing their assets from the IRS's reach.
As a factual matter, it so happens that most
of those cases will often involve some concealment along
the way. If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold
coins out of the country to take them to a Swiss bank,
they often don't mention that when they're leaving the
country.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just not filing
a return?
MR. GANNON: Just not filing a return is
probably not going to be enough to establish tax
evasion. That would be an offense under 7203, which
doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit. The thing
that distinguishes 7201 is the need for the government
to establish that there is an attempt to evade either
the assessment or payment of taxation.
JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, I suppose what
confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201,
they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil
fraud suit; isn't that right? And it also counts as a
crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud. And all
of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases
as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud.
MR. GANNON: Well, certainly in the context
of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has
concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an
understatement due to fraud. And the reason why it has
refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206
offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is
because the 7206 offense does not require the government
to have proved that there was any understatement to
begin with. And so, there could not have been an
understatement due to fraud.
I'd also note that it's not at all clear
that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that
I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion,
that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be
applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is
triggered by an understatement of an amount required to
be shown on the return. And, therefore, if it isn't --
if it isn't actually something that's done in the
context of filing a tax return that understates how much
you owe the government, then -- then that may well not
trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on
civil case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what did
you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Are there
any tax provisions that you think are not covered by the
fraud and deceit section and the tax evasion section?
MR. GANNON: You mean --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Any tax crime.
MR. GANNON: Any tax crime --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Felonies, I should say.
MR. GANNON: There are several tax offenses
that don't necessarily involve fraud or deceit. So,
parts of 7202, which is the willful failure to collect
tax, would not necessarily involve fraud and deceit, but
it also covers failing to truthfully account for
collected tax. So, some of those offenses would involve
fraud or deceit, and it may be divisible. 7203, which I
just mentioned --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that fall under tax
evasion, or that's a separate statute?
MR. GANNON: That's not tax evasion. The
only thing that counts as tax evasion is 7201.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I cut you off. Which
are the other ones?
MR. GANNON: I was saying that I already
mentioned to Justice Scalia that section 7203 -- all of
these offenses I'm talking about are in 26 U.S.C.; 7203,
the willful failure to file a return or to pay tax or
maintain records or supply information doesn't
necessarily involve fraud or deceit. Parts of 7204,
which is failing to furnish a statement to the employee
reflecting the amount of taxes, but not -- but then,
again, I think it could be divisible because it would
also apply to furnishing a false statement to your
employee. Even the misdemeanor offense under 7207 for
presenting false documents might be covered for fraud or
deceit, but in practice it's only used when there's --
it's only used when the tax deficiencies are de minimis.
And so, it would never trigger the $10,000 loss
requirement that (M)(i) would also require us to
establish in order to make it an aggravated felony.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --
what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i)
argument?
MR. GANNON: Well, my answer is that I don't
think it proves really any more than the collateral
estoppel cases in the civil fraud context. The
provision that we're talking about is not reprinted in
any of the briefs, but 6501(c)(1) is an exception that
-- that lifts the limitation on when the IRS can levy an
assessment or seek collection; and it refers to the case
of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade
tax. And I think that in context, the reference to a
false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax is
not something that clearly connotes that Congress is
just speaking to 7206 offenses. It uses not only the
word "fraudulent," but also "the intent to evade tax,"
which I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, but I
think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is
7206 is fraud and false statements. And he said if
you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't
have had to add "with the intent to evade tax," which is
what they do in 6501(c)(1).
MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think if you look
to (c)(2), it also refers to a willful attempt in any
manner to defeat or evade tax. So, the next provision
also applies more broadly to 7201 and more closely
tracks the definition in 7201. So, I think just like
the statute of limitations provision that we note,
Congress is probably using a belt and suspenders
approach there, that -- we noted that Congress may well
have had reason to be concerned that 7201 offenses would
not necessarily be seen as having fraud or deceit as an
element of the offense in light of this Court's decision
in Scharton, which was an old case, but it had said that
in the -- in the statute of limitations context, that
the -- the extended statute of limitations that apply to
offenses in which fraud was an element was not triggered
by the statutory predecessor to tax evasion. And so, to
the --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But Scharton was a very old
case which had been distinguished away by many courts.
It really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell
me if I'm wrong, but --
MR. GANNON: Well, to this day section 6531,
which is the statute of limitations provision which we
do reprint in our appendix, includes provisions that
refer not only generally to offenses involving fraud but
also specifically to a tax evasion offense. And so, I
think that the fact that Congress had already felt like
it needed to be expressed, to pull in not just fraud
offenses but also tax evasion offenses in 6531, makes it
unsurprising that they would have pursued a similar
approach here. In addition, I would --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, the paradoxical
thing about your argument is that, one, it makes us
think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about
this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses
were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost
always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was
thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that
maybe there was going to be some conviction out there
that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress
is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same
time, that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly
clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction
which is that one does not write superfluous language.
MR. GANNON: But, Justice Kagan, we don't
think it's superfluous, in part because of the evasion
of payment cases we're talking about, but I think also
if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph
(43), the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that
there are several other provisions that have significant
overlap in them. And so subparagraph (A) refers to
murder and rape; those would also generally be covered
in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F). The same
thing is true in paragraph (E)(i); it pulls in various
explosives offenses including arson, destruction of
property or building by fire or explosives; that's the
reference to an 8441 --
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, our rule of statutory
construction when it comes to this aggravated felony
statute is that superfluity doesn't matter?
MR. GANNON: No, Justice Kagan, I think that
in context, there is a lot of overlap among the
different provisions in -- in paragraph (43) already,
and I -- I was also going to mention subparagraph (K)(i)
and (ii), which like (M)(i) and (M)(ii), are ones that
have little (i), which has a generic reference there to
offenses associated with managing a prostitution
business, and little (ii) then expressly refers to
certain enumerated Federal statutes, all of which
involve transporting individuals for purposes of
prostitution in the case of seeking commercial
advantage.
And I think that virtually all of those
offenses would have been included within (K)(i), but
Congress wanted to be sure and, therefore, added
(K)(ii). And as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, pointed
out before, textually it -- it had reason to think that
7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here in --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But 7206 is the lesser
offense. I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute
that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is,
evasion. It gets a more severe penalty. And when
Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only,
why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant
with respect to aggravated felonies? That there's one
tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that
label. And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many,
many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and
loss to the victim?
MR. GANNON: The reason why we don't think
that's appropriate is in part because, as I've
explained, there would -- there is some aspect of which
(M)(ii) is not superfluous. But, more importantly, we
don't think that the specific controls -- the general
canon is triggered here, and we don't think that (M)(ii)
talks about a category of tax crimes or tax offenses
more generally, because it only refers to one offense.
And so, the cases that Petitioners invoke
here, in order to establish that there is a category
that's being pulled out of (M)(i), are HCSC-Laundry and
Leocal. Those are both cases in which the statute
actually identified the category of offenses in
question, whether it was the cooperative hospital
service organizations in HCSC-Laundry or DUI offenses in
Leocal.
And so, here we don't have Congress actually
saying tax offenses are covered by (M)(ii). What it
says is tax evasion is covered by (M)(ii). And --
JUSTICE BREYER: But what about -- what
about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201.
Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us
was, does 7206 fit within the term "aggravated felony";
i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit?
So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything
about fraud or deceit. It says perjury and making a
false statement. So, then we go look up what were the
torts of fraud and deceit. And he's right. Fraud
traditionally requires an intent to get another person
to act, but you don't have to have that intent to
violate 7206. And deceit -- it not only involves that;
it also involves the person having acted.
So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have
to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to
his detriment. Fraud, you have the first of those and
second. You read the statute and say, well, say neither
of those is present here. This is just perjury, which
isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit. And there we
are, not in the statute. What's the answer to that?
MR. GANNON: Well, I don't think that the
common law definitions of fraud and deceit are the ones
that this Court has always applied in the context --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not always. But
here we were dealing with a very serious statute,
aggravated felonies. That has terrible consequences for
the persons who fall within it.
MR. GANNON: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- and in most of these
M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to
statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it,
is very specific. So, when we read these words "fraud"
and "deceit" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit
means fraud and deceit?
MR. GANNON: Well, in the --
JUSTICE BREYER: The traditional elements.
MR. GANNON: In the criminal context, the
Court has recognized that fraud offenses don't require
the government to prove reliance or damages. And that
makes sense. If you think about the tort action, the
classic tort action, you would need to be an injured
plaintiff; and, therefore, you would need to be able to
say I relied on this to my detriment --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no.
MR. GANNON: -- and I want to recover.
JUSTICE BREYER: You have to prove that the
-- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment.
MR. GANNON: And --
JUSTICE BREYER: Which he may or may not
have done. I mean, when you commit -- a person who
commits perjury may or may not have intended that a
victim rely to his detriment. Which you don't have to
prove here.
MR. GANNON: We do not have to prove as a
separate element that there's reliance or intended
reliance here, but we do need to prove what we think
satisfies the plain meaning of the term "deceit." We're
not focusing on fraud here but deceit, and that's the
act of intentionally giving a false impression, because
the elements of this offense are making and signing a
return under the penalties of perjury that it is false
as to a material matter, that the defendant does not --
JUSTICE BREYER: Deceit can mean that.
You're absolutely right.
MR. GANNON: -- does not believe to be true
or correct, and it's all done willfully.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, the tort didn't involve
that. The tort involved the same element of fraud which
you don't want to rely on.
MR. GANNON: That -- that's right, and we
think here Congress has used the -- the term --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- is there
any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument
other than that you just think that and you could argue
the other way? I mean, can we get anywhere?
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that Congress did
use the terms disjunctively here. And I think that now
the plain meaning of "deceit" is -- it sort of operates
in the opposite direction of the one that you're talking
about, Justice Breyer. And if you look at the way the
Court in Yermian discussed the difference between an
intent to defraud and intent to deceive, it talks about
an intent to defraud includes actually obtaining
something, whereas an intent to deceive just involves
creating a false impression. And so, I think that
actually the difference can run the other direction in a
way that supports the definition that we're relying upon
here.
But going back to the point that I was
trying to make about this not ruling out all tax
offenses, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the reference
to 7201 alone doesn't do that, nor do we think the fact
that Congress then added a limited -- limiting language
that said that when the revenue loss exceeds $10,000, it
would satisfy (M)(ii).
JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure,
Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about
superfluity? Because when I asked whether (M) -- the
second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to
these evasion-of-payment cases. And you cite two of
them. But then you say even those cases will almost
invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud. So,
are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or
otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of
fraud?
MR. GANNON: Well, I think that's as a
factual matter, Justice Kagan. We were --
JUSTICE KAGAN: As a factual matter, are
there any?
MR. GANNON: We were observing that as a
factual matter, those evasion-of-payment cases probably
would not happen without there being acts of
concealment, but that doesn't --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's what I'm asking.
As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that
do not involve affirmative acts of fraud?
MR. GANNON: I don't believe that I can, but
I think that to the extent that the Court is looking to
the elements of the offense in 7201, if they're talking
about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily
require deceptive acts of concealment. And so, that's
the reason --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I know, but we have a very
active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and
you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases
under this section that don't involve affirmative acts
of fraud.
MR. GANNON: Well --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that makes me wonder why
Congress was so worried about this problem that it
ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation.
MR. GANNON: Well -- and I believe that the
reason that they were worried could be because of the
Scharton decision, in which this Court had already said
that evasion does not necessarily require fraud, because
the textual cues in 7201 are much further from fraud and
deceit than those in 7206; that there's also -- there
would be less certainty. Even assuming that Congress
was well aware of the established practice at the
Federal level of having 7201 tax evasion cases be
compared with fraud, this is also a provision that
applies to State and foreign offenses. The penultimate
sentence of paragraph (43) says that the term applies to
an offense whether it's in violation of Federal or State
law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was one of the
problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which
actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to
include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in
offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and
local level. It would really swell the category of tax
crimes that lead to deportation. That -- did Congress
really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons?
And then there was a very practical point
made, that the government is going to be hurt more than
helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that
very often the government will try to make a bargain.
It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard
to prove. So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206. And
if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there
will be many, many people who will say: If it's a
question of whether I get thrown out of the United
States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead
to something that will mean immediately when I serve my
time I will be thrown out of the United States.
MR. GANNON: Well, that may well be the
consequence of the definition that Congress has adopted
here of aggravated felony. And I would note that in the
plea agreement that Mr. Kawashima filed in this case,
paragraph 4, which is reprinted on page 117a of the
petition appendix says Mr. Kawashima recognizes that he
may be deported as a result of his conviction. That's
in his plea agreement to the 7206 offense here.
And so, it is, to be sure, the case that the
government may well find it more difficult to secure
guilty pleas when an alien is -- is admitting to an
offense that is an aggravated felony. But we think that
that's a consequence of Congress having expanded the
definition. In --
JUSTICE BREYER: Let me go up to start with
Justice Ginsburg's first question. I mean, if this
falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury?
Is every perjury statute within it? And what about
lying to an FBI agent? And what about lying to a
government official, which is -- which is -- you know,
there are all kinds of statutes on that one.
MR. GANNON: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Are all those aggravated
felonies?
MR. GANNON: Congress has given us two
different metrics for determining whether those --
whether those offenses are aggravated felonies. If they
involve fraud or deceit and there is loss to the victim
exceeding $10,000 --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.
MR. GANNON: -- then that it could fall
within (M)(i). If it's perjury statute that doesn't
involve loss or a false statement to an FBI agent that
doesn't involve loss to --
JUSTICE BREYER: The government's view is
that, of course, you have to meet the other
requirements. But as far as the words "fraud" or
"deceit" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every
perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI
agent, lying to this or lying to that. And has that
been the consistent policy of the immigration service?
Have they deported people where the other two conditions
are fulfilled?
MR. GANNON: In the beginning, when the
amount of loss was $200,000. I think most perjury
offenses don't involve a loss of more than $10,000 --
JUSTICE BREYER: But all I need are a few.
I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and
the government to deport people where these other things
are met -- which they would be perhaps rarely; I don't
know -- but to deport them where the crime, the
underlying crime, is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or
lying to other government officials?
MR. GANNON: There -- yes, there are such
cases. Sometimes they go under (S), which is the
paragraph for perjury, which was actually not in
existence when (M)(i) was added to the statute. It was
added 2 years later. But, more generally, I would like
to mention that there are other tax offenses --
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I'm confused by
the $10,000 requirement. Does that have to be an
element of the offense?
MR. GANNON: It does not need to be an
element of the offense. It's a consequence of the
Court's decision in Nijhawan.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just a consequence of the
-- of the fraud or deceit, right?
MR. GANNON: It needs to be tied to the
offense of conviction under this Court's decision in
Nijhawan. And most instances where somebody lies to an
FBI agent probably don't involve costing somebody more
than $10,000. And so, I think that it doesn't often
come up in (M)(i). But many other tax offenses are
prosecuted under other provisions that potentially
involve fraud or deceits and could -- can cost the
government more than $10,000.
And Petitioner's reading of saying that all
tax offenses have to be pulled into (M)(ii) and then
only tax evasion is covered would require the Court to
bifurcate all of these other provisions. And I'm
thinking of, for instance, 18 U.S.C. 371. This is the
provision for defrauding the United States by
obstructing or impeding the IRS in its efforts to
collect taxation. This Court cited 371 as one of the
fraud offenses that it thought was covered by (M)(i) in
the Nijhawan decision.
The same is true for mail fraud. The
criminal division, the tax division can prosecute tax
cases in which somebody mails a false tax return under
U.S.C. 1341. False claims under 18 U.S.C. 287,
conspiracy to false claims under 286, false statements
to the government -- these are all provisions that are
used to prosecute tax offenses. And Petitioner's
reading of saying that all tax crimes are pulled out
would require the Court to bifurcate these offenses and
make whether it's an aggravated felony turn on whether
the government has lost revenue as opposed to some other
form of money. And we don't think that that's what
Congress intended when it went to the trouble of just
stating that tax evasion was expressly covered.
And going back, Justice Kagan, to your
concerns about superfluity, I do think it's important
that in the context of this statute, there's lots of
other overlap. Congress had reasons to be unsure in
light of the Scharton decision, in light of the
evasion-of-payment cases because, even though as a
factual matter --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But it would have been
perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which
said just in case that you -- you know, just in case
this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean
tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that
appears to exclude all other tax offenses.
MR. GANNON: I don't see how -- if Congress
wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they
should have put that exception in (M)(i). They should
have said offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not
tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims
exceeds $10,000. If Congress wanted to make an
exception tax offenses --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's just arguing
against our application of the normal rule of avoiding
superfluity where we can.
MR. GANNON: Well, yes. I agree that the
Court avoids superfluity where it can. Here we have
contextual reasons to think that Congress was just
trying to add more offenses to the definition rather
than rule out an entire class. And I also think that
there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating
all of those other provisions under Petitioner's
reading.
And so, if you were to say that the
reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses,
that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the
government in which the government loses more than
$10,000 count and some don't. Same for wire fraud.
Same for false statements. Same for false claims,
conspiracy to false claims, and Klein conspiracies under
section 371, which -- which are -- have a great deal of
overlap with 7201.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They still wouldn't -- no.
Why? They still wouldn't be tax offenses.
MR. GANNON: Well, I -- they would be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you use the mail to
avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use
of the mail to defraud.
MR. GANNON: But the -- I mean, as I
understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that
(M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that
makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving
tax offenses. And I think that if a mail fraud offense
against the government involved taking -- getting more
than $10,000 worth of refunds from the government as
opposed to getting more than $10,000 in an ill-gotten
government contract or government benefits from the
government, that that could still be characterized as
revenue loss.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he put it -- he put
it wrong. He should have said -- just tax statutes are
covered.
MR. GANNON: Well, that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Then -- then you wouldn't
have to bifurcate, right?
MR. GANNON: Then I just don't see how the
reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all
other tax provisions --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not just that.
It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the
victim or victims. And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to
the government has to exceed 10,000. I mean, in one
case, it's the loss to the victim or victims. Why --
why did it use parallel language? Why -- or why did it
say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the
loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i)
involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section
7201 of Title 26? I mean, if -- if you read it, it
seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with
revenue loss to the government.
And I find it hard to regard the government
as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the
truth.
MR. GANNON: Well, I -- none of the courts
of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the
government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000
in a fraud case or, indeed, in a tax evasion case. And
so, here, there is a different phrase, but I think
what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of
revenue loss offenses. Instead, it defines a class of
tax evasion offenses. It only refers to the one
statute. And -- and then in that context, where there
has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a
7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency. Then
it's natural to talk about the relevant losses being
revenue loss to the government.
The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it
also applies to other types of frauds. And I think that
the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is
intending to read out all tax offenses.
As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before,
although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty,
which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies
under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that
particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter
the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing, the
-- the same criteria that are both tied to loss. And
more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like
371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18, actually have longer
maximum punishments.
So, if the government wants -- has a
particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after
somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've
cost the government a great deal of money, it may choose
to proceed under one of the other provisions where it
can get an even greater punishment. And so, just
referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows
it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a technical
aspect of this case I don't understand. Maybe you can
explain it. There was a question about what might be
the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife. Why
should the revenue loss be different? She's -- she's
convicted of aiding and abetting.
MR. GANNON: She -- although it's -- the
statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring,
or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting
statute. It doesn't require there to be an underlying
primary violation. It's an independent offense.
And so, as it happens in this case, we all
know and it's not disputed that they're for the same
underlying false tax return, the same tax return that
ended in 1991 for one of the corporations that
Petitioners co-owned, but -- but we just didn't have
that evidence in the record.
And so, I think even though it's an aiding
and abetting, it's -- it's not a classic aiding and
abetting violation that depends on the husband's
conviction. She could have been convicted under 7206,
too, even if the husband didn't know anything about the
false numbers that she was providing him from the
restaurant that they were operating.
So, if there are no further questions, we'd
urge the Court to affirm the court of appeals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Whalen, you have 8 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WHALEN: My colleague mentioned the
Yermian case, which is in our brief, but I failed to
present it to the Court today. And it's a very
important case decided by this Court, which said that
filing a false statement is not -- is not indicative,
not evidence, of an intent to deceive.
Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, as also
decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held
that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges'
involvement with the Communist Party does not evidence
fraud.
And these cases, I believe, of this Court
control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an
essential element of this crime of conviction.
Following up what Justice Kagan has said or has asked,
that the rules -- canons of construction that the
Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluity --
against superfluity; the idea that the court must give
cognizance to different words mean different things;
that is, revenue loss from the government is different
from loss to a victim or victims; and the specific
versus the general.
The answer of the Government is simply
speculation and conjecture of, among other things,
courts make the wrong decisions; Congress didn't
understand that tax evasion does involve fraud; and,
therefore, it will be superfluous.
The position of the Government in this case
is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may
not be in (M)(ii), the reason that -- rather, that fraud
and deceit may not be in tax evasion, but that a lesser
revenue offense is in (M)(i).
I would like to remind the Court, as many of
the Justices have indicated, that we're not looking at
an idea of someone who suffers a penalty because -- as a
result of the tax offense. We're talking about
banishment. And we're talking about deportation. And
the statute in which we're -- of which we're involved
should be read in favor -- where the Congress has not
been clear, the statute should be read in favor of the
immigrant.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Although it's not a
criminal statute?
MR. WHALEN: Pardon me, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a criminal
statute.
MR. WHALEN: This Court in the Fong case
said that the rule of lenity applies to an immigration
case. And the holdings of this Court have been
consistent that the rule of lenity applies to both
criminal cases as well as immigration cases. And I
invite the Court to look at the cases we have cited that
the rule of lenity has applied, in fact, to immigration
cases.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there's one
technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand.
The particular tax here in question, the failure to
report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that
was given for the total failure to report is over
1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is
245,000. Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than
the failure to report 76,000.
MR. WHALEN: The threshold amount is not an
issue in the case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd just like to know how
we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated,
given that the crime that was charged, the failure was
to report only 76,000?
MR. WHALEN: I don't know. It was in
negotiations between the government and the Kawashimas.
In any compromise, the government chose only to charge
them with a crime under 7206, which -- and to settle on
that basis. As Justice Alito has mentioned in the
Padilla case quite emphatically, that attorneys
representing immigrants deal with the government in
order to avoid deportation. And that -- in this case
whether the Kawashimas in fact had filed false returns
in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards,
because the government and the taxpayer agreed that
their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read
the elements -- and you can read the Justice Department
handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it
does not include fraud and deceit.
If there are no further questions, I --
finally, I would like to mention one case which hasn't
been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the
Justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we
cited, Nugent, mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's
question, that the Nugent case said that you must
fulfill both elements, that is perjury, (S) under the
statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you
must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue.
And, of course, in this case, the Kawashimas
did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet
the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1
year.
But in any event, I want -- I would like the
Court to keep in mind that what we are dealing here with
is perjury, and we're not dealing with fraud or deceit,
as agreed to by the government and the taxpayer. And
that, I suggest to the Court, should be dispositive in
the decision in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the
