Mr. Schoenfield.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
In enacting section 1252(a)(2)(B), Congress
limited its reduction of judicial review to where the
authority for the Attorney General's discretion is
specified under subchapter 2 of chapter 12 of Title 8.
Congress did not express any intent to
remove the courts’ jurisdiction to review discretionary
decisions, the authority for which is specified under
any other subchapter or in regulations, nor did Congress
express any intent to delegate its constitutional
responsibility to determine Federal jurisdiction to the
Attorney General --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under what authority
were these regulations issued?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: The regulation that grants
discretion with regard to motions to reopen comes from a
section in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2, of the
regulations. And that was authorized by section 1103 of
Title 8.
I should say the authorizing statute for
the regulation is in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2.
And that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that -- how does
that read? I -- I recall the briefs say that, but I
don't recall reading it. Is it -- does it appear
somewhere?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1103, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the provision that
-- that you contend provides the authority for the
Attorney General's regulation.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1103(g)(2)
authorizes the Attorney General to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I know. Where is it, I'm
asking? Is it -- is it in the briefs somewhere?
You know, it's nice to know what we are
talking about. When -- when you are relying on a
section, it would be nice to have it in the materials.
I mean, I guess I can send for it, but --
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Sure. It -- it indicates,
on page 18 of the reply brief, that, quote, "Establish
such regulations... as he deems necessary for carrying
out his authority under the provisions of this chapter."
The fact that the statute we are focused on
states that authority must be specified in this
subchapter -- being subchapter 2 --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Two. The -- the key word
that is emphasized in this case is it's "under,"
instead of "in."
MR. SCHOENFIELD: The word used in the --
in the statute is "under," which, of course, has a
variety of definitions. We believe that taking the
statute in context, that the correct definition to apply
is "according to" or "within."
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be clearer if
it had said "in."
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Congress could have said
"in," but I think Congress made it clear by using the
phrase "authority specified under," so we’re not -- we
don't have a situation where, as Congress usually would
do, they would say: a regulation under such and such a
statute, where Congress uses the word "regulations."
There is the -- the term "regulation" is not used in the
statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you were to
evaluate the validity of the regulation, I suppose,
like, an APA case or similar to that, what statutory
provision would you look to, to see if the regulation
was consistent with that statutory provision?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: We would look to section
03 in subchapter 1.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it really doesn't matter
what "under" means, right? I mean, even -- even if you
accept the other interpretation of "under," to wit, that
it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your
point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to
the subchapter.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's absolutely correct,
Your Honor. Although we don't think regulations are
included, even if they were, it's not in the subchapter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but -- is that
right? Would -- would subchapter 1 give you much
insight into the scope of the regulation and how it was
a fair interpretation of the authority under which the
Attorney General purported to act?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: I think that in terms of
looking at the discretion of the Attorney General,
historically, on motions to reopen, there have been --
there has been discretion.
What the regulation did was to codify that
historical authority and to be consistent with what the
courts had always done, but I think, in interpreting
the scope of Congress's intent to reduce judicial
review, we need to be very careful about that,
obviously. And so, therefore, when it says "as under
authority specified in this subchapter," we need to find
the authority in the subchapter, which we don't.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- subchapter 2
does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered
spouses, children, and parents. Is that a statute where
the discretion is committed to the Attorney General?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: No, Your Honor, because
subchapter 2 does not say that the Attorney General has
discretion to decide motions to reopen. That language
is only found in the regulation. The only reference --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so it -- so absent
the regulation, you would interpret the statute as
saying there is no discretion?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Absent the regulation, I
would interpret the statute as being silent as to the
matter.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, that wasn't my
question. Let's say there’s no regulation. And the
statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2
of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions
to reopen. And then there is a special rule for
battered spouses.
Now, you would interpret that statute,
absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the
discretion of the Attorney General?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: I would interpret the
statute as not providing for discretion, yes, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how does an Attorney
General decide without -- without using discretion? He
must grant, in any case? Whether a battered spouse
waits for 15 years, he must grant?
Just under the statute, now.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: No.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is hypothetical.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Yes.
No. I'm -- I'm not trying to say that, Your
Honor. What I'm trying to say is that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then there must be a
discretionary component implicit.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: I would disagree in -- in
this way: If the statute is silent as to matters of
discretion, the Court can look to -- the Court could
look to other sources to determine --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you clarify, what
is the provision about battered spouses? I thought that
that had to do with you could have more than one
petition to reopen.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's correct, Your
Honor. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the rule is you may
reopen once and that -- that provision on battered
spouses says, but if you are in that category, you
can reopen again?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: I believe that's correct,
Your Honor. I believe that the provision on battered
spouses creates in a -- allows you to bring more than
one motion to reopen. It does -- it does not address
the issue of discretion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would it -- I
don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is
that it doesn't make any sense.
Why would Congress want to exclude review
for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that
are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the
statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that
are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney
General is given the authority to make them
discretionary and has done so?
I mean, a discretionary judgment is a
discretionary judgment. Why -- at least if it's a
legitimate one. I can understand why you would say
discretion which is given to the Attorney General under
the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has
wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of
discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute?
One is explicit in the statute, and the other is
pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to
make it discretionary.
Why would Congress want the one to be
subject to judicial review and not the other?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Judicial review of motions
to reopen has -- has been the traditional normal process
for the court to take. I think what Congress was doing
here was saying: In certain specified instances, we are
going to remove judicial review, but not in all
instances.
And the question is, where did Congress draw
the line? Congress --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I'm saying why
is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational
line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised,
since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled
to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it. That
makes some sense.
And I -- but where discretion is lawfully
exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when
the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute
says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is
lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the
Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not
allow it? I don't understand why -- why it would want
to do that.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Well, let me suggest
several reasons, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: First, if the Court was to
read the statute as allowing a regulation to create
discretion and, therefore, to remove judicial review --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't --
you don't contest that the regulation can provide
discretion. You -- you don't say the regulation is
invalid.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So it is a valid exercise
of discretion, right?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: And courts frequently
review decisions for abuse of discretion. And motions
to reopen, I would suggest, are particularly important
because it creates a safety net for review. It deals
with -- like, rule 60(b) of the Federal rules, it deals
with potentially new evidence, matters that weren't
available to bring initially, and it's important that
potential mistakes be reviewed.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to return for
a moment to the battered spouse provision. The battered
spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney
General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for
the 1 year for the battered spouse.
Now, that surely is discretion specified --
and I think the word "specified" is important here --
specified in subchapter 2. So there should be no
judicial review as to that.
You would have to agree with that, wouldn't
you?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Yes, as to the -- as to
waiving -- as to waiving the -- on the number of
motions, yes. On that point, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So then the
thing that Congress cares about most is something the
court can't review. That is counterintuitive.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Congress specified some 30
instances of discretion to the Attorney General in
subchapter 2, and I believe it drew the line there and
said, if we did not specify it in subchapter 2, then it
is reviewable, just as courts have traditionally
reviewed these matters. If there --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ones that have been
codified by statute -- those prior to the codification
were by regulation. Is that -- is that so?
MR. SCHOENFIELD: The regulation regarding
motions to reopen existed before the statute. Congress
could readily have made that part of the statutory
scheme if it had chosen to do so, but it did not.
If there are no further questions, I would
like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The statute at issue does not bar judicial
review of denials of motions to reopen. And I would
like to go right to one of the questions that was asked
by Justice Scalia, which is: How do you make sense out
of this statute, in terms of what Congress is doing in
not allowing judicial review of specifications of
discretion in regulations, but -- I'm sorry, and
allowing judicial review of things that are specified in
regulations, but not things that are specified in the
subchapter?
And I think that the answer to this question
comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you
compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and
(ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and
that are covered by (ii) are substantive decisions that
are made by the Executive in the immigration context as
a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens
can stay in the country or not. And those are matters,
at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the
exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power,
has the authority to decide and that Congress did not
want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing.
But what the Federal courts have often
reviewed are things where discretion is committed by
regulation, and these are procedural matters that
relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting
his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts.
Things like --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my question
with reference to motions to -- to reopen? That is
specified under subchapter 2. That's right there in
subchapter 2: There shall be a motion to reopen.
Now, if you had no regulation upon it,
wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of
the Attorney General?
MS. SAHARSKY: I would say that the Attorney
General has the discretion to issue regulations with
regard to that --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No, that's not my
question. Hypothetical, not a real case. Just a
hypothetical.
MS. SAHARSKY: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so we can talk about
the statute. The statute says there -- subchapter 2,
the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and
that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion
to reopen.
Now, don't you think that's within the
discretion of the Attorney General, absent any
regulations?
MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, because the statute --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So absent a
regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under
that provision, right?
MS. SAHARSKY: No.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?
MS. SAHARSKY: Because in the case that you
are positing, the discretion of the Attorney General is
implicit in the statute. It's not specified in the
statute. And here, Congress didn't say any time there
is a discretionary decision, which is what implicit
discretion would go to. It says: When discretionary
authority is specified.
Under this subchapter, that means that there
needs to be something specific, specified, explicit,
specifically noted in the text of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. But you would
give me, or would you, the concession that -- or
agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to
waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed
to him? And that's non-judiciary reviewable, wouldn't
you think?
MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. That wouldn't
be reviewable. Congress used the language of
discretion --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, that seems odd,
that the thing Congress cares about so much that it
makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial
review.
MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that is like the
-- the various matters that Congress listed as specified
as discretionary within the text of the relevant
subchapter, that it decided that this was a matter of
Executive grace that it did not want the Federal courts
involved in.
But the Federal courts have long reviewed
things like denials of motions to reopen, continuance
denials, where you have a situation in which the Federal
courts wanted to make sure that aliens were getting a
fair chance to have their claims heard.
JUSTICE BREYER: So, in fact, if -- if what
we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for
asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes
a decision that can't be reviewed. But then the
department, let's imagine, has a regulation, and it
says: Anyone can ask the department for a rehearing in
such a matter, and we'll decide as a matter of grace
whether to give you one.
Now, you're saying that would be reviewed?
MS. SAHARSKY: No, I'm not saying that.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't it be
reviewed?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.
JUSTICE BREYER: You just said it was. You
said every procedural decision is reviewed, which to me,
makes no sense to begin with, because I can't imagine
that Congress, while they don't want them to review the
substance at all, is perfectly happy to have the courts
review every detailed matter of extra time to file a
brief, extra time to have an oral argument. All those
matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view.
MS. SAHARSKY: Two answers, Your Honor.
First, the standard of review here is abuse of
discretion. It has long been abuse of discretion. That
doesn't mean that the Federal courts are involved in
second-guessing the agency --
JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly the same is true of
the substantive decision. I mean, that has nothing to
do with it.
I want to know -- look, this is where I'm
going. I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of
this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am
trying on, and I'm sure there’s a lot wrong with it,
that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the
procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and
treat them the same way that they are treating the
substantive decisions. So that in his case, he wins.
Because he gets review of the substance, he should get
review of a reopening. It's the same thing. And in
some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get
review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the
reopening. Both are the same thing. They are just
filed at different times.
So that, to me, is the only reading of this
statute that I have yet found that made sense. But
since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making
some huge mistake. But that's what you can tell me.
(Laughter.)
MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think you are, if I
am understanding you correctly. We actually have a
footnote in our opening brief where --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you are on the
wrong side, if you agree with it, because --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: No, you are on the right
side, because he wins. No, you're on the right side.
He wins. I take that back. I'm sorry.
(Laughter.)
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, let me try to explain.
There are a number of matters that are committed to the
agency's discretion after (i), things like adjustment of
status. And if the alien sought review, judicial
review, of an adjustment of --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MS. SAHARSKY: -- status determination, we
would say that's unreviewable under -- under (i).
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MS. SAHARSKY: Let's say that he then files
a motion to reopen --
JUSTICE BREYRE: Yes.
MS. SAHARSKY: -- where he is essentially
trying to relitigate his adjustment of status.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but, wait, new things
have happened. He doesn't just want to relitigate it.
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, what the --
JUSTICE BREYER: New things have happened;
that's why he wants it reopened.
MS. SAHARSKY: What the courts of appeals
have said is if what he's challenging is a discretionary
determination that the Executive has already made, that
that motion to reopen would not be --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not, but his
motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to
deal with it; I accept yours. My hypothetical is,
something new came up. That's why he wants it reopened.
MS. SAHARSKY: If something new came up --
JUSTICE BREYER: Something new came up.
That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people
want it reopened because something new came up?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, certainly that's what
the statute requires them to do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MS. SAHARSKY: It's not our experience that
every case that's filed is that way.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no.
MS. SAHARSKY: But in your hypothetical,
when something new comes up, we understand Congress as
have wanting that to have been judicially reviewable.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm asking you, what
possible sense could it make?
MS. SAHARSKY: Because Congress wants to
make sense that the alien is getting -- make sure that
the alien is getting a fair shot in terms of the
process.
JUSTICE BREYER: Look, we're -- two issues.
One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and
he loses. Something new comes up, and what does he
want? Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new
fact.
Now, my question would be: What possible
sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the
first, but they could review the second?
MS. SAHARSKY: If what he's seeking is a
review of an exercise of discretion, then that is not
reviewable, because of the reason that the initial
determination is not reviewable.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, by the way, this
reopening is done by regulation, not done by statute.
That's where I get to the problem.
You are trying to distinguish between
whether it's done by regulation or done by statute. And
I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context.
Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the
initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or
whether it's done by statute.
MS. SAHARSKY: Right, and what I'm
suggesting is that the difference there is between a
substantive determination that's a matter of grace and a
procedural determination to make sure that an alien gets
a fair shot, and it is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- I'm
sorry, do you want to finish?
Okay.
I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can
illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is
before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be
trusted without judicial review.
(Laughter.)
And I find that doubly curious when the
Justice Department won on the opposite position below.
I mean, are you suggesting that the statute
is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there
and say that your colleague down the hall in the Justice
Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion,
but in fact you are saying: I know we won on that, but
we are not going to defend it because we think the
Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay
in line?
MS. SAHARSKY: In the vast majority of
cases, of course we believe that the Board can be
trusted, and that's why review is for an abuse of
discretion, and it has been for many years. This Court
has said in Dada --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if you take
-- if you continued to argue the position you won on
before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be
that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that
it is okay. It would be there is no review at all.
MS. SAHARSKY: That's right, but we did not
argue to the Seventh Circuit that there was no
jurisdiction here.
In fact, it has been our position since 2004
that the text of this statute, particularly the text,
the context, the history, is so clear that we could not
reasonably take the alternate position. It has been --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the position of
the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004,
correct?
MS. SAHARSKY: There are only a handful of
cases, and in those cases, several individual attorneys
argued that there was no jurisdiction. And as soon as
the leadership of the Office of Immigration Litigation
heard of those cases, it sat down with the text of the
statute and said: We think that the text here is clear,
and we don't think the jurisdiction is taken away. And
it directed all of the attorneys in the Office of
Immigration Litigation not to be making this
jurisdiction-stripping argument anymore.
And it has been the United States'
consistent position since then, and we urged it to the
Seventh Circuit below, that when you look at the text of
the statute, you look at authority specified under
this subchapter. It’s Congress that specifies
authority. "Specified under this subchapter" means "in
this subchapter." It means "in the text of the
subchapter." And we have to answer this question in
this case by looking at the text that Congress enacted.
I acknowledge that there is not legislative
history, for example, to tell us what Congress intended
to do here, but we think that the answer comes from the
text of the statute. That if you are looking at the
substantive determinations that Congress was most
concerned about in 1996 when it enacted IIRIRA, those
were the things where Executive discretion was
exercised it did not want the Federal courts getting
involved in. But this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an idea of
how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for
review each year?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there are approximately
between 8 and 10,000 motions to reopen filed by the
Board of -- before the Board of Immigration Appeals each
year, and about between 15 and 20 percent of those are
granted.
So if you look at the -- the remaining 80 to
percent that are denied, the general appeal rate for
the courts of appeals is about 30 percent from the Board
of Immigration Appeals. So if you assume that the
appeal rate is about the same for motions to reopen, you
could get a number that way. So, you know, we -- there
are a substantial number –-
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we are talking about 2
or 3,000 petitions to the court each year?
MS. SAHARSKY: But the -- the point that we
are making is that there are these circumstances that
Congress has recognized, and this Court recognized it in
Dada. The motions to reopen serve several important
purposes, and, yes, they are reviewed under a very
deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. We do not
think in many cases that the Board was doing something
wrong and that it needs to be overturned.
But, for example, in the -- in a similar
context of continuance denials, say there was an
immigration judge who did not allow an alien to seek a
continuance in order to get an attorney to bring forth
his case before the immigration judge. Continuance
denials, some circuits, including the Seventh Circuit,
have said, are barred under this language.
We don't think that judicial review of that
is barred. We think that in the rare cases --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but that would
be a question of law which is accepted.
MS. SAHARSKY: I -- I am not sure that it
would be a question of law in that circumstance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you think it's
so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it. Why
do you need a court to tell you that?
MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the courts have
long served a very important check on the Board's
authority and on the Board's exercise -- you know, the
Board has many cases before it. In rare instances --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You keep saying "the
Board" --
MS. SAHARSKY: -- the Federal courts --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You keep saying "the
Board." Under the statute, it’s the Attorney General,
correct?
MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's right, but the
statute also -- the Attorney General -- the Board acts
on behalf of the Attorney General under the statute,
so the Board is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he doesn't
like what they do, he has the authority to act himself.
Whenever somebody delegates authority, they retain
authority to act themselves.
MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. The Attorney
General does police the Board, but the courts of appeals
have long done that too, particularly in the context of
motions to reopen.
This Court, just a couple of years ago in
Dada, recognized the important functions that motions to
reopen serve and assumed that there would be judicial
review of motions to reopen. In fact, it noted that
judicial review of motions to reopen, albeit under the
abuse-of-discretion standards, goes back to 1916, and we
just didn't see anything in 1996 to suggest that
Congress wanted to change that. And I think --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know where the
motion -- where -- where did it originate? Where did it
-- it was -- we now know it's in the regulations. It's
in the statute. But how did motions to reopen BIA
decisions originate?
MS. SAHARSKY: Before the BIA existed, so
back in the 1916 context, there were immigration
officers, and you could ask them to reconsider or reopen
your case. In -- I think it was 1940 or 1941, the Board
came into being, and the Attorney General quickly
enacted regulations that provided for either sua
sponte reopening or for the filing of a motion to
reopen. And those regulations existed in substantially
the same form until 1996, when they were amended to make
discretion explicit in the regulation, and the 1996 is
essentially the same form that it’s in today. So there
has -- there has always been an assumption that there
can be such a thing as reopening.
And I -- I just want to focus on what
Congress was doing in 1996, because I think it's very
telling. We know that Congress was focused on enacting
bars to judicial review, and we also know that Congress
was codifying for the first time an alien's right to
file one motion to reopen.
But Congress just didn't make any effort to
make denials of motions to reopen judicially
unreviewable, and that's very telling, because there’s
any number of ways that Congress could have done that.
JUSTICE ALITO: I didn't do the math fast
enough in my head when you were answering Justice
Kennedy's question, but is he correct that the effect of
accepting your argument is about 2,000 additional
appeals that -- that the Department of Justice will have
to brief and the courts of appeals will have to decide?
MS. SAHARSKY: You know, I -- I haven't done
the math on that, either, and I think it requires the
assumptions that I set out to Justice --
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. On the assumptions
that you made, do you know what the -- the result is?
MS. SAHARSKY: I -- I don't, because we
haven't calculated the number of motions throughout, and
we only have total numbers in the courts of appeals.
But let me say, if you are concerned about
the burden on the courts of appeals, every court but the
Seventh Circuit that has considered the issue has found
that the provision at issue doesn't bar judicial review.
So I don't think that this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have any of those courts
said that they don't have a workload problem?
(Laughter.)
MS. SAHARSKY: I think you would know better
than I would. We ask the judgment below to be reversed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, before you
sit down: Your response to the briefs that suggests
that all of this is beside the point because this was
a -- a second motion to reopen, and the statute allows
only one?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, this is comprehensively
addressed in footnote 18 in our reply brief, so I will
just address it briefly here -- but if you have follow-
up questions -- which is: If you look at the statutory
language, it says that an alien may file one motion to
reopen. It doesn't limit the Attorney General's
authority to allow more than one motion to reopen in
certain circumstances. And, in fact, it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Leiter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMANDA C. LEITER
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MS. LEITER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Congress enacted IIRIRA to reduce the burden
that immigration cases imposed, and continue to impose,
on the Federal courts. The plain language of the Act
--
--
strictly limits Federal court jurisdiction to review the
discretionary decisions of immigration officials. In
fact, as this Court has explained, the theme of the
legislation was to protect the Attorney General's
discretion from the courts.
Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is central to that
theme.
Before I discuss the language and meaning of
the section, I want to make one point very clear. The
section does not preclude judicial review of legal and
constitutional claims. Both of those are expressly
preserved by section 1252(a)(2)(D).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that provision came
after the original jurisdiction stripping, a number of
years after. So why should we look to that to inform
what Congress intended at an earlier time with respect
to judicial review --
MS. LEITER: Well, I have --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or the scope of it or
MS. LEITER: I have two answers to that,
Your Honor. The first is, to the extent that the Court
is concerned now about taking away judicial review of
the really sort of important central motions to reopen
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re talking about --
MS. LEITER: -- that is not a problem. With
respect --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re talking about us
acting as policymakers. The question is: Why should we
be looking to that to define what Congress intended
then, when it --
MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- stripped jurisdiction
earlier or granted it?
MS. LEITER: I believe this Court always
would have understood and Congress understood that its
jurisdiction strip would have had an exception for
constitutional claims even as of 1996.
In 1988, this Court issued Webster v. Doe,
finding that section 701(a)(2), which is quite parallel
to this provision, recognizes certain claims as
committed to agency discretion by law. Congress --
excuse me -- this Court in 1988 recognized that
provision as requiring a constitutional exception. And
I think Congress, acting in 1996, would have recognized
that the same -- very similar language in section
52(a)(2)(B)(ii) would also have a constitutional
exception.
I agree with you that there would not have
been a legal exception but for the enactment of
52(a)(2)(D).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, couldn't we look
at the fact that when Congress was considering whether
to put back into the jurisdiction-stripping statute an
exception for constitutional claims, it then knew,
because the courts of appeals except for the Seventh,
who just recently did it, were routinely taking
jurisdiction over motions to reopen?
Don't you think that was the time for them
to tell us: Hey, you guys got it wrong; we are going to
make motions to reopen statutorily discretionary, so if
there’s any doubt about this, let's clear up what our
intent is.
MS. LEITER: Well, Justice Sotomayor,
certainly had Congress done that, we wouldn't be here.
However, it is not true that the courts of appeals as of
that date had been uniform in their view that section
52(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not extend to regulations.
None had extended it to motions to reopen,
but in CDI Services v. Reno in 2002, the Sixth Circuit
recognized section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extending to
regulations. That was in the context of a -- a petition
for a visa extension. And Onyinkwa v. Ashcroft in 2004,
the -- excuse me -- Eighth Circuit similarly recognized
that. And then in Yerkovich v. Ashcroft in the same
year, the Eighth -- excuse me -- the Tenth Circuit also
recognized 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extended to regulations.
So the confusion plainly existed as of the
date of the REAL ID Act. And I think the burden was on
Congress, frankly, in that position, actually to clarify
the reverse. If Congress wanted to make clear at that
point --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute, you’re --
you’re arguing from a real negative, because some courts
had said that other statutes were covered by the
jurisdictional bar. You’re arguing that they knew
that no court had held that motions to reopen -- that
there was no jurisdiction for motions to reopen, that
somehow it should have --
MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, it is
the same statute at section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). And they
were holding exactly what the Seventh Circuit held and
what we argue here, which is that section
52(a)(2)(B)(ii) extends two things specified as
discretionary in regulations issued under the Act.
They had not yet considered the issue with
respect to motions to reopen, but with respect to other
issues specified as discretionary in regulations, they
held that the -- that the Act clearly extended to those
issues and stripped the courts of jurisdiction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But on a motion to
reopen, there is -- Seventh Circuit stands alone,
doesn't it?
MS. LEITER: It does, Your Honor. Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how many circuits are
on the other side?
MS. LEITER: I believe there are six.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any -- ever a
decision in any of those six circuits that went the way
the Seventh Circuit went on the motion to reopen?
MS. LEITER: No, Your Honor. And that
appears to be because the circuits, even the Sixth,
Eighth, and Tenth, were persuaded by the existence of
the consolidation provision, section 1252(b)(6), but
motions to reopen should for some reason be treated
differently than other things specified as discretionary
in regulations. But their --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Have they adhered -- have
those other courts that you said originally said that
other discretionary judgments made discretionary by
regulation were non-reviewable, have they adhered to
the -- to that view as to those other --
MS. LEITER: They have not repudiated the
view, but they have not adhered to it with respect to
motions to reopen. They seem to be reading the
statute --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I understand. I am
asking: Have they treated motions to reopen
differently?
MS. LEITER: Yes, they seem to treat motions
to reopen differently as reviewable, and they have been
persuaded to do that by the existence of section
52(b)(6), the consolidation provision.
But as I explained earlier --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Has any of them, since
switching to -- or since holding this with respect to
motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to
other discretionary judgments?
MS. LEITER: Not that I have found, Your
Honor, but nor have they repudiated it. I haven't found
a situation in which, after considering motions to
reopen, they went back again to consider visa
extensions, for example.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about
what’s “specified” under subchapter 2. I think that's
an important word, in addition to "under." And motions
to reopen are specified, and it doesn't say
“discretion.” It just says there shall be a motion to
reopen.
Do you get any mileage from that, or you
seem to rest your argument instead on the regulations?
And I think that's almost a weaker argument.
MS. LEITER: Frankly, Your Honor, I do not
think that specification of discretion -- with the
exception of the battered spouse's provision that you --
that you raised earlier, I do not think the
specification of discretion with respect to other
aspects of motions to reopen is sufficiently clear in
the statute to convey discretion.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you consider --
you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where
motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent
regulation? That would seem very odd to me.
MS. LEITER: No, Your Honor. I think when
Congress referred to a specification of discretion in
section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), they intended, effectively,
to provide a notice requirement. There are many things
that the Attorney General did under the Immigration Acts
prior to the enactment of IIRIRA, after the enactment of
IIRIRA, that were understood to be discretionary.
What the statute calls for is a different
category of discretionary decisions: Those things that
are specified as discretionary to be unreviewable; other
things that have long been understood to be
discretionary remain reviewable.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to say anything
about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I
have had? This is -- it’s -- my thought is that both
sides are arguing: We just look to see if it's
discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and
we draw the line on reviewability there.
Now, what we're talking about is a big set
of cases, including frauds and various things where
there is some discretion substantively to let the person
stay. Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says
if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review. But if
it's asylum, we want review. Isn't that how it works,
basically -- basically?
MS. LEITER: Basically.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Fine. I'm saying
instead of looking to see whether it's a rehearing
or procedural or reopening matter, period, you look
to see whether it has to do with the basic category.
If it's something that Congress doesn't want courts
to meddle in, that carries over to reopening, which
is the same thing; it carries over to rehearing
petitions -- they’re all about the same thing. And if
it's something that Congress did want courts to meddle
in, like asylum, it carries over to reopening, and it
carries over to rehearing petitions and other such
matters.
So Congress has one simple judgment: We
want courts to meddle in these affairs substantively or
we don't. And our job would be to say, right, if that's
what you want, unless it’s unconstitutional, that's what
we give you.
Do you see the way -- I'm just drawing the
line vertically instead of horizontally. But I agree,
nobody has. Now, to me that makes sense, but apparently
to no one else. So I would like to be talked out.
(Laughter.)
MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, I
think that "no one" includes Congress. I think that
that -- that that line --
JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't leave anyone out.
No one is universal.
(Laughter.)
MS. LEITER: That line might have made sense
had Congress drawn it, but Congress --
JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know they didn't?
I mean, there’s such a thing in the law called -- what
we think of often -- they often use the word "ancillary"
to describe it. And when Congress passes a thing that
has to do with X, you often interpret a statute to carry
with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing
that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a
separate sentence because you can't think of everything
that describes every matter ancillary to X. That's
normal in law.
MS. LEITER: The words Congress used here,
though, are those decisions specified as discretionary
kind or --
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and we would say those
decisions specified includes those decisions that are
totally wrapped up in the same thing. So that if a
person tries to escape this by simply making his main
argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it,
because it's really the same thing.
MS. LEITER: I agree, Your Honor, that that
category of things is unreviewable. What I'm struggling
with is that the regulation at issue here, regulation
03.2, specifies in no uncertain terms that motions to
reopen are discretionary, and therefore, if "specified
under" extends to regulations, there is no way in my
view not to extend --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? This is not
a matter that is the subject of the special provision.
A reopening petition is the same kind of thing,
identical to the initial petition, and so something that
applies to the initial petition applies to the reopening
petition because they are the same kind of animal. If
you have a -- you know -- I mean, okay. Oh, forget it.
I see the point, no point going further.
MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, I
think the language Congress used was clear here and
extends clearly to decisions -- decisions specified as
discretionary under the subchapter. Congress could
easily have said decisions specified as discretionary in
the subchapter, but it did not. And the paragraphs --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any rhyme or
reason why some universe of things that could be
reviewed in court, Congress put some of the them in the
statute and left others out?
MS. LEITER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the
description of something as discretionary has
consequences for the Attorney General, for the
administrative process. It has only the ancillary
consequence of stripping the courts of jurisdiction. So
court -- excuse me -- the Attorney General needs to
determine a rule of evidence for motions before it,
needs to determine rules of procedure, needs to
determine a rule of decision, and so there are -- there
are categories of matters where I could imagine Congress
saying to itself: The rule of decision here is really
not something with which we need to concern ourselves.
It is up to the Attorney General to decide whether this
is a discretionary decision or whether this is instead a
decision that he or she would like to -- to constrain in
some way by having certain specific rules of decision to
go by.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's -- the
question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA
exercises discretion. In all of these, the Attorney
General exercises discretion. The question is immunity
from court review, and ordinarily that's done by
statute. And I do not know of another instance, perhaps
you do, where the decision whether a matter that the
agency rules on will be exempt from judicial review is
made by the agency itself -- the very agency that makes
the decision, rather than by the legislature.
MS. LEITER: I will answer your question
first. I can imagine Congress believing that there are
categories of decisions where even the rules of decision
are best left to the agency to determine. And in that
category, Congress leaves it open to the agency to
decide whether to specify those matters as discretionary
or instead to specify more constraining rules of
decision.
With respect to your question about
examples --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and I'm not
questioning the discretion. The Attorney General can
be given discretion to rule on the matter, but the
question is: Does that mean that the exercise of
discretion will be immune from judicial review?
Congress might well say: Agency, you decide what’s
within your discretion. But not say: And, Agency, we
delegate to you, too, the matter whether the court will
-- will review your exercise of discretion.
MS. LEITER: Right. Two things, Your Honor.
First, the jurisdictional consequence of the
discretionary specification here attached after the
Attorney General applied the label. So here this is not
a situation in which the Attorney General was making a
determination as to what things should be reviewable.
The Attorney General was making a -- a decision as to
what rule of decision to apply in motions to reopen, and
Congress later attached the jurisdictional significance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if your
interpretation of "under" is right.
MS. LEITER: Well, Congress acted later and
may, if our interpretation is correct, have attached the
jurisdictional significance at that point, yes.
With respect to your question about other
examples of situations in which an agency is left to
make a determination that has jurisdictional
consequences, I have a few examples. The first is the
Communications Act of 1934. This Court recognized in
Global Crossing that the agency there could determine
that a -- that conduct under the Act was unreasonable.
That is an administrative determination under one
section of the Act. It has the consequence under
another section of the Act of creating a cause of action
for individuals to recover in damages.
A second example is actually section
1(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act which
refers to categories of decisions that are committed to
agency discretion by law. Courts have understood that
that is not the broad subset of discretionary decisions
but instead that subcategory of discretionary decisions
for which there is no law to apply, and many courts
recognize that the agencies may create the law to apply
in those circumstances.
So an agency may enact a regulation that
binds the agency's own discretion and renders the issue
reviewable where it would not otherwise have been. So
there --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think absent the
special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that
we are considering, if it were just under the APA, that
a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency
discretion under 702? Because it seems to me that, you
know, there are sources we could look to, to see whether
or not it's rationally exercised.
MS. LEITER: I do not, Your Honor. I
believe there is law to apply in this circumstance,
particularly after enactment of IIRIRA. Congress now
has provided guidelines for when some motions to reopen
should be granted, the timeliness of motions to reopen,
et cetera. So I do not think this is the broad
category of -- or sorry -- the narrow category of things
that are committed to agency discretion by law. I was
using the example solely to show that there are other
circumstances in which an agency action has the
consequence of restoring --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I actually think it
helps you because -- there is -- there is something to
review, the agency does have discretion. But this
statute strips it, because it provides for motions to
reopen, specifically. But, of course, you --
MS. LEITER: Yes, and --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you don't take that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to talk about
"under"?
--
(Laughter.)
MS. LEITER: I would love to talk about
“under,” Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Good.
MS. LEITER: And if I may, I would like to
start on pages 6a and 7a. I have an illustration
here -- excuse me -- of the -- of the government's
opening brief. An illustration here of the fact that
Congress knows what it is doing when it chooses
prepositions. If you look at the section that
immediately precedes 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) -- that is
section 1252(a)(2)(A). In (a)(2)(A) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, what -- on what page?
Look at page 6 --
MS. LEITER: I'm sorry. Pages 6a and 7a of
the government's opening brief -- so the Respondent’s
opening brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, 6a of the government's
MS. LEITER: And pages 6a and 7a in the
appendix. This is -- this is provision 1252(a)(2)(A) --
and borrowing the term “Romanette” -- Romanette (i),
(ii), and (iv) -- refers clearly to things provided in
subsection (e) of the statute; whereas, Romanette (iii)
refers to the application of such section to individual
aliens including the determination made under section
25(b)(1)(B) of this title. That is a determination by
immigration officials at the border as to whether an
individual who is otherwise inadmissible may have
grounds to be detained and allowed to go through asylum
proceedings. Clearly there, where Congress recognized
that there was an administrative determination to be
made, it used the preposition "under" to reach through
the statute to the administrative determination.
I also have three examples, Your Honor, of
situations in chapter 8 in which Congress actually uses
the phrase "specified under," the same phrase at issue
here, to refer again through the statute to
administrative determinations. These are not
unfortunately in the briefs.
U.S.C. 1227 -- excuse me. Let me start
with 8 U.S.C. 1375a(a)(4) and (a)(6). This is a
provision that calls for the preparation of a pamphlet
on the legal rights of immigrant victims of domestic
violence. Paragraph 1375a(a)(6) calls for the pamphlet
to be distributed and made available, quote, "in the
language as specified under paragraph (4)." Turning to
paragraph (4) then, it clearly anticipates an
administrative determination, because it says the
Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the
Attorney General and the State Department shall
determine at least 14 languages into which the pamphlet
is translated.
So that's an example of Congress using
"specified under" to refer, yes, in the first instance
to statutory language, as it does in our provision,
specified under subchapter 2, but it is a situation in
which the statutory language to which "specified under"
refers clearly anticipates some exercise of
administrative authority.
Here, the exercise of administrative
authority is the specification of languages.
In our example, it is the specification of
procedures for motions to reopen.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question
before you finish -- if it is an appropriate time?
What is your response to their argument they
raise in the reply brief that this was specified under
subchapter 1, rather than subchapter 2?
MS. LEITER: Your Honor, subchapter 1
includes the language that grants authority broadly to
the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing
the chapter, and the language implemented by the motions
to reopen regulations exists in subchapter 2.
The motion to reopen regulations very
clearly implements Section 1229(a), which is in
subchapter 2. And a question asked earlier was where
one would look to determine whether Regulation 1003.2 is
a valid regulation, a reasonable interpretation of the
statute, and for that, I believe one would have to look
at the content of section 1229(a), which is in
subchapter 2, so although --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the text refers
not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says
the authority for which is specified under this
subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the
authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1.
MS. LEITER: Yes, Justice Scalia. I am
certainly not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No. You would have to say,
no, Justice Scalia, if you want to win this.
(Laughter.)
MS. LEITER: Yes, the phrase includes the
word the authority, Justice Scalia, but I don't think it
can bear the weight that Petitioner and the government
put on it. I believe that “authority” there references
the authority that is clearly granted in section 1103 to
implement the entire chapter.
But what the section does is to indicate
where the specification of discretion must be located,
and in this case, it must be located in either the
statute or regulations issued under it, and to see
that, I think the easiest illustration is to suppose
that the statute read: No court shall have jurisdiction
to review any decision specified as discretionary --
excuse me -- decision, the authority for which is
specified as discretionary in the subchapter or in
regulations issued thereunder.
If Congress had used belts and suspenders in
that way and made itself doubly clear, there would be no
question here that the word "authority" was somehow
superfluous or misplaced.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any reason why
Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain
that courts can review asylum decisions, but Congress
would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of
an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if
something new comes up that justifies asylum?
For example, a new government comes and
takes over a country, and now they are going to
murder the person, and that couldn't be considered the
first time because the old government was there, and
they were just going to torture him, all right? So --
so there's something new here.
Now, why would any human being say, we want
to get courts involved in the first decision, but we
want to keep them out of the second decision?
MS. LEITER: The -- the best answer I have,
Justice Breyer, is that Congress wanted to cut off
review at some point, and it was a question of numbers
of bites at the apple. I understand your point, that --
that the second --
JUSTICE BREYER: Reopening is not a bite at
the apple. Reopening is a new thing; at least, by and
large, and supposed to be -- a change.
MS. LEITER: And that may have been part of
Congress's concern, that, of course, by and large, it is
supposed to be, but it may not always be used in that
way, and, at some point, Congress wanted to draw the
line. And I note here that Congress did not -- I mean,
what Congress did here was to set up a regime under
which things that are specified as discretionary are
unreviewable.
But there is some room here for the Attorney
General to remove the specification of discretion if
that system is unworkable --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, if your
interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer
just described, the government's interpretation produces
the opposite anomaly. Right?
MS. LEITER: Certainly, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, and that's why I
ended up with this unusual --
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose it's a
large question, if you are talking about, presumably,
the unusual cases in which the motion to reopen is -- is
justified, that you are talking about 2,000 or
,000 cases, and the question is whether or not those
are -- should be reviewed in the executive branch or
should be reviewed in the judicial branch.
MS. LEITER: Well, the math that we were
given earlier, I believe, does come out to about 2,000
appeals per year, but I remind the Court that section
52(a)(2)(D) preserves those that raise questions of
law or constitutional questions for review.
So this is a far narrower -- I assume,
although I do not have the numbers, but I assume a far
narrower subset of those decisions that would be
rendered unreviewable here, only those for which a
discretionary factual determination has been made by the
agency.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we are looking
for needles in -- in a haystack, right?
MS. LEITER: I -- I don't have the numbers,
Your Honor. I don't know what percent. I am not sure
whether it's a fraction of the haystack or a needle
within it, but -- but it is certainly a subset of the --
of the category of cases.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have other
examples where -- “under” is commonly used -- statute
and regulations thereunder -- but in the appendix that
you have given us, it says, "under regulations."
“Under” is always coupled with “regulations,” and you
want us to transpose that to a statute that
conspicuously does not say, "regulations."
MS. LEITER: Justice Ginsburg, we included
the appendix to illustrate how Congress uses the
preposition “under,” when it is talking about
regulations, so we specifically looked for examples
where Congress was talking already about regulations,
and the
preposition that accompanies that is always “under.”
I do have two further -- excuse me.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You said, earlier, that you
had three examples --
MS. LEITER: I have two further --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that were not in your
brief. You better spit them out, or we won't know about
them. What are the other two?
(Laughter.)
MS. LEITER: Thank you, Justice Scalia. The
other two are section 1227(a)(1)(H), which refers to
82(a)(5)(A). 1227(a)(1)(H) -- both in Chapter 8 --
refers to grounds of inadmissibility -- excuse me --
specified under paragraph (5)(A) of section 1182(a).
Turning to paragraph (5)(A) of section
82(a), that calls for the Labor Department to
determine whether the United States needs immigrant
laborers in a particular category.
So, again, it's a use of the phrase
"specified under" to refer to statutory language, but
through the statutory language to what is clearly an
anticipated exercise of administrative discretion.
JUSTICE SCALIA: 1227(a)(1)(H). What’s the
third one? And then I am going to ask you what the
first one was because I forgot it.
MS. LEITER: Okay. The third one is
section -- again, chapter 8, section 1537(b)(1) and
(b)(2). (B)(1) says that, after judicial review
affirming a removal order, the Attorney General, quote,
"shall remove the alien to a country specified under
paragraph 2."
And then, in paragraph 2, the statute says
that the alien may choose the country, but that the
Attorney General has authority to review the alien's
choice of country, and if the alien refuses to choose a
country, the Attorney General has authority to
specify the country.
The first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. What was the first
one? Just -- just give me the -- the cite for the first
one. I didn't write it down. I should have.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1252(b)(6)
mandates that review of the underlying decision should
be consolidated with review of a motion to reopen. I
think that tells us several things.
The first and foremost of which is Congress
intended there to be review of motions to reopen -- at
least some motions to reopen. To try to go back to
Justice Breyer's questions, I think one can extrapolate
from the consolidation provision that, if it is
impossible to consolidate because there is no review of
the underlying decision, you do not get to have a review
of those motions to reopen.
And that is referenced, I believe, in the
government's brief, at footnote 15 -- excuse me -- with
some cases cited, where courts have so held.
We did not focus on that because that is not
Mr. Kucana's issue. As the Court has alluded to,
Mr. Kucana's issue is the nature of asylum based upon
changed country conditions, and those situations are
where it may be a matter of life and death, certainly,
also a matter of -- of liberty, to be able to bring
forward new evidence, which did not exist before, about
changed country conditions, and it is not two bites at
the apple. It's the first bite at current conditions,
which is essential.
With regard to the case of Webster v. Doe,
that my colleague cited orally, that was an extremely
unusual case in which the Court essentially said that it
could not -- it did not have any criteria to evaluate
the discretion used by the director of the CIA.
That is certainly not the situation we have
here, where we are dealing with motions to reopen, which
are analogous to rule 60(b) and which are routinely
reviewed on abuse-of-discretion standard.
Additionally, let me note that, if you were
to determine that the statutory language “specified
under” is ambiguous that the applicable canons both
point us to favoring judicial review -- favoring
judicial review and not essentially allowing the
Executive to pass a regulation which insulates itself
from judicial review.
That would be both the clear statement
requirement as well as the principle laid down by this
Court that, in an ambiguous situation dealing with
deportation, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of
the alien.
If there are no further questions --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MR. SCHOENFIELD: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Leiter, you have
briefed and argued this case in support of the judgment
below, at the invitation of the Court, and have ably
discharged that responsibility, for which we are
grateful.
The case is submitted.
