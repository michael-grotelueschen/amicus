ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
In AB 1889, California defunded employer
speech about union organizing because the State's labor
policy is that such speech interferes with employee free
choice. The Federal policy is that employer speech
enhances employee free choice. California's labor
policy is designed to discourage exactly what the NLRA
promotes. The fact that California implemented its
labor policy as an exercise of its spending authority is
irrelevant under Gould. If the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say the labor
policy promotes it? It certainly permits it, but
what -- what --
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think
that if you look at the exceptions to the policy, in
particular those that allow State funds to be spent for
things that clearly facilitate union organizing, for
example, that it's not prohibited under AB --
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about the
-- the Federal policy. You say the Federal policy
promotes this employer speech. Why do you say it
promotes it? It clearly permits it. It clearly does
not discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?
MR. GOLDSMITH: I think -- I think it is,
Your Honor. I think that the cases of this Court and
the cases of the NLRB have made clear that free, open,
robust debate is important on all matters having to do
with the union/employer relationship. That was
certainly what the Court noted in Linn.
The fact that employer speech is, I think,
absolutely critical to an employee being well-enough
informed to make an informed judgment about whether to
say yes or no to a union, further underscores the point.
A union election or any situation involving
a contest of any sort between a union and an employer is
something on which both parties should have the right to
speak, and to speak in a noncoercive way, and I think
that clearly the National Labor Relations Act promotes
that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did Congress in
several statutes have a provision from which California
copied when it enacted this measure? In several
--
statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will
go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use
any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter
union organizing.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Your Honor, those are three
statutes that the court below and Respondents rely on
heavily. Those statutes, first of all, I don't think in
any way reflect the meaning or the sense of Congress
that employer speech is to be inhibited in connection
with union organizing. Those in no way, I think,
reflect the overall intent of Congress. More ever,
nothing in those statutes, in any way, undercuts the
basic principles of the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they run against that
principle because they say at least under these programs
-- I think there were more than three. Wasn't Medicare
MR. GOLDSMITH: Medicare was the fourth, I
believe. It was a regulation not a statute. But
certainly in doing that, Congress didn't in any way
modify the NLRA. There's nothing in the legislative
history of those statutes that suggests that this
Court's principles, as laid down in Machinists and
Garmon, were in any way to be inhibited. And, moreover,
what Congress can do certainly doesn't mean that the
States have the same right. But --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Those -- those grantees
would be subject to the NLRA. So, as to them, it is
modified.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, it's not modified in
the same way that AB 1889 modifies it, Your Honor.
First of all, under those statutes there is no
requirement that funds be segregated. There is no
possibility of litigation, treble damages to follow.
There is no possibility of attorneys' fees to the
prevailing party. So those statutes are, I think, are
really unique and don't in any way change the basic
principle that I think all labor lawyers would agree,
and that is that, under the National Labor Relations
Act, all parties to a union election or any issue
between a union and an employer have the right to speak
in a noncoercive way.
JUSTICE BREYER: Say: Speak, go ahead,
speak, speak. Just not on our nickel.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, I think that's clearly
what they say, but it's not that simple given the way
this statute operates, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: And they also say -- by the
way, that you answer this, I'd keep this in mind -- you
may be right about it being too much of an
administrative burden, the treble damages et cetera, but
they've made major concessions here, and they say that's
a matter to be worked out on remand.  And it may be that
they have to be very careful about inhibiting your
speech.
So let's go back over those administrative
provisions one by one. They are suggesting to us, as I
read it, don't do that now.
MR. GOLDSMITH: If I may respond to both
questions, Your Honor. First of all the notion that one
can use your own money, to use the vernacular, and use
it to speak, doesn't answer the most basic question that
the statute presents, and that is that whether you can
or you can't -- and I'll get to that in a moment -- the
fact is that California has regulated, used its spending
power to make labor policy, something that this Court
has made clear, in Gould and various other cases, it
cannot do. But even getting past that, which I think is
the end of the case, there are certain employers,
certain Petitioners here who are a hundred percent
funded by the State. They have no ability, as a result
-- when I say "funded by the State" I mean they depend
for their income on State programs, let's say -- they
have no ability, none, to speak to employees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --
MR. GOLDSMITH: The State has effectively --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the
State's fault.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, the State's argument
to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's a free-market
choice. They can either do business in California or
not. And I would refer the Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they can do
business with other entities beside the State.
MR. GOLDSMITH: They can, Your Honor, that's
true, but that doesn't answer the question because for
those that -- because of the service that they provide,
such as under Medi-Cal, they have chosen to be in
business with the State. They are being forced to make
an election between doing business with the State or
giving up an NLRA-protected right. That is --
JUSTICE BREYER: If you have -- you have a
park service of the State and have you a hotdog stand
there, it runs the hotdogs, it's private, but the State
pays for everything. The State pays for everything.
And it happens that, in the grant, they have no place
for talking about the union. You're saying they are
required to add to the legislation, a special grant, so
that the employer can speak of the union?
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, a grant presents a
slightly different problem.
JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Because they
say here we are talking about 100 percent money that
comes out of the State treasury and all we are saying is
use that money for the State purposes, and those
purposes do not include talking one way or the other
about the union.
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, that may be the case
for a particular program or a particular grant, but
that's not what AB 1889 does, Your Honor. AB 1889
affects on an across-the-board basis every single
contractor, every single employer doing business with
the State of California. So if -- if the State could
show that it were making that -- it was making that
policy decision for some fiscal purpose, then there
might be an argument. But that's concededly not the
case here, whereas --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you -- you are
bringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must
show, not that the State must show, and the State -- the
simple argument is look we are paying for certain
things, and we want to get what we paid for. There are
a lot of other things that we could have paid for, but
we -- we want to get, say, a training program for
elementary schoolteachers. And that has nothing to do
with union organizing. We don't want to pay for union
organizing.
MR. GOLDSMITH: That might be an argument
that the State could advance credibly if in fact this
statute had anything to do with saving money. It
doesn't. The court below unanimously concluded that
this was not anything that had anything to do with the
fiscal issues; it had solely to do with making labor
policy. And as far as a facial challenge is concerned,
Your Honor, the fact is that this statute was applied to
the Petitioners. The Petitioners --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the lower court
say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it
is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want
to pay for?
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, Your Honor, that's, of
course, my vernacular for --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That in --
MR. GOLDSMITH: -- what the court said, but
what the court did say was that the State passed --
legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1889
solely for labor policy purposes, and that's clear from
the preamble to the statute. The preamble to the
statute says, it is the policy of the State of
California -- in so many words -- that employer speech
interferes with employee free choice. There's nothing
in the record. There's no attempt at all to suggest
that anything achieved by 1889 saves the State a dime.
That's an argument --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would come out --
it would come out differently if the statute has said,
we want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose
not to pay for labor relations?
MR. GOLDSMITH: Well, if the State could
establish that it was acting as a proprietor, within
meaning of this Court's decision in Boston Harbor, and
establish as a proprietor that it was doing something to
advance a fiscal purpose, then perhaps a statute so
worded would survive the pre-emption challenge. But
that is clearly not what happened here. There's no
evidence that that happened, and that is not the purpose
or the effect of AB 1889.
And as to the facial challenge issue, if I
could answer both Justice Breyer and Your Honor, the
fact is that this statute was applied to the
Petitioners. The Petitioners went into district court
and they said, this applies to us, it's burden some for
us to do -- to do what the statute purports to require
us to do. The district court granted an injunction and
so on.
But whether it's a facial challenge or
as-applied challenge I think really makes no difference
here. The Ninth Circuit found that AB 1889 was not
pre-empted as a matter of law. Our position is that AB
89 is pre-empted as a matter of law. The purpose and
effect are clear. Sending this back to remand to
develop facts or trying to sort this out and whether
it's a facial or as-applied challenge really doesn't
change the basic fact that the court below, as I said,
decided this as a matter of law and NLRA pre-emption
generally raises purely legal issues.
The legal issue is whether or not the
Federal scheme has been interfered with, and I think
that any fair reading of this statute makes it
abundantly clear that that's exactly what happened.
California was very open about it. The preamble says
precisely that: We believe that employer speech
interferes with employee free choice. So that they
passed a statute that is designed to and does severely
inhibit an employer's ability to speak. That's what
they wanted to do; that's what they did; and that
interferes with the Federal policy.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say something
different from what Congress said in those three or four
statutes that were mentioned earlier?
MR. GOLDSMITH: In terms of using the words
assist, promote and deter, those words appear in those
statutes in that Medicare regulation, or statute,
component of the Medicare statute, and those appear also
in, in AB 1899.
But, you know, again, Your Honor, from my
perspective I think, you know, it's clear that nothing
in those statutes changed the fundamental policy that
speech, free speech, for both employers and for unions
is something to be encouraged in the context of a union
organizing drive for a number of reasons, not the least
of which employees are allowed and entitled to hear both
sides of the picture before being put in the position
where they have to make a choice. California believes
that employer speech is a bad thing. AB 1899 is a
reflection of that. They believe it's bad because it
interferes with employee free choice.
JUSTICE ALITO: If you take the example of a
nursing home that participates in the Medi-Cal program,
what does this require? They have to segregate the
funds that they get from the State, and they can't use
-- is it the case they can't use any of those funds for
union-related speech or just the portion that does not
represent profits?
MR. GOLDSMITH: They can't use any of those
funds. The notion that profits -- the statute doesn't
say a word about profits, and, of course, if the statute
were to say something about profits, it would make
segregation of accounts problem in the statute even
worse than it already is.
But what a nursing home has to do is to
track every single possible circumstance under which an
employee of the nursing home engaged in speech that was
designed to assist -- which don't happen very often,
presumably -- promote or deter union organizing.
And let me try to bring it down to what
really happens in the union organizing campaign. This
is, by and large, a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour a day
operation. There are any number of encounters during
the course of the union organizing drive that the
employer responsible for complying with AB 1899 may
never even know about.
So, for example, if an employee goes to his
supervisor and says union X is trying to organize
nursing home, what do you know about union X? And the
supervisor says, well, the only thing I know about union
X is they used to represent the nursing home across the
street, and then that nursing home is now closed.
Now, that may be a purely factual statement,
purely true statement. That's certainly what the
employer would argue. What the union might argue is
that no, no. You have to put that in context, and that
was a statement designed to deter the employee from
voting for union X.
Now, if the employer guesses wrong on that
issue, that is the employer says, well, this is factual,
it's not something designed to deter union organizing,
he is subject under the statute to litigation for not
having segregated -- and I don't know what he would
really segregate; the statute is unclear. Do you
segregate the time? Do you account for the time that
the employer spent talking --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if he guesses right,
he is subject to the litigation.
MR. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You said if he guesses
wrong, he is subject to litigation. He is subject to
the litigation even if he guesses right.
MR. GOLDSMITH: That's correct, Your Honor,
and unlike the prevailing party as the defendant, or the
prevailing party will of course -- the prevailing
plaintiff and the prevailing intervenors will recover
reasonable costs of attorney's fees, the prevailing
defendant under this statute does not. There is --
there is no question that it's even impossible for an
employer under the situation that I described to
effectively account for that encounter that I describe
between an employer and employee.
Do you take the 30 seconds that it took and
allocate 30 seconds of the salary? Do you take the
overtime for the week that the supervisor might have
worked? There is really no way that the statute allows
for that to happen, and it I think underscores the
degree to which this statute interferes dramatically
with NLRA protected rights.
If there are no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
You've got a friend on the other side still.
MR. GOLDSMITH: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I
forgot about that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The National Labor Relations Act manifests
congressional intent to encourage free debate on issues
dividing labor and management. State laws that restrict
speech regarding unionization frustrate that fundamental
national policy and are therefore pre-empted, as this
Court held in Linn.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the
spending clause question? You -- the Federal Government
has a lot of programs where they use their own money and
they come with a lot of conditions, and you -- your
office frequently argues that those are justified under
the spending clause. Why isn't what California is doing
here similarly justified?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, first of all, obviously,
Your Honor, the National Labor Relations Act does not
constrain Congress' ability to impose particular
restrictions. It does constrain the State's ability to
use their spending power to regulate, as this Court held
in Gould and in Nash.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we tell
whether they are using their spending power to regulate
as opposed to simply attaching conditions to what's done
with State funds?
MR. HUNGAR: The Court has identified
several factors that it has used to distinguish
regulatory from proprietary conduct, first and foremost,
as this Court said in Boston Harbor. It looks to
whether the State is acting in order to effectuate
policy or is instead seeking to achieve cost savings
program efficiency and the like. In addition, the Court
looks to whether the measure --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On a case like Rust
versus Sullivan, is the Federal Government acting to
promote policy, or is it simply acting in a proprietary
capacity?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, of course, that question
did not come up in Rust against Sullivan because there
was in a NLRA pre-emption issue there, and the question
that the State was --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about
spending power versus regulatory power in general.
MR. HUNGAR: But what the Court did say in
Rust is that the government has a legitimate policy
interest in advancing its preference for life, in that
case, that the Congress was entitled to advance. The
problem here is that the policy interest that the State
is advancing, a policy interest that says employer
speech regarding unionization interferes with employee
free choice, is a policy that is directly contrary to
the Federal policy under the Act as Congress and the
board have repeatedly recognized, and that this Court
has repeatedly recognized.
So, there is no legitimate interest
supporting what the State is doing here, it's an
interest directly contrary to Federal policy, unlike in
Rust and other First Amendment cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, give me an
example of a spending clause provision that would be
acceptable, not necessarily in this context, but in
general, because you would say, well, that's not trying
to implement a policy at all.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, if the -- one of the
amicus briefs in this case points to a rule that the
State has adopted recently apparently in the Medi-Cal
context, which says that they will only reimburse
administrative costs of hospitals up to the 50th
percentile of costs incurred by similar facilities.
That's obviously not attempting to regulate
any particular labor speech or any other type of
conduct. It's simply saying we are only going to
regulate this category, this broad general category of
costs to a certain level. It's not targeted at a
specific category of disfavored speech because the State
disfavors that speech. It's simply attempting to save
money.
That clearly would not be pre-empted, even
though it might have a disproportionate impact on a
particular hospital that's engaged in a costly --
JUSTICE BREYER: Would your answer be the
same if -- if -- and I hide contrary to fact, perhaps,
that a magic administrative scheme were invented so that
there was no administrative problem, we could identify
with the greatest of ease each penny that came from a
State and which did not? And then the State said, you
know, we do have a policy here. We actually favor labor
unions in our State, and some other State might have a
different policy. But we think it best that the State
officials involved when their company -- when their
department is being organized, to say nothing. We think
it best that the employers that we pay a hundred percent
to, given their -- their strong funding by the State,
that they got to find some money elsewhere, and those we
pay 50 percent to better use the private money, not use
our money.
Now, no administrative burden whatsoever,
but that's the policy. Now, is there some rule or
statute that would make that unlawful or pre-empted that
policy?
MR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer, I think -- I'm
assuming in your hypothetical that this hypothetical
law, in addition to posing no administrative burdens
also doesn't have the strict liability of treble
damages.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, on all these things
which I think they are asking us on the other side to
leave for another day, none of them exist. They all
work perfectly. It's only the magic system has been
developed to, without any extraneous burden, segregate
the State money from the non-State money. And the only
rule is don't use the State money when you speak.
That's the only rule.
MR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, other states
have exactly opposite rules, they are right-to-work
states. They give you extra State money. So -- but one
State has this rule and --
MR. HUNGAR: Obviously that would be a very
different case.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, well, if it's a very
different case, then why aren't they right to say this
is a facial challenge, leave that very different case
which raises all the issues to be worked out when we
discover whether this is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say it's a very
different case Mr. Hungar? I don't really understand
MR. HUNGAR: It's a very different case in
the sense that in this case it's -- from every one of
the factors that this Court has looked to, to determine
regulatory versus proprietary -- and this case cuts
fairly in favor of the conclusion of the unanimous court
of appeals, all 15 judges, that this is regulatory.
It's punitive; it's government-wide; it's not program-
or contract-specific; it's not the kind of conduct that
private entities engage in. All of the factors -- and
it's expressly as well as obviously, in effect, intended
to disfavor a particular kind of speech that Congress
favors.
So everything cuts in favor of it being
regulatory; whereas, in your hypothetical, most of those
considerations would not. However, I think it's still
the case that in that hypothetical, what the State is
doing is regulating -- for labor policy reasons it's
disfavoring a particular type of speech. The State does
not have any obligation under the Act to fund
unionization speech, but what it can't do under the Act
is deny a government benefit because of a -- a labor
policy. That's what this Court held in Nash.
JUSTICE BREYER: Is my right-to-work example
equally -- equally pre-empted?
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, I think it would be. But,
again --
JUSTICE BREYER: So, they could not say in
Utah, to take a State at random, the -- here we have
government grants and there's overhead, and we would
like you to spend this overhead; indeed, you're
certainly free to spend this overhead in speaking as
much as you want, should there be an organizing
campaign. Don't worry about spending the government
part. Can they do that? You say no, they couldn't?
MR. HUNGAR: Well -- I took your -- the Utah
example to be one where the State was somehow mandating
this particular expenditure.
JUSTICE BREYER: No.
MR. HUNGAR: If the State is simply -- is
not taking -- is taking a hands-off approach, it's hard
to characterize it as regulation. But what this Court
held in Nash, what this Court held in Gould, what this
Court held in Livadas is, when the State is denying
benefits -- even though there might be plenty of
legitimate reasons that might enable it to deny benefits
-- if it's denying benefits for the purpose of advancing
labor policy in an area where Congress has said there is
to be no regulation, that's pre-empted, and that's
doubly pre-empted here where the labor policy that the
State is advancing is directly contrary to the Federal
labor policy that Congress and the Board have
enunciated.
And with respect to the facial versus
as-applied or the suggestion that somehow because you
might be able to craft a statute that would achieve some
of the effects of this statute in a nonpre-empted way,
that doesn't make this statute not facially pre-empted.
This statute has the punitive provisions with the strict
liability, treble damages, the segregation requirement
that's virtually impossible to apply in practice, the
clear expressive mission of a regulatory policy that's
contrary to Federal policy.
This is the statute that is in front of the
Court. This is the statute that is facially
unconstitutional, and that's the issue that the Court
should decide in order to correct the Ninth Circuit's
error, which said it's both facially and as applied
immune from pre-emption challenge before it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What policy was Congress
implementing in the Federal funding statute that
California copied?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, California did not
copy any Federal statutes. None of the Federal statutes
has a segregation requirement; none of them imposes
strict liability, punitive damages.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they do say that the
money is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter
union organizing.
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, there are three Federal
statutes that impose use restrictions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why do they do that?
MR. HUNGAR: It's not clear why they did
that, other than obviously they were choosing not to
compensate those particular kinds of costs as well as
the others. Congress is entitled to carve out
particular exceptions to the general nonregulatory
provisions of the Act, just as it has done in section
(c), where they have carved out coercive employer and
union speech for regulation, even though other speech is
to be unregulated.
It's important to understand also that the
general policy in Federal grant programs is to the
contrary. There is no such restriction in the vast
majority of Federal grant programs involving the vast
majority of Federal grant money.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't -- there's
no reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done
in these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary
to national labor relations policy?
MR. HUNGAR: Well, it's not contrary to
national labor relations policy, because Congress has
chosen to create an exception, and it has the right to
do so; the State does not.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It was labor policy. I
mean, you have to acknowledge it was labor policy in
these other cases, just a different labor policy that
the Federal Government wanted, right?
MR. HUNGAR: In -- in a specific program --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. HUNGAR: -- which obviously the State's
law does not apply to those programs; it applies to
State spending across the board.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Hungar.
Mr. Gottesman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GOTTESMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Until this statute was enacted, California
was in the anomalous position that it was financing
speech on one side of union organizing campaigns but not
on the other, because most grants, programs, contracts
include employment costs as an allowable cost.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so was anyone
who hired a company to do any kind of work, right?
Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try
to restrict what activities the company engaged in with
respect to union organizing.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. I mean, a private
employer could have said the same things that the State
said: don't use our money to do this. And they would
not have violated anything by doing that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not sure why you
characterize California as financing one side of a
debate, because -- and this I think is sort of the nub
of the disagreement between the two sides here -- their
argument is that a State can determine what it wants to
buy with its money, but what California is doing is
telling its contractor what it can do with the money
after the State has got what it paid for.
MR. GOTTESMAN: That's not correct, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the --
MR. GOTTESMAN: That's what they claim.
JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that is the
basic distinction between a case like Rust and a case
like this.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They're trying to control
their profits as opposed to determining what they get --
what you get for your money. And how do you respond to
that?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's true if it were
the case that the State's statute said: Even after you
have earned this money by performing all the service we
asked, you still can't -- it's therefore now your money;
you can't use it. That is not what the statute means.
That is -- the State has been very clear about that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any case in
which California claims that it has not gotten the
service that it paid for as a result of the position
which an employer -- a grantee employer took on -- on a
unionization issue?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, there haven't been any
cases decided under this statute, but what the court of
appeals pointed out is that the Petitioners did not move
for summary judgment on the ground that you're
forbidding us from using our money. They moved for
summary judgment solely on the ground that it was the
obligation of the State to give them money that they
could use for these purposes. And that it was wrong --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not quite
accurate. They moved for summary judgment on the ground
that what the State was doing was in effect regulating
labor relations --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that that
activity was pre-empted.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well, yes, on that
core issue, they said to -- to tell us that we cannot
use State funds for this purpose -- well, they are still
State funds -- is to regulate us. And we submit that
that is wrong. This is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say "while they
are still State funds" -- the -- the money that the --
that any employer is using, I presume, to the extent
that it can be identified, is money in the employer's
pocket. And the only claim that California would have,
it seems to me from the pre-emption argument, is that in
fact we are buying a form of speech or a form of
promotion of labor policy when we contract with social
service agencies or whatnot. But I don't understand
that to be California's argument at all.
MR. GOTTESMAN: No. Our argument -- let's
take one of the two provisions that the district court
struck down, and that Petitioners argue properly struck
down. It said that when we give you grant money, don't
use that money for this purpose. Now, the State gives
them the money up front, before they have provided the
services. And that's true universally.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but if they give them
grant money -- let's say it's a grant rather than a
contract, and I assume that's, you know, the point
you're making. When they give them grant money, I
assume they're giving them grant money in order to do or
to perform whatever kind of service or function the
agency is devoted to performing.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Not to -- not to enforce
labor policy of one sort or another, but to promote the
arts or conservation or whatever the organization does.
And there's no argument here that the organization is --
is failing to promote conservation or the arts or
whatever, and that for that reason, California isn't
getting what it's paying for. The argument is that
whatever California has to -- I'm sorry, whatever the
organization has to spend, say, on its labor relations,
which is something that is left over from its promotion
of the arts, cannot be spent except in accordance with
California policy.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first, if they don't
spend all the grant money on the prescribed purposes,
they have to give it back to the State because grants
aren't profit --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I assume they are
entitled to some overhead cost which would include the
cost of their employee-related -- managing employee
relations?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And that's --
JUSTICE SOUTER: So that wouldn't be money
left over. That would --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but that, Your Honor,
is where the concern that the State was addressing comes
Traditionally, when the State gave grant
money, one of the permissible uses of that money was for
the costs of employees who had to perform the grant, and
without this limitation, that would have included the
employer spending the money to combat unions. That
would be -- could arguably be a legitimate cost.
JUSTICE SOUTER: So, is the argument that
the employer in fact -- that the employer is in fact
devoting less of the grant money to the purpose of the
grant, so that it falls within Rust?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well -- yes. Well, our
position is certainly yes. That is, the State is
entitled to prescribe what it is prepared to pay for in
a grant and what not, and it is not required to
subsidize the employer's campaign --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But the --
MR. GOTTESMAN: -- against a union or for a
union, for that matter.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The difference between this
and Rust is that the Federal Government in Rust was
assuredly following a Federal policy.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it was a Federal policy
that the Federal Government had every right to
implement. We do not want to support abortions.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The issue here is whether
the policy that California is trying to implement --
namely, we do not want the employer to -- in its view --
disrupt the -- the labor management relations by -- by
opposing union -- unionization.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that is the issue,
whether that is a policy that California can -- can
implement.
MR. GOTTESMAN: That is not the State's
policy, and the preamble to the statute does not say:
the State disapproves of employers spending money. What
it says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the policy
-- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about
unionization.
MR. GOTTESMAN: No. They don't want them to
spend them the employer's money -- the State's money to
talk about unionization.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because it's wasting
the money or because that is their --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- their labor policy?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Because the State wants to
be neutral, and that -- the right --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then that -- then that, it
seems to me, cuts the feet off your argument of a moment
ago, that in fact the State's concern is that it's
getting less of what it thought it was getting for with
its grant, because more is being spent on labor policy.
And now, it seems to me, you're saying no, that's not
the case. It is simply the fact that the time that the
employer spends in talking with employees, whatever the
subject is, involves a policy that California does not
want to support, and, therefore, California prohibits
them spending that time for purely policy reasons.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it prohibits them
using the State's money to do it. Of course they can
use their own money to do it.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, your argument a
moment ago is that they were using the State's money
because in fact they were providing less of the service
that the grant was for and spending that in -- in
conversation with employees about labor unions. And it
seems to me your answer to Justice Scalia was
inconsistent with that. Your answer to Justice Scalia,
as I understood it, was it is simply that they do not
want that policy being implemented by anyone who gets
any money from the State within that State.
MR. GOTTESMAN: I don't think I said
"inconsistently." What I said was, previously it was
within the permissible scope of a grant to spend money
in an organizing campaign, either assisting, promoting,
or deterring unionization. The State is now saying that
will no longer be. We don't really want to spend grant
money on that, and our reason is that we think we -- the
State's money should not be used by either side in that
union organizing --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that -- how
is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an
OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective
devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want
to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be
used to put in these federally required safety devices;
you can use somebody else's money for that. Why isn't
that the same thing here? You're saying there's a
Federal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want
our money to be spent implementing that policy or
pursuant to that policy.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Because there is no Federal
labor policy that requires States to use State treasury
money to finance a party who is engaged in this debate.
That's why this is just like Rust.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Just like -- like Gould. I
mean, there is a case where a State used State money, no
contracting with any -- with any company that's been
convicted of unfair labor practices three times.
Strictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to
spend our money dealing with such a person.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right, but there we're
saying we won't deal with you. That's -- that would
classically -- if the State in this case said, no
employer who opposes unions can have a State contract,
that would be Gould. It would also be a violation of
the First Amendment.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be the
State's managing its own money? It's our money.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, But it is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We just don't want to deal
with people who oppose unions.
MR. GOTTESMAN: No, there's a huge
difference between saying, don't use our money to do
something, and saying, we won't deal with you even when
you use your own money to do it. The implication that
this is pre-emptive --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But on your argument, there
is no "your own money." You're saying that everything
that the grantee gets in a grant situation is the
government's money.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But that distinction that
you just made in answer to Justice Scalia could not be
drawn.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if they have their own
money, they can spend it on that. They just can't use
the State's money.
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, the hypothesis of this
whole argument is that we are talking with a grantee who
was fully funded by -- I thought fully funded by the
State, and I thought that was your strongest argument.
So that this alternative -- well, you can use your own
money -- is an alternative which, you know, by the very
hypothesis that we are arguing on, will never exist.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if we have a grantee
who has no other money, that doesn't mean the State has
an obligation to provide them money to oppose
unionization. It would be very odd to believe -- and
this is, after all, implied pre-emption -- that it was
Congress's intent without mentioning it to say that it
is the obligation of States to provide funding to
employers to do this.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gottesman, can I ask
sort of a background question to be sure I understand
your position?
Am I correct in assuming that if the State
of California had its labor relations agency make it an
unfair labor practice to engage in this employer speech
described here, that that would be pre-empted?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Employer speech with its own
money?
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be
pre-empted, absolutely pre-empted.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.
MR. GOTTESMAN: If not pr-empted, it would
certainly be a violation of the First Amendment as well,
to punish them for engaging in speech.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if they adopted the
rule that the Federal labor board applied prior to the
Taft-Hartley Act.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That's what I'm asking.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Exactly. Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: That would be pre-empted?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course that would be
pre-empted.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Our position, however, is
that it's quite different to say that the National Labor
Relations Act requires the State to pay for these
activities. And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why --
JUSTICE STEVENS: It does require that this
-- it arguably requires that this area of combat between
labor and management be unregulated.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. And this is not
regulation, for the very reasons that this Court in
Regan and Rust and in a whole line of cases had said
that it is not regulation to simply say, we the
government are not going to pay for this activity.
That's all that California is saying in this
case: we are not going to pay for it. It's the policy
of the State not to interfere in these union organizing
drives; therefore -- and this is the precise words of
the preamble -- "for this reason, the State should not
subsidize."
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your reason for not
paying for this activity is that you don't like this
activity.
MR. GOTTESMAN: That's not true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I call that -- I call that
regulating the activity.
MR. GOTTESMAN: That is not at all the case,
Your Honor. There's nothing in this preamble -- the
other side keeps characterizing the preamble, which they
don't include in their statutory appendix, as saying, we
don't like the employer doing it. That's not what it
says; it's on page 3.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you allow the
employer to engage in all other employee relations, and
you're willing -- that can be done without -- the one
thing the employer can't do is speak out against the
union. This isn't because you don't --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, you've got for or
against. This is content discrimination, not viewpoint
discrimination; and it is content discrimination whose
purpose is to keep the State's funds out of this area of
context. The taxpayers' money should not be spent
supporting one side and not the other in these disputes.
This court in the Linn case -- and I want to
quote this sentence, because this is the key to why a
policy of neutrality with respect to the use of the
State's money is not, you know, regulated. We -- this
was a case in which, to be sure, it was the Federal
Government was denying food stamps to strikers. And the
claim was that was a violation of their associational
rights under the First Amendment. Everybody else who
satisfies the test for food stamps is entitled to them,
but we are not going to give them to strikers.
And when the Federal Government is asked why
is that, they said, well, we don't want to get involved.
To be sure if we give them the money, that would make it
likely the strike would go on longer. But we are not
being anti-union. We just want to be hands off. We
want to be -- we don't want Federal money spent to help
one side or the other in this labor dispute.
And what this Court said was, we have little
trouble in concluding that that provision is rationally
related to the legitimate governmental objective of
avoiding undue favoritism to one side or the other in
private labor disputes.
Now, that's the core of what this statute is
about. The labor union --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying it
doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?
MR. GOTTESMAN: It just takes the State's
money out.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that depends, as
a practical matter, on the view that there are at least
some employers who would be arguing in favor of
unionization?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it wouldn't matter if
they were arguing for or against. The point is that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but my point is
that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. Well that may well
be true, but the point is when they are arguing against
the union, until this statute State money was being used
to argue against the union, the union was not getting
any State money to respond. The State was funding one
side of this dispute. And the notion that it was an
implied purpose of Congress in the National Labor
Relations Act to compel States to fund one side of a
dispute with a subsidy is -- would be remarkable.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when the State pays a
program participant -- let's again take the case of a
nursing home -- for providing services to patients who
are covered by Medi-Cal, and money is paid to the
nursing home, it's your position that remains the State
's money.
MR. GOTTESMAN: If this -- if the nursing
home -- there are a number of different ways in which
this money is paid to the State. If the situation is
the nursing home first provides the services and when
they have done so billed the State for the money, that's
not State funds. Once they receive the money, since
they put the money up in front to provide the service,
they are being reimbursed for it, that's not the State's
funds. It's the State's funds if the State gives them
the money up front.
As is true universally with respect to
grants. We give you this money. This money now because
of this statute its purposes are limited so that they do
not include engaging in -- one side or the other in
union organizing. If you have your own money, feel free
to spend your own money on that, but we are not giving
you this money for that purpose.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just be clear. The
statute with reference to State contractors, which is
the $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to
private employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all
of those cases, the law is applicable only if the money
is paid before all the work is done?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. If you look at the
contract one, which is not actually before the Court
because nobody had standing -- the district court ruled
to raise it -- it says the State funds to assist,
promote or defer -- union organizing during the life of
the contract are not to be spent on this.
So once the contract is done, that is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question of when
the contract is done is different from the question of
when the money is paid.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course. Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He is asking with when the
money is paid.
MR. GOTTESMAN: So when you pay the money up
front and you say here is your money to do the
contract --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the
situation in which the contract runs for a year and you
bill monthly? On your theory the contract is still
going on and yet there is no prepayment. I assume on
your argument they would be just as bound by the
California policy as if they got a hundred percent
payment up front.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's -- that's a
question about a meaning of a provision that isn't at
this issue in this case. The ones that are at issue in
this case --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you concede that
if they -- if all they did under a 12-month contract
was -- was bill for services rendered every past 30
days, that there would be either no application of the
California law or that the application would be
pre-empted?
MR. GOTTESMAN: That might well be the case.
But we don't have an interpretation of that provision of
the California law.
JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. That was an
either/or.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE ALITO: Which might be the case?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Oh. I say it might be the
case.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It's like saying yes.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.
(Laughter.)
MR. GOTTESMAN: But again, that issue isn't
here. What we've got here are programs, some of which
the State advances the money, and some of which it pays
after the services have been completed.
JUSTICE BREYER: So you did on that point on
page 27 and 25 and 29 of the AFL-CIO brief, I took the
statements there, where it would say "organizations,"
namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred
percent of their money from the State are free to use
their profits?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: If there are any, or any
other non-state moneys they had?
MR. GOTTESMAN: And we the State responded
say the same thing in our brief. We say it at pages 26
to 27: The State maintains a legitimate interest in
program funds until such time as the program participant
has provided the State with a service the State has
funded.
JUSTICE BREYER: So if you sell them tables
and they write you a check, the State, for the tables,
at that point the check is yours?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Of course.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. GOTTESMAN: There is no question about
that, because in that case, that would be covered by the
contract provision that isn't here. But it says once
the contract is completed, it's your money.
So the concern here only is that they not
use our money. The State's brief also says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there is a
warranty for another year, say if these tables break you
have to replace them?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, that's a question
of -- remember, neither of the lower courts has
interpreted this statute. This statute has never been
interpreted. That's -- and what the court of appeals
said is that's because the argument that you all have
been asking me about was not raised in summary judgment
by the Petitioners. Their core argument is the State
has an obligation to subsidize our speech. And that's
the only issue they brought up on summary judgment.
Because Judge Beezer in the panel decision said, oh,
look at all these, quote, as he called them, horribles
that will come from this, Judge Beezer got into all
these issues: The accounting would be burdensome, that
it's going to be the employer's own money.
And what the majority said is, number one,
that's not here. And number two, they said this -- I
believe it's on page 34 of the appendix but I'm not
certain of the -- wait a minute, I can tell you the
exact page. Yes, it's page 34, in a sense the parade of
horribles goes far beyond the scope of plaintiff's
facial challenge, that is the challenge they brought on
summary judgment. The district court made no findings
nor is there evidence that this statute, quote, "co-ops
the payments for goods and services and profits realized
under a contract ."
JUSTICE BREYER: What is your recommendation
as to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's
there, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the
example with the tables is an example of it. When does
the profit actually accrue? Is there treble damage
provision that makes this much worse? Are there
administrative requirements that in practice make it
impossible? Is it administered in such a way that the
employee we heard about would just not know what to say,
the employer's representative?
All those things could be problems, and you
say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet. And your
recommendation as to what we should do is what?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Is affirm, because all the
court has said is the motion for summary judgment was
improperly granted.
JUSTICE BREYER: And if we did that, how
would all these problems be worked out? I mean, how
would the arguments that you -- they think are far too
burdensome, you think they are not and can be done
properly, how does that get worked out?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, first of all, let's
talk about the burdens, the accounting burdens, which
are actually quite minimal under Medicaid, because they
already have to do this because the Federal Medicaid
requires them to -- to account for which were allowable
expenditures and which were not in a very detailed
accounting form. And of course, the Federal Medicaid
says that this is not allowable expenditure, so they
have to do this anyway, half this money is Federal and
half is is State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not going to go
through all of these one by one, are you?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Pardon? No. I just wanted
to give an example of that.
But with respect to each of these, we need
to have a record. For example, on the burdens there is
an affidavit from an accounting firm submitted by the
defendants that says this is really not burdensome at
all.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you a basic
question that doesn't require you to get into one by
one. Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have
its money used to assist unions. This is an antiunion
State and it adopts the same kind of law that you have.
And it simply says, none of -- none of this State's --
yes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of
the money that we give you --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Give who.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- shall be used -- shall
be used for collective bargaining or for any -- any
activities involving unions.
MR. GOTTESMAN: That would be -- that would
be the moneys we give to the employer?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Same. Yes.
MR. GOTTESMAN: I'm not sure which question
you're asking.
JUSTICE SCALIA: To the employer. No
employer getting money from the State can expend any of
our money -- the same way yours is -- in collective
bargaining with unions or in anything else. Now, we are
not stopping employers from doing that. We just don't
like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this
employer to use it for unions. Would that be all right.
MR. GOTTESMAN: I think that would be
problematic but only for this reason. If the employer
is allowed to spend the State's money to -- to bargain
with nonunion employees and you know medical
researchers, whatever, negotiate contracts with them,
but the State says you can't do it for collective
bargaining, then that is exactly the Livadas case. That
is the case in which the State is saying your
entitlement to a State benefit turns on whether you are
unionized or not. In this case we'll let the employer
do this with nonunion employees, but not with unionized
employees. But if the State said we don't want to pay
for the costs of negotiating --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that -- why does
that make a difference? If it violates Federal policy,
it violates Federal policy. Livadas said you can't do
it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor
unionization, and not to deter.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But this statute
neither favors nor deters. This statute --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same
about that other one.
MR. GOTTESMAN: This statute simply says we
don't want to subsidize either party, and as a practical
matter we are only subsidizing one party in union
organizing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So does the statute I
posit. Just don't use State money. You can use all of
your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want
our money used for it.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That clearly would be
banned and I don't see why yours is any different.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well because -- it would not
be banned if the State had said we don't want you to use
State money to negotiate contracts with any of your
employees; that would not be banned. It would be banned
if they singled out only unionized employees that you're
not allowed to use it with. You're allowed to use it
with nonunion employees.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to get back
to your responses on the procedural costs of the case.
You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would
be with respect to accounting rules.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes. There is a State
disputed facts in the district court on that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make any
difference if the argument is which is what I understood
it to be, that you can't regulate at all? It's not
simply that you can't regulate so long as it's
particularly burdensome, but you don't have the
authority to regulate in this at all.
MR. GOTTESMAN: But our argument is that
this is not regulation. To say that the State money is
not going to be spent for this is not regulation. Just
as Regan and Rust says --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets to the --
MR. GOTTESMAN: It just says--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets to the
spending clause question. We're not -- I mean, we can
address that without deciding whether the regulations
are particularly burdensome. You were saying well, the
accounting is not a big problem.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it doesn't mean
that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, we are not regulating
whether the employer opposes unions. What we are
regulating is what they do with the State's money.
That's the only regulation that's here. We are saying
don't use our money for this purpose. The only
regulation that's going on is to see whether you use the
State's money --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't seem to
me to be responsive to my question. Your point was
well, we don't know how burdensome a particular
regulation is. If you lose on the question of whether
it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to
see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled
to regulate at all.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, if you say that a
State's position, "we don't want our money to be
used" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're getting back
to the spending question.
MR. GOTTESMAN: -- is regulation --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting that
aside.
MR. GOTTESMAN: I'm having -- the problem
I'm having with Your Honor's question is presuming the
answer to something. The -- if this is regulation, then
there is a serious prospect of its being pre-emptive,
but this is not regulation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of
whether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome
regulation.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's regulation
why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary
judgment. Not the spending question we have -- that's a
different issue. But if there is no difference with
respect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so
we don't have to have further proceedings on whether
it's burdensome.
MR. GOTTESMAN: Right. But the only issue
they raised on summary judgment is that to deny us your
money, the State's money, is regulation. And our
position is that to deny you the State's money is not
regulation, any more than it was in Regan, in Rust, in
this whole line of cases where the Court has said the
government's choice not to subsidize an activity is not
regulation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But on that point you're
in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and --
MR. GOTTESMAN: Yes, we are. The Ninth
Circuit misunderstood Boston Harbor. It thought Boston
Harbor created two boxes that represented the whole
world. You're either a market participant or you're a
regulator. That's not what Boston Harbor said, if you
go back and look at it. What Boston Harbor said, if you
regulate you are vulnerable to pre-emption arguments; if
you are not regulating, then you are free of pre-emption
concerns.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the principal rationale
for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your
view?
MR. GOTTESMAN: Well, it's not -- no. The
Ninth Circuit also talked about the First Amendment and
got it right. It said when it talked about the dissent
had said what this State is doing is violating the First
Amendment, and the Ninth Circuit's response is no,
that's not right. All this is is withholding a subsidy,
and the First Amendment cases are clear: that's not
regulation of a speech.
What the Ninth Circuit thought erroneously
is that Boston Harbor had denied it the right to take
that same view, because it thought that Boston Harbor
said that everything is regulation unless it's market
participation, and that's not what Boston Harbor said,
and this is not regulation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Goldsmith, you have four minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIS J. GOLDSMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
I'd just like to make a few comments in
rebuttal. First of all, the preamble of the statute
makes it absolutely clear as to what the State's purpose
is. It's at page 3a of the appendix of the petition.
It says it is the policy of the State not to interfere
with an employee's choice about whether to join or to be
represented by a labor union. For this reason the State
should not subsidize -- and so on.
So clearly the State has a labor policy
position. It's a position as I said at the outset that
is completely contrary to that of the NLRA. The NLRA's
position is that employers just like unions ought to
have the right to speak in a noncoercive way to their
employees.
Secondly, it is not our position that the
NLRA requires the State to fund activities. It is our
position that the NLRA and the decisions of this Court
make it abundantly clear that the States are to stay out
of this area altogether, period. And that would be the
case whether it is the kind of statute that Justice
Scalia was posing a question about, whether it was in
effect anti-union or pro-union. It doesn't matter.
They are both pre-empted.
The State has no business making labor
policy. The decisions of this Court, the unanimous
decisions of this Court in several circumstances I think
make that very clear. And the Ninth Circuit did find
that for all practical purposes, the State was
regulating by making labor policy.
If I could make two points about neutrality.
First of all, the statute is anything but neutral.
First of all, the State's policy is not one of
neutrality. As I just read from the preamble they have
a position; the position is that noncoercive employer
speech interferes with employee free choice, and the
statute follows that position.
The decision to withdraw funds is not the
same thing as being neutral. Your Honor made a
reference to the Hyde amendment. The Hyde amendment,
Congress withdrew funds from -- from abortion
practitioners. It was not neutral about abortion. And
California here has made a judgment about noncoercive
speech.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the Lyng
case that Mr. Gottesman cited in response to that
argument?
MR. GOLDSMITH: The Lyng case seems to me to
be completely off the point on the pre-emption issue.
But there is no question, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,
that Congress can make judgments about what it chooses
to fund or not to fund. That did not open the door to
the States to do whatever they wanted to do by way of
funding or not funding. Lyng addressed a
constitutional --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Lyng said that
the -- that Congress was being neutral not that it was
making a choice on how to spend its funds. And I
understood Mr. Gottesman's point to be that so too,
here, California is being neutral.
MR. GOLDSMITH: But California is -- is not
being neutral, not just because of what the preamble
says but because of the add-ons to the statute if you
will. California has taken it much farther than simply
withdrawing the subsidy. California has taken it to the
point that you're exposed to treble damages, but then
you have minute tracking and segregation of fund
details, and California has taken it even one step
farther and said on the other hand, if you want to spend
State money to facilitate union organizing, that's
perfectly fine with us. You can spend money to give
access to union representatives to property. You can
use State money to -- to facilitate neutrality
agreements of one sort or another. Anything that would
help a union organize employees, that's fine by us.
So California is not neutral in the same way
that Lyng was neutral, but again I would suggest that,
Mr. Chief Justice, that Lyng didn't open the door, any
more than Rust or Regan opened the door to the States to
make labor policy by granting or withholding moneys in
any way that they saw fit. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Goldsmith.
The case is submitted.
