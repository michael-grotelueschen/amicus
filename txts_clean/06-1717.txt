CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security
Service versus Chertoff.
Mr. Wolfman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOLFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Federal Circuit affirmed an award of
attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, or
EAJA, to Petitioner Richlin Security Services Company,
but it denied Richlin an award for paralegal services at
market rates on the ground that statutory attorney fees
do not include work done by paralegals.
The Federal Circuit was wrong because, as
this Court has explained, the statutory term "attorney
fees" -- and now I'm quoting -- "takes into account the
work not only of attorneys but others whose labor
contributes to the work product for which an attorney
bills her client." Employing that reasoning the Court
held, in Missouri versus Jenkins, that paralegal fees
are compensable at market rates as attorney fees under
U.S.C. section 1988.
The question in this case is whether there
is any reason EAJA should be interpreted differently.
The answer is no. And, indeed, the only potentially
relevant difference between the two statutes -- that
EAJA requires fees to be awarded at prevailing market
rates, and section 1988 requires only that fees be
reasonable -- provides stronger support for market-based
recovery of paralegal fees under EAJA than it would
under section 1988.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfman, what about
the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in
EAJA?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that
really is, when we get down to it, what the government's
argument boils down to. And I think the cap is
irrelevant for two reasons, both of which are important.
First, and let me -- let me first state the argument;
then I'll give you the answers.
But the argument that the government posits
is -- taking a lead from the Federal Circuit -- is that
paralegal services can't be compensable at market rates
under EAJA because then paralegal services would be
fully or largely compensable, while lawyers' fees to the
extent that they exceed the cap would not be. And again
there are two answers to that: First, the argument
incorrectly looks at EAJA from today's perspective when
lawyers' rates generally exceed the fee cap.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The paralegals'
rates would also be subject to the -- to the cap.
MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: They couldn't go above the
cap.
MR. WOLFMAN: There is no question about
that because -- because, Your Honor, they are attorney's
fees.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.
MR. WOLFMAN: That's our submission. But --
but the problem with looking at it at the current
vantage point, which is what the Federal Circuit
essentially did, is that at the time EAJA was enacted,
most lawyers --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask on that
last point, does the government agree that the
paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the government would
certainly agree that if there are attorney's fees, they
are subject to the cap. They are not willing to pay
above the cap for anything.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, would insist.
MR. WOLFMAN: Yes, indeed, Your Honor. But
at any rate --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But they do not agree with
the bottom line that they are subject to cap?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, what they believe -- the
government --
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- attorney's fees.
MR. WOLFMAN: And I'm sure they can explain
this better than I can. But what the government's
position is, is that they are like an out-of-pocket
expense --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. WOLFMAN: -- reimbursable only at the
cost to the lawyer. That's an interesting question,
Your Honor, because one could -- one could posit a
situation 20, 30 years out from now, if EAJA were not
amended, where even the cost to the lawyer could exceed
the cap. So, in a way, the government's argument sort
of collapses upon itself. We -- we -- our submission is
they are all attorney's fees and they are all subject to
the cap. But let me go --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- isn't that one
of the problems with your argument? Because there is
something very strange about capping paralegal fees at
the same amount that they would cap a lawyer's fees for,
regardless of what that amount is and when they were
setting it.
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, again, that's -- that's
-- I took to be Justice Ginsburg's question and let me
try to answer it. First, as I say, by -- by positing
that's a strange situation, which we don't agree with,
but even assuming it's a strange situation, again it
looks at the situation from today's perspective, not at
the time --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm looking at it from
the perspective of the original enactment on your theory
at that moment. These fees were legal fees, were
attorney fees, and they were capped at the same amount
that a lawyer's time was capped at. And that's just
odd.
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I don't believe it's
odd. And, again, for two reasons: At that point --
again, you have to take the perspective where they are
at. Lawyers' fees and paralegal fees were really capped
at the same point, but all those fees were arrayed, by
and large, under the cap so that there would be
paralegal fees at a relatively low rate, junior
associates at a modest rate, and the senior partner's
closer to the cap.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, agent fees --
MR. WOLFMAN: By and large --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the problem exists
whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees,
because agent fees are also subject to the same cap.
MR. WOLFMAN: That is true.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And agents were paid a good
deal less than that.
MR. WOLFMAN: That is true. That is another
argument that could be made. Agents, who are
individuals that are qualified by an administrative
agency, in essence, to practice law without the
supervision of a lawyer, they are also allowed fees
under the administrative part of EAJA, but not under
section 2412, which is the court part of EAJA.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You began -- and it's not
just because of my notepad but because I'm interested --
you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons --
MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- why the government's
cap is wrong. And I'm not even sure you finished the
first one. What are the two reasons?
MR. WOLFMAN: I would love that opportunity,
Your Honor. The first, again, is, -- and let me come
back to this if I didn't get it out completely -- which
is that, again, it's looking at the -- at the problem,
if there is one from the -- the current-day perspective,
but what you had at the time, by and large, was that
lawyers' and paralegal rates would be arrayed below the
cap. It's just not something that would have been
within the contemplation of Congress. But let me --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask you this?
MR. WOLFMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing at the time the
statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally
treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements,
does that make a difference?
MR. WOLFMAN: That might have made a
difference, but that was not the case, Your Honor. In
fact, what the Court pointed out in Missouri versus
Jenkins, which was 1989, nine years later, paralegal
fees -- it appeared to be that they were separately
billed in about three-quarters of all law firms. In
80 it was probably fewer. There was a transition
going on.
But let me give you the Court's response to
that problem in Missouri versus Jenkins, to the extent
that it is a problem. And what the Court said was,
whether they're separately billed or not, they were
subsumed within the lawyer's rates like other forms of
overhead. That's what the Court said in Missouri versus
Jenkins. And the question of how they are billed
doesn't -- doesn't inform the question of how you
interpret the term "attorney's fees." That's what the
Court said in Missouri versus Jenkins and what it
reaffirmed two years later in the West Virginia
Hospitals versus Casey.
Now, let me, if I could, get to the second
point which Justice Kennedy asked me about. The second
point is that the government's argument proves far too
much, because under the Federal Circuit's theory, which
the government has now adopted, the fees generated by
law firm associates would also not be compensable at
market rates because a much higher percentage of an
associate's billed rate would also fall below the cap as
compared to the senior partners in the firm. In other
words, it doesn't help explain the problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Is your
point there that most associates are billed at less than
$125 an hour?
MR. WOLFMAN: No. That's not my point, Your
Honor. My point is this: The -- the theory of the
government's argument is that you would -- you would be,
in essence, giving too much recovery to the lower -- to
the lower-billed billing agents, whether they be
paralegals, junior associates, and so forth. And it --
when you get up to the senior partners --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Too much money
proportionally.
MR. WOLFMAN: Proportionally.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MR. WOLFMAN: Exactly. That's the argument.
In all events, some of those various individuals' rates
will be compensated under EAJA.
Our point is that it proves far too much
because the junior associates are much more like the
paralegals than the senior associates at the largest K
Street or Wall Street law firm. And my only point -- my
only submission -- point in that regard is that it shows
that the government's argument proves too much because
it illustrates that the government's concern and the
Federal Circuit's concern, the anomaly that they have
pointed out, has nothing to do with the statutory term
"attorney fees" and nothing to do with paralegals, per
se. It's the phenomenon that's at work is the fact that
the rate -- the hyperinflation in the legal services
market as a whole has outstripped EAJA. That's the
phenomenon on which the Federal Circuit, in truth, was
relying, even though they put it to the paralegal
question.
JUSTICE ALITO: If -- if paralegal charges
are not fees but are other expenses, what would be the
standard for determining the rate at which they would be
compensable? Would it necessarily be cost under this
statute or would it simply be what is reasonable?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, that's -- that's an
excellent question. I think it, in part, undermines the
government's position because what happened here is that
the Federal Circuit and the Board of Contract Appeals
below said, well, it's cost to the lawyer, and we are
going to do an Internet search and we are going to find
what paralegal salaries are and divide it by the
requisite number of hours in any year. And we are going
to make it $35 an hour, and we are going to determine
that's the cost to the law firm.
But, of course, that's -- that's not the
cost to the law firm. What about the overhead? What
about the rent, utilities, and so forth, what about
benefits? So what you would have is a very complex cost
analysis.
Now, you're suggesting, Your Honor, that we
could do it on some vague notion of reasonableness. But
the problem is that the -- the fee-shifting statutes
either look to market rate or actual cost. But what is
interesting about the actual cost argument here -- and
that's true across the entire range of fee-shifting
statutes -- and what's interesting about --
JUSTICE SCALIA: This problem is going to
exist anyway, isn't it? I mean, even if you don't cram
paralegals into the other expenses, there are going to
be other expenses that are in the other expenses.
MR. WOLFMAN: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to have to
have this same problem -- and what about the overhead
and so forth?
MR. WOLFMAN: No, that is -- with respect,
Justice Scalia, that is not correct because the problem
here is -- and I'm using your words -- is that the
government is cramming a in-house professional
services -- service into a place where no court
virtually in the history of American jurisprudence has
ever put it. Out-of-pocket --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if -- if it's simply
reasonableness -- because I don't see anything in the
statute that says that all non-fee expenses are
compensable at cost -- if it's simply reasonableness,
would it be possible to say that what would be
reasonable would be a rate that preserves the ratio
between attorneys' fees and paralegal fees that existed
at the time when the statute was enacted so that you
wouldn't have the problem of attorneys being compensated
at the same rate as paralegals?
MR. WOLFMAN: Let me -- let me answer that
in two ways: If you were to preserve the ratio, then it
seems to me that the -- in many markets, the paralegals
are going to get right near the cap anyway or, you know,
between $75 and $100, because we know that many lawyers'
rates are well above the cap -- if you preserve that
ratio --
JUSTICE ALITO: No. No. If the ratio -- if
lawyers were -- I know that if lawyers were compensated
at $125 an hour when this was enacted and paralegals
were compensated at $75, then it would be a 2-1 ratio,
and you'd preserve that.
MR. WOLFMAN: Yes. You could do that, and
what you would have is just a static rate for all
players in the market, and there's no suggestion that
Congress intended that. After all, I using the term
"prevailing market rates" --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Am I to understand, you
claim that even if they are expenses, they should --
they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, not quite market rate,
but this goes to -- I said I had two responses to
Justice Alito's question.
And the problem is that when we talk about
out-of-pocket expenses, again, which is where the
government is trying to shoe-horn the paralegal
services, we talk about out-of-pocket expenses for the
client, for the prevailing party. Expenses, whether
they are out-of-pocket expenses or attorney fees are --
are awarded to the prevailing party, and the cost faced
by the prevailing party is the cost to the prevailing
party, what it paid for the paralegal services.
Now, that will approximate the market rate,
no question about it. It might not always be synonymous
with it.
Justice Alito, I am not suggesting that
Congress could not have done it that way, but there is
no suggestion that it did. After all, in this statute,
compared to other fee-shifting statutes, it specifically
said it wants to work at the prevailing market rate.
And the only reason that in some markets for some
lawyers the -- the ceiling, the cap has become a floor
is because of hyperinflation in the legal services
market. It has nothing to do with the compensability of
paralegal services vis-a-vis junior associates, as I've
mentioned.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfman, if there's
any discretion in the district judge in setting the
amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate
to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an
hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer
is $200? Does it do the same thing with the paralegal?
The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it
down so that it will match the knock-down for the
lawyer?
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, the reason for that
is -- is that there -- there is no suggestion at all
that that's what was being contemplated in this statute.
And that may be the way that if you had seen this
phenomenon that's developed, which again is
hyperinflation in the legal services market, you might
have written it that way.
It's true that the courts have discretion.
There's always a reasonableness factor. But the
overriding factor is the market rate. The Congress said
"prevailing market rate." And to me, that would be
outside the bounds of any discretion that had been
afforded.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it likely that
when Congress said that, it was not thinking of
paralegals.
MR. WOLFMAN: No. I think -- I don't think
-- with respect, I don't think that's the question.
Going back -- that takes us back to Missouri versus
Jenkins, and what the Court said there is that you have
this word "attorney's fee," and the way of thinking of
attorney's fees is to include everything that goes into
the labor of the attorney that ultimately gets billed to
the client and that paralegal services are an aspect of
that.
Two years later, in West Virginia University
Hospitals, the Court made -- made essentially the same
point again, which is that -- that at the time that all
these fee-shifting statutes were passed, paralegal
services, to the extent that they existed, were
traditionally subsumed within the lawyer's rate. And so
that once law firms started billing for them
separately --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.
"Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate," are you
suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't
billed separately to the client?
MR. WOLFMAN: No. I'm not suggesting that.
I'm saying traditionally, well before they were passed,
they were subsumed to the market rate. There -- there
came to be a tradition, roughly in the '70s and early
'80s, for the separate billing. And what the Court held
emphatically in Missouri versus Jenkins was that the
separate billing didn't tell you anything about whether
there were attorney's fees.
--
Let me -- let me -- if I could extend my
answer a little bit. Appreciating what the government's
argument is here, the government's argument is that if
the paralegal fee, the paralegal services, are subsumed
within the lawyer's rate, if there were a law firm out
there that still didn't do the separate billing, that
would be compensable as an attorney's fees when billed
within the lawyer's rate. But if they're billed
separately under EAJA, the government's position is
they're not compensable at lawyers' rates.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that's no loss
to the government because when you put it into the
lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate
that much sooner.
MR. WOLFMAN: That is true --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems like that would be
MR. WOLFMAN: -- but that was not true in
80.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. WOLFMAN: And that's the point we are
making here. And it's true that it may not be, in this
day and age --
JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. Why wasn't it
true in 1980? You simply mean in 1980 the two together
wouldn't have gotten as high as the cap?
MR. WOLFMAN: Absolutely. If you -- in most
markets for most lawyers -- we deal with this
extensively in our brief. We cite case after case to
this effect. And I think -- and I don't mean to be glib
here -- I think the way to put this, that in 1980 and
85, that the statute covered virtually all lawyers'
fees rather comfortably on Main Street, if not
necessarily on K Street and Wall Street. I mean -- and
that's what the statute was for.
I know it's hard to appreciate that now,
when we see, you know, very high rates from the large
law firms, but put yourself back in that perspective,
which is -- in that vantage point, which we try to do in
our brief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that our decision
will in part drive the market either way, what we do
will effect the way paralegals are used, the way billing
is done. If that is true, is there some utility in
simply following the EAJA so we give a consistent signal
to the market and then if Congress wants to change it,
it can? I mean --
MR. WOLFMAN: I'm not sure I understand the
question.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Rather than follow EAJA, I
mean follow 1988, follow Jenkins. Follow Jenkins.
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, I certainly think
there's utility in doing that, and Congress can revisit
this. The difficulty is that Congress has not revisited
it. And Congress could revisit this and make -- I think
it's -- it is clear right now that the -- the purposes
of the statute are not being fully carried out because,
again, of the hyperinflation in legal services.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there some
disutilities from an economic standpoint in having two
structures: Jenkins for one kind of cases, EAJA in the
other cases as the government wants?
MR. WOLFMAN: Is there some --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there some
disadvantages to the system?
MR. WOLFMAN: I -- of course, we don't think
there are, but the -- to be candid, the -- the Federal
Circuit pointed to one purported disadvantage. The
Federal Circuit claimed that to the extent that there
was some incentive that would be driven by a contrary
decision, it would be that lawyers would shunt off more
work than is efficient to paralegals, and it's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- I saw
that analysis. This Act only applies when the
government's position is not substantially justified.
People are not going to structure their billing
arrangements assuming the government's position is not
even going to be substantially justified.
MR. WOLFMAN: I certainly agree that it is
unlikely, but as we point -- very unlikely. I agree
with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is another point
that I would make that we cover quite extensively in our
brief, which is that -- which is that -- I think you
have to step back and think about that for a second,
what the Federal Circuit did.
The notion that lawyers are going to shunt
off work to paralegals that they wouldn't otherwise
have, there are -- runs head long into both economic and
ethical constraints on the profession. Economic,
because if that was occurring, i.e., people were --
lawyers were giving paralegals work that they could not
sensibly do, clients would, one, insist that work not be
allocated like that; or, two, take their business
elsewhere. That's the economic constraints. If, in
other words, the whole premise --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That point makes
some assumptions about the relative abilities, say, of
junior associates and senior paralegals, and I'm not
sure are well founded.
(Laughter.)
MR. WOLFMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I
will -- I believe that you have greater experience on
that than I do.
But I think the other answer to that is the
ethical constraints. Even if there weren't economic
constraints -- I mean, as we pointed out in our brief,
sure, the paralegal profession has become an impressive
one. They do a lot of things that lawyers used to do,
no question. But a lawyer can't shunt off work that
they can't handle because there are ethical constraints.
I can't, for instance, give a paralegal,
say, responsibility for -- principal responsibility for
writing an appellate brief. I could not or would not do
that because they can't do that, generally speaking,
because of their training and experience.
So I just think that just falls apart. And
as you say, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact that -- of the
substantial justification defense and other reasons as
well, it's unlikely -- and this gets back to Justice
Kennedy's questions -- unlikely that law firms will
structure their practices and businesses around this
problem.
The real problem, though, is not an attack
on the government fisc, as we point out in our brief.
The impact on the public fisc for rejecting the Federal
Circuit's decision would be negligible. It's worth
noting, though, that the Federal Circuit's decision
would have an impact on clients most affected by it.
Three groups comprise the great majority of
EAJA applicants: Small businesses like Richlin,
disabled veterans, and disabled Social Security
claimants. In all three situations, clients will lose
if paralegal services are awarded at the cost of those
services to their lawyers. For the latter two groups,
veterans and Social Security claimants, Federal law, in
fact, requires that EAJA -- that the EAJA fee be paid to
the claimant.
So, although it makes economic sense for
paralegals to work on significant aspects of Social
Security and veterans' cases -- and that's set out at
some length in the amicus brief of the National
Association of Legal Assistants -- the claimants will
lose those fees under the government's view of EAJA.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that pertinent --
is that pertinent on the cap questions we've been
discussing too? I mean, if you're representing a
disabled veteran, is the lawyer typically charging more
than $125 an hour?
MR. WOLFMAN: No. This is how it works, and
that's why I said Federal law provides for this. And
let me give you the citations. They are also set forth
in footnote 2 of this Court's decision in Scarborough.
The way the Social Security and veterans
situations work -- and, again, they comprise the
majority of these cases -- is that the Federal law
allows the lawyer to take a contingent fee out of the
back benefits, not to exceed 20 and 25 percent of the
veterans' or Social Security claimants' back benefits,
respectively.
But then what Federal law also provides --
and the citations are Public Law 99-80 section 3 and
Public Law 102-572 section 506(c) -- Federal law
provides that to the extent that there is an EAJA fee,
the lawyer may not double-dip and has to send that fee
directly back to the client. So for these relatively
impecunious claimants, essentially chopping the
paralegal fee in third or in half or something like that
would have a real impact on claimants.
JUSTICE BREYER: I would not say no one
else, but not everyone else places the importance on
legislative history that I do, but I do. And I saw here
that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered all these
arguments, they wrote a report; and they sided with the
government.
MR. WOLFMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And I know it was there,
but it doesn't matter to me it was on a bill that was
later not passed, and then unless there is something
different --
MR. WOLFMAN: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- for that reason, because
in my own mind I'm thinking there were a group of people
on the committee, they went through the issue, they
reflected views of their principles, they work it out,
and unless something changed that makes me think that
isn't the working out of it, I would put a lot of weight
on it.
MR. WOLFMAN: Well -
JUSTICE BREYER: And now you're going to
tell me what there is, I hope.
MR. WOLFMAN: I'm certainly going to do
that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is -- and I do
want to point out for the benefit of the other members
of the Court that -- is that that piece of legislative
history accompanied vetoed legislation. But let me also
say that, and we explained this at some length both in
our opening and reply briefs, that the government relies
on a snippet saying that paralegals -- paralegal
services can be awarded, and then it says paren, at
cost. But there are a number of other aspects of that
same piece of legislative history that point in exactly
the opposite direction in terms of market rate recovery,
and in fact the Court cites -- excuse me, the committee
cites a case from the Sixth Circuit, the Northcross
case, in which paralegal services were awarded at market
rates.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And of course they
may mean -- may have meant costs to the client.
MR. WOLFMAN: And that is -- and that is my
next point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that it said "at
cost," but at whose cost? And the problem here, is that
this piece of fee shifting statute and every other fee
shifting statute of which I am aware awards a fee to the
prevailing party. The purpose of the statute is not to
enrich the lawyers. The purpose of the statute is to
provide incentive for lawyers to handle cases on behalf
of clients. Unless the Court has any further questions,
I'll reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Mr. Yang.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. YANG: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
EAJA authorizes Federal agencies to award
two distinct categories of litigation expenses against
the United States: fees and other expenses. The most
natural reading of attorney's fees is one that embraces
an attorney's time, payments for an attorney's time,
whereas the broader term "other expenses" naturally
encompasses outlays that are paid by an attorney during
its representation of a client including the cost of
paralegals whose work may be necessary for the
preparation of a client's case.
Congress recognized this distinction between
attorney's fees and other expenses when it enacted EAJA
in 1980. The relevant Senate report, like EAJA's House
report, stated that the ceiling on "attorney's fees" --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say the relevant
one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed,
right?
MR. YANG: Actually this is even before EAJA
lacks the first time, this is upon EAJA's initial
enactment in 1980, there was a Senate report and a House
report and both have functionally identical language.
The Senate report states that quote, "attorney's fees
relates only to the compensation of lawyers themselves"
and then goes on to explain that costs connected with
their representation of a particular interest in a
proceeding is not affected by the limitation that is the
cap on attorney's fees. When Congress then re-enacted
EAJA after its repeal, Congress again made clear -- and
this is the report that, Mr. Chief Justice, you were
referring to -- made clear that the "other expenses" of
EAJA fees includes an attorney's out-of-pocket expenses,
and that those out-of-pocket expenses were illustrated
by the specific example of paralegal time being
reimbursed at cost.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is cost? Could you
-- one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and
come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in
the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead,
there is the fringe benefits -- so just giving the
hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to
the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to
determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal,
the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.
MR. YANG: Justice Ginsburg, the government
agrees that more than simply salary would be
reimbursable at cost. And I think the appropriate way
to calculate cost in the context of paralegals would
be -- would parallel how the government calculates its
cost for attorneys when the government seeks attorney's
fees. And what the government does is it uses salary as
a baseline and then adds -- for the government 29 or
approximately 29 percent of salaries for other benefits.
And --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well and it might be
quite different for private practitioner. Your benefits
for health care will probably cost you a lot less than
private practice and doesn't that make the paralegal
fees quite different than the other items of expenses
that are listed? You know, expert witnesses, you get a
bill, that's how much it costs the lawyer. Studies,
analysis, engineering reports, you don't have to figure
overhead benefits with respect to any of those. All of
a sudden you throw in another item, paralegal costs, you
put those under costs, and now you've got to go through
this elaborate calculation that is going to be not worth
it, almost, for a typical firm representing a small
client.
MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not sure
that I agree with some of the premises that you had.
First, with respect to the analysis and reports and
such, those are not always things that are done outside
a law firm. The statutory text, in fact, allows the
reimbursement of costs for any study, analysis, report,
test or project; it's not limited to things that are
done outside of a firm. I mean also be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in most firms
an engineering report would be outside the --
MR. YANG: Well, that's an engineering
report, except for maybe, some intellectual property
firms but --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me the
question is a valid one, that you're running away from
the question.
MR. YANG: Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'll let you answer.
It suggests this further inquiry. Suppose that a solo
practitioner knows that a paralegal in another firm is
very good at this and he asks the other lawyer, may I
use your paralegal, and he just sends that lawyer the
bill. What -- how would that be billed under your view?
MR. YANG: Well, there is now two questions
in the air.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: They both -- they both
apply, they both apply to outside experts.
MR. YANG: Well, when a paralegal is
outsourced, which is your question, there is two
potential situations. One may be that the paralegal is
less expensive, and if that were the case you would
think that firms would normally outsource their
paralegals if it's less expensive to obtain them from
the outside than the inside.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that
wasn't Justice Kennedy's question. His was the
outsourced paralegal is better at a particular task.
MR. YANG: The outsourced paralegal is
better, it may be that the actual cost to the firm is
the cost that the firm pays for that paralegal to the
third party.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well in that case it would
bill the paralegal in the same way it would bill, I take
it, the expense of, let's say, having water tested in a
pollution case. It would -- it would -- I take it it
would bill the client dollar for dollar what it had to
pay.
MR. YANG: In fact that's right --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And add --
MR. YANG: And not add profit on to that --
that paralegal as well.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They don't add a profit and
they don't add a profit on to -- to travel expenses and
things like that.
MR. YANG: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- so if that is so, in
each case cost means cost to the client, and you're
coming up with a new category of expense, which is cost
to someone else, and why should there be a subcategory
of expense, in which cost does not mean cost to the
client when every other category of expense does mean
cost to the client?
MR. YANG: Justice Souter, every other
category does not mean cost to the client. In fact,
EAJA specifically provides for fees, but the fees are
based on the prevailing market rates for similar
services.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Because there is a separate
provision for fees.
MR. YANG: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. YANG: But in that context a client does
not incur any legal fees, have any obligation to pay any
fees, and courts routinely award EAJA fees when there
has been no cost to the client in fees, and similarly,
even if the client has an obligation to pay the cost in
those circumstances -- where for instance a firm is
providing pro bono services or a legal services
organization is providing pro bono services to a client,
the client does not have to incur or pay the costs.
The question is whether those costs have
been ultimately incurred and have been incurred at the
rate that the firm has incurred the cost on behalf of
the client.
JUSTICE STEVENS: At this discretion, let me
ask this question. Maybe it's the same question Justice
Kennedy asked, but I want to be sure of your answer.
Suppose you had independent firm of paralegals. I don't
know whether the market contains them, but it surely
could. A firm that they are all paralegals, and they
then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and
then the law firm in turn bills the client. In that
situation, would the market rate of the independent firm
of paralegals govern?
MR. YANG: It would be the rate that is
ultimately paid. If you're outsourcing the paralegals
it would be the rate paid by the firm for those
paralegals. Now it may also be, for instance --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand the
government's position that the -- the result would
different if a firm uses its own paralegals as opposed
to outsourcing?
MR. YANG: The result is not different, Your
Honor. The result is the same in the sense that the
firm's cost --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But under my example
they would be paying the market rate for paralegals, and
I think you say they could be reimbursed for that.
MR. YANG: It wouldn't necessarily be the
market rate. It may would be what they are paying,
which may well reflect the market rate.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they are not market
to make business. I presume the paralegals would charge
the going rate.
MR. YANG: If they did.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I assume that they also
charged the market rate.
MR. YANG: It may be. But if it's the
market rate, there would presumably be no incentive for
a firm to outsource --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But again, you're not
answering the hypothetical. Let's assume two cases:
Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour.
He is outside, he is independent. He is just like the
expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an
hour. Case two, it's your own paralegal. The
prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is
$85 an hour.
Why should there be a difference?
MR. YANG: There should be a difference,
Your Honor, because with respect to outsourced firms,
there is no concern that a firm is going to add, well --
if the firm is only going to bill at its cost, the firm
is not going to add additional profit to the outsourced
paralegal.
So if, for instance, a firm paid $85, under
our view the firm could not turn around and charge $95
to the client. Likewise -- and the reason that this is
important under your context --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under your -- they
can't even charge $85 an hour.
MR. YANG: Well, that's correct if their
cost, actual cost would be less in house. And the
reason that's important is because in EAJA, unlike
section 1988, there are several statutory differences.
One, EAJA provides for other expenses, so the term
"attorney's fees" is not the only terms that needs to be
construed by the court. Other expenses needs to be
construed in a manner that gives it meaningful effect.
And Congress recognized, again, in the
legislative history to the extent you could disagree on
the meaning of other expenses, Congress was very clear
both in 1980 and then again in 1984 that other expenses,
attorney's fees do not include things that attorneys pay
and only compensates attorneys for their own hourly
rate.
And the reason that the fee cap was
important is because EAJA, as this Court recognized in
Underwood, is not intended to be fully compensatory. If
the cap for --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know you said that a
few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to
me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees
and costs -- and costs is very limited in the statute in
20 -- and if you have attorney's fees and other
expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than
costs within 1988. So I -- I would think that, well,
EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more
items.
MR. YANG: Justice Ginsburg, under Jenkins'
rationale, Jenkins recognized that when there is not
another -- another box of other expenses, where in a
statute which was intended to be fully compensatory,
that attorney's fees necessarily must include
compensation for all types of costs that a lawyer might
incur in the presentation/representation of a client.
That works for Section 1988.
But if that rationale were applied to the
EAJA context, if attorney's fees were given the same
meaning in EAJA, there is little or no work for other
expenses to be done in the statute, because already
you've pushed all of those expenses into the box of
attorney's fees and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your --
this question only arises when the position of your
client was not substantially justified. Now under
those -- and it was designed, to some extent, to
penalize you because -- because of that fact. Why
should we adopt a construction that, in effect,
penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal
Government when the Federal Government's position was
not substantially justified? They are going to have to
pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are
only goes to get compensation at cost.
MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, the reason
that you would adopt our construction is because
Congress is balancing more than the intent to provide
compensation for prevailing parties in EAJA. It was
also intending to balance the effect on the Federal fisc
and limit the government's exposure as a means of
passing the Act.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a
stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law
that only applies to individuals or small businesses
where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that
we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat
paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate.
I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.
MR. YANG: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think
the legislative history illustrates that, in fact,
paralegals and other costs --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it assumes
that when they said "costs," that they meant costs to
the firm as opposed to costs to the client. And that, I
think, is entirely an open question.
MR. YANG: Well, the relevant page of the
legislative history in 1984 that you're talking about
explains that Congress wanted to adopt the views of the
Administrative Conference in its model rules, and goes
on to quote the Administrative Conference --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not to belabor the
point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate
report may have meant that.
MR. YANG: Well, that's a problem with all
legislative history.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think it is a
problem with legislative history.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: I think that the people in
Congress who hired their staffs pay attention to what
the staffs say in precisely the same way that any other
executive --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know what the
President's view was on that question when he signed the
legislation into law, which is what he was required to
do before it became law and which he did not do under
the prior bill?
MR. YANG: The President did not express a
view, but what we do know is that the legislative
history in 1984 dealt with language that was identical
to that ultimately passed by the Senate -- by Congress
and signed by the President. And that legislative
history explains and quotes the Administrative
Conference that says that what should be awarded is an
award of reasonable expenses of the attorney.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any other
case where we used -- I mean it just gets worse and
worse. Do you know any other case where we've used the
legislative history of a vetoed bill to determine the
meaning of a later bill that was not vetoed?
MR. YANG: Yes, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Good. What is it?
MR. YANG: This Court has twice cited
unanimous opinions, the same report that we cite here,
one of which was in the Jean opinion. In fact, the
Court not only cited the Senate report, but also cited
the House report to the 1984 bill.
JUSTICE SCALIA: When was that?
MR. YANG: Jean?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MR. YANG: Pardon my --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Never mind. Don't take --
don't waste your time.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean that wouldn't be
surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because
you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14
sections and section of the B bill could have been
vetoed -- been vetoed because of problem with Section 14
and repassed without Section 14, in which case the
legislative history for the other 13 sections would be
highly illuminating as to what they mean.
MR. YANG: In fact Congress recognized that,
Justice Breyer, when it re-enacted -- when it
readdressed the bill in 1985, the relative legislative
history specifically references the bill that existed
before that it was reported by --
JUSTICE BREYER: The question that I had in
respect to this statute is -- is that my impression and
here -- I'd like to know how they bill secretary's
times. I'd like to know how they bill rent. And my
thought is -- and I want to be either verified or told
I'm wrong and explain it, that when you have no cap, the
lawyer and the client want to shove everything possible
into the rubric attorney's fees, including the kitchen
sink, if the plumber is there in the kitchen of the law
firm.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That's fine. No problem.
There is no other way to get paid for them.
But where you have a cap, you should shove
everything the other side, if expenses are going to be
paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will
not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the
cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only
that lawyer's time. And everything else goes into
expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he
will recover his expenses elsewhere.
Was that the theory of this bill? Is there
any evidence that that was the theory? If you did it
that way, would anything get mixed up?
MR. YANG: Well, the theory of the bill was
that attorney's fees would be based at prevailing market
rates, and that prevailing market rates would embody a
certain set of costs that might be reimbursed. I would
think that the prevailing practice is not to bill
separately for the kitchen sink, but as the Court
explained in Missouri versus Jenkins, Missouri's
analysis would extend to your hypothetical, Justice
Breyer. It explains that reasonable attorney's fees had
to cover all kinds of costs, including the costs of
secretaries, messengers, librarians or janitors who
might well be cleaning the kitchen sink.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right that when this
language first came in -- this is in relation to Justice
Breyer's question -- there was no cap? When did the --
when was the cap put on?
MR. YANG: The cap in EAJA was imposed from
the very beginning.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was.
MR. YANG: Yes. It was. It was in the
Senate bill. It was -- it was removed by subcommittee,
reinserted by the full judiciary committee, passed the
Senate, came over to the House and continued on for
passage in 1980.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be a lot of
weight to be put on three little words: "Billed at
cost." If you just read those words, you could be the
costs to the client, the cost to the law firm and then
you'd have to go to this further document, the
Administrative Conference document, it's rather thin I
think.
MR. YANG: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we are
relying not only on the 1984 but also on the 1980
legislative history, which although it does not
specifically refer to paralegals, explains that in
connection with the term "attorney's fees" and the
ceiling on attorney's fees -- and I'll quote again from
the Senate report, which was the first: Ceiling on
attorney's fees relates only to the compensation of
lawyers themselves. And then goes on to say: That does
not include other costs connected with their
representation of a particular interest in a proceeding.
And when Congress did that, it specifically
recognized that it was taking a different approach than
that taken in other fee-shifting statutes. The very
next sentence explains that the committee notes that
this section is not intended to limit or affect the
computation of reasonable attorney's fees under any
other provision of law, and gave as an example the Civil
Rights Act. That is section 1988.
So Congress knew from the very beginning
that its treatment of attorney's fees as being limited
only to attorneys and the larger more capacious category
of other expenses, capturing all other costs that an
attorney might incur in the representation of a client
was one that was both different from other statutes, and
one that was intended by Congress. And it's not
reflected not only by the legislative history, but again
by fee caps.
The fee caps I believe you started here were
specifically designed and set by reference to attorney's
rates, the exceptions to the fee caps -- again
specifically reference attorneys. There is an exception
that you can exceed the fee cap when there is a limited
availability of the attorneys qualified at the
proceedings involved. And it would be anomalous in that
context where Congress has paid particular attention to
the billing rates of attorneys, set the cap based on
attorney's rates with no reference to paralegals to
assume --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back --
MR. YANG: -- that Congress intended --
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to the
point, because I think you were cut off before you went
into the full legislative history. I'm still concerned
about the argument that even if they are not fees but
rather costs, that the costs should be those that are
billed to the client. And you think there is some
conclusive answer in the legislative history that that's
not the case.
MR. YANG: Well, the legislative history
when you -- again, if you look to what Congress was
talking about, both the Administrative Conference rules
and the quotation of the Administrative Conference rules
--
JUSTICE STEVENS: Which took place when?
MR. YANG: This was in 1984.
JUSTICE STEVENS: At that time were they
billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client? Was
it --
MR. YANG: In fact, Your Honor, there was a
dispute that the legislative history speaks to the
controversy that evolved regarding the -- whether other
expenses of the term would include more than what was
specifically enumerated in the statute. And what we
cite to in our brief as a footnote at page 28, footnote
, there was a dispute. Several courts had concluded
that paralegals were reimbursed at cost. In fact, the
Northcross decision, which the committee reports,
specifically references -- concluded that it was costs
to the attorney, as this Court recognized in Jenkins.
Footnote seven of Jenkins discusses the Northcross
decision and explains that Northcross awarded
out-of-pocket expenses for attorney's fees at the cost
to the attorney.
And so, when you take that controversy which
had evolved regarding how you compensate these other
expenses -- and specifically paralegal expenses -- along
with Congress' statement that it intended to compensate
out-of-pocket expenses incurred with connection to a
case, the model rules and Northcross when you combine
that with the statement that paralegals are to be
compensated at cost, seems clear to us that Congress is
intending that in contrast to attorney's fees, which
have a profit element embedded in them and a profit
element capped by the fee cap that Congress imposed in
80 -- that when read together, it seems fairly clear
to us that Congress intended --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Every expense that's
reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for
whoever performed the service.
MR. YANG: But when it's within the control
of the firm --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Business or otherwise.
MR. YANG: -- within the control of the
firm, there is a particular danger that the firm can
inflate its own costs. Whereas when it's going out to
the market, of course, it's not going to control the
profits.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe this is
the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't --
I didn't grasp the answer. Under your system it would
make sense for lawyers to charge separately for
photocopy services, telephone services, so on because
then they are not going to be subject to the attorney
fee cap. And they may think, look, the difference
between cost and market rate is relatively small; the
difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.
MR. YANG: You're asking about the
incentives that firms might have.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm just
saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be,
I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as
I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for
things at a higher rate than their cost? They will
charge higher rate for photocopy services because they
try to factor into it overhead and things like than
cost.
MR. YANG: Overhead profit. We don't
believe it's actually going to change any practices,
because ultimately, when you're looking at what costs
are reimbursable under EAJA, it has to be costs that are
not traditionally already paid for in the attorney's
fees. So you have to look not to the practice of the
specific firm that's at issue, you have to look at the
prevailing practice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would say --
I would say that it's now traditional for firms to
charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it
cost them.
MR. YANG: Well, if that's the case under
our reading, of course, we would -- we would say that
that is -- that is not a type of expense that was
contemplated by EAJA, because Congress already provided
for profits that attorneys get from representing a party
within the attorney fee and cap that.
The whole idea of a cap is to limit the
reimbursement that a firm might get from EAJA below what
the prevailing market rates for the services would be.
If the -- the prevailing market rates were below the
cap, the cap never comes into play. The only reason for
that cap is to limit compensation below market rates.
And it would be anomalous to allow --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the cap doesn't apply
to expenses, does it?
MR. YANG: I didn't catch you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The cap does not apply to
reimbursement expenses at cost?
MR. YANG: Precisely, because in our view
expenses are at cost and it is not -- you don't have the
same danger of having firms imbedding profit within
their own rate.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me just the
opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests. It seems
to me you're creating an incentive for the firms to --
to charge as much as they can -- I mean, under market
rates for everything under the -- under the time of the
lawyer himself.
MR. YANG: But again, and under our view if
they were to -- if a firm were to charge, say, 50 cents
for a photocopy and it only cost 10 or 15 cents for that
photocopy, under our view the firm would only be
reimbursed for our for the 15 cents. The not an
incentive to bill the client for anything more --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, because other costs
reasonably interpret to include overhead. It's not just
the paper and the accounting time.
MR. YANG: Overhead, we don't believe, is
fairly attributable to a particular case. And, in fact,
Congress was specific about this particular point on
overhead in the legislative history.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you
missed my point. It was even if you're right, 50 cents
and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an
incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because
they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to --
they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no
that's part of the attorney's fees.
MR. YANG: I guess you're right to some
extent there would be incentive to shift out costs even
though there would be less of an incentive than shifting
out costs plus profit. But the reason that -- that
the -- the reason that we think that that's a bit
different is because, again, Congress intended for the
profit making part of a -- an attorney's compensation to
come out of attorney's fees, and then are capped. And
there is very little incentive to -- to shift out fees
unless the market itself is already doing that. And if
the market itself is already billing for photocopies,
then that's what you're going to get. Even if you
didn't separately charge for photocopies as part of your
rate, you could bill under EAJA. The market is
providing for photocopies being billed separately, you
can simply submit a request for photocopies.
JUSTICE SCALIA: When you have a -- you can
submit it a letter. I've looked in your brief, I can't
find this Jean case that you mentioned on use of veto.
I have a certain morbid interest in it.
(Laughter.)
MR. YANG: It's at 496 U.S. 154. And
it's -- I believe it's cited, it's Commissioner, INS
versus Jean. And I apologize if it's not there, but I
thought it was. Yes. No. That's right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd like to go back to a
question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman.
Isn't there -- doesn't it make sense to take a word like
"attorney's fees" and like the word "discrimination," we
have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but
there has been an attempt to give that word
"discrimination" the same meaning in all those statutes.
And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that
includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say
every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's
going to mean?
MR. YANG: As a general rule, in
fee-shifting statutes that are like Section 1988, that
is in fact the rule. But the rule that similar words
are given a similar meaning readily yields when there is
indication that Congress did not intend the same to
apply here, and in fact for instance in the Fogerty
versus Fantasy case, the Court specifically rejected the
approach of adopting the understanding of reasonable
attorney's fees applied in other fee-shifting statutes,
because it found that the policy and legislative history
of the Copyright Act required or at least suggested that
Congress intended something else.
And here, not only do we have a different
legislative history, we have fundamentally different
statutory text. There is a second category of other
--
expenses that must be given meaning in conjunction with
attorney's fees. It did not --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well on that point, does the
statute say that all non fee expenses are compensable at
cost? Or are you arguing that the work that's done by
paralegals is a study or analysis project?
MR. YANG: It's either a, it can be a study
or analysis or at least analogous to that type of a -- a
JUSTICE ALITO: Which is it, is it a study
analysis or project? That seems like a strange way of
describing it.
MR. YANG: It can be -- it can be a project,
for instance in this case, the paralegal compiled the
relevant information regarding how much wages needed to
be developed, repaid on the merits of the case, how much
taxes needed to be reimbursed. That could be understood
as a project, particularly when Congress has modified it
with any, the word "any" before.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, there are
occasions, aren't there, when the government is entitled
to attorney's fees?
MR. YANG: There are occasions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know how you
bill paralegal times -- time in those situations?
MR. YANG: We often don't bill them
separately.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You often don't bill
them separately.
MR. YANG: I -- I asked this question. I
have not been able to determine that we have ever billed
paralegal time separately. Normally, like every other
litigant in a normal fee-shifting statute that would
provide for attorney's fees, and again, just the way the
government calculates it, it is based on overall costs
per benefit, ends up some percent of salary. There is
an attorney fees that benefits -- percentage and a small
overhead charge as well. For the attorney's fees, not
separately for paralegals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang.
Mr. Wolfman, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOLFMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
I want to start where the discussion left
off. It harkens back to some things that Mr. Yang said
towards the beginning of his argument. He said that,
that if the Federal Circuit weren't affirmed, that there
would be no meaning to the term "other expenses," but
that's just not so; it would begin to lose its meaning.
It means things like travel, long distance
phone, copying, the types of things we think of as
out-of-pocket expenses. The problem here is they are
shoe-horning a -- the government is shoe-horning what is
always conceived of as an in-house professional service
as an out-of-pocket expense, and it just does not fit
there.
Let me turn to the legislative history and
I'd like to do two things with that before I close. The
first is, let's presuppose that it should be given some
weight, as Justice Breyer has suggested, and the problem
is that it just doesn't bear the weight that the
government gives the report. If you look at -- and this
is discussed at length at page 12 of our reply brief --
let's turn for instance to the administrative conference
report. Here's what it says. It's a 46 Federal
Register 32913. It says that: With regard to expenses,
they should be compensable whenever the lawyer, quote,
"ordinarily charges clients separately for such
expenses." That's the situation today with paralegal
expenses.
Then it's true that the ACUS, the
administrative conference, did not issue a hard and fast
rule with respect to paralegal expenses. But that of
course is because the market wasn't uniform at that time
as it is today. Today it's nearly ubiquitous that
paralegal services are -- are separately billed. But
listen to what the court said --said: Indeed, we
decline to issue because, quote, "practices with respect
to charging clients for paralegal time vary depending on
locality and field of practice."
But that statement reflects exactly our
position. That the rule the Court embraced in Jenkins
is that the compensability of paralegal services should
replicate prevailing practices in the market.
Now let me just end by -- by -- on this
note. If, there is also the question raised about
whether you should give any weight to this -- this
report at all. We say that you should not for the
reasons, essentially in Justice Scalia's last question
on that topic; but we do -- we do talk about why the
Jean decision use of that report does not wear the
weight that the government gives us, and that's on pages
and 14 of our brief, our reply brief. And the reason
is, is because in Jean, no one brought to the Court's
attention in any of the briefs the problem that the --
that legislative history accompanied vetoed legislation.
It was never brought to the Court's attention. In the
Scarborough case three years ago, neither the majority
opinion nor the dissent cited that report.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I think
Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no
reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they
had already done on a bill that was substantially
identical?
MR. WOLFMAN: That might be true in some
circumstances, but that's not what happened in 1985.
There was an extensive House report accompanying that
legislation. There was no Senate report. The House
report --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was no Senate
report because they had done it just the previous year.
MR. WOLFMAN: I think not, Your Honor.
There were some other things taken up in the House
report and the House report, quite extensive, says
nothing; it's silent on the question of paralegal
services.
Look, let me just say as I close -- may I
answer the question?
Let me just say as I close that -- that if
the Court wishes to look at that report, at the very
best for the government, it's a wash. Thank you very
much.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel,
the case is submitted.
