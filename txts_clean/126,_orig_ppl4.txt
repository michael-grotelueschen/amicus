CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case No. 126 on the original
docket, Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado.
Mr. McAllister.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Kansas seeks to ensure that Nebraska has
effective incentives to comply with its compact
obligations every year, including the years when water
is scarce.  To achieve that goal, Kansas asked this
Court to take two measures:  First, award a significant
amount of disgorgement for Nebraska's massive gain from
its compact violation; and second, decline to rewrite
the detailed and complicated settlement agreement that
the parties reached in 2002, an agreement that is full
of compromises and concessions on all sides.
Ultimately, Kansas wants to receive the
water to which it is entitled year in and year out,
including especially when water is scarce.  The best way
to achieve that is to impose significant disgorgement
for Nebraska's massive gain and leave any changes to the
accounting procedures to the parties and to the process
that has been created under the compact, the RRCA.  I'd
like to start with -- with the accounting procedures
argument.
Nebraska and the master suggest that
the Court should rewrite the way we calculate Nebraska's
consumption of imported water supply, but Kansas
disagrees that that's appropriate here for several
reasons.
First of all, that agreement itself was a
complex set of concessions and compromises.  The model
is, at best, an estimation of what's going on in the
basin.  No one actually knows, perhaps can know, how
much imported water comes over from the Platte or how
much actually gets consumed.  The parties were aware of
the very phenomenon that the master and Nebraska focus
on.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- you know
roughly what the amount of extra -- I don't know what
the word -- liability on Nebraska is.  What if it were
way off?  What if the formula resulted in Kansas getting
50 percent more water than the parties anticipated?
Still no authority to revise the formula?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, Your Honor, I think
if the argument is there's a mistake, then we have to
find an actual mistake.  That's what justifies the
extraordinary remedy of reformation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I thought it was --
it was agreed that the compact itself doesn't govern
imported water, which this procedure covers.  So if it's
not within the compact itself, then how can it stand?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, Your Honor, it's --
it's not as black or white as the master said.  By
implication, the compact does not cover imported water.
It never actually uses the words "imported water."  It
talks about the virgin water supply.  And it's certainly
the parties' goal to try to exclude the imported water
from the calculation, but we did that very deliberately
with the imported water supply credit, which is very
substantial and which Nebraska gets.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought that --
that the parties were not aware of the error that proved
beneficial to Kansas.  So you say that there were many
compromises, tradeoffs, but in this particular result,
the parties were not aware that the accounting
procedures would include this imported water.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I disagree with that
statement, Your Honor.  They were aware that it could.
There may not have been awareness of the magnitude
potentially of the situation and whether, in fact, it
would arise.  But the parties -- there's evidence -- for
example, Colorado's expert was asked when did you first
realize this could happen under the model and he said:
About 15 minutes after I looked at it.  The Kansas
expert also recognized it was possible.
All of this is an estimation.  And -- and
what happens, in our view, is Nebraska is saying, well,
now we think we've come up with a better way to more
accurately measure this based on new information, new
modeling techniques that may be available.  But there's
a mechanism for making those changes and it's through
the RRCA process.  It wasn't a mistake.  They just think
they've got a better way to do it now.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is -- what is that
mechanism?  What -- what does that process entail?
MR. McALLISTER:  That process entails the
chief water officers of each State and they meet
regularly and they can and have considered changes to
both the accounting procedures and the model.  Both have
been changed over time by agreement of the RRCA.
It's -- it's kind of like what was at issue
in the Texas v. New Mexico except there it was just two
States and they each had to agree; now it's three
States.  And each has a vote.  And if all three States
agree on a change, then a change is made.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Will you accept that then,
that we send it to that group and the group tries to
work it out and if they fail to work it out, the master
imposes a solution?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, that's where we
disagree that there --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  I don't
understand, because I thought as it turns out when this
river is dry, as it sometimes is, and there's no water
in there, that Nebraska -- that they -- they don't --
they use only imported water, which they should have
every right to take all of it if they wanted to.  But
nonetheless, due to a mistake in the model, it counts it
as if they were taking all the Republican River water.
And nobody wanted that.  That would be totally unfair.
And that's what the master says and so they made a
mistake about how the model worked.  So what do you
suggest we do about the mistake?  Nothing?
MR. McALLISTER:  I suggest you do nothing
about the mistake and send it back --
JUSTICE BREYER:  In which case, if we do
nothing, it's like as if I were to enter into an
agreement and I bought 17 cows from the barn and it
turned out the barn didn't have any cows.  It just had
horses.  Okay.  So we're under a mutual mistake.  Now,
what do we do?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, except I disagree
with the premise that it's a mutual mistake, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But there's a finding that
the --
MR. McALLISTER:  The master certainly
characterizes it that way, but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  All right.  Now, if I
accept the master's characterization, what is it I'm
supposed to do in your opinion?  I -- I don't think if
you have the cow or horse or something, and everybody
agrees it's a mistake, or if they don't the judge finds
it's a mistake, then what is a court supposed to do?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, again, two things.
Reformation requires clear and convincing proof of an
actual mistake.  Kansas doesn't believe that's present.
But then the purpose of reformation is to -- to put
together what the parties actually intended.  And
there's no real agreement that what the parties intended
was the particular 5-run solution that the master
suggests.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now -- now,
fine.  Sois it all right with you if we were to write
these words:  You agree, Kansas agrees, the object is to
get what the parties really intended; therefore, send it
to this group and if the group agrees, fine.  And if
they don't agree, special master, you impose what the
parties really intended.  And, of course, if they don't
accept that, they can always appeal here, but
nonetheless, that would be a way of resolving it.
MR. McALLISTER:  That would be a way of
resolving it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And what's wrong with that?
Or do you have a better way?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, one problem with the
master's solution, the 5-run solution, is all he is
concerned about is the imported water supply.  That's
only one piece of this.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think your objection is
that what the parties really intended was to adopt this
particular formula, which they knew might be inaccurate.
And that's -- what's the parallel is -- is not buying
horses in a barn, but buying whatever animals are in the
barn.  Although both parties believed it was a mix, it
turns out that was wrong.  But the deal was the deal,
right?  They were --
MR. McALLISTER:  That is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  They were rolling the dice.
MR. McALLISTER:  That is fundamentally --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whatever animals were in
the barn.
MR. McALLISTER:  -- fundamentally the Kansas
position, because I would like to emphasize the
tradeoffs that went into this.  We did give Nebraska a
substantial imported water supply credit.  There are in
fact questions about whether some of that water is
actually Republican River water being counted as
imported water.  That's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You want us to apply
ordinary contract principles on this issue of
reformation; is that right?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, yes.  I mean, the
high level of -- it's an extraordinary remedy and
difficult to achieve and it's only to be used to put in
place what the parties actually intended when somehow
they mistakenly --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And do you want us to do the
same thing on the issue of disgorgement?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, disgorgement in our
view is different, Your Honor, because --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You want us to apply
ordinary contract principles?
MR. McALLISTER:  You can for disgorgement,
although there are other theories that also support and
justify disgorgement, which the master recognized here.
So the fact that the compact also has status as a -- as
a statute is one.  The fact that what's really being
affected is downstream water rights, real property.
That's another theory.  We argue there's an analogy to
fiduciary duty, we're not saying there is a fiduciary
duty.  But my point is disgorgement can be justified by
more than contract principles here.  That is one basis
for justifying it.
But what I wanted to say to Justice Scalia's
point, we gave Nebraska several things in that agreement
and we knew this model wasn't perfect.  Everybody -- it
can't be, it never will be.  It's too complicated;
there's too many unknowns.  We gave Nebraska a high
credit for groundwater recharge at a percentage much
higher than Colorado and Kansas get and Nebraska crowed
about that as a concession they got from Kansas that was
worth 15 to $20 million annually, that's Exhibit K, 133,
in the record.  We also gave up all claims for any
potential compact violations prior to the agreement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the
special master specifically found that this was not part
of the bargaining and tradeoff.
MR. McALLISTER:  The special master was
focused on the bottom line notion that somehow we were
supposed to reach a bottom line accounting.  And -- and
with all due respect to the special master, he's simply
wrong that the parties did not purposely negotiate for
calculating all of these factors, the imported water
supply credit, the consumption of each State, the way we
did.  Kansas specifically wanted the mound turned on
as they calculated --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How -- how do we decide --
is -- is this a question on which we have to defer to
the master's factfinding?  Is it a question of fact what
the parties intended?  Or are we to look at the
agreement and decide it from the agreement?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think you can
certainly decide it from the agreement, Justice Scalia.
I think the Court's cases have said things like you give
respect to the master's findings, but it is actually a
de novo proceeding, so there's no -- no deference that
has to be given to the master's findings.  And here, the
agreement itself would --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I'm going to give
more deference, I suppose, if -- if I think it is
entirely relevant what the prior negotiations were, and
that it was appropriate for him to look into that.  And
to reach the conclusion he did.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think you could
reach the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If on the other hand, I
think it's -- it's the text of the agreement that
governs, I don't care what he found about the
negotiations.
MR. McALLISTER:  And I think you could
certainly ignore the negotiations.  What I'm saying is
you can look in that agreement and find many tradeoffs,
some of which benefited Nebraska significantly.  Some of
which may benefit Kansas and Colorado.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  As you understand it, does
the -- do both parties agree that we treat this as an
application of reformation principles in an ordinary
contract or is there some argument that because this
negotiation was pursuant to provisions where a special
master had been involved, that there is some more
latitude for reforming the contract, so that the earlier
special master's participation somehow gives this
contract an equitable character and makes it easier to
reform.  Does anybody argue the latter?
MR. McALLISTER:  Certainly, Kansas doesn't.
I -- I can't speak for Nebraska.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  Well, I want
you to know -- as I understand Nebraska's position, they
argue that ordinary contract principles apply.  I may be
wrong.
MR. McALLISTER:  That's -- I agree.  That's
my reading.  So I don't think anyone is suggesting a
lesser standard.  And in fact, taking it back to Special
Master McKusick, when he approved this, at the urging of
people, including my colleague, Mr. Cookson, who said,
Special Master, this is close enough, you know, it's not
perfect, but everything comes out in the wash, it's more
or less a good deal for everyone.  And Special Master
McKusick said, no party represents this is perfect, and
that there might not be other ways to do this.  But this
is a reasonable way to resolve the dispute in --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  General, can I try to better
understand what you think would have been different in
the contract.  Suppose that Nebraska had come in with
the 5-run proposal at -- when you were negotiating this,
and said this is really a much better way of doing what
we all agree we ought to do, which is separate out the
virgin water from the imported water.
What would have been different in the
contract?  What would you have done -- what provisions
would you not have had if?  If that 5-run proposal had
been there and you had accepted it.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I -- I can mention
three or four things that might be different.
Obviously, it's hypothetical, but one thing that the
5-run solution does is it does take care of the imported
water issue, but it actually increases the problem with
the unaccounted-for depletions from groundwater pumping,
which is what the whole prior round of litigation was
about, was that those count under the compact, too.  And
so the master's solution may solve, if you will, one
problem, the problem that Nebraska sees, it exacerbates
another problem.  So we'd certainly want to talk about
that.  That was what the 16-run solution did a better
job of, but Colorado objected to that because their ox
was being gored.  That's why they came around when they
made a deal with Nebraska to the 5-run.
But the other things that could be
negotiated here, certainly, their groundwater recharge
amount is very generous to them.  Again, they said 15 to
20 million annually.  That's worth -- we could revisit
that.  We could revisit an issue of they get credit for
water that's coming back on irrigated lands to the
groundwater, but some of that is probably precipitation
that's infiltrating.  That's not fully accounted for.
Even the imported water supply credit is
probably unduly generous, because it likely includes
some Republican Basin water in it.  So what -- what I'm
suggesting, I think there are a number of things we
could negotiate about, but it's not fair to pick out
this one thing that the master got focused on and saw as
a black or white issue, when it's really not, and say
I'm going to fix this one thing, and too bad, Kansas and
even perhaps Colorado, everything else we're not going
to touch.  It all should go to the RRCA process or it
all should be in play here.  But our preference is that
it goes to the RRCA process.  That's where the States
could negotiate this out.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McAllister, I
thought that the special master, if I read his report
right, had invited you to come in and tell him a better
solution to the problem.  And you guys didn't put forth
one.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, my understanding is
Kansas had worked on one, sometimes referred to as the
integrated solution, I think, and it was to approximate
closer what we call the virgin water supply metric, but
had not had time, did not get it developed.  These
things are not just spur of the moment, you can come up
with an answer quickly.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's assume, as we
have, that we're going to credit -- I know you don't
want us to -- but let's assume that we're going to
credit the special master's finding that this was a
mutual mistake.  Generally, as I understand it under
ordinary contract principles, the remedy is not contract
formation.  It's rescission.  And I don't think you want
that.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I don't know that any
of us would want that at the end of the day.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So if you
don't want rescission, what you're left with is contract
formation.  And you're absolutely right, the parties
never discussed this 5-run solution during their
negotiations.
So it's not as you're -- as if you're
reforming the calculus.  You're reforming -- you're
trying to fix the mistake.  So what's left?  Equitable
and just solution.  And if you didn't put forth an
alternative, why shouldn't we accept the special
master's judgment on the 5-mile run?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, one reason we didn't
put forth the alternative is this notion of mutual
mistake actually came up extremely late in the process.
It wasn't until the very end.  In fact, Nebraska all
along didn't call it that.  They -- they talked about
changing the accounting procedures.  And it was the
master who finally labeled it as a mutual mistake.  And
so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me, it's rather
like asking a man who believes he's been wrongfully
convicted whether he would like to die by the firing
squad or the electric chair.  I mean, you -- you didn't
want any remedy to be imposed.
MR. McALLISTER:  Exactly.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And for the master to ask
you, oh, you tell me what remedy I should impose, you
don't think he should have impose any.
MR. McALLISTER:  He shouldn't.  He should
leave it to the process.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't blame you for not
telling him.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You say -- you say
this problem should go to the RCRA process.  Each State
has a representative.  Your -- your representative has
an absolute veto in the RCRA process.
MR. McALLISTER:  And so does each of their
States.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So -- so you're
feeling pretty good about your chances if you send it
back to the RCRA.
MR. McALLISTER:  No, Your Honor.  I would --
I would tell you a quick story and then make a point
about that.  Quick story that 20-some years ago, Kansas
introduced a resolution in the RRCA that said, how about
we all resolve that we will comply with the compact.
Kansas voted yes, Colorado voted yes, and Nebraska voted
no.
So this goes back a long ways.  But -- but I
think if -- if the notion is -- that's why I think it's
unfair to pick out the 5-run solution.  The things I
just mentioned to Justice Kagan, if we talked about
infiltration by precipitation, if we talked about the
groundwater recharge amounts, if we put other things on
the table, then I think we have things to talk about,
including the 5-run solution.
But Nebraska just wants to pull out this one
thing and have it mandated in their favor.  No
negotiation.  I mean, the fact that negotiation can work
is demonstrated by Colorado here initially being --
sided with Kansas, both opposing the 16-run solution.
And then Nebraska came along and said, well, let's try a
different way, and Colorado said, well, actually, that
way works to our -- our advantage, we like that, we'll
go along with that.  That shows that the negotiation and
the horse trading can work in this setting if given a
chance.  But I do think we have to have more than one
thing to negotiate over.  The other point I'd make --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you -- did you --
suggest that there were other issues like this that
favored Nebraska, so that if the accounting procedure
was going to be opened up on this point, that there were
other things the special master should have considered?
MR. McALLISTER:  I believe the litigation in
front of the special master, Justice Ginsburg, was
mostly just saying, you shouldn't change anything, you
should leave this to the process.  I'm not sure in front
of the master we got deeply into other things that might
be changed with regard to the model.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What would happen -- I
think Justice Breyer asked you -- if it goes to the
commission and they are unable to agree?  What's the
next step?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, there is the option
of nonbinding arbitration, which we all love and almost
always works out our disputes.  And then from there,
we'd go, presumably, to try -- you know, if any of the
States feel strongly enough about it, would probably
come back with a request for a special master.
But again, I don't think we'll get there
because the parties can and have negotiated
successfully.  When we can't do it is when you pick out
one discreet thing and put the court or the master's
thumb on the side of the State.  Well, then there's
nothing left to negotiate about.
But the veto is nothing new in the compact
territory.  I mean, this was true in Texas v. New
Mexico.  Either State could disagree and nothing could
happen, and the Court said in that setting so be it;
that's the system the States created under their
compact.  Here it's a three-way.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's been a while since
I read the briefs in total, but I thought you had gone
through all those other alternatives before filing the
petition here for a special master.
MR. McALLISTER:  On our issues.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.
MR. McALLISTER:  On the 5-run, no.  I mean,
that's something Nebraska brought in as a
counterclaim --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I see.  Okay.
MR. McALLISTER:  -- before the special
master.  So on -- on the issues Kansas pressed,
absolutely.  If I could --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The disgorgement issue,
you -- you had failed on that.
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, in arbitration, I
think we were trying to establish whether there was a
compact violation and -- and the amounts and so forth.
And there was some discussion of the accounting
procedures.  But then we brought the case to this Court
because we believed there was a compact violation that
required a remedy.
And all the parties -- let me speak to
remedy for just a moment before I sit down.  All the
parties agreed the remedy should be money here.  It's
not a perfect remedy.  It doesn't really substitute for
the water that people didn't receive in the years that
they needed it and were supposed to receive it.  But
it's the remedy we've agreed on.  I will say the
reaction of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, You got money.  You
got money, didn't you?  You got damages.
MR. McALLISTER:  We got damages less than --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you want more than
damages.  You -- you want to say I not only want to
receive what it cost me, what your violation cost me,
but I want in addition to receive any benefits that you
got from the violation.
MR. McALLISTER:  In order to stabilize the
compact, we think that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not a normal
contract remedy.
MR. McALLISTER:  It's not -- it's not
necessarily a common one, but it's a recognized one in a
situation where the master suggests Nebraska gained at
least, perhaps, 25 million from the breach.  If it only
has to pay Kansas 3.7, then next time conditions are
dry, there's little incentive, especially when it takes
us 8 years basically to get from the point of breach to
even the possibility of recovery.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But this is not a case where
Nebraska was found to have intentionally violated the
agreement in order -- on the ground that it would be
efficient to do that; isn't that right?
MR. McALLISTER:  Well, they didn't -- the
master found that they knowingly exposed Kansas to a
risk of violation of the compact.  They didn't purposely
set out to violate the compact, but they did -- I think
you have to say it's more than negligent.  They had
notice every year around by June 1 of what their
consumption was the previous year, and for 4 years in a
row they didn't just exceed a little bit, they blew past
their allocations.  These were massive violations on
Nebraska's part, knowing they were in trouble and just
really not taking any kind of adequate steps.
And that's what the master reacted to and so
does Kansas and urges the Court.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal if I could, but nothing less than a
substantial disgorgement award seems to really get their
attention.  And here it has gotten their attention and
it has also gotten Colorado's attention, as you see in
the briefs.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. O'Connell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALF
OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
There are two primary points that the United
States would like to make.  First, it is important that
disgorgement be an available remedy for breach of an
interstate water compact.  Unlike a regular contract
between private parties, interstate water compacts are
laws of the United States that apportion a scarce
resource among sovereigns.  It is important that water
flows down the river, not just money, and the
availability of a disgorgement remedy will help to
stabilize compacts and ensure that States are working
vigorously to meet their compact obligations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you could say the
same about contracts.  I mean, no -- nobody is saying
that disgorgement is not a remedy for contracts, right?
MS. O'CONNELL:  That's right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  The problem is what should
be the conditions under which disgorgement is imposed.
Does it require an intentional violation or not?
That's -- that's all the debate is about here.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  And it typically
does for -- for disgorgement of profits or some amount
of profits.  And although Section 39 of the Restatement
of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment -- that's the
provision on opportunistic breach -- says that it
requires a deliberate breach, and the master did find
here that this was not deliberate, we -- we're drawn to
that provision because the Court has said repeatedly a
compact is like a contract.
But there are lots of principles that are
equally applicable here, including Section 40 of the
Restatement, which talks about interference with
property rights.  And if you interfere with another
party's property rights and gain a profit from that,
then the remedy for a conscious wrongdoer -- and I think
the master's finding or conclusion about Nebraska's
intent here is that of a conscious wrongdoer, that they
knowingly exposed Kansas to a risk of a breach.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the Restatement
base that on?  Did they just make that up?  Are there
are a lot of cases that say that?
MS. O'CONNELL:  About what --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just because the
Restatement says it, we -- we've got to believe it?  How
many cases are there that impose disgorgement where
there is no intentional violation, but property rights
are involved.  Do you have a lot of cases?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, there's no deliberate
violation, but I think if you're finding that somebody
is a conscious wrongdoer and that they -- they
recklessly violated the compact, which I think is about
what the conscious wrongdoer standard is akin to, then
yes.  I mean --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not enough for
normal contract disgorgement, is it?
MS. O'CONNELL:  No, I think it is.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You need intentional
violation, don't you?
MS. O'CONNELL:  If there's -- if you're only
looking at the contract provision of the Restatement,
then it typically requires a deliberate, opportunistic
breach of the contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Exactly.  And -- and you
say there's an exception where it's property rights
involved.  And I'm asking you what cases do you have for
that?  You see, I don't -- I don't -- I don't think the
Restatement can change our law by just saying something
by consensus of law professors.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are there cases that --
that have established that rule?
MS. O'CONNELL:  In Texas v. New Mexico,
the Court, when it was talking about why awarding money
damages is not -- shouldn't be a concern that States
will just continue to violate compacts as long as they
can send money down the river, the Court said, we don't
really need to worry about that because there's always
the possibility of ordering specific performance plus
whatever additional penalty might be warranted for a
deliberate breach.
And even -- I mean, the Court wasn't saying
in that case it has to be deliberate or setting forth a
legal standard, but I think this Court has -- has
indicated that disgorgement may be appropriate when you
have an intentional breach or something.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If disgorgement is
appropriate, and I have a question about that, where did
this $1.8 million figure come from?  Out of thin air.
Is this an approximation of attorneys' fees or expert
costs?  Where did it come from?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think it's -- it's the one
part of the special master's opinion that is -- is
pretty much unexplained.  And we're not here to defend
1.8.  I think we said this in footnote 1 of our brief.
It's not our intention to say that we think 1.8 is the
exact right amount.  What we are saying is that the
master, because he weighed all of the different things
that you would want to look at when you're determining
whether you want to look at disgorgement -- whether
Nebraska profited, whether Nebraska had intent or was a
conscious wrongdoer, whether there was any need for
deterrence -- the master looked at all of the things
that you should be looking at.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how would you set the
amount in a circumstance like this?  What would you
think an explanation would look like?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, we haven't taken a
position of what exactly the amount should be.  What --
what we have tried to say in the brief is if the Court
wanted to go with what the special master said and award
$5.5 million, which is a disgorgement of part of
Nebraska's gain, then it could be satisfied that that's
not an arbitrary amount.  I mean, to some extent, any
amount you choose if you're balancing equities would be
arbitrary.  But I think what the Court would want to do
is to point out that Nebraska profited and one of the
purposes of disgorgement is to relieve a wrongdoer of
unjust enrichment; that Nebraska -- there is a finding
that they knowingly exposed Kansas to this risk.  It's a
finding of a conscious wrongdoer.  I mean, the master --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But this 1.8 seems to be
much less than the amount of unjust enrichment that the
master was suggesting Nebraska had -- had gained.  So if
he's not going to do the full measure of unjust
enrichment, what's he supposed to do?  Or is he supposed
to do just that?  If -- if the master thinks that
disgorgement is necessary, you look to the unjust
enrichment, that's the number you choose, there's no
other discretion.  Or is there some other discretion,
and if so, what would you look to and how would you base
the award?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think there -- there is
discretion and there is certainly support for that in
the Restatement where if you are, you know, if you are a
conscious wrongdoer, you can typically get your profits
taken away.  If you're an innocent party, you might just
have the property taken away from you, but you can keep
the profits.  If you're somewhere in the middle, if
you're negligent or it's just an ordinary breach of
contract, Restatement section 52 says that you can
choose or adjust the level of disgorgement based on the
-- the wrongful conduct of the party.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. O'Connell, we've --
we've had a lot of compact -- water compact cases before
this Court.  I mean, a lot.  Can you give us one case in
which we have imposed disgorgement even -- even for an
intentional violation?
MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  And I think the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the second question is:
How many for an unintentional violation?
MS. O'CONNELL:  The Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Minus something, right?
MS. O'CONNELL:  The Court has indicated
in -- in Texas v. New Mexico that disgorgement could be
a possible remedy.  It certainly left that door open.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For an intentional
violation.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we've never done it,
have we?
MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  And this is a -- a
novel --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it's dictum, right?
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, in that case, sure.
But, I mean, the Court certainly has left that open.
And, Justice Kagan, to get back to the question, I think
that if you really thought that somebody was a conscious
wrongdoer and you thought all of their profits should be
disgorged, then you could do that.
I think the master was also weighing some
other things here.  Unjust enrichment is not the only
purpose of disgorgement, but also a need to deter is
something else that you look at.  And what the master
concluded here was that Nebraska had all the tools in
its toolkit now to comply with the compact going forward
and that perhaps the 1.8 million was just the push it
needed to make sure that it was conscientiously using
those tools that it had.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we're dealing
here with an agreement between States.  And it seems to
me particularly important that they have some idea about
what they're agreeing to based on our -- our precedent.
And particularly since the special master, according to
your position, has such broad discretion.  It can be
zero, it can be 40 -- 20 million, whatever the maximum
is here.  I'm not sure that the States bargain for that
exposure.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, when the States agreed
to an equitable apportionment of the compact, I mean,
the -- this Court does have all of the tools of equity
available to it to ensure that there's a fair solution
imposed.  And it's not just the special master's
decision.  I mean, this Court could certainly award a
different amount of damages.  It is de novo review.
It's up to you to determine what you think is fair.
I think what -- what we've put forth is that
if you wanted to go with and -- and give some preference
to what the special master did, that 5.5 million is not
an arbitrary amount based on the weighing that he did.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I understand your
position, Ms. O'Connell, on whether this is just a
contract or whether it's something else entirely?  I
mean, should we be looking solely to contract rules or
is your position that because public rights and public
interests are affected here, we have a different kind of
obligation?
MS. O'CONNELL:  I think it's not
specifically just contract rules when the Court is
exercising its original jurisdiction.  The Court has
said many times, in Ohio v. Kentucky, that its -- its
jurisdiction in original cases is equitable.  It's an
equitable division of the water that underlies the
compact and so the Court is just deciding what it thinks
is fair as the remedy --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait.  A lot of
contracts -- my goodness.  Equity courts adjudicate
contract rights sometimes.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, I mean, the -- the
issue is whether normal contract principles apply,
whether they are the principles dealing with law or the
principles dealing with equity.  And disgorgement is an
example.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And normal contract
principles say an equity court will not give
disgorgement unless there's an intentional violation.
So I don't think your appeal to equity carries the day
at all.
MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Scalia, though, I do
want to point out the -- the deliberate breach that
you're talking about is one particular, like breach of
contract type of -- of a violation of a -- of a party's
rights.
As I mentioned before, there's a lot of
different analogies to what's happened here and one of
them is interference with somebody's property.  And if
there is a -- it doesn't just have to be deliberate, but
just, you know, a knowing risk or recklessness can also
qualify there.
And if I -- if I could talk, since we took
time from both parties about the being the accounting
procedures for -- for just a -- well --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe for one
sentence.
MS. O'CONNELL:  We just -- I want to point
out, and the parties can correct me if I'm wrong, but
this issue has already been to the Republican River
Compact Administration and Kansas wouldn't agree to it,
and there was an arbitration about Nebraska's crediting
dispute.  We described that in pages 8 and 9 of our
brief, and we support the master's recommendation to
reform the compact.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Cookson.
ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID D. COOKSON
ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS
MR. COOKSON:  Mr. Chief Justice, may it
please the Court:
This Court should affirm the special
master's report except for his award of exemplary
damages that is not justified in this case.  If I could,
I would turn to the Court's questions regarding what is
the deal and why should this Court reform the Technical
Appendix C, which is the accounting procedures.
The deal between the parties is found in the
Final Settlement Stipulation that this Court approved in
2003.  Section IV F expressly provides that this compact
accounting will not count imported Platte River water
supply as part of the Republican River Basin, in part
because that's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the -- it went on to
say how -- how you will determine whether there is such
water supply.
MR. COOKSON:  That is --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It went on to determine
that.
MR. COOKSON:  That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Through a formula.
MR. COOKSON:  That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And they agreed to that
formula, right?
MR. COOKSON:  Right.  But the deal we bought
was not the formula.  The deal we bought was we're not
going to count imported water that is inconsistent with
the terms of the compact.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's assume two parties --
I come into an antique store and I see this -- this item
of furniture that I like, and I talk it over with the --
with the owner, and I say, you know, let -- let's come
to a fair price on this.  He says, yes, that's what I
want to do, too.  Let's have a fair price.  And we write
it down.  It's going to be a fair price.  And the fair
price is $200.  Okay?
It turns out this thing is worth more than
$200.  Okay?  But both the antique dealer and I know
that this is a game of rolling the dice, that -- that
the risks you take when you buy and you sell antiques is
that it's worth more.
And that's the same risk here.  The parties
knew that this formula would not be entirely accurate
and they agreed to a fair price, that is, none of this
water should be counted.  But they said the way to
figure out whether this water is coming in or not is
this formula.
Why shouldn't they be held to that formula?
That -- that was the deal.
MR. COOKSON:  Because in Section I F of the
Final Settlement Stipulations, the parties made it clear
that the RRCA could modify the accounting procedures at
any time through its process, which, as the SG's office
correctly noted, we did.  We went through the RRCA.
Kansas objected.  We went through nonbinding
arbitration.  The master agreed the mistake occurred,
sent it back to the RRCA to develop a solution.  This
was all presented to Kansas in 2007.
But under -- to your point, Your Honor, the
deal we made was not to count imported water.  Kansas'
own expert testified that the purposes of the accounting
procedure and the groundwater model are to effectuate
the terms of the Final Settlement Stipulation.  The
master agreed.  And it's undisputed between all of the
parties that the accounting procedures are acting in
direct conflict to both Section IV F of the Final
Settlement Stipulation, and to Article III of the
Compact, which allocates water originating --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that ordinary
principles of contract law should guide our decision on
the reformation issue, or is this something that's not
an ordinary contract?  If this were a stipulation in
ongoing litigation, I could understand that we want to
give the court substantial power to alter the
stipulation.  But this stipulation was reached as part
of a final a judgment that was made and that case is
closed.  So isn't it just like a contract or is it
subject to revision more easily than a contract because
it was a stipulation?  It's a stipulation that's closed;
it's just like a contract, isn't it?
MR. COOKSON:  In this instance, Your Honor,
the Technical Appendix is more like the ongoing matter
because the parties specifically bargained in
Section I F of the Final Settlement Stipulation that we
would be able to modify the accounting procedures --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- well, that's
just like saying the parties can amend this contract,
right?  I mean, those procedures take the consent of
each one of the parties.  So that amounts to saying
nothing except what is obvious and would be the law even
if it were not said, that the parties, by mutual
agreement, can amend the contract.  Does it mean
anything different from that?
MR. COOKSON:  It does, Your Honor, because
there's -- in the Final Settlement Stipulation, the
parties agree we're not going to change it.  That --
there is a non-severability clause.  That is the bargain
that occurred between the parties.
JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it work?  I mean,
this can't be the first time this came up.  The
contract, to me, is more like the antique dealer and the
customer promised to buy all of the Ming vases, and
they'll determine if it's a Ming vase according to a
technical method in the appendix, and the appendix
happens to throw in not only the Ming vases but all the
Tang vases and nobody thinks they should get the Tang
vases.  Okay.
So that's the deal.  So we go to the judge.
And one way is reformation, but they say no, no, it's a
contracts deal, it's all closed, you can't -- another
way is rescission.  Okay.  Rescission, apparently nobody
wants that.  Because there was a mutual mistake, they
rescind.  Okay.  You must have read -- there must be
thousands of cases with algorithms.  I mean, we live in
a world where there are algorithms, there are computers,
there is the Internet, there is this formula, that
formula.
It can't be the first time that somebody in
a contract has made a technical mistake about the
algorithm to be used for determining the object.  So
what do the contract courts do?
MR. COOKSON:  Well, specifically the special
master referred to two cases that -- before this Court.
In Texas v. New Mexico the parties determined that the
1947 version of an algorithm, the inflow/outflow steady
plan to the Pecos River Compact, was completely
unreliable.  And this Court approved special master
Brightenstein's reformulation of the inflow/outflow and
that was an appendix to the compact.  Here we're only
talking about an appendix to a settlement stipulation
that this Court approved.
Likewise, in Wisconsin v. Michigan this
Court entered a consent decree dealing with islands in
the Lake Michigan between Wisconsin and Michigan, but
neglected to address an issue regarding where is the
boundary in Green Bay.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is there any authority
that a settlement agreement is more subject to
reformation than a regular contract?  Is there any
authority for that proposition?
MR. COOKSON:  Not that I'm aware of, Your
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You agree, don't
you, that you couldn't -- the special master couldn't
have revised the formula if it had been part of the
compact itself?
MR. COOKSON:  That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why is that?
MR. COOKSON:  Because the compact is
approved by Congress and it is not for the parties, and
as this Court said in Alabama v. North Carolina, for
this Court to add terms to the compact that's been
approved by Congress without congressional
authorization.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was the appendix included
in it when it was submitted to Congress?
MR. COOKSON:  No, Your Honor, it was not.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That was just added
afterwards?
MR. COOKSON:  In 1943 when the compact was
complied, article 9 provides that at some point the
States, the compact administration, which we now know as
the RRCA, would meet and establish rules and regulations
that were not inconsistent with the compact.  That
actually did not occur until 1961.
Justice Scalia: I see, I see…
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I do think, though,
it is still, the FSS is an agreement between two
sovereigns, and I think, putting aside what contract
principles may provide as a general matter, that the
idea of a special master or this Court changing the
nature of that agreement is a pretty radical one.
MR. COOKSON:  But we're not changing that
agreement.  The agreement in the final settlement
stipulation is do not count imported Platte River
water --
JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Cookson, suppose the
following:  The parties are there and they're around the
table and everybody agrees:  We should not count Platte
River water, we should only count Republican River
water.  But everybody also agrees that that's easier
said than done and the devil is in the details.  And
there are three different plans for -- three different
formulas for how not to count Platte River water and
instead only to count Republican River water.
And each of these the parties think -- you
know, the parties first, how accurate is that formula,
but those formulas also do a range of other things that
the parties may care about.  And so there's a bargain
and a negotiation about which of these three formulas to
use in order to reach the result of not counting Platte
River water and in order also to further the parties'
other objectives, and one is chosen.  Why isn't that one
the one that continues to govern under the agreement?
MR. COOKSON:  Because the parties recognized
in negotiating the agreement, and this was recognized by
both Special Master McKusick in the first generation and
Special Master Kayatta that we were proceeding with the
notion that, as the technical appendix, Appendix C, the
accounting procedures, moved forward, we would make
changes.  We've made roughly 14 changes to the
accounting procedure through the process of the RRCA and
agreement of the compact administrators.
And what we have here is a Texas v. New
Mexico situation, where Kansas has exercised its veto
right, and in that case this Court said that the States
may come to this Court, and in this case a special
master, to seek vindication of its rights to correct
what everyone agrees is a mistake that's not only in
violation of the final settlement stipulation, but
expanding the terms of the compact beyond what
Congress intended.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the
general rule that the specific controls the general?
You have the general statement here, okay, we're not
going to count imported water, but then you have a very
specific calculation about how you're going to achieve
that result.  So why doesn't that control?
MR. COOKSON:  Because in this instance the
specific statement in the deal is we're not going to
count imported water supply.  The accounting procedures,
as all parties testified including Kansas, was simply
the means, the tools, if you will, to effectuate the
specific agreement of the parties.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, but it was
clear that you knew shouldn't count it because that's what
the provision says.  But then it says any imported water
supply credit shall be calculated in accordance with the
RRCA accounting procedures and by using the RRCA
groundwater model.
So they -- it's incorporated directly in
that procedure that this is only a credit and that
it's going to be -- any credit shall be calculated in
accordance with the procedures set forth therein.  What
gives us the right to, the special master or anyone,
under reformation principles to create a new procedure
because the 5-run mile protocol is a new procedure that
they never agreed to.
There's no argument that this is a procedure
you put forth.  It wasn't part of the original
negotiations.  This is a reformation that's one-sided.
It's what you want.  Or two; maybe Colorado does.
So how do we get there?  Under contract
principles, under equitable principles, how do we get to
do that?
MR. COOKSON:  I think if you look at each of
the accounting provisions or each of the provisions of
the final settlement stipulation that deal with
accounting you will find that same language that you
just quoted.  In other words, the parties understood
that they were not baking into the final settlement
stipulation how they were going to do the accounting.
They were going to refer to the technical appendix,
which it is, it's an appendix to the final settlement
stipulation, that this is how we'll do it and this is
how the model will do it, understanding that at the time
the final settlement stipulation and the accounting
procedures were agreed to, the parties -- the States had
still not agreed to the groundwater model, which is the
fundamental principle that will do it and, in fact, came
back to this Court roughly 6 months later for approval
of the groundwater model.  So again --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  You haven't
answered my question.
MR. COOKSON:  I believe --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- which is what
contract principle or equitable principle permits us to
create a procedure that they haven't agreed to?
MR. COOKSON:  Because it's the exact same
situation that this Court exercised in Texas v. New
Mexico with the appendix to that compact with the
inflow/outflow model that the special master referred
to.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you read Texas v. New
Mexico as reforming the compact?
MR. COOKSON:  No.  And I don't read what the
special master has done here as reforming the compact.
This is a technical appendix --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, or reforming the
accounting procedures, I should say.  Do you read Texas
v. New Mexico as reforming anything?
MR. COOKSON:  It reforms the inflow and
outflow steady plan to conform to the intent of the
parties in the Pecos River Compact.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just by appointing a
special master to monitor it over time, correct?
MR. COOKSON:  That was over a different
issue other than the original reformation of the
inflow/outflow study that was done at, I believe 446
U.S.
JUSTICE BREYER:  This is a slightly
extraneous question but I'm curious in light of the --
part of this argument is about money.  We can deal with
that.  But this part about the accounting, my instinct
is that farmers and others who use the water have to
know, and it hurts them when another 5 years goes by
without anybody understanding what the procedure is.
All right. Both sides say that, you know,
you should be able to work this out.  It looks as if what
you're facing are nine people -- I'm not speaking for the
other eight I'm just speaking for myself -- who couldn't
know less about it, all right, and we're supposed to
decide whether some system here is going to work or not.
And that can be another 5 years.  Is there any chance that
you all could work this out?
MR. COOKSON:  I think, Your Honor, that what
the special master has presented is not something that
requires 5 years to work out.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's true, but they've
made an argument that if you look at the contract law,
you will see that rescission is the normal remedy for
this kind of a mistake rather than reformation.  And you
apparently, at some level, agree with that because what
you've pointed to are not normal contract cases.  You
pointed to two cases involving State compacts in this
Court.
And suppose that I think that that is
actually a difficult question.
MR. COOKSON:  I would suggest, Your Honor,
that it is appropriate beyond contract principles, as
you did in Texas v. New Mexico, to conform the terms of
the accounting procedures to the final settlement so
that they are consistent with both the compact and the
final settlement stipulation.
And to -- Mr. Chief Justice, to your
question, this is significant.  As the special master
found, had he chosen to apply this retroactively, it
would have reduced Nebraska's violation in 2006 by 20
percent.  And ongoing forward into the future is a
significant amount.  So it was both material, it was
mutual, and it was significant.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, this may be an unfair
question, so if you are not prepared to answer it,
that's fine.  But just out of curiosity, which would you
prefer, a decision that agrees with the special master
on both reformation and disgorgement or a decision that
disagrees with the special master on both reformation
and disgorgement?
MR. COOKSON:  I would agree with your
characterization, Your Honor, that from my perspective
that is probably not fair because we believe --
(Laughter.)
MR. COOKSON:  -- the law and the facts
justify reformation, they do not justify disgorgement,
and they should not -- and there is no inherent or
implied linkage of the two.
And if I might turn to the disgorgement
issue, obviously Nebraska excepted to the award of
disgorgement because it did not act deliberately to
violate the compact.  Nor was --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask what that means
exactly?  You know, because the special master said,
well, it wasn't a deliberate breach.  But the special
master also said essentially what the SG -- how the SG
characterized it, that you were a conscious wrongdoer,
that you failed to act, refused to act in the face of a
known risk and that the quite foreseeable effect of your
actions was going to be, unless there was some very
lucky fortuitous thing that happened, the quite
foreseeable effect of your actions was going to be that
Kansas didn't have enough water.
MR. COOKSON:  Your Honor, I would point
to -- I would respond to that in two ways.  One, the
master not only found there was not a deliberate intent
to violate at page 111 of his report, but he also said
Nebraska did not exercise a consciously opportunistic
breach in the nature of an efficient breach at page 131
of his report.
But factually we have excepted to his
finding of knowing and the findings that Nebraska
somehow did nothing.  Nebraska seized control of its
consumptive use in 2002 while it was still negotiating
the compact, and through 2006 reduced its pumping by
over 500 million -- or 500,000 acre-feet, a 35 percent
reduction.
At the same time, however, Nebraska could
not reasonably foresee that its allocations were going
to fall even below the historical low period of record
in this basin, which was the Dust Bowl.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't the special master
say that was the risk that Nebraska should have known,
so -- and he said they did this and that, but it wasn't
enough and it wasn't until 2007 that they came into
compliance in a way that didn't put Kansas in jeopardy.
But he said all along Nebraska knew that Kansas
might well be the loser, because Nebraska didn't take
adequate steps.  It was aware of the risk to Kansas,
right?
MR. COOKSON:  No, we would not agree with
the master's characterization of what was reasonably
foreseeable, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but assume that the
master's characterization as to that holds, that that's
a matter of fact that we're not going to overturn; that
he said that you knew that there was a risk and that the
risk was a substantial one, that Kansas would end up on
the short end of the stick in violation of the compact.
I mean if that's the case, what does it even mean to say
that you did not deliberately breach?
MR. COOKSON:  If you look at the master's
report on page 111, he outlines the significant steps
that Nebraska took from the beginning, including a
substantial rewrite of its State water laws to ensure
that its regulatory actions going forward -- and we did
that in 2004 after this Court approved the final
settlement stipulation in 2003.  We started reducing
pumping in 2002 and in 2003 and in 2004.
But, again, to get to the characterization
of being reasonably foreseeable, understand that the
compact allocations that you find in the compact before
you were based on a 10-year period of the Dust Bowl, the
historic low period.  It was reasonable for Nebraska to
rely that it would not go below the period of the Dust
Bowl.  And yet in '05 and '06, our allocations
significantly fell below the Dust Bowl, and had they
simply stayed at the Dust Bowl level, Nebraska would
have been in compliance in 2005 and 2006 with the added
water given to Nebraska by the special master under the
imported water supply and the Harlan County event.
There was nothing in the historical record to suggest
that we would go below the period of the Dust Bowl at
the time we were taking action to comply with the
compact.
And we acted reasonably in measuring our
efforts, and we continued our efforts when it was clear
that we fell short in 2006.  We conceded that we
violated the compact.  We offered to pay Kansas its
actual expectation loss, its actual damages.  And we
moved forward with additional tools so that the next
time this occurred, Nebraska would be in a position
where it could stay in compliance.  And as the master
found, with the tools in place now, had we had those in
2002 to 2006, Nebraska would have been in compliance
even in the driest condition now of record in the basin.
And we've added additional tools, should it get dryer,
to address it.
So for these reasons, disgorgement is not
appropriate.  There is no reason to incentivize
Nebraska.  There is no need to deter Nebraska.
Moreover, there is no need for an injunctive relief, as
the U.S. and Nebraska agree with the special master on
this interest.  We believe the Court should conform the
accounting procedures to meet the compact.  And it
should not award disgorgement absent a deliberate act,
which is not to be found in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does disgorgement and
injunction -- do the two go together?
MR. COOKSON:  No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If it's inappropriate to
issue an injunction, is it always inappropriate to
require disgorgement?  Are they both looking to the
future, so that if there is no realistic possibility of
future violation, you cannot issue an injunction and you
should not require disgorgement?  Is that a correct
statement?
MR. COOKSON:  In our view, yes, disgorgement
should not be used as a future-looking tool.  Injunctive
relief is the appropriate remedy, and in this case the
facts don't justify it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure you've
answered my question.  You say it should not be used as
a future tool.  So it can be used even though it's not
being imposed in order to deter future action.
MR. COOKSON:  Well, in the context that
Kansas sought in this case, they were seeking to -- from
the initial arbitration through the trial with the
master, Kansas sought unjust enrichment as a means of
disgorging gain to Nebraska, and they also sought
specific injunctive relief, more specific than what they
have accepted to the Court now.  So they sought both in
the context of this litigation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But do I understand
your answer to be that disgorgement serves at least an
additional function beyond the injunction, sort of an
unjust enrichment element?  You've got to disgorge your
profit in a typical contract case?
MR. COOKSON:  Yes, it does serve that
function in a case where, as this Court suggested, there
is a deliberate act, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can you get in a normal
contract case both your damages and disgorgement?  I
always thought you were put to the choice.
MR. COOKSON:  This Court --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You either sue for your
damages or you sue for unjust enrichment.  Can you do
both?  You get your damages plus the other guy's
profits.
MR. COOKSON:  It's our belief, Your Honor,
that no, it's -- that you are correct, that it's --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  One or the other --
MR. COOKSON:  -- you get contract damages,
your expectation interest.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. McAllister, 2 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. McALLISTER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
I wanted to go back to something
Justice Kagan correctly identified as that when these
procedures were negotiated there were lots of options on
the table.  In fact, the groundwater model option the
parties chose was not Kansas's first choice.  It was
Nebraska's first choice.  And these kind of trade-offs
were being made, and I think this case is directly
analogous to New Hampshire v. Maine, which is talked
about in the briefs, where those two States reached a
boundary agreement.  And the Court said, well, your
agreement may not be perfect, but you were dealing with
some vague terms, some uncertainties, you've done
something reasonable, we bless it.  25 years later New
Hampshire came back and said:  You know, we made a bad
deal.  We'd like you to undo it because we shouldn't
have agreed to that 25 years ago.
And the Court gave New Hampshire the answer
we think you should give Nebraska today, which is:
Sorry; you made the deal, and just because you now think
you have a better way of doing it doesn't mean we should
rewrite the contract.
If the Court rewrites the contract here, the
compact -- well, the procedures which are part and
parcel, as the United States recognizes of the FSS --
there is no clear black and white distinction between
the procedures and the settlement agreement, they don't
work unless they are both present.  If you rewrite them
now, it opens the door -- if Kansas comes up with a
better way 2 years from now to measure this, then we
would be able to come back.  And if Nebraska says no,
we'd come all the way to this Court again, saying:  You
know, there was a mistake because there was a better way
than the 5-run solution to do this.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McAllister, how much
more are you going to get under the accounting
procedures as they exist without the 5-mile run?
MR. McALLISTER:  Yeah, I believe on an
annual basis the difference is on the order of 8 to
10,000 acre feet.  So that's the difference in what --
Nebraska wants that much more taken out of its
consumptive use.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Give me money?
MR. McALLISTER:  Oh, what it's worth in
money?  Well, that's a big dispute.  I mean, the master
when he valued the gain used some figures from Nebraska
evidence that was $362 per acre foot.  There are other
ways to try to value the water, and we haven't tried to
quantify that amount.  The reason it matters to us is it
affects actually the total amount we get.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
