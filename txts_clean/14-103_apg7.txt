CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next today in Case No. 14-103, Baker Botts v. ASARCO.
Mr. Streett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STREETT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
At the end of a bankruptcy case, a
professional must file a detailed fee application.
Numerous interested parties may object and the court
must hold a hearing to resolve those objections and make
an independent assessment of reasonable compensation.
Each of those steps is indispensable to
accurately determining the professional's core fees and
the estate's administrative expenses, allowing the
trustee to close the case and ultimately pay the
estate's creditors.
Everyone agrees that preparing the
application is compensable as reflected by Section
330(a)(6)'s guidance for determining the amount of that
compensation.  Defending the application against
objections is an inseparable part of that same
code-mandated process.  There is no principle basis and
certainly no textual basis for categorically banning
compensation for that next step.
To the contrary --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the principle basis,
as I understand it, is that when you prepare it,
you're -- you're serving the -- the trustee.  You're
serving his needs but when, you know, if he's disallowing
it, you're, to the contrary, acting against the trustee's
interest.  Isn't that a principle distinction?
MR. STREETT:  It would certainly not be in
the vast majority of cases.  For example, in the typical
Chapter 7 case the trustee hires a professional, the
trustee wishes to pay the professional fully for his
good work, and the debtor comes in and objects.
By defending that application against the
debtor's objections, the professional is serving the
trustee.  The same thing happened here where the
debtor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay So you'd acknowledge
it's okay if the trustee objects, then he doesn't have to
pay, right?
MR. STREETT:  I would not acknowledge that,
Your Honor, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think you would.
MR. STREETT:  But that is the reason there
should not be a categorical --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the trustee is not
the estate.
MR. STREETT:  That's correct, and there's
no --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The estate wants to keep
as much money as it can to give to the creditors.
That's the purpose, right?
MR. STREETT:  Well, in this case, for
example, the estate paid all of Baker Botts's core fees
and wanted to pay all those fees, and you had ASARCO
coming in as the reorganized company and objecting.  So,
again, I don't think that is true in the vast -- in
many, many cases.  And typically it's not the case in
the Chapter 7 case.  As the National Association of
Bankruptcy Trustees point out as amicus, a trustee is
not going to be able to retain competent and skilled
counsel if the debtor is going to be able to dilute that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you hired another law
firm to fight this objection, would that other law firm
have been entitled to fees too?
MR. STREETT:  It would possibly be entitled
to fees through 330(a)(1)(b).  I think in your
hypothetical you're assuming that the other law firm
would not be approved by the trustee as an estate
professional.  So that's the on/off switch for
compensation under 330(a), a compensation as a service
rendered.  So the only possible way they could be
compensated would be as an expense for rendering a
service to the estate professional.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I just want to
understand your rule completely.  Anybody who prepares a
fee application -- an accountant, an expert -- the
bankruptcy court can pay all of their legal fees, if the
trustee has hired their lawyer?
MR. STREETT:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Approved their lawyer?
But if the trustee hasn't, then they have to assume the
costs of fighting --
MR. STREETT:  No, your Honor, that's not our
position for two reasons.  First of all, there's two
ways to get compensated under 330(a).  There's
(a)(1)(a), which is compensation for services rendered
by a professional hired by the estate.  And then there's
(a)(1)(b) which is expenses, and that's things like
experts, outside contractors that the estate
professionals hires to help him or her do the services.
So in the context of an accountant who hired
a law firm to prepare and defend its fee application --
it happens all the time; accountants can't do it
themselves -- that outside law firm would be compensable
as an expense to the accountant.
Now, of course, ASARCO's position would
categorically ban all compensation for law firms, even
those retained by the trustee that defend their fee
application; it would categorically ban compensation by
the accountants.
And the problem with ASARCO's position is
that everything you can say about defending a fee
application is also true about preparing a fee application
in the context of a  statute.  They both are paid out
of the estate.  They both diminish the estate in that
way.  They're both something that the code requires --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I take it you -- excuse
me.  If the trustee objects and there's a lengthy
hearing, I take it you would still say that you get fees
for participating in that hearing.
MR. STREETT:  Yes, that's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  So the fact
that ASARCO came in is really irrelevant to the -- to
this case.
MR. STREETT:  I don't think it's irrelevant
because it shows the error of the Fifth Circuit's way in
adopting a categorical rule that prohibits compensation,
even when the trustee wants to pay the professional the
full amount.  That's the only reason I really made that
particular point.
And that's the only argument that's before
this Court, is a categorical ban under the statute on
compensating the professional for defending his fee
application regardless of who objects.
And I think this Court has already rejected
the distinction that Justice Scalia suggested between
preparing and defending the fee application.  In its
opinion in Jean, where the Court said there's, quote, no
textual or logical argument for treating so differently
a party's preparation of a fee application and its
ensuing efforts to support that application.
And the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That was in the context
of a fee splitting statute though.
MR. STREETT:  That's correct.  And the fee
shifting context is the proper analogy here.  Of course
we don't claim 330(a) is formally a fee shifting
statute.  We're seeking payment from the estate for work
that the code requires us to do as part of our work.
But the fee shifting analogy is accurate for
a couple reasons.  First of all, in the fee shifting
statute and in the bankruptcy statute, the professional
must file an application and have his fees approved by
the court.  And as in the fee-shifting regime, the
bankruptcy professional's application is opened up to a
wide range of objectors who are not the professional's
client.  So all of this leads to, in both the
fee-shifting and the bankruptcy regime, a concern that
the professional's fees for his core work will be
diluted by the professional being forced to defend those
core fees.
And, in fact, those concerns are heightened
much more in the bankruptcy context for a few reasons,
because in bankruptcy, the fee application is far more
detailed and gives far more opportunity to -- to pick
and -- and object and a far greater range of objectors
are available, the U.S. trustee, the court itself, the
creditors, the creditors committees.  All of those can
come in and object that do not exist in the fee-shifting
context.
And Congress recognized this concern in
Section 330(a)(3)(f) by codifying the factor that
bankruptcy professionals be compensated at parity with
non-bankruptcy professionals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but just -- on
the parity point, if you're not doing bankruptcy work
and you send the client a bill and they don't pay it, if
you've got to take litigation action or whatever, you
don't get paid -- you don't get those fees back.  We
follow the normal American rule and you pay your own
fees and if you win, good; if not, you don't.
MR. STREETT:  That's right.  And that would,
of course, also be true of preparing the bill or the
invoice which is compensable under bankruptcy.  So
Congress departed from that regime and, again, it gets
back to the two reasons the fee-shifting cases are
analogous because, outside of bankruptcy, a professional
doesn't have to go to the court to have his fees
approved.  It's a structural parity difference.  Outside
of bankruptcy, the professional doesn't submit his
application to -- to a gallery of potential objectors,
and that's why bankruptcy is structurally different.
And that's why Congress recognized in Section
330(a)(4)(A)(ii) that services necessary to case
administration do fall within the bankruptcy court's
discretion to compensate.
And when you read Section 330(a)(6)'s
reflection that preparing the fee application is
compensable, it's clearly not authorizing compensation
for preparing it,  ASARCO concedes that, it's
authorized under Section 330(a)(1)(A) as a service
rendered, and it's most naturally falls within
Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) as a service necessary to case
administration.  And that's because it assists the
trustees.  The trustee has to see the case all the way
through to its completion.  It has to make a final
accounting of the case.  It has to administer and close
the case.  And none of those things can happen until the
fee application is not just prepared, but litigated.
Section 330(a)(1)(A) reflects that not only
the application must be prepared but there may be
objections by either of the parties in interest, the
trustees, or the court itself, and then the court must
hold a hearing.  That's all -- those are all textual
bases for compensating the defense of the fee
application.  Those are things that the code requires,
and they're all compensable for the same reasons as
compensating the preparation of the application.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Streett, do you have
a position on enhancements?  If -- if the creditors say
that enhancement is -- you did a good job but it's not
worth the enhancement, is defending the enhancement
also, under your rule, compensable?
MR. STREETT:  We believe it would be
compensable, in the sense that it passes by the minimal
compensability threshold that puts it into
bankruptcy court discretion.  Now, bankruptcy courts
must consider the (a)(3) factors in determining whether
that will be actually compensated and the amount.  And
courts consider, for example, the nature and value of
the service.
And a court could reasonably conclude in its
discretion that the nature and value of seeking an
enhancement is not the same as the nature and value of
defending the core fee application.  Many courts have
reached that conclusion.  At the end of the day, that's
where the courts came out here, and we didn't -- we
didn't challenge that on appeal.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You practice in bankruptcy.
I mean, you know it pretty well because what I was
trying to think of, which is really balancing on the
side, but the phrase "likely to benefit," it has -- it
says "likely to benefit."
Now, it seems to me there must be instances
where you, representing the -- the debtor, hire
accountants or various others to do technical work,
conveying and where -- where, in fact, it's quite clear
that it won't mean more money for the debtor.  It will
mean less money for the debtor, because it will discover
all kinds of assets  they didn't even think the debtor
had, but that's part of your job.
MR. STREETT:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And you do it and it
benefits only the creditor.  And I take it, it's rather
clear, you get compensated for that.
MR. STREETT:  Yes, and that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that right?  Am I
just --
MR. STREETT:  That's absolutely correct,
Your Honor, and that's why there are two prongs within
Section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii).  Congress recognized that not
everything the professional does is going to produce an
immediate, direct benefit to the estate.  In the
legislative history we discuss at pages 37 and 38 shows
that Congress  added the prong compensating tasks that
were necessary to case administration.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, then you're in
trouble, because if -- if all those things -- I mean,
there are a set of things, such that when you carry them
out through accountants or conveyers or others, will in
fact cost the estate a lot of money.  Possibly more than
they ever dreamt.  And yet it's part of your job.  Now,
if that's not considered as being  of benefit to the
estate, but rather, part of the administration of the
estate, then I don't see how this falls within benefit
to the estate.  I mean, if you're really making that
distinction.
MR. STREETT:  The way --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's administration of
the estate, then this would have to be administration of
the estate.  But this isn't administration of the
estate, and therefore, it's left out.
MR. STREETT:  We agree that this is
administration of the case for the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, you're saying this is
administration.  In other words, you're not saying it
falls within (a).  You're saying it falls within (b).
MR. STREETT:  It falls within either one.
We think the most natural home for it is necessary to
the administration of the case.  And Congress -- the
structure of section 330(a)(4)(A)(ii) reflects that the
professional's service need only be necessary to the
administration of the case--
JUSTICE BREYER:  I see.
MR. STREETT:  -- of the case or beneficial
to the estate, because Congress recognized there are
going to be a lot of things that a professional has to
do, as Justice Breyer said, that may cost money in the
short run.  But they're necessary to carry out the
administration of the case.  We think that's where
preparing the fee application comes in, under (a)1 and
(a)(4)(A)(ii), and the very next inseparable step is
defending the fee application.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're ignoring one
important aspect of difference which is in everything
else, you're acting for the estate.  When you're
defending fees, you're acting for yourself.  There is a
self-interest involved because you could just give up on
the objections and walk away.  The only reason you're
fighting them is because it puts more money in your
pocket.
MR. STREETT:  I don't think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not because it puts more
money in the estate's pocket.
MR. STREETT:  Yes.  But all of those things
would be equally true of preparing the fee application.
The professional could just work pro bono or could
decide to discount 20 percent of its rights on the -- on
the fee application.  All of those things are -- ASARCO
has tried to say that preparing and defending the fee
application are adverse to the estate because it takes
money out of the estate.  Well, that cannot be the test.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except that
preparing the fee application:  A, it's specifically
allowed by statute; and B, if they compensate you for
that, there's -- then you'll do a very careful job, and
there will be less necessity to have to defend it.  So
it -- so there -- it is certainly a rational reason
for the distinction.
MR. STREETT:  Well, let me take that
question in two parts, because I think if Congress
drafted the statute to say preparing the fee application
is compensable, then we would have a very different
case.  But it didn't say that.  It said any compensation
awarded for preparing the fee application shall be
awarded at this rate.  So it presupposed that preparing
the fee application was authorized under Section
330(a)(4) -- (a)(1)(A) as ASARCO even concedes on 12 --
on page 12 of its brief.
So you can't draw any negative inference
from the fact that it's mentioned for the purpose of
limiting it, that defending a fee application would not
also be compensable.
But to your second point, Your Honor, we
agree Congress wanted to encourage people to do a
careful job preparing the fee application.  Baker Botts
did that here.  But that did not stop ASARCO from coming
in and -- and mounting a barrage of objections that eat
up professional fees.  So just the careful preparation
of the application doesn't solve the question.  And
that's why Congress codified Section 330(a)(3)(F) and
the parity factor, and that's why bankruptcy courts for
decades have been responsibly exercising the discretion
that Section 330(a)(1) gives them.  Congress could have
enumerated all of the tasks that are compensable in
bankruptcy, but it didn't do that.  It's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But people know -- I
mean, the American rule in the legal area is very
fundamental, and it strikes me bankruptcy is one of
those areas where they go into considerable detail
telling you who pays what and when you can get it, just
like you say here.  You get compensation for preparing
the fee at this particular level.  And to say that
somewhere in -- in all this, you sort of cut and paste
these things together and you say, oh, there it shows
that they meant fees on fees to be awarded.  It seems to
me that if they wanted to go against the basic American
rule -- that’s the American rule, patriotic -- they
would have -- they would have spelled that out a little
more clearly.
MR. STREETT:  Congress certainly could have
done that, but that's simply not the way it wrote
330(a).  You're right, Your Honor, it listed in many
other statutes nine options for things, but in this, it
just said, courts may award reasonable compensation for
services rendered with very narrow and express
prohibitions.  The Fifth Circuit erred by superimposing
a categorical ban on that flexible statute.
And if I could reserve the remainder of my
time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fletcher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BRIAN H. FLETCHER
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
We agree with Petitioners that when a
bankruptcy professional is seeking compensation under
Section 330(a) successfully defends its fee application,
the bankruptcy court may increase the amount of the
award to compensate for the time it reasonably spent on
the fee defense.  But we reach that result for a
somewhat different reason.
In our view, preparing and defending a fee
application are not themselves services rendered for a
client within the meaning of Section 330(a)(1)(A).  And
they are not independent grounds for compensation.
Instead, compensation for the successful
defense of a fee application may be appropriate because
it ensures that the professional receives the
statutorily prescribed reasonable compensation for the
services it rendered in the underlying bankruptcy case.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it fall within
the (4)(A)?
MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Breyer, we don't
think it's viewed as being subject to the (4)(A) at all.
(4)(A) --
JUSTICE BREYER:  If it's not subject to
(4)(A) at all -- I mean, (4)(A) forbids certain -- it
says you can't -- cannot allow compensation for, and
then, you know, it has the list there.  So -- so how do
you -- where do you find the authority to give this to
them?
MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Breyer, (4) --
(4)(A), which appears on page 3(a) of the record of
appendix, it describes the limits on compensation for
services.  Our view is that when you are preparing and
defending your own fee application, that does not fall
within the category of services at all.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So where -- where is the
authorization to give it then?
MR. FLETCHER:  In the authorization in
Section 330(a)(1)(A) that says you can allow reasonable
compensation for the underlying service that the
bankruptcy professional has rendered in the bankruptcy
case.
So here, for example, Baker Botts prosecuted
the -- the fraudulent conveyance action, among many
other things.  And the bankruptcy court applied the
lodestar method and it determined that reasonable hours
times reasonable rates required a certain amount of
compensation in order to make Baker Botts --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where does it say that you
can get the money that's necessary for you to get the --
the money you pay to get the reasonable compensation.
Where does it say you get that?
MR. FLETCHER:  There's no explicit
provision.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Well, then, I
mean, suppose that you had to go through enormous
trouble to get what they paid you.  They paid you and
you -- you know, some kind of Voltavian bonds or
something -- you know, you  imagine all kinds of
circumstances where it costs a lot of money to get the
money they paid you, and I just wonder where does it say
you can do that.
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, Justice Breyer, what I
think is different about this is that the things that
you have to do to get paid when you're a bankruptcy
professional that we're here concerned with here are
things that are creatures of the bankruptcy system
itself and 330(a) itself.  Section 330(a) says if you're
a professional and you want to get paid reasonable
compensation, you have to submit a very detailed fee
application.  And then in order to ensure that that
application meets the statutory requirements, we're
going to open it to scrutiny by the judge, by the U.S.
Trustee, and by the parties in interest, and allow them
to raise objections.  And all of that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't that in the
administration?
MR. FLETCHER:  I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.
MR. STREETT:  Well, he claims that it could
be on either a service, or a benefit, or a need in the
administration of the estate.
MR. FLETCHER:  So our view is that the
problem with it is that sort of Section 330(a)(1)(A) is
the sort of starting point, and it says reasonable
compensation for actual necessary services rendered.
And then (a)(4) limits which services are compensable.
It says in order to be compensable, you either have to
be necessary to the administration of the case or for
the benefit of the debtor.
We don't think that preparing and defending
your own fee application is a service rendered at all.
And so we don't think it's subject to the (a)(4) limits.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
MR. FLETCHER:  I was just going to say,
instead, we think the question that the bankruptcy court
should be asking is, do we need to provide some
additional award to make the professional whole for the
extra time and costs that they had to go through to
vindicate their right to get their award of compensation
for the underlying services  --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Sounds like a policy
judgment.  You're basically saying it's not in the
statute, but this is how we do it and as Justice -- as
the Chief Justice pointed out, normal attorneys outside
the bankruptcy court don't get compensated for fee
disputes.
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, we -- we do think it
makes a good sense, the rule that we're advocating, but
we also think it's grounded in the statute and in the
way that this Court has addressed other statutes that
also provide for awards of reasonable attorneys fees.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't the problem here
better dealt with by sanctions?  If a party like ASARCO
makes frivolous objections, then they -- then sanctions
can be imposed on them.  And the -- the fees fall on the
party that caused the problem rather than on the estate.
MR. FLETCHER:  I absolutely agree,
Justice Alito.  And we argue in our brief that if a
bankruptcy court is in a situation where the objections
that were raised are not merely meritless, but actually
sanctionable, the better course would be to impose
sanctions, precisely because that puts the burden of the
litigation on the party that raised the frivolous
objection, rather than on the estate.  But we think that
there can be a broad range of objections that while not
frivolous or not sanctionable are still found to be
meritless, and that unless the professional is
compensated for the time it has to spend in responding
to those objections, it's underlying -- its award of
compensation for its underlying services is going to be
diluted  below a reasonable level--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  No more so than -- than
the -- the lawyer who submits a bill outside of
bankruptcy to a client, and the client objects, and the
lawyer has to -- has to litigate.  Would you say that
dilutes the lawyer's recovery?  No, I assume that the
lawyer's fees are set at a high enough level that it --
that they take into account the fact that sometimes you
will have to litigate to get the fees.
MR. FLETCHER:  That's true.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And why can't bankruptcy
lawyers do the same thing?
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think that would be
contrary to the policy of the -- of the bankruptcy
statute and the Section 330(a) in particular.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?
MR. FLETCHER:  Because the -- the problem
that we're dealing with here is that it's true that
litigation can arise between lawyers and clients over
fee issues.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. FLETCHER:  But the Section 330(a)
creates a structure where it's not just your client that
you have to please, and the showing that you have to
make isn't just that I perform services that are within
the terms of our contract.  You have to satisfy the
bankruptcy judge and are subject to objections, not just
from your client, but also from the U.S. Trustee and
from lots of other parties in interest.  And they can
object not just on the grounds that you didn't perform
within the meaning of the contract, but also on the
grounds that you didn't satisfy any of the many
requirements of the Section 330(a).
And we think that because that imposes sort
of extra costs on bankruptcy professionals, the reasonable
approach, and the approach that's consistent with the
way that this Court handles and others have handled the
same sorts of costs that are imposed on attorneys
seeking fees under fee-shifting statutes, is to say that
when you successfully defend your fee application, this
doesn't apply when you fail, we don't -- we very
strongly believe that if you are unsuccessful in
defending your fee application, you should not receive
an additional award.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What was your reason for
not going with the administration of the estate?  And my
intuitive judgment of it, which is pretty not totally
informed, of course, is there -- there are loads of
things that -- that -- that lawyers do who represent a
trustee -- who represent debtors, that it will cost the
estate a lot of money.  And you can't say all of them
are for the benefit of the estate.  And there are loads
of things they do to help administer the estate and hire
all kinds of people.  And -- and paying their fees is
part of the administration, I would think, normally.
Why don't you see the paying of the lawyer
as part of the administration of the estate?  And if you
see the part -- that part as part of the administration
of the estate, then you'd see that the administrative
expenses necessary to secure that payment are part of
the administration.
I mean, so you had some reason over there in
the Justice Department of saying, no, we don't follow
that route, and -- and I'm not.  And so that -- of
course, that creates a difficulty because I think, well,
if your judgment is don't follow that route, then I -- I
better be careful about following it myself.  And -- and
you know more about it in a sense, so -- so explain that
to me.
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, Justice Breyer, we --
we basically take an earlier term.  In -- in our view,
you don't get to (a)(4) in asking about the preparation
of defense of a fee application because (a)(4) tells you
which services are compensable.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No.
MR. FLETCHER:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, I understand your
argument, and all know that's true about it.  I just
wonder you're -- you're studying this.  You're trying to
develop a position.  And for some reason or other, you
rejected what the -- what they started out with that
this falls within 4(A)(ii) -- (i) or (ii), and I
wondered why.
MR. FLETCHER:  So I -- I think if you were
going to -- you disagree with our position and your view
is that this is a service, and so the question is, Does
it fall within either of the categories under Section 4
that make it compensable.  We think -- agree with
Petitioners that the stronger basis is to say, as you
say, that it's administration.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. FLETCHER:  It's not for the benefit of
the estate.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that.  I already
knew -- can see that.  I just wondered why --
MR. FLETCHER:  Because --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- you -- you rejected.
You had a reason for not doing what seems linguistically
the simplest thing and say it is part of the
administration.  And you had a reason, and I want to
know what the reason is, if you can tell us.
MR. FLETCHER:  Well, it's because
linguistically -- I don't want to belabor the point --
but just linguistically, we don't think it's reasonable
to describe this as a service rendered, and so we -- we
don't get to the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  The administration of the
case.
MR. FLETCHER:  But you only ask about
administration of the case if you decide that it's a
service rendered, right?  Section (a)(4)(A) says, "The
court shall not allow compensation for services that
were not reasonably likely to benefit the estate or that
were not necessary to the administration of the case."
Our view is that defending your fee
application --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Service.
MR. FLETCHER:  -- isn't a service that
you're rendering to the client at all, and so you don't
ask these questions.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.
MR. FLETCHER:  But -- but I can also answer
because if you disagree with us about that and you think
it is a service and you think it is subject to the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Is -- is there another part
that says it's service to the estate rather than service
to the case or something like that?
MR. FLETCHER:  It's -- it's -- the term is
used in 330(a) -- (a)(1)(A), which describes
compensation for -- reasonable compensation for actual
and necessary services rendered by a trustee and
examiner or a professional person.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Render --
MR. FLETCHER:  I think the most natural
read --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I see. Thank you.
MR. FLETCHER:  But -- but just to answer
the -- the question that you were posing before, you
know, why did we -- why are we hesitant to say that this
is a service that can be compensable if it's reasonable
or necessary?  It's, frankly, because ordinarily,
services are compensable whether the attorney wins or
loses, and we are very concerned about making sure that
people don't get paid for unsuccessfully defending their
fee applications, and that's what's led us to
the position we’ve taken.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Oldham.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY OLDHAM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLDHAM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Section 330(a) of the bankruptcy code
compensates all types of professionals for their
services rendered for the estate under Section 327(a).
But when adversarial fee litigation arises and a
professional either hires a lawyer or just happens to be
a lawyer and engages in purely self-interested fee
litigation work at the expense of the estate, that is
not a service rendered on behalf of the estate within
the meaning of Section 330(a).  There is simply nothing
in the statute that authorizes estate funds for a
professional to engage in self-interested litigation,
particularly in light of the American Rule, which
requires, and for 200 years plus, has required that
Congress speak clearly when it wants to reallocate the
costs of litigation.
And I'd like to --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how does the fee fit
into this?
MR. OLDHAM:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The -- the fee, the
fee -- the fee preparation fee.
MR. OLDHAM:  And I want to go straight to
that question.  Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy
also put their finger on exactly the fundamental
distinction between preparing a fee application and
litigating over a fee application.  And it's that when
an accountant, for example, goes and  hires-- excuse me,
does accounting services and then provides an itemized
bill to explain to the -- to their client why they are
charging what they're charging, that is a benefit to the
trustee.  The -- the "please remit to" line may not be a
benefit, but certainly the itemized -- itemization in
that bill is a benefit to the trustee and to the estate.
And at that point, they're still on the same team.
But when an accountant then gets into a fee
dispute and has to go hire his or her own lawyer and is
in litigation against the estate, they're not on the
same team anymore.  There is no sense in which, at that
point in time, the accountant is serving the estate.
And I think that fundamental difference matters
textually under Section 330(a), and it's very
significant under the American Rule because --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Oldham, why aren't
they all tied together so you recognize that the
application for the fee is compensable?
MR. OLDHAM:  Correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's like the opening
pleading.  Then the objection is the answer to the
application, and then the response to the objection is
the -- the defense of it.  It seems to me it's -- it's
all one package, that it -- the application, and there's
an answer to the application, and then there's a reply.
It -- why don't those three things go
together?
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I don't think they go
together because Congress didn't put them together.
What Congress authorized under Section 330(a)(1),
especially when read together with Section 327(a), is
that professionals are entitled to compensation when
they're working for the estate.
But when -- when professionals have hired
their own lawyers or happen to be lawyers and are
litigating adverse to the estate, that is not -- they're
not on the same team anymore.  And so under 330(a)(1)
and 327(a), Congress has just simply not allowed
compensation for that, which is the same as it would be
outside of bankruptcy.
And all we're asking for in this case is the
same rule that generally applies outside of bankruptcy.
Because outside of bankruptcy the American Rule controls
and says that if you get into a fee litigation dispute
with your client, then you pay your own way.  And so the
same rule should apply in bankruptcy.
And I want to address why Congress might
have authorized compensation for preparation services
inside the bankruptcy context when that also is not
compensable outside of the bankruptcy context.  And that
is because certainly in 1994, when Congress enacted
Section (a)(6), there's a vast difference in the amount
of time and the amount of effort that goes into putting
together a fee application in bankruptcy and putting
together a bill for the client.
Now, certainly, it's -- as time has gone on,
clients require more and more detail in bills and
that -- that difference might be diminished.  But there
is -- because in bankruptcy a fee application is
required to be filed, it made perfect sense for Congress
to come in in (a)(6) and say you get compensated for
that.
But what's not different between bankruptcy
practice and outside of bankruptcy practice is fee
litigation.  When fee litigation arises, the American
Rule applies and says inside or outside of bankruptcy,
you pay your own way.  And so Congress did not need to
say anything different about that in Section A -- in
Section (A)(i).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do lawyers these
days actually charge private clients for fee
preparation?
MR. OLDHAM:  No.  Well, there might be some
extent to which overhead accounts for things like that,
but certainly, no lawyer is going to put on a bill, you
know, time spent preparing this bill, but the fact that
they're not charging for it doesn't mean that it's not a
benefit to the client because, again, when the -- I
think most clients, when they get a bill and see that
they have to pay, say, $100,000, it's a pretty good
benefit to them to know why they have to pay $100,000,
and to be able to object if they feel that there's, you
know, an objection warranted to that bill for $100,000.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I've -- I've been
out of practice for half a century, but my -- my -- my
thought was that -- that -- that lawyers do -- do charge
for the amount of time preparing the bill.  Maybe I'm
wrong about that.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, again, I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We can -- we can check it
out.
MR. OLDHAM:  I think the only sense in which
lawyers do that is to the extent that -- that it's built
into overhead.  But I don't think that generally, as a
practice, otherwise, of lawyers marking down their time
for it, and I think that would probably be a shock to
most clients to hear that you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You ought to
think -- might want to think about it.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is -- is there any writing
that says that when lawyers, outside bankruptcy,
determine their -- their fee structures, that they
include reimbursement for the risk that they might have
to go into court to defend it?  I've never heard that.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well -- and we -- we cite the
Gibbons-Grable case in our brief, but there's -- there's
a number of things that go into, you know, rate setting
for law firms and one of them certainly is a risk of
nonpayment.  Another one is a risk of collections.
If you -- if you have a particular client
where you're afraid of collections, you might also
have -- want a retainer and things like that.  But,
yeah, rates account for a variety of things like risk of
nonpayment and risk of collection.  And I think that
goes to an important point about bankruptcy practice,
which is that bankruptcy lawyers use non-bankruptcy
market rates.  And so, to the extent that they are using
a non-bankruptcy market rate, they're already getting
some -- you know, some amount in their rates that
accounts for the risk of dilution.
JUSTICE BREYER:  On that theory, if -- I
mean, if -- if you're supposed to get some fees -- say,
$100,000 -- and in that fee is -- is various risks of
the extra money it'll cost to collect or the extra risk
of you won't get it, you'll only get half and -- and
you -- you set the rate at 100,000.
And so now a different risk is eventuated --
namely, you had to go to litigation -- and that wasn't
in the 100,000.  Well, then, if it's reasonable and
everything, why shouldn't it be?
I mean, why is -- you're -- you're trying
to, in that 100,000, give the employer something for
their -- for their time and their effort and also
compensate certain risks.  And here was one that wasn't
in the  100,000.  It turned up later.  But how would you
draw a line between some and the other?  I think that's
the government's theory.
MR. OLDHAM:  That's right, Your Honor.  And
I think the American Rule draws the line, because if --
if it were the case that anytime a damages award or
anytime a fee award had to be defended, therefore, we
need to give them more, the American Rule wouldn't
exist.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, no, of course, it
doesn't exist -- you're quite right -- outside of
bankruptcy.
But now you're saying that the 100,000 does
include all kinds of -- for various payments for things
that might make it more expensive to get the money.  And
then what I don't see is saying some and not others.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And this is just one of
them, I mean, the -- that you have to go into court and
litigate, is just one of them.  You wouldn't object, for
example, if the fee -- the judge says, look.  We're
going to give the firm 120, why not 100?
Well, you know, there are risks in this; and
one of the risks is they're going to have to go to court
and somebody will sue them and they have to go litigate
that.  So we'll give it to them upfront to pay for the
risk, just as you pay for the risk of nonpayment.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I think we would object
to that, Your Honor, and I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?
MR. OLDHAM:  Because if -- if -- if the
conscious decision is made that $100,000 is reasonable
compensation for the services they're about to render --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  It's -- it's not.
Only -- actually, only 90 is.  But it's reasonable
compensation because 10 compensates for risks such as
risks of nonpayment.
Am I being clear?  Do you see where I'm
going?
MR. OLDHAM:  I do, Your Honor.  If I can
make two responses:  The first is that, you know,
building in for certain risks in a rate is one thing and
the way that the bankruptcy system accounts for that is
it looks to non-market --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.
MR. OLDHAM:  -- non-bankruptcy market.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe this is not worth
pursuing.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And that was -- that was
my question.  Can you tell me, if -- if a distinguished
law firm represents a trustee in bankruptcy, does the
law firm charge its regular rate?
MR. OLDHAM:  Yes.  Generally speaking, they
will -- they will -- they will --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The same rate that it
would charge to a -- to a non-bankruptcy client.
MR. OLDHAM:  That's correct.  I mean,
Congress, you know, wanted parity in Section -- in -- in
Section 330(a).  And so, generally speaking, what --
what Congress effected in 1978 was to make clear that
bankruptcy lawyers can get the same market rates that
they would get outside of bankruptcy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In the papers --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Oldham, you -- you
agree, don't you, that in this system, the court can do
enhancements?  Yes.
MR. OLDHAM:  Yeah, that's correct.  Well,
that -- that's not been -- certainly disputed in this
case.  Yes, that's --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah.  So some of the things
that we've said are permissible for enhancements are
exceptional delays in payment, extraordinary outlays of
expenses, and unusually protracted litigation -- okay?
-- that those count as enhancements.  We said that in
Perdue v. Kenny A.  Why isn't this just like that?
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, there's -- I guess
there's two responses to that.  One is that when you're
looking at enhancements and the -- the question when
that was litigated below is not whether enhancements
could be authorized, but instead, what the proper test
was for enhancements in the bankruptcy context.
Here, the whole question is under
Section 330(a)(1), has Congress even authorized a
district court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, no, no.  But I'm
proceeding on the assumption of -- on the SG's
assumption that what we're trying to do is to get a
reasonable rate for the services that clearly have been
authorized.  And the question is:  What's a reasonable
rate?
And it seems to me that what this statute
does is to say "reasonable" can include, like, lots of
things.  It's highly discretionary.  Right?
And then on top of that, you know, it --
included in "what is reasonable" is this idea of
sometimes you can do performance enhancements, but we
haven't said performance enhancements are just for
super-duper work.  We've actually said performance
enhancements are for things like unusually protracted
litigation and lots of expenses and exceptional delays,
sort of like this.
You know, this is just an expense of your
work, is having to go after the fees.  So why doesn't
that get into the mix, too?
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, I would agree with your
characterization of the government's position that it is
effectively authorizing a broad scope for -- for
bankruptcy courts to just give enhancements.  That is
effectively what they're arguing for.
And if I could respond to the government's
position, because I think there's at least three things
wrong with it.  First is textually, the text simply will
not permit their position.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, it does, because the
text just says "reasonable."  And then the question is
what's reasonable?  And "reasonable" can include, you
know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other
lawyer, but "reasonable" is, also, you had to do this
over a very extended period of time and "reasonable" is,
also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to
get them to pay you anything at all.  All of those
things count as what's part of "reasonable."
MR. OLDHAM:  Well -- and if I could make one
more point on the text.  Section 330(a)(1), if it just
said "reasonable," that might be the right answer; but
it says "reasonable compensation for services rendered."
The government agrees with us that fee
litigation work is not a service rendered.  So when
Congress says --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yeah, it's reasonable for
all the other work you're doing.  But then everything
else goes into this question of reasonable, right?
Is -- you know, I'll give you a hypothetical.
Suppose I hire somebody to shovel my
driveway, and I say, I'm going to give you reasonable
compensation.  And everybody knows that it's $10 an hour
to hire my driveway, right?  That's the going rate.
But then I say, oh, did I not tell you --
did I not tell you I'm going to make you go down -- come
down to the court so that I can pay you the $10?  And
that costs another $5.  All right?
Now, it strikes me that if somebody said,
what's reasonable compensation now, it would be $15.  It
wouldn't be $10.  And it's the exact same thing here.
It's like by the time you go through all this stuff that
you have to go through to get paid, you should get paid
more.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well -- and to respond to that
hypothetical, I think the difference is under -- in your
hypothetical, to apply to 330(a)(1), would be Congress
came in and said, you're going to get -- or you -- you
told your -- you know, whoever is helping you, I will
not pay you for bringing it to the courthouse.  That is
not something I pay for, but then turning around and
nonetheless saying but you can get paid for it anyway.
That's effectively --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it doesn't say you can't
get paid for it.  There's no exclusion.  All, you
know -- you know, I think you and the SG agree, it's --
we're not counting this as the service.  What we're
saying is you have to be reasonably paid for the obvious
services that you have performed, shoveling my driveway.
And in my -- in my hypothetical, that means
you also have to be paid for the cab fare.  And
similarly, here, it means you also have to be paid for
the cost of, like, making them sign a check to you.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well -- and, again,
textually -- I won't belabor -- but textually, I think
it disassociates reasonable compensation for services
rendered.  I don't think textually that that works under
a fair reading of the statute.  But just to go beyond
the text, the argument --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, it doesn't have to go
be- -- I mean, I just don't understand what that means.
It's this -- it's the clear service rendered, it's
shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the
estate.  What counts as reasonable?  What counts as
reasonable is not just the hourly rate, but all the
things I've put you through to get the hourly rate.
MR. OLDHAM:  And let me give you two other
responses to that.  One is that that argument is really
just a straight shot at the American Rule, because it's
true whenever there's a damages award, that if a damages
award is given for, say, $1,000,000 and you have to
spend a $100,000 going to defend that, every damages
award will be diluted by that $100,000.
But this Court has said --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But here's the problem, I
think, with that response.  It's a reasonable response,
but we're already out of the American rule here.  I
mean, the bankruptcy system puts you in a different
universe than a statutory universe, and the question is
what do those words of the statute say?  It's not what
would exist if the statute didn't exist.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, the American rule applies
to litigation, and so obviously, in bankruptcy, you have
some litigation, you have some non-litigation.  But when
you have a fee litigation matter arise, the American
rule certainly applies, and Section 330, doesn't --
because it exists, doesn't mean the American rule, you
know, is tossed out the window.  The American rule still
controls and you have to look at what Congress actually
authorized.
And so I think, for example, the Court's
decision in Cooter & Gell --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the American rule
can't trump the statute.  The statute has to trump the
American rule.  And if the statute says reasonable
compensation for services rendered -- the obvious
services rendered, and -- and the only thing that counts
as reasonable is taking into account things like how
protracted the litigation is and how much risk you've
had and the exceptional delay, and the fact that you've
had to contest a lot, a lot, a lot of meritless
objections, all of those things make for something -- go
into the question of what's reasonable.  They don't have
to.  I mean, in 90 percent of the cases, it might be
that it's like, no, that's just a normal part of the
process.  But in that other 10 percent, where it's not a
normal part of the process and you wouldn't be
reasonably paid unless they were included, it seems to
me the word reasonable demands that they be included.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, and I think if that's the
rationale then this Court's decision in Cooter & Gell
would have come out the other way.  That case dealt with
whether, under Rule 11, an award for a reasonable
attorney's fee -- or under Rule 11, whether you can get
the cost for defending that on appeal.  And the Court
said no in interpreting that statute and --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about other statutes?
I was thinking the same thing, there are other statutes
that provide -- that undo the American rule, and they
say you're entitled, if you're victorious, to reasonable
attorney's fees.  Do they usually include fees for
getting the fees?
MR. OLDHAM:  Under -- under classics
fee-shifting statutes where Congress -- the answer is
yes, in a number of those cases, courts have said you
get your fees on fees, but those statutes are very
different textually, and, I think, in their rationale.
Those statutes say that you get your reasonable
attorney's fee incurred in an action.  And so, fees on
fees, when you have a dispute in that action fit within
that express authorization by Congress, it is fees
incurred in that action.
So textually, that's very different from
Section 330, but I also think it's very, very different
when you're thinking about the purpose of those
fee-shifting statutes.  In the fee-shifting context what
you have is an award to a private party who has
vindicated their statutory rights.  And the award is to
that party, there's an award of attorney's fees on top
of that, and throughout that process the award comes
from the opponent.  And so you never have the dynamic
that you have in the bankruptcy context, where the
lawyer and the -- and the client get on opposite teams.
They're always on the same team.  They're fighting for
an award, they're fighting for fees on fees, and they
both benefit by the more, you know, fees that they get.
That's fundamentally different from Section
330, which is a very limited authorization  that says,
it doesn't depend on success in litigation, because
that's not the rationale for compensation.  The
rationale for compensation is that you provide services
that benefit the estate or that  are on behalf of the
estate.  But because the estate is going to pay no
matter what, you have this dynamic where, when fee
litigation arises, the professional is suddenly on the
opposite team of the estate, because it's always going
to be at the expense of the estate.  And I also want --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you practice in
bankruptcy?
MR. OLDHAM:  I'm sorry?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you practice in
bankruptcy?
MR. OLDHAM:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And do you happen to
know whether fee litigation is more common in bankruptcy
than  other fields?
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, there have been some
studies that have tried to address that and see --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Okay.
MR. OLDHAM:  -- whether -- I mean, I think
the argument that we have seen is more of a logical one,
that there are more potential objectors in bankruptcy
because a -- a party has to file their fee application,
and theoretically more people get to review it, but I
think there's a very strong argument that some courts
have accepted that, outside of bankruptcy practice,
there's a paying client in every single case who has the
full incentive, because they're footing the bill, to
study and object and litigate if they want.  And I think
it's the rare case outside of bankruptcy and it's
probably the rare case inside of bankruptcy, where you
have full-blown litigation, but it certainly happens in
both contexts and outside of litigation.  And all we're
asking for is for the same rule to be in bankruptcy as
is out of bankruptcy.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, all right, but if you
look at the fee-shifting statutes, we looked up a lot,
we found quite a few which say that the court can award
a reasonable attorney's fee.
MR. OLDHAM:  Correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's broader than here.
But the words, basic active words are reasonable
attorney's fees, and almost all of them have been
interpreted to allow compensation for the reasonable
fee.  So they throw that in.  And so, they're counting
it as part of the reason -- they're counting it as part
of a reasonable attorney's fees.  And here, reasonable
attorney's fee is the same.  That language is the same.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, it's reasonable --
JUSTICE BREYER:  A reasonable compensation.
MR. OLDHAM:  For services rendered, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a reasonable
attorney's fee.  But it's hard to make a lot out of
that.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, when you excerpt just
those parts, I agree with you, but I think you have to
look at the full language --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
MR. OLDHAM:  -- which is in the fee-shifting
context, it is reasonable attorney's fees and then
usually it says, incurred, and then it talks about a
civil action, like in the Jean case, the Equal Access to
Justice Act.  It says fees incurred in a civil action.
Well, it's within the express authorization to get fees
on fees there because in that civil action, if there is
a fee fight, fees were incurred in that civil action.
So if Congress, in Section 330, had said -- instead of
what it did say, if it had said professionals shall get
reasonable attorney's fees in the bankruptcy proceeding,
then that might be a different case, because there
you're saying anything that happens in the bankruptcy
proceeding you get compensation for.  Congress didn't
say --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But that happens later,
everything's closed and they discover that through some
odd thing they have to spend $10,000 to get the $90,000
that was awarded to them.  Any authority on that?  You
go back to court and say, Judge, I want $10,000 more.
He says, But the case was closed.  He says, Yeah, but I
but to spend the $10,000 to get the $90,000.  If there
were such a case, one of you would have found it.  Or
somebody would have, I guess.
MR. OLDHAM:  Well, if you're asking -- I
mean, certainly the -- the bankruptcy court maintains
some jurisdiction for a party to go back.
JUSTICE BREYER:  But there's no -- just
under all these other statutes, there is so many
attorney's fees statutes that --
MR. OLDHAM:  There are, and let me just say
that if we're going to, you know, sort of think about
what rule might make sense, I think it's important to
remember that the -- the fee-shifting statutes, just
like Your Honors talked about, where it's true fee
shifting, that is, there's a dispute that arises, the
loser has to pay the, you know, the attorney's fees for
the winner, Congress used that in the bankruptcy code.
For example,  in  automatic stay.  If there's
somebody that commits a willful violation of the
automatic stay, Congress identified that particular
dispute and said that the loser in that particular case
should have to pay it to the winner.
And so if we're thinking about what rule
makes sense, I think the government put their finger on
it in their brief and talking about it today -- and this
goes to a question that Justice Alito asked about
sanctions -- what would make far more sense is for
Congress to have come in and created a true fee shifting
in which it said that if there's going to a be dispute
over a -- you know, over a fee application, then maybe
the, you know, the prevailing party should have to --
should get the attorney's fees from the loser.
Congress didn't do that here.  There's
nothing like that under Section 330 or any other
statute.  Instead, what Congress did is it authorized
compensation to a professional for the work that they do
for the estate.
And I just want to emphasize too, because
I've -- I've heard today that -- the suggestion that our
rule is a per se rule, and that's not at all true.
We're not saying that professionals can never get their
fees and we embrace the discretion of bankruptcy courts
to authorize fees under the long-standing exceptions to
the American rule for sanctions such as for frivolous
conduct or for bad-faith litigation misconduct.  The
argument has been made that those are, you know, two
exceptional, but outside of the bankruptcy context,
those longstanding exceptions to the American rule have
stood alone as the only exceptions to the American rule.
And there's never been any suggestion at all that those
are not -- those are not sufficient outside of the
bankruptcy context.  And so I don't think there's any
reason for a special rule just in the bankruptcy
context.
I think it's also really important to keep
in mind that Section 330(a) is not just for attorneys.
It's for all professionals.  And so in the context of,
say, an accountant that has to go hire their own lawyer,
this Court's decision in Lamie made very clear that you
can only get compensation under Section 330(a) if you're
approved under Section 327(a) for employment.
It would -- it would candidly just go
straight through that decision if it was okay for a
Section 327(a) professional, to nonetheless go hire
somebody, have them do professional services, and then
just count it as, you know, the accountant's own
professional services, or, as was suggested today, to
simply call professional services necessary expense.
Which goes against what Congress said in Section
330(a)(1)(A), where it -- and (B), where it made a very
distinct difference between a necessary expense and a
professional services.
And so, there -- there's -- the cases that
have talked about this issue, about whether an
accountant can hire a lawyer and get paid, have -- have
-- more of them have said exactly what this Court said
in Lamie, that you can't do that.  Section 327(a) is the
sole gateway to compensation for those professionals
under 330(a).
The only exception has been -- that some
courts have identified, which we think would be
inconsistent with Lamie and with Section 327(a), is
where there's an engagement letter between the Section
327(a) professional and the debtor, where the debtor has
agreed that the Section 327(a) professional is allowed
to go and hire others to do particular work.  that,
again, we don't think is sufficient, but that is a
different context than -- than this case.
If there's no further questions, thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Streett, four minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. STREETT:  Thank you.
The bankruptcy code uses broad, open-ended
language and commits these questions to bankruptcy court
discretion, and that's no different than the fee
shifting statutes.  We've said -- we've heard from my
friend on the other side that this is a direct shot --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Will you answer his last
point?  Why does it make any sense to say that the
lawyer can get -- make his fee reasonable by getting his
litigation expenses, but the accountant, who's also
entitled to reasonable fees, cannot?  If he has to sue,
he has to pay his own lawyer, and you don't assert that
that -- that that is compensable, do you?
MR. STREETT:  We -- we do assert that would
be compensable, either as an expense to the accountant
or it could be included as part of the accountant's
reasonable compensation for his underlying services on
the bankruptcy, as the government argues.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, you do?  Okay.  I
didn't realize you --
MR. STREETT:  Yes, we --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought you said
earlier the trustee had to approve it.  And I'm
wondering how the trustee could approve that, because
it's for the benefit of the accountant,  not the
trust.
MR. STREETT:  The trustee would have to
approve if those services were to be directly
compensable, not if they were to be compensated as
expenses or as part of the underlying reasonable
compensation of the accountant.  I think the
hypothetical was, you have an accountant who is already
a 327(a) professional, and it has to hire a lawyer.
ASARCO wants to force that accountant to eat those
costs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are there case authorities
supporting the answers you gave?
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It does eat those costs.
MR. STREETT:  Yes, we cite one that surveys
the entire case law on this point in our reply brief, I
believe it's footnote 4.
To get back to Justice Breyer's question,
you cannot read "services" in isolation.  You can't read
"services rendered" in isolation from the rest of the
statute.  (a)(4) recognizes that there are services
necessary to case administration, and (a)(3)(C)
recognizes there are services that are beneficial toward
the completion of the case.  My friend on the other side
read in a word, he said "services to the estate."  It
doesn't say that anywhere in the statute.  It could be a
service to the court, it could be a service to the
trustee, which must administer and finally close the
case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except -- except that in
Woods, looking at the predecessor statute, which also
talked about services rendered, we held that the phrase
"reasonable compensation for services rendered," quote,
this is us, "necessarily implies loyal and disinterested
service in the interest of those for whom the claimant
purported to act."
MR. STREETT:  And I'm glad Your Honor
brought this up, because the idea that litigating a fee
application is adverse to the estate, cannot be right.
The code requires you to litigate the fee application if
it's challenged.  Now, think about what happens if we
file an interim fee application under Section 331.  We
can do that four months into the bankruptcy.  The second
somebody objects and we have to respond to that
objection, ASARCO's position is, we're immediately
adverse to the estate and we're disqualified.
But I did want to mention that all of the
National Associations of Trustees support Baker Botts
position on this point, because it's not just a small
expense that can be counted as overhead.  In Section --
Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, these National
Associations of Trustees point out that the litigation
costs will frequently eat up the entire core fee,
because it's a modest core fee and all it takes is one
debtor rendering an objection or the Chapter 13 trustee
rendering an objection.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you answer the
question about suppose the objection to the fee is
sustained?  Does the lawyer, nonetheless, get the work?
MR. STREETT:  It would pass the minimal
compensability threshold, but courts have consistently
exercised their discretion for decades to deny that
compensation, because the nature and value of
unsuccessful defense is very different from that of a
successful defense.
And ASARCO is the one asking this Court to
make a major change from the status quo that has
prevailed across this country in the overwhelming
majority of jurisdictions where courts have wisely and
responsibly exercised their discretion to award fees
where they are necessary to make the underlying fee
reasonable, and to deny fees where the defense is
unsuccessful or otherwise wasteful.  Baker Botts is just
asking this Court to allow the status quo to continue
playing out in a way that's been effective for the
bankruptcy system.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
