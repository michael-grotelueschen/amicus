CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 12-315, Air Wisconsin
Airlines v. Hoeper.
Mr. Cohn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Not even Mr. Hoeper can defend the decision
below and for good reason.  Under the plain terms of the
statute and consistent with this Court's First Amendment
precedence, truth matters, and airlines should not lose
their ATSA immunity, unless their statements are
materially false.  None of that is in dispute anymore.
Also not in dispute, I think, is that Air
Wisconsin was justified in picking up the phone, calling
TSA, and conveying certain core facts; namely, that
Mr. Hoeper was mad at the airline; that he was a Federal
flight deck officer or FFDO; that he had walked out on
his training, his last chance to keep his job; and he
was about to board a plane.  I don't believe any of
those facts are in dispute.
What is in dispute is how those facts were
framed or phrased to TSA in that call.  How the report
was packaged and did --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm -- I'm not sure it --
you said it is conceded that -- that those things should
have been brought to the airline's attention.  Has that
been conceded?  I'm not sure.
MR. COHN:  I think they conceded--
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think -- I think they
said if it -- if they were brought, they should have
been brought in a different fashion, but I'm not -- I'm
not sure they -- they have conceded that.
MR. COHN:  I believe they have conceded,
Justice Scalia, that those facts could have been
conveyed, justifiably.  If we had conveyed those core
facts using different words, there would not be any
issue here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you could convey
anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that.
MR. COHN:  And the question, Justice Scalia,
is whether we framed or phrased the report in an
adequate manner.  And in assessing that issue, the
question comes down to how much breathing space airlines
should be given in making these reports, how much room
there should be for permissible characterization and
expression in making these reports.  And context should
be kept in mind in answering that question, three things
in particular.
First, these reports are being made by
airline employees, such as pilots and flight attendants
and baggage handlers and ticket agents, who are being
told by TSA they have to report in realtime, without
investigation, without calling their lawyer, without
stopping to think on how to refine the perfect script,
and they are being told to do this based upon their
suspicions, in some cases, suspicions of other people's
emotions or state of mind.  That's one critical piece of
context.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Mr. Cohn, on the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can -- can we go back to
your response to Justice Scalia?  You said that the
Respondents conceded, but -- but isn't it the case that
it was the Colorado supreme court that said that the
airline likely would have been immune if they had
phrased the report more cautiously?
MR. COHN:  That's exactly right, Justice --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So it's -- it's the
Colorado supreme court, not the Respondent?
MR. COHN:  Well, I believe the Respondents
have also acknowledged that a call could have been made
conveying a certain fact.  You're completely correct,
Justice Ginsburg, that the Colorado supreme court said
we'd be likely immune if only we had used different
words, and those different words are immaterial.  That
lower court engaged in hairsplitting --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You had -- you're
saying -- you're saying there were three critical facts.
One is that these reports have to be made on suspicions
right away in realtime, by people like baggage handlers.
And your second point was?
MR. COHN:  The second point of context is
that these reports are being made to TSA and other
reasonable air safety officials, for the purpose of
passenger safety and aviation security.  And TSA tells
the airlines, if you have any doubt, report; if you see
something, say something.  And if you don't say
something --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then the third?  And
your third?
MR. COHN:  And the third piece of context is
the consequences of a failure to make a report can be
catastrophic for passenger safety and aviation security.
And that's why TSA says, if you don't report
sincerely-held concerns, you might be sanctioned by us
for failing to make the report, placing airlines between
a rock and a hard place.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In this context, it's not
clear to me what the issue is that's before us.  My
understanding is, is that there was no finding of
falsity.  Now, the jury was instructed that it had to be
defamatory.  Lawyers know that that means it has to be
false, I assume.  And are you saying that -- you know,
the jurors weren't instructed as to the definition of
"defamatory"?  Is that the point?
MR. COHN:  No, the issue is not about the
jury instructions, Justice Kennedy.  The question's
about the statutory immunity and the Aviation
Transportation Security Act, ATSA, and whether that
immunity requires a determination of whether or not the
statement was materially false.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  By the court.
MR. COHN:  By the court in our view.  We
think, under any standard, we should prevail.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What -- what position --
although they'll tell us in a minute -- does Respondent
take on that issue that a determination by the jury
suffices?  As you understand their brief.  They can talk
for themselves in a few minutes.
MR. COHN:  I believe two things.  One, I
believe they concede the legal question that material
falsity is part of the ATSA analysis, and that's the
question on which this Court granted cert.  On the
second question, which is not before the Court, is who
should decide this issue, the court or the jury?
I believe they feel the jury should answer
that question.  Again, that issue is not strictly before
the Court, but I think, on the issue that is before the
Court, they agree that material falsity is part of the
ATSA analysis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But isn't that implicit in
the instruction to the jury, that it has to be
defamatory?  Now, if you say, well, even if it is, the
judge -- the court has a duty to determine, as a matter
of law, at the outset, then that's something else.
MR. COHN:  Well, the jury -- and this is a
question of the jury instructions, which are not being
challenged, are not before the Court, but the jury was
not given instruction on materiality.
The jury, also, was not given instruction on
clear and convincing.  They're not given instruction
that the decision should be about what the effect would
be on TSA.  So the jury didn't answer that question.
The jury shouldn't have answered that question.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But does defamatory require
that it be materially false?  Can't I defame somebody
with a statement in -- in which the derogatory
information is not material to anything at all, but it's
just derogatory?
MR. COHN:  Under the common law, Justice
Scalia, the statement has to be materially false.  We
agree with that.  And we also think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Has to be materially false
to sustain what?
MR. COHN:  To sustain a defamation judgment.
Of course, it depends upon State law, but generally,
under the common law, the statement has to be materially
false --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Material to -- to
what?
MR. COHN:  In --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, you can have
a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material
to -- you know, air safety.  Is that what materiality
goes to, the particular reason that the statement is
made?
MR. COHN:  Mr. Chief Justice, that's a very
important distinction because, in the common law
context, you're concerned about the effect on the
person's reputation -- his general reputation in the
community, whereas, in the ATSA context, you're talking
about a very particular listener.  The listener is TSA
or a reasonable air safety official.
And the purpose of the report --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying you
can't defame -- someone gets immunity for a statement
that would be defamatory in the common law context if
made generally, but because it's made in the context of
information about flight safety, that's somehow immune?
MR. COHN:  Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  The
statement might be deemed defamatory if you don't have
the ATSA immunity, but because of the ATSA immunity,
it's not materially false.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you call some TSA
official and say this pilot -- you know, is having an
affair.  That's immune?
MR. COHN:  That would not be immune because
that would not be relevant to a suspicious transaction,
suspicious activity, or passenger safety, so --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it would still support
a defamation, wouldn't it?
MR. COHN:  Correct.  It would probably --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because it is material to
the person's reputation.
MR. COHN:  Correct.  And it would not be
immune.  But the report we had here is not that
someone's having an affair, but, rather, the report we
made is that someone might possibly be giving rise to a
concern.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on the report that was
made here, suppose that the report said that the
Respondent -- we believe the Respondent is mentally ill,
or we believe the Respondent has serious mental
problems.  Would you -- would you make the same argument
if that's what was said?
MR. COHN:  With those words, I think I
would, Justice Alito, because --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You would?
MR. COHN:  The same argument, yes.  Now, I
think there are words that would cross the line.  I
don't believe those words do because -- a couple things.
First, the gist of the statement is still the same.  The
gist is this is a person who might possibly have a gun
and might possibly be in a state of mind --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, the facts, as I
understand it, were that he became very angry during a
test -- during a flight simulation test.  He took off
his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset,
started cursing at the instructor, and then later,
he was -- he was showing anger and cursing for a period
of time in other parts of the facility.
Does it go beyond that?  Is that fair?
MR. COHN:  That's a fair characterization.
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  And you think,
based on that, you could say, we believe this man is
mentally ill?
MR. COHN:  Justice Alito, I'm keeping in
mind the first important piece of context, which is
these reports are being made by tens of thousands of
aviation employees on the ground that could have
different educations and socioeconomic backgrounds and
might not all speak the way we do, especially in an
uncertain context in which the facts are rapidly
evolving.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  What's so
difficult about simply saying he's angry?  Why choose
the word "mentally unstable"?  Isn't it with an intent
to connote something more than the facts?
MR. COHN:  A couple things, Justice
Sotomayor.  First, it's not -- the question is whether
the gist of the statement is the same.  It's up to TSA
to draw the connotations, the implications --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, yes, but from
facts.  So isn't there a difference between saying
someone's angry and someone's mentally ill --
MR. COHN:  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- has a mental problem
or is mentally unstable?  Don't you think that the
intent is to convey something else?
MR. COHN:  Justice Sotomayor, I think that
different people express the same thought in different
ways.  I think a baggage handler in Boston or a flight
attendant in LaGuardia might use different words, such
as "he lost it," "he went off the deep end," "he was
acting irrationally," "he blew up."
And the lower court said --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, you could say he's
nuts, but the question isn't whether somebody would say
it.  The question is whether that is false.  I mean, the
mere fact that -- that a lot of people will -- will
exaggerate and say things that are simply not true
doesn't make it okay.
MR. COHN:  Justice Scalia, a couple things
in response.  First, this is not a situation in which
there's a simple statement and the person hangs up.
There's a conversation with TSA, in this case, a
10-minute conversation, in which they probe behind the
facts and they found out what happened, that Mr. Hoeper
was angry and upset and he blew up that morning at
training.
And second, the lower court recognized this
and said, if we simply had used "irrational and blew
up," we'd be immune, as opposed to saying "mentally
ill."
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But the point is that
somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or
whatever it was, was material, whether -- whether it
would have made any difference to TSA if it had been
described otherwise.  And in this case, as I understand
it, as -- as the Colorado supreme court said, nobody has
made that determination; right?
The Colorado supreme court says it doesn't
make any difference whether -- whether it would have
affected TSA or not, putting it -- putting it the proper
way, right?
MR. COHN:  Correct, Justice Scalia,
absolutely correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So that's what we're
confronted with, simply, the -- the need for somebody to
make that factual determination, right?  And you're
saying what?  There's no need to make it at all?
MR. COHN:  Oh, no, no, Justice Scalia, we
say that there is a need to make that determination.
The lower court said no need, material falsity is not
part of the ATSA analysis.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where did it say
"material"?  I thought -- I thought -- I think, so far
as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or
falsity of the statement.  And you're saying that the
Colorado supreme court should have said it has to be
false.  Isn't that your argument?
MR. COHN:  They had to say it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  Now, I've looked
at -- I've looked at footnote 17 -- or footnote 6 or
whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their
characterization of the Colorado supreme court is right;
that is, the Colorado supreme court is going to be very
surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to
be false.
What they said here is, "In the
determination of immunity, we need not and, therefore,
do not decide whether the statements were true or
false."  Correct.
Why not?  Because, they say, "The trial
court properly submitted the case to the jury.
Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the
elements of a defamation claim, including whether the
statements were false."
So, as I read that, which I think you'll
hear from the other side in about -- a few minutes,
the -- the Colorado supreme court says, look, the jury
found that the statement was false, so we don't have to
worry about that, we're worried about whether the false
statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth
or falsity or knowledge that it was false.  Okay?
That's how I read the footnote.  And they
say something like that on -- on page 30 and 31 of their
brief.
So -- so if I'm right about that, what are
we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to say that matters
of truth or falsity are not for the jury?  Are we
supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any
reasonable person would go -- would do here?  What is it
we're supposed to do?
MR. COHN:  Justice Breyer, the lower court
recognized that the ATSA immunity question is for the
court to decide.  And because they left that issue,
material falsity, to the jury, they said it's not part
of the ATSA immunity analysis, and that's error.  It
should --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But did the jury -- did
the jury find falsity?  Do you recognize that?  Did this
jury find that the statement was, as you say, materially
false?
MR. COHN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The jury
did make that determination, but --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And how did -- how did
they make it?  Because the only thing I see is the
special verdict sheet and it doesn't ask that question.
MR. COHN:  Correct.  What the jury did,
first of all -- first of all, it shouldn't have gone to
the jury because it's part of the ATSA immunity
analysis, which is for the court to decide.
But, second, the jury did not ask whether or
not our statement would have a different effect on TSA,
which is the proper test here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There are two -- there are
two different issues of falsity that we're talking about
here, of materiality.  One is the defamation issue, and
it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable
when all that he did was lose his temper.  Okay?  That's
my view of it.
That does not answer the question of whether
calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his
temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have
produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the
airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper,
he's been fired from his job, he may have a -- he may
have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was
mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to
take him off the flight.
There are two different questions.
Materiality for defamation is -- is quite different from
the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity
under this Act.  The latter question is for the court,
but the former is for the jury, it seems to me.
MR. COHN:  I agree completely, Justice
Scalia.  That's absolutely correct.  And unless this
Court has further questions, I would like to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I do.  I'd like an
answer -- well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd
like an answer to my question.
MR. COHN:  My answer, Justice Breyer, to
your question is that the jury answered a different
question.  They answered a question about whether it's
material under defamation law, not whether it's material
to TSA as required by ATSA and that determination should
not go to the jury, that's for the court to decide.
And the lower court said, I'm not going
to -- we're not going to address that question, we're
not going to address it because it's not part of ATSA,
and that was legal error, as even Mr. Hoeper concedes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Feigin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,
FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. FEIGIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
It's essentially undisputed that, in order
to encourage airlines to report suspicious activity to
proper authorities, the ATSA immunizes such reports when
they're materially true.  I want to emphasize two main
points about the scope of that immunity.
First, ATSA gives airlines very wide
latitude in how they describe the suspicious activities.
These reports are made against an inherently uncertain
factual backdrop, and that's why the statute protects
reports of any suspicious transaction relevant to a
possible violation of law or regulation relating to air
safety.  Misconceptions and exaggerations can occur, not
only because of confusion about the facts, but because
of the emotion, the stress, and potentially even the
fear that may go along with making one of these reports.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Mr. Feigin, do you think
that the statute, 44941, was intended by the Congress to
incorporate the New York Times-Sullivan standard, the
Masson v. New Yorker standard?
And -- and if so, then it -- it seems to me
that the airline is under a duty more strict than the
one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's
counsel has explained.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think
there's a distinction between Masson and this case.
Masson follows the more general defamation law rule
about whether a statement is materially false in terms
of a person's reputation, whereas, here, the focus is on
what a reasonable security official would believe.
And we think that's fairly seen in the text
of the statute, which, again, protects statements about
any suspicious transaction relevant to possible
violation of law or regulation.
So what the statements are intended to
convey is a suspicion of a possible threat, and the gist
in this context, what has to be true in this context, is
the suspicion of the possible threat.  Now, I want to
emphasize that because the statute talks about
suspicions and possibilities, that the actual factual
basis for what's reported doesn't need to be
particularly strong.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So -- so you want us to
write an opinion to say that the -- that the statute
here is to be interpreted differently than if it were a
New York Times and Sullivan case or Masson-New Yorker
case?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think the
only real difference is the context.  I think, in
Masson, you were talking about readers of a general
interest magazine, The New Yorker Magazine, whereas,
here, the audience for these reports is much more
specialized.  It's law enforcement officers who are
receiving reports of suspicious activity.
Now, they're not interested in someone's
reputation as a general matter.  What they're interested
in is what kind of threat the person might pose and what
might happen to an airplane in the next period of time
that they have to worry about.
And I think it's particularly important that
the Court give wide latitude to statements in this
context because there's a substantially similar
provision that protects individuals who make reports to
law enforcement authorities.  That's in 6 U.S.C. 1104.
And I think it would be very unfortunate if
someone responding to the TSA's ubiquitous "See
Something, Say Something" campaign were to inadvertently
or recklessly, as later concluded by a jury, have some
sort of exaggeration about what they were reporting and
then find themselves liable for civil damages, just for
trying to --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I accept that for the
moment -- accept all that.  What's bothering me, a picky
little point, but the picky point is that your statement
of the question, whether ATSA immunity may be denied
without a determination that the air carrier's
disclosure was materially false?  No, can't be.  But I
read the footnote, footnote 6, last sentence, it says
there was such a determination, the jury made it, and we
don't have to go back over it.
So what are you arguing?  Are you arguing
that there should be like, as there is in free speech
cases -- you know, a special duty upon an appellate
court to go back over such a jury finding?  Are you
saying the Colorado supreme court was wrong in the
second part of footnote 6 when it says the jury made it?
What am I supposed to do, in your opinion.
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, what you're supposed to
do in this case, Your Honor, is that the jury -- the
finding that the jury made -- first of all, the jury
wasn't actually instructed on materiality --
JUSTICE BREYER:  They may have waived it --
you know.
MR. FEIGIN:  But assuming, for the sake of
argument, the jury found the statements were materially
false, it only did so in the context of the State law
defamation verdict.  And as Justice Scalia explained and
as I tried to explain earlier, there's a difference
between materiality from the perspective of someone's
reputation and materiality for purposes of the TSA
in inquiry that's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  My understanding of what the
Colorado supreme court did is this:  On the issue of
ATSA immunity, it said, very clearly, that is for the
court.  And it says, in footnote 5, it may -- it gives
no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to
the facts that it found on the immunity question.
And then, at the end of footnote 6, what it
said was, having found that there is no immunity, then
it was proper for the trial judge to submit the
defamation issue to the jury, and the jury made findings
on the defamation issue.
Is that -- is that your understanding as
well?
MR. FEIGIN:  That's my understanding of the
supreme court of Colorado's opinion, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And are they right that, in
determining ATSA immunity, the jury has no role, doesn't
make findings of historical fact, who said what,
anything like that?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think
this is encompassed within the question presented, but
our view, as we explain in footnote 6 of our brief, is
that, under ATSA, questions of historical facts, such as
what was actually said on the call and what actually
happened, would be submitted to the jury.
Materiality is a mixed question of law and
fact.  We believe that, also, it should be submitted to
the jury, but with very careful jury instructions,
making clear the very wide latitude that airlines have
in this context.
And because airlines have such wide latitude
in this context, we think, very often, the courts will
be able to get rid of these kinds of cases at the motion
to dismiss --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then you disagree with
Justice Scalia?  He drew a distinction between two forms
of materiality, whether something's materially false,
meaning is it misleading; that, presumably, would go to
a jury.  But whether or not this misleading statement
would be material to the TSA or to security officers is
a question for the court.
You disagree with that position by him?
MR. FEIGIN:  Again, Your Honor, we don't
think the Court needs to address it here.  We actually
think a jury would resolve the materiality question
under the ATSA --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  You'd give the jury two
different instructions?  You are to find materiality for
purposes of whether it's defamatory or not and then,
having found that it is defamatory, you must make a
second materiality finding, namely, would this
defamatory statement have caused TSA -- if it had been
accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it
did, not have removed this man from the flight?
You're going to give the jury those two
instructions on materiality?
MR. FEIGIN:  We do think the court should
give the jury separate instructions on ATSA, and then,
if it passes the ATSA bar, you'd go on to defamation
law.  But, Your Honor, I'm not going to fight the Court
too hard if it wants to say that this is a question for
the Court.
What I'd really like to emphasize here is
that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I actually would
like your opinion, the SG's opinion, on whether this is
an issue for the court or the jury.  I mean, you don't
have to fight us.  What -- what is your view?
(Laughter.)
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, we are comfortable
with the Court saying that it's a question for the
court.  Our reading of the statute is that it would be a
question for the jury.  There'd be an instruction, as
there was in this case, although not a proper
instruction, on all the elements of ATSA, with the court
making the law very clear to the jury that it has to
apply for ATSA.
And then, if the jury gets past that, they
would get a separate set of instructions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Of course, you
don't -- there's no reason -- and, presumably, a good
trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two
separate questions using the same word, right?  I mean,
you could articulate what you mean by "material" in --
in each context.
In other words, you don't have to say it
would be material to TSA.  It would say just, as my
colleague has suggested, whether or not TSA would have
done anything different if a different formulation had
been used.
MR. FEIGIN:  That's right, Your Honor.  I
think you could ask how TSA would have understood the
statement with their particular eye towards the
suspicion of a possible threat that's being conveyed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you'd -- you'd feel
snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines,
knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is
going to be up to some jury who is going to see that
this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be
up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not?
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, we're
comfortable --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't give me a
lot -- a lot of comfort.  If you're really concerned
about enabling people to come forward without fear, when
they have a suspicion of something, I'm saying,
well -- you know, some jury will decide whether --
whether you put it wrongly or not, and if you're putting
it wrongly, it would have made a difference, it doesn't
make me happy.
MR. FEIGIN:  Your Honor, I think what's
going to provide the adequate good feelings that
airlines have making these reports, to make them feel
safe making these reports, is for this Court to
emphasize the very wide scope that the ATSA gives to how
airlines characterize --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Feigin, they have
that wide scope because of the actual malice standard,
that somebody needs to show that there was actual
knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to
falsity.
And you're saying that we should do
something different.  You're saying that we should
expand what falsity means in this context as a sort of
extra protection, and I guess why is that true?
MR. FEIGIN:  Well, Your Honor, I don't think
we're doing anything different from the actual malice
standard, except taking account of the context.  In this
particular context, where there's a lot of factual
uncertainty, a lot of emotion mixed in, and the audience
aren't readers of, for example, a general interest
magazine, they are security officials looking for
suspicion of a possible threat, we think that the scope
of the materiality test is very broad.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Russell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are two sets of questions before the
Court here.  There's a legal question about the proper
interpretation of ATSA and maybe some subsidiary
questions about the division of authority between judge
and jury and what the materiality standard is.  And then
there's a question about what to do with this case.  And
those two sets of things should be considered
differently because much of what's being argued here
today was not presented to the lower courts.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So suppose I'm the trial
judge and I conclude that, if Air Wisconsin had said to
the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier
question, We have an employee who was terminated today,
he probably knew it, he lost his temper during a test,
he might think that some of our employees are out to get
him, and there may even be some truth to that, he's
authorized to carry a gun, we don't know if he has one
or not, we're giving you that information.
Suppose I'm the trial judge.  I conclude
that, if that information had been given to TSA, TSA
quite properly stopped this plane to examine the pilot.
Do I send the case to the jury?
MR. RUSSELL:  Let me unpack that.  I think
there is three parts to that question.  The first is
implicit in that is ATSA immunity factual questions for
the court or for the jury?  And we agree with the
government that you should apply the ordinary qualified
immunity standards and historical disputes about the
facts are handled by the jury.
Of course, if the court can say, look, even
on the plaintiff's view of the facts, immunity is
proper, you can enter summary judgment.
The second question is what is the
materiality standard.  Justice Scalia, you've suggested
that the standard is would TSA have done the same thing
anyway?  And I take the government even to be saying
that that's not the right test because we can't know,
because TSA won't tell us.
TSA has to keep secret its procedures about
what it would do and when.  And, as a consequence, I
think the proper standard is the standard that applies
under New York Times and in other defamation cases,
which is the Masson standard.  Would a true statement
have a different effect on the security officials' mind?
And we think you can have a gloss on that,
that says --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the Masson reporter
for The New Yorker Magazine spent months on this
article.  They had proofreaders.  They had editors in
New York.  And you're saying the same standard applies
to the baggage handler who has only 10 minutes to decide
what he's going to say?
MR. RUSSELL:  I'm saying the same standard
of material truth applies.  Actual malice, the
subjective good faith, is the principal protection
afforded to the baggage handlers.  Even if what he says
is blatantly materially false, so long as he believed
it, so long as he acted in good faith, he's protected
here.
And so the question is, what happens when
somebody like Mr. Doyle, who has been found to have
acted in bad faith, and that's not challenged here --
does he, nonetheless, get immunity because what he said
was materially true?
And we think the standard --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go back to the
"who decides" question?  I find it very confusing.  Now,
everybody seems to say, well, it's the jury that
decided -- that decides, but the Colorado supreme court
said that it recognized that the court was to decide
this question, not the jury.
And in this case, the jury decided it.  That
was error, the Colorado supreme court said, but it was
harmless.  So who decides?  Is it -- is it the court or
the jury?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think that the answer to the
legal question is that you have the same division that
you have in qualified immunity, that material disputes
of facts are resolved by the jury and then the court
reviews those -- those findings under the normal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in my -- under my
question, I first asked you, I'm the trial judge, I have
made the determination that TSA would have acted the
same way.  I still have to submit this to the jury?
MR. RUSSELL:  If -- if you think that
there's no disputes about those facts, that no
reasonable jury could conclude otherwise on those facts,
and you think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, I thought that, even
if the facts had been reported much more accurately than
they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate.
MR. RUSSELL:  All right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can't I make that
determination as a matter of law?
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't -- I think the
materiality question goes to the jury, subject to review
by the court on the motion for directed verdict --
whatever.  But there's also -- I also want to make clear
that I disagree with the premise of that question about
what the standard of materiality is, and it's not
whether TSA would have acted differently.
It's whether TSA would have had a different
impression about facts that are undoubtedly material to
their determination, not only about the extent of the
threat, but also what to do in the immediate aftermath.
They have to make a decision from the
get-go, not only whether to investigate or not, but
whether or not to respond by sending an officer down or
scrambling a SWAT team.  And certainly being told that
somebody is mentally unstable and may be armed is going
to be materially -- be a materially different impression
on their minds about those questions.  And that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not sure what
you just said because, even the way you just phrased
that, you're asking what TSA would have done.  How else
can we think about materiality, other than by asking,
well, if you were a TSA officer and you heard this, what
would you have done?
MR. RUSSELL:  You apply the Masson test,
which is would a truer statement have a different effect
on the mind of the reader?  It doesn't mean that they
have to have done something differently.  It's just that
they understand the facts differently than they do based
on what was said.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you're saying, if
it made a difference in their mind whether to send one
officer to his house or a SWAT team somewhere else,
that's material, and you lose immunity?
MR. RUSSELL:  That's materially false, yes,
if the difference would have made a difference --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If the difference --
if the difference in the language causes TSA to do
anything differently, then you lose immunity?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think you would, but that's
not the question.  The question is, would the statement
have a different effect on the readers or the listeners.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  A different
effect -- a different effect on who?
MR. RUSSELL:  The listeners, the TSA.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The TSA.  So -- but
that's what I'm saying.  Let's say the TSA person looks
at it and says, ah, this is -- you know, if it had been
phrased as you say, ah, this is silly, I'm not going to
do anything.
But he says, well, it looks silly to me, but
I'm going to send it to my supervisor.  That's a
different effect on the listeners' mind, and you say
that difference causes the airline to lose immunity.
MR. RUSSELL:  I think so.  And in addition,
whatever you say about this, you should also keep in
mind what was actually argued below.  Let me say a few
things about how this went down --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, before you get to
that -- before you get to that, to finish up on the
point you were making earlier.  Suppose that the report
is he ranted for 10 minutes, and then suppose the jury
found he ranted for 7 minutes.
Now, maybe those 3 minutes would make a
difference -- make a difference in the impression on the
TSA.  That would be enough, in your view?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think it has to make a
difference in the way that they would evaluate the
existence, nature, or extent of the threat, and so it --
you know, it wouldn't make a difference to the way that
they evaluated the nature or the extent of the threat,
then it's not material.
But keep in mind, the way that this case was
litigated below, they, themselves, proposed the Masson
standard.  And it's -- we've reproduced their brief to
the Colorado supreme court.  It's on page 30a.  They
say, "A statement is not considered false unless" --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where are you reading?
MR. RUSSELL:  Page 30a of the Red Brief.  It
is where we reproduced their Colorado supreme court
brief.  And on page 30a, they say, "A statement is not
considered false unless it would have a different effect
on the mind of the reader than what the pleaded truth
would have produced," and they cite Masson.
"This new-found ATSA-specific materiality
test comes largely from the United States' invitation to
brief at the cert stage in this case."  And they never
asked for an instruction on materiality at all, much
less an ATSA-specific materiality instruction to the
jury.
They never argued for an ATSA-specific
materiality test in the lower court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I think you're
right.  They seem to rely mostly on the proposition that
this all should have been submitted to the judge.
MR. RUSSELL:  That's correct.  That was
their principal argument below, and that's clearly
wrong.  And the United States agrees with us, that
that's not the right way to -- to go about dealing with
this.
This is a statute that is premised on --
that is based on the model of qualified immunity.  In
the Federal courts, qualified immunity factual issues
are submitted to the jury and subject to ordinary
appellate review, sometimes heightened appellate review
with --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What are -- what are the
factual issues?  You said the factual issues.  I didn't
think that there was much dispute about what was said to
the air traffic safety.  So what are -- what are the
disputed facts that the jury would find relevant to the
immunity?
MR. RUSSELL:  So the materiality consider
compares what was said -- and you're right, there's no
dispute about that -- and what was true, and there's a
lot of dispute about that.
But we think that, at the end of the day,
even if you say that it's a question of law for the
court, even if you take it upon yourselves to decide it,
we don't think that there's any way in which they can
say that these statements were materially true.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So am I right in
understanding that there be two -- you would view these
two scenarios differently?  The same historic facts.
Somebody calls and said this happened, this happened,
this happened.  He was acting crazy.  And the next one,
this happened, this happened, this happened, and he's
crazy.
Do you think you lose immunity in the latter
case, but not the former case?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, I think you'd lose in
both.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You would lose in
both?
MR. RUSSELL:  Yes.  I mean, I think in
both --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So a layperson -- a
layperson who -- you know, just looks at this and said,
he's acting crazy, they're not immune from that?  If
they called TSA and say that, everything is true, I
guess you would say up until that characterization.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, let me be clear about
that then.  If they give all the -- all the facts -- and
I'm not sure what all the this is true, this is true,
this is true -- they simply explained all the facts and
then appended to it their evaluation that showed he was crazy,
I don't think they would be immune.  I think they lose
immunity for that.
But that's not what happened.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But they would be --
the airline would be immune?
MR. RUSSELL:  The airline would be immune,
correct.  But that's not what happened in this case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no.  I know.
But I'm trying to find out if you think there's a
difference between the person's subjective, uneducated
evaluation, "He was acting crazy," and a difference
between that person saying, "He's crazy."
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think there's a
difference between that.  What's -- the difference is
when the person asserts that somebody is mentally
unstable as a fact and doesn't give the background facts
to allow somebody to make an alternative --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So other than proving at
trial that these statements were misleadingly false --
or false, how did you prove that the statements would
have had an effect on a reasonable security officer?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, let me -- sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you -- what's the
evidence that you expect parties to present and what was
it you presented to show that their response would have
been different?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, let me ask -- answer the
second question first, which is we had an expert witness
who was formerly in charge of writing security
regulations for TSA and the FAA before that who
testified that, in light of the truth, a call wasn't
even warranted, but that he perfectly understood why TSA
acted the way it did, given the contents of the call.
Now, this wasn't a focus because nobody made
the argument that this could be a materially false --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But we have granted cert on
this question.  So -- so given that fact, could we do
this:  One, yes, it has to be false; two, the Colorado
supreme court, because of footnotes 5, as well as 6,
which I haven't picked up, and other things they've
said, is at least ambiguous about the role the jury's
finding played.
And given that fact, what we'll do is we'll
go through and see where the parties agree about what
happened in -- in the world, and insofar as they agree,
we'll take it, you see.  Your side will get the
underlying assumption, and looking at it, as it's agreed
upon, we find either that it would be or wouldn't be
within the scope of the immunity.  And on that one, you
might lose.
But is there -- is there -- what do you
think of that procedure?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I definitely think that
it would be appropriate for this Court to write an
opinion that says, look, to the extent footnote 6
suggests that some true statements aren't protected by
ATSA, that's wrong.
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't say that.
It says -- footnote 6 has to be read with footnote 5,
which I hadn't picked up.  And once I put those two
footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado
supreme court says.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think you can say,
look, we don't know what it means, but to the extent it
means that ATSA doesn't affect all true statements,
that's wrong.  But in this case, the jury found -- and
three courts -- Colorado courts affirmed, that the
statements weren't true.
And, Justice Ginsburg, there was an
instruction to the jury, and in Instruction No. 9 at
page 579 of the Joint Appendix, I have been told the
jury, that to enter a verdict, they had to find that the
statement was false.
So the jury found that that was false.  On
appellate review, two courts of appeals found that there
was sufficient evidence for that, even though they
didn't ask for a materiality instruction.  Those two
courts resolved every material falsity claim or every
materiality objection that AWAC actually raised, in the
context in which it actually raised it, which was
whether we had satisfied our version -- burden to prove
the elements of common law defamation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, on two of the -- on
two of the three statements, the difference between the
literal -- the very strict truth and what was said is
very slight.  But you dispute that on -- they'd said he's
an FFO officer, and he may be armed.
MR. RUSSELL:  I think that there's a huge
difference.  There's no reason to say that he may be
armed.
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's literally true.  It's
literally true.  He's an FFO officer.  He has a gun.  He
may be armed.
MR. RUSSELL:  Suppose I were to know that
there is a lawyer in town who has a concealed carry
permit, and I know he has a hearing at the courtroom --
at the courthouse down the road later today.
If I were to call the security folks there
and say, hey, just to let you know, there's a -- there's
a lawyer coming to the argument, and he may be armed,
everybody would understand that I was saying to them
that there was something more than the theoretical
possibility that he's armed and that I have some
information to believe that he is violating or intending
to violate the law that prohibits him from bringing that
gun to the court.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And what would be a true
statement?
MR. RUSSELL:  A true statement would be --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Not with respect to the
lawyer; with respect to your client.
MR. RUSSELL:  I think it would have been
true for them to say, look, we're calling to let you
know, because Mr. Hoeper's an FFDO, we don't have any
reason to believe that he has gun with him, but we can't
tell for sure, so we just thought we would tell you, in
case you have any questions and want to investigate
further.
By not saying -- by not qualifying "may be
armed" with the statement that "we have no reason at all
to believe that he actually has a gun," which is the
truth, I think they gave a very different impression --
and Mr. LaWare, for example, the vice president who made
the decision to make the call, testified that, if he had
been told, as a pilot, that a mentally unstable person
who may have a gun was boarding his plane, it would make
him very concerned about the safety of his crew and
passengers.  This is at JA 271 to 272.
And as a consequence, he said those aren't
the words I would have anticipated being used because he
recognized, as somebody in the industry, what effect
those words would have on a reasonable security person.
So that --
JUSTICE ALITO:  But you're talking about a
very subtle implication of the statement.  And I agree
with you, there's an implication there that may not be
justified, but you're talking about something very
subtle in -- in the context of -- of someone making a
call to report a possible threat.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, again, I don't think
it's that subtle.  I think an ordinary person would --
would think I was being misrepresenting in the example
that I gave, which I think is the same.  But in any
event --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, just pursuing
Justice Alito's point about the other statement, the
other, that he was terminated today.  Well, he didn't
get notice.  I mean, that -- that's --
MR. RUSSELL:  We acknowledge that that is
not an important part of our case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And then the final
thing, I guess, was the same thing Justice Scalia had in
mind, was that he's unstable.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, "Mentally unstable."  And
that's -- you know, this Court has used the phrase
"mentally unstable" as a shorthand for describing people
who are subject to involuntary commitment, and people
who are barred by Federal law from owning a gun.  These
are trigger words in -- in this context.  So that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're not
suggesting it would be a different case if they just
said he's unstable, as opposed to he's mentally
unstable, are you?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, because I would understand
that they're not saying that he might fall over.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's what
you were saying.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When Justice Kennedy
posed the question that he was unstable, you said,
"mentally unstable."  And my point is that that doesn't
make any difference to your case, does it?
MR. RUSSELL:  No, it doesn't.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.
MR. RUSSELL:  It doesn't.  I'm sorry.  I
didn't mean to be facetious about it.  But I-- the point is
that whether they said "unstable" or "mentally
unstable," everybody understood it was the same thing,
and it had the same implication, which is very serious.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, they didn't -- they
said, we were concerned about his mental stability.
MR. RUSSELL:  They said that, but they also
said he is unstable.  They said, "unstable pilot."  And
when you couple those together, even if they just said
they were concerned, I think that would be false and
misleading, in part, because they weren't.
I mean, we had testimony.  We asked them,
"Did you think that Mr. Hoeper was mentally unstable?"
And Mr. Orozco said, "I don't believe he was mentally
unstable."
JUSTICE ALITO:  Wouldn’t you think it makes
a difference we're talking here about a pilot?  I mean,
my impression of pilots is that they are supposed to
remain perfectly calm, even when terrible things happen.
Well, all the -- you know, all engines are on fire and
one of the wings has fallen off, but -- you know, you
don't start ranting and screaming.
And so someone described him as acting in a
manner that was more unprofessional than they had ever
seen.  Do you think that makes a difference?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think you could take that
into account, but you also have to recognize that,
hopefully, this wouldn't be the same because most people
don't get treated as unfairly as Mr. Hoeper was.
And I think there is abundant evidence for
the jury to conclude that he was acting with -- maybe not the
best way, but he was acting within the -- the spectrum
of normal human reaction to being treated that unfairly,
with respect to something that important.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But maybe for ordinary
people, but how about for pilots?
MR. RUSSELL:  I think even for pilots.  For
example, Mr. Sherman, who is a pilot, who's trained in
spotting threats, testified -- he's the one who got
yelled at -- testified that, when he left the training
center, he didn't think that Mr. Hoeper was acting
irrationally, he didn't think that he was a threat.
He was shocked to learn that calls to TSA
had actually been made.  And Mr. Orozco talked to him
briefly before he boarded the flight, and he knew, at
that point, that he was an FFDO, he was a pilot, he knew
about the last chance letter, he knew about the prior
incidents of pilots taking down airplanes.  And he told
him, go ahead, get on the flight.
There really isn't -- these are the people
who would know what is surprising and concerning about
the conduct of our client in this case, and none of them
were willing to say that he was, in fact, mentally
unstable, and that's telling.
You know, even if they are willing to say
now, through their lawyers, that they had concerns about
his mental stability, the fact that they weren't willing
to say that he was mentally unstable shows that they
recognized that there's a material difference between
those two statements.
Otherwise, they would have said, yes, he was
mentally unstable because we had concerns about his
mental stability.  And that's the same thing.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All of us have had the
experience -- at least I have, of -- if I get very angry
at something, one of my children will say, God, he's
mentally unstable.  See, I mean, that's -- people use
that word in different contexts.
And what's worrying me is -- is that some
real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and
the people are going to report it to the TSA, start
watching their words and they don't know what the
lawyers mean exactly -- and you understand the problem.
MR. RUSSELL:  I understand --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So why isn't the best thing
to say is, look, there is leeway here -- considerable
leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's
reporting -- that are reporting things to TSA.  All it
means is they are going to search him more thoroughly.
MR. RUSSELL:  There is enormous leeway
already, and that is in the actual malice standard.  So
long as the person believes that what he is saying true,
so long as he doesn't suspect that it's untrue, he has
immunity, even if it's grossly untrue.  And that's
the -- that's, I think, one of the reasons why -- and
you have that protection under the First Amendment to
start with.
And that's one of the reasons why we're able
to identify only six cases, and this is one of them, in
the entire ten-year history of the statute, when
anybody's even cited this provision in an opinion,
published or unpublished, State or Federal.
And that's because the protection that's
afforded by the actual malice standard, which comes in
the First Amendment, but also in this statute, provides
ample protection for people who are acting in good
faith.  And I don't think that you need to come up with
some special materiality light standard under this
statute, particularly when there's no reason to --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Russell, weren't you,
yourself, suggesting the twist on the materiality
standard?  You said it shouldn't be -- in the usual
case, we said would it have had a different effect on
the mind of, essentially, the average reader -- the
reasonable reader.
And you say, no, here, we're not supposed to
think of the reasonable person, generally; we're
supposed to think about the reasonable TSA officer.
Haven't you conceded that yourself?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I think that's -- that's
an application of the Masson standard, which is if you
know who the reader is.  I think it's reasonable to ask
the jury to think about who the reader is, and -- but
it's a world of difference to say --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how do we know about
the reasonable TSA officer?  I mean, you made the point
that we don't know a lot about TSA officers, in terms of
what they are going to do with respect to any given set
of facts, and -- you know, I find it a little bit hard
to think about the question, what does a reasonable TSA
officer think, without thinking about the question,
what's a reasonable TSA officer going to do?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, you have the same
problem with figuring out what he's going to do.  In
fact, it's much harder.  And so I think whatever -- if
you adopt that standard, you have the same problem with
my standard, and I think my standard's easier to deal
with.
I think you can look at -- you can have
expert testimony, as we did.  You can look at -- you can
ask the people who are in the industry and involved in
the case, as we did.  And they all seem to recognize
that saying somebody is mentally unstable versus saying
we have concerns about his mental state or that he is
angry would have a hugely different effect on a
listener's mind in that industry.
That's why Mr. LaWare said he would be very
concerned if those words were used and said --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Tell me the
difference between having a huge effect on that
listener's mind and the listener taking a different
action?  I'm not sure how -- what the difference is.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, the difference is -- I
mean, what Mr. LaWare was saying is it calls --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm more upset --
MR. RUSSELL:  I'm more concerned--
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- but -- I'm more
concerned, but I'm going to take the identical action?
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, I'm saying that you
don't have to figure out what they would have done.  In
part, this is just general defamation law, right?  You
are entitled to presume damages, so long as what is said
affects your belief about this person.  And there's
nothing in this statute -- there's nothing in the text
of the statute that alters that ordinary standard.
It's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but it affects
your belief is different in a context like this.  It may
not affect your belief, but you may decide, but given
what's at stake, I don't think he's mentally unstable
just because somebody calls and says that, but I'm going
to send it up to my supervisor, make sure he feels the
same way.
And you tell me that you lose immunity if he
says, I don't think he's mentally unstable and -- you
know, throws it away, in that -- as opposed to when he
says, I don't think he's mentally unstable, but let's
see what the boss thinks.
MR. RUSSELL:  Well, certainly, what they do
with the information is reflective of the effect it has
on their minds.  So we do think that, in any case, you
could show that TSA would have acted differently.  You
would necessarily be showing that it had a different
effect on their mind.
But the problem is TSA is not going to tell
us what they would have done if -- if a different
statement had been made.  This is not a standard that
can actually be applied in the real world.  And at the
end of the day, it's not necessary because there is
substantial protection already provided to good-faith
speakers who will know that, so long as they are
believing what they say, they can say whatever comes to
their mind, without having to consult with their lawyer.
In any event, even if this Court thought
that was the standard, even if you thought -- and we're
willing to forgive them for not raising that standard in
the Colorado courts, we do think that, on this evidence,
there was a basis for concluding that TSA would have
acted differently, had they known the truth.
And that's because, as I said before, we had
expert testimony from somebody who is very qualified in
this area who said that, had he known the truth, as a
TSA official, he wouldn't have wanted to receive a call.
And that -- he perfectly understood the very dramatic
response, given the content of what was actually said.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what are the other things
TSA could have done?  I mean, let's assume that this
call was made and it was a much more -- in tone, it was
much more factual and without using any of these words,
but it said the guy really lost his temper and -- you
know, he has this license, and we have no idea whether
he, in fact, is carrying a gun, but he could be?  What
could the TSA officers have done?  What do you think
they should have done, short of what they did?
Say that they were concerned, they thought
this might be a problem?  What are the midlevel
possibilities about-- of a response?
MR. RUSSELL:  So one possibility is -- it
depends, very much, on when the call was made.  Part of
the difficulty here was raised was that Mr. Doyle waited
for two-and-a-half hours after receiving this
information before making the call.
Had the call been made earlier, there was
testimony there was lots of things they could have done.
They could have called and checked to see if he had
checked in his gun at security.  They could have found
him.  They could have called him on his cell phone.
But even when -- having waited as long as
they did, they could have asked somebody on the airplane
to just go and ask him and talk to him and see if there
was reason to believe that there was something amiss
that would require going back to the gate.
Now, I acknowledge that, again, because the
call was so late, there really wasn't a ton that could
be done, but that's not a reason to give them greater
leeway.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you want us to say the
call has to be made right away, without reflection,
without talking to supervisors, without some quiet
discussion first?  That's what you want us to put in the
opinion?
MR. RUSSELL:  No.  I mean, TSA has told people,
report what you know immediately.  And so we do think
that Mr. Doyle's conduct, in which he wasn't consulting
with supervisors -- he did nothing during that
two-and-a-half hours that would reflect that he had an
actual concern about mental stability or danger here.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I thought I read
somewhere that, after this incident, there was a
discussion between or among Mr. Doyle and various
government agencies to figure out how to avoid something
like this in the future.
MR. RUSSELL:  He did testify to that effect,
yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Who testified?  Doyle?
MR. RUSSELL:  Mr. Doyle did.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what was your
sense -- I don't remember the testimony now.  What --
MR. RUSSELL:  I don't think he gave any
details about the content of that discussion.  But,
certainly, you can understand why TSA would not want
something like this to happen again because -- you know,
when somebody is given false information that --
particularly when it leads to an elevated response that
wouldn't have been necessary under a proper report, that
gives rise to security concerns and dangers in itself.
When you send armed men onto a plane full of
nervous people, in close quarters, who don't know what's
going on, and officers who believe that there may be a
man on the gun -- with a gun, who's mentally unstable on
the plane, that is a recipe for danger and for
accidental things to happen and for people to get hurt,
in addition to diverting attention from things that
might be actual more -- more serious incidents that
are going on at the same time.
Congress didn't think that the way to
promote airline security here is simply to give carte
blanche immunity to anybody who reports anything about
suspicious activity, if they thought they could have
ended at subsection A.  Instead, they recognized that
there's a balance and that people who make bad-faith
reports that are materially untrue ought not to be
immune, recognizing that there might be some deterrent
effect at the margins, but acknowledging the need to
strike this balance.
And in this case -- whatever you end up
doing in this case, and I would like to come back,
before I leave, to this point, that this case has been
litigated up the chain, without any request for
ATSA-specific materiality instruction, with the court
addressing every material truth objection that was
actually made in the context in which it was made.
And it's important to point out that they
never, even when they argued material truth, argued that
mentally unstable -- or were concerned about mental
instability was materially true.
The only argument they ever made about
that -- and you can read it at the appendix to the Red
Brief, was that this was a protected statement of
opinion because it could not be true or false.  And
there's a world of difference between saying that
something isn't true or false and saying that it is
true.
Because to determine whether it's protected
opinion, you only have to look at the statement to
determine whether it's substantially true.  You have to
look at the evidence.  And so they have not -- at the
very least, they have not preserved any argument that
the statement "mentally unstable" was materially true.
So, at the end of the day, we think that you
can satisfy the government's need for clarity about what
the legal standard is by simply saying ATSA protects
true statements, full stop, but, nonetheless, affirming
this case -- the opinion in this case on the ground that
the Colorado court asked whether these statements were
true and said that there was sufficient evidence that
they were not and resolved every materiality objection
that they actually made in the course of their opinion.
The fact that they did it under a different
subheading, that they asked the right question under the
wrong subheading, isn't a ground for reversal in this
case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you add to the
question -- the question in this case was put by the
Court -- the question whether ATSA immunity may be
denied without a determination the air carrier's
disclosure was material and false?
MR. RUSSELL:  The answer to that question is
no, with the caveat that an appellate court has no
obligation to resolve materiality objections, unless
they're actually raised by the defendant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Cohn, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COHN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Two very quick points:  First, the mixed
question, the application of law to facts most certainly
should be decided by the court, not the jury just like
this Court held in Muehler v. Mena or Nellis and Congus.
The historical facts are a separate
question, but the ultimate question of materiality is
one that should be decided by the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, how do we decide
what a reasonable security officer would do?
MR. COHN:  How do we decide it?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How does -- how -- how
do we as judges?  I'm not sure how juries would do it,
I'm not quite sure how judges would do it.  So what evidence
did you proffer?  He says he had an expert.  What did
you have at trial?
MR. COHN:  We had experts, too.  And judges
should resolve it, just like they resolve issues of
reasonable force and probable cause.  They have to use
judgment and common sense, in light of the broad leeway
that TSA should be given in answering these questions,
but the important thing is resolving that issue at the
earliest possible stage.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah, but we don't
decide whether it was reasonable force, if we think
there's a question about that.
MR. COHN:  If there's a question of
historical fact, if there --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  Not a question
of historical -- if there's a question about how a
reasonable officer would respond.  There's competing
experts.  Who decides that question?
MR. COHN:  Well, the – the only
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And there are some
levels of -- of force that we can say, as a matter of
law, don't qualify as excessive, and we have said that.
But when have we said that what might be excessive to
one -- to some, is a jury question -- is a judge --
MR. COHN:  According -- Nellis said the
ultimate question is for a court to decide.  But our
point is, first of all, the lower court here said the
question is for a court to decide for ATSA immunity.
But under any standard, we should still prevail because
the matter of law, the statement here simply is
immaterial.  Falsity -- the alleged falsity is
immaterial.  Under any standard, the Court should hold,
as a matter of law, the standard here is immaterial.
And the second point I was going to address
is the Court should address that application question in
this case because airlines need guidance.  They need
clarity.  They need predictability on what the law is.
And right now, there's no predictability
because the lower court held that hairsplitting
distinctions make a difference, that the difference
between fire today and fire tomorrow is a material
difference.  And the Court should make clear those
hairsplitting distinctions do not make a difference.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Cohn, what if I
think that TSA might have reacted differently to what
was actually said and to what really should have been
said?  Would they have reacted either way, they should
have done something either way, but they would have done
a different kind of thing?  What if I think that?  What
does that suggest about the proper resolution of this
case?
MR. COHN:  I would say it matters on whether
that different thing is material.  So, for instance, if
it's sending one officer versus two officers to the
plane, that's not material.  That does not make a
difference.  This is a case this Court should decide.
There's no material distinction between mental stability
and mental state or rationality or blow up.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
