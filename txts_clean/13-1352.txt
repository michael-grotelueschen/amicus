Mr. Meyer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MEYER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MEYER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In cases of foul acts done in secret where
the child is the party injured, the repelling of their
evidence entirely is in some measure denying them the
protection of the law.
That 254-year-old passage, I think, quite
accurately predicts the situation we find ourselves in
in Ohio following the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court
in this case, we believe, misapplying the Sixth
Amendment Confrontation Clause to these facts.
We believe the Ohio Supreme Court erred in
two fundamental ways.  First, when it held that private
parties who are acting with no police involvement by
virtue of their mandatory reporter's status are
transformed into law enforcement agents or agents of the
government for purposes of the Confrontation Clause
analysis.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have to be an agent
of the government for the Confrontation Clause to kick
in?
MR. MEYER:  Based on this Court's
post-Crawford decisions, we believe that that is the
primary analysis that should be conducted.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not primary.  I'm asking,
is it -- is it exclusive that no person who's not an
agent of the government can trigger a Confrontation
Clause protection?  I mean, that's clearly not true.  I
mean, you -- you can have a cross-examination in a civil
case, a lawyer in a civil case has somebody on the
stand.
MR. MEYER:  Well, in a civil case, I would
agree that that is -- that is testimonial evidence, but
purely private --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is.
MR. MEYER:  -- people --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's a private person.
MR. MEYER:  Well, in a civil case, Your
Honor, I believe that -- that official solemnity that
attaches to the oath that a witness is taking and an
understanding --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a question of
solemnity, but solemnity -- solemnity has nothing to do
with whether you're a civilian or -- or a policeman.
MR. MEYER:  Well, going -- going back to
Crawford itself and what this Court explained was the
purpose behind the Sixth Amendment, when the framers
adopted it, was to prevent a very specific kind of
abuse.  And that's government agents who are
investigating crimes for purposes of a criminal
prosecution.  And when you reduce it to the level of a
three and a half-year-old child talking to his daycare
teacher, I would submit that that is far --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Doesn't the --
MR. MEYER:  -- removed.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't the test whether
the statement is intended to be testimonial in nature?
MR. MEYER:  Yes, Justice Sotomayor, that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So whether it's given to
a private individual or a police officer is irrelevant.
The question is, was it intended to substitute for
testimony to be used later.
MR. MEYER:  That is the test that this Court
has announced in -- in Davis certainly.  But we have
submitted, I think, perhaps a threshold formulation
maybe, before you get to primary purpose, and this Court
has consistently applied it to law enforcement actors.
When you talk about private persons, I think that is an
easier test, coming from this as a boots-on-the-ground
trial prosecutor and trying to predict the way that
primary purpose test is going to be applied, I would
suggest the private party analysis as a first step would
lead to more predictable results.  Certainly --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Meyer, could you
explain one anomaly in this case?  The child, three and
a half years old, is incompetent to appear in court as a
witness.  How can the substitute be permissible?  If the
child is incompetent to testify in court, why isn't the
child incompetent to testify out -- make the same
statement out of court?
MR. MEYER:  Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,
I think it would be a mistake to say that his
incapability, his incompetence for purposes of the
courtroom setting means that nothing he's ever said on
planet Earth could be taken as a reliable statement.
Any parent knows that talking to their three year old,
certain things they say can be relied upon.
The Ohio rule, evidence rule 807, which is
modeled, I think, off of this Court's opinion in Idaho
v. Wright somewhat applies very rigorous factors to
determine reliability.
And so I think the -- the choice for a
prosecutor is not between live testimony and hearsay.  I
think when you deal with a three year old, it's a choice
between hearsay and nothing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that -- that goes to
the hearsay rule.  I mean, you could -- you could have
an exception to your -- to your hearsay rules.  But --
but how could this child ever have the intent that
Justice Sotomayor described?  Which is the test of
whether particular evidence is testimonial or not.  How
could a three and a half-year-old child have that
intent?
MR. MEYER:  I don't think he can.  And I
think, looking at this Court's emphasis in -- in both
Davis and Bryant on the declarant's purpose, if you view
it from that standpoint, and Crawford -- Crawford's
requirement that the person bear testimony, he's just
incapable of doing so.
JUSTICE  KAGAN:  Well, let's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then they can talk about
testimonial and I think we should, and I don't want to
take argument in another -- suppose that this is not
testimonial.  Suppose you prevail on that.  Isn't there
still a question as to whether or not this is hearsay
that is so unreliable that it violates the Confrontation
Clause slash -- and/or the Due Process Clause and we
remand for that?
If we -- if we rule in your favor that this
is not testimonial, that at the end of the case their
statement comes in or do we remand?  Or is it before us
to say, part two, we think this is inadmissible under
other hearsay principles that are so well settled that
it's a violation of either the Confrontation Clause or
the Due Process Clause?
MR. MEYER:  I don't think the reliability
question is one for the Confrontation Clause.  I do
think the reliability question is one for the -- the Due
Process Clause.  And so if --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And has that been
addressed here or is that still open?
MR. MEYER:  I think that's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We -- we remand for that?
MR. MEYER:  I -- I think that's still open.
And if you have a situation where the States are
designing their rules for the deliberate purpose of --
of avoiding having live witnesses come to court, a sham
rule, that would be a very arbitrary rule under the Due
Process Clause, but I don't think the Confrontation
Clause is what that was designed to address.
Certainly --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about the Due Process
Clause?  Do we -- have -- have we adopted hearsay rules
under the Due Process Clause?
MR. MEYER:  Not that I'm aware of, Justice
Scalia.  What I meant --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I thought it was up to the
States, let it in and let the jury take it for what it's
worth.  I'm not sure we've ever --
MR. MEYER:  What I meant to say -- and I
think this Court did say this in Crawford -- was that
the reliability question is one for the States and their
democratic processes.  And -- and they should have some
leeway in formulating their hearsay rules.  And so
unless the -- the hearsay rules themselves rise to the
level of a due process violation, the reliability
question as this Court has explained is not for the
Confrontation Clause.  Otherwise, I think we're
backsliding towards the Ohio v. Roberts analysis and the
constitutionalization of all hearsay rules.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Meyer, can I go back --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or of some hearsay rules.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry.  Can I -- can I go
back to what you said before in answer to Justice
Scalia?  We can all obviously agree that three year olds
don't form any kind of intent to make testimonial
statements.  But -- but that would suggest that there --
the Confrontation Clause just doesn't come into play at
all with respect to any people with diminished capacity,
without the capacity to form that kind of legal intent.
And that seems -- that seems not right to
me.  That it seems as though there ought to be some
other inquiry that substitutes for the intent inquiry
when we're talking about people with diminished capacity
in order to decide whether a statement that they make is
testimonial.
MR. MEYER:  If you disagree with my
formulation that private parties is the first step, this
Court has consistently said that there's three key
inquiries.  The intent of the declarant, I think, has
been this Court's focus, but also the intent of the
questioner, and the circumstances of the questioning.
And at the outer margins, I suppose there could be a
situation where the intent of the -- the questioner
might tip the balance.  But in this case, the Ohio
Supreme Court seemed to put all of its emphasis on the
possible speculative intent of the questioner, and I
think that's fundamentally wrong.  If the intent of the
declarant isn't to do anything other than respond to the
basic questions asked like the declarant in Bryant, like
the declarant in Davis, I don't think you have
testimonial evidence.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're forgetting --
you're forgetting the circumstances prong of it.  Were
the questions here by the interrogator for purposes of
law enforcement or were they for the purposes of the
ongoing emergency, the abuse of the child?
MR. MEYER:  Here --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So --
MR. MEYER:  I think the -- the intent from
the questioner's standpoint, the teacher was just simply
that.  And I think a helpful way to look at this,
Justice Sotomayor, is to remove this reporting
requirement and ask if the questions would be any
different.  And I submit they would not.
These are just the basic questions that a
teacher would ask when a three year old comes to school
with a bruised face.  It's a concern the teacher has for
their student and to say that that teacher is
stepping into a role of a law enforcement officer, I
think, is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, that goes to
reliability, and that goes to whatever the finder of
fact, whether they take that approach or they take
another.  But the point, I think, that Justice Kagan is
making in deciding the intent of the declarant, you have
to look at what everyone else is doing and who they are.
MR. MEYER:  Well, I think that -- it -- it
may go to reliability, but more fundamentally, it goes
to the function that these actors are -- are performing.
And if these aren't law enforcement people, if there's
no direction by the police, this is just a teacher and
student.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose this, Mr. Meyer.
Let's take the -- the diminished capacity out of the
equation.  Let's just presume a 13-year-old kid rather
than a 3-year-old.  And the 13-year-old kid comes in
with welts or bruises or whatever it is, and the teacher
says to the 13-year-old, Listen, Joe, I want to know
what happened, but I want to tell you that I'm under a
statutory reporting obligation, so everything you tell
me, I'm going to tell the police, and I'm going to write
down everything you tell me just so I can get the facts
straight.
Would you think that that is testimonial
such that it's a violation of the Confrontation Clause
if that comes into a case without the opportunity for
cross-exam?
MR. MEYER:  It -- it may be, and if I could
explain.
If both the intent of the questioner and the
intent of the declarant both acknowledge that, in some
way, this is going to the police and the circumstances
of the discussion is for the police, that's a much
closer question, and I would --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, that seems to me then,
is then -- it suggests that the way to do this is
actually more the way the S.G. suggests, that we should
just ask in every case whether there -- whether a
statement is testimonial rather than to draw the very
sharp distinctions you want us to with respect to
private parties.
MR. MEYER:  Well, I think the Solicitor
General in Ohio's opinion are -- are harmonious in that
they agree in their brief that in almost every
circumstance, a private discussion is not going to be
testimonial because it's just not for law enforcement.
And maybe the better way, if the Court agrees, is to
view it as a threshold determination before you even get
to the question of purpose.  And I would agree at the
outer margins of some of these hypotheticals, you have
to look at purpose to sort out difficult facts.
To say that, like the Ohio Supreme Court
did, we just look at the foreseeability of the statement
reaching law enforcement is fundamentally wrong.
Everything that you see in life that you might have to
testify about as a private person may make its way to
law enforcement, but that's not the intent, I would
submit, of the framers when they adopted the
Confrontation Clause.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could you remind us, the
young people who -- who heard this child's utterances,
what -- did their statements come in?  The
grandmother -- was it the grandmother, the aunt, the
social worker, and the police, what happened to their
statements?
MR. MEYER:  Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth
District Court of Appeals -- those statements did come
in at trial.  The Eighth District Court of Appeals ruled
that their admission violated Ohio evidence rule 807.
And so while they were heard by the jury, they
were -- they were not, according to the intermediate
Ohio appellate court, proper evidence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the teachers didn't
violate -- the teachers -- that was an hearsay
exception; is that right?
MR. MEYER:  The Eighth District analyzed the
teacher's statements exclusively on the Federal
constitutional question.  There was no discussion of
Ohio rule 807.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, then what -- if all
the others were -- were inadmissible under Ohio's own
hearsay rule, why wouldn't the same thing apply to the
teacher?  What's the difference between the teacher and
the social worker?
MR. MEYER:  Well, first -- first off,
Justice Ginsburg, I think this is a -- a purely Federal
constitutional question.  But if you look at -- if this
were to be remanded to the Eighth District for
consideration of that issue, you -- you would have to,
and the Eighth District would be required to look at
very specific factors that I think distinguish the
child's statement to the teachers, to those of -- the
social worker and the police the next day.
The teachers asked the questions very close
in time to when the injuries occurred.  It was within
hours.  They also asked very open-ended questions.
There were only two real questions:  Who did this?  And
what happened?  These are all factors you can look to to
assess the reliability of the statement under Ohio
evidence rule 807.
But more fundamentally, both the Eighth
District and the Supreme Court of Ohio have said as a
per se matter, these are testimonial statements and that
we disagree with.
I would ask to reserve the balance of my
time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Eisenstein, welcome.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ILANA EISENSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Ohio Supreme Court did err by viewing
the teachers here as equivalent to police.  And if I
could turn first to Justice Sotomayor's concern there, I
think that it is significant that these were teachers
and not police officers; teachers who were not acting as
surrogates for police, but in their normal, ordinary
role as care providers for this child.
Teachers aren't in the business of
prosecution.  They're not in the business of collecting
evidence, and as such, this Court can generally presume
that when they inquire of their students as to how they
got hurt, they are asking out of a concern for welfare,
safety, and out of their normal, routine role, not as a
means of collecting evidence.
It's also significant that when you take
away, you strip away that view of the teachers as
equivalent to police, the conversation viewed through
that lens takes on a very different character.  Instead
of scrutinizing each question and answer to determine
whether this is an emergency on the one hand, or whether
it is a -- a need to address a criminal violation,
instead there is a whole range of reasons why these
teachers, out of care for the student, would be asking
what happened and how the child got hurt.
And fundamentally, the type of fluid,
informal, spontaneous conversation between the teachers
and the students is far from resembling the type of core
Confrontation Clause testimonial statements.  It lacks
the type of formality, the solemnity, and it also
reflects that the teachers were addressing a present
purpose in trying to understand how this child was
injured.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what happens,
Ms. Eisenstein, really along the lines of the
hypothetical that I gave to Mr. Meyer where it's pretty
clear to both the teacher and the student that back of
that conversation, is the presence of police.  In other
words, the teacher will say, I'm under a reporting
obligation, or maybe the kid will bring it up.  If I
tell you, does that mean it's going to the police?  And
the teacher says, Yes, it does.  You know, what happens
when -- when that arises?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Justice Kagan, I think that
is a much harder case for two reasons.  One is from the
declarant's perspective, which is where I believe this
Court generally starts.  The declarant is now
recognizing that this teacher is essentially a direct
conduit to police in a way that a 3-year-old child here
certainly did not.
And secondly, the teacher is expressly
recognizing her role as, in some respects, a surrogate
for police.  Now, not in all respects.  And that's --
you know, an important point as to one of the special
concerns with prosecution and police questioning is that
there is an additional concern with the police that they
may, for one thing, shade the nature of the
conversation.  It's also a concern where there is a
level of structure and formality, that simply the
conversation would tend to resemble testimony or the
taking of evidence.
None of that would be present in this kind
of informal, spontaneous interaction between a -- a
civilian who frankly the -- the teachers who initially
questioned the student and elicited the statement that
Dee did it, did so -- did so prior to their supervisor
recognizing an obligation to call -- to call in.  And
even then, in your hypothetical, one further distinction
is that the teachers here and the obligation here was to
call social services, not police.  While it certainly
may have been foreseeable from an objective standpoint
whether there was the subjective view here --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought it was
either -- that the school teacher could notify either
the social worker or the police.
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they
can notify either.  But when the police are notified,
then the next step is for the police to call in social
services, and the first responder at the agency charged
with investigating primarily child abuse especially in
the very immediate moments, as was the case here, is the
social welfare agency, the social services agency not
the police.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just so I have it clear.
Social services, if they're selected to -- to get the
information, I assume they have the obligation to advise
the police.  Am I wrong about that?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  I -- in terms of there
is -- there is a cooperative structure, at least under
the Ohio statute.  And nationally, in these reporting
structures there's --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is it a legal requirement
in Ohio that social services report to the police?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  I'm not sure the extent,
Justice Kennedy, of the sharing of information and the
degree to which social services in this particular
statutory scheme must report all information to police.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, would I be right to
think that where there is any kind of serious injury,
police are involved as a routine matter?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Justice Kagan, I'm
not sure about that.  At least one of the amici cites
that in a majority of cases of reported child abuse, it
is social services alone who investigates the case.
Clearly, in this case, the police got involved, but I do
know that the police did not get involved until two days
later when the second social worker came to the house
and discovered a much more serious circumstance than was
presented initially at the daycare.
JUSTICE ALITO:  There can be a lot of --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.  There can be a lot of
circumstances where a -- a person seems to be under a
threat, maybe -- may have been hurt, seems to be under
a -- an ongoing threat.  Someone questions that
individual and the person who makes the statement, as
well as the person who asks the question, may have in
mind immediate safety concerns and also the possibility
of criminal prosecution.
How realistic is it to try to break that
down and determine which of the two is the primary
purpose?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  I think that is a challenge
and the test, but it's less challenging in the context
presented here where you have a -- a -- an ordinary
citizen questioning a small child.  It may be a more
difficult circumstance that the cases like Bryant and
Davis where you have police who have a duty, one of
their primary duties, to collect evidence and forward to
prosecution to -- to try to parse that out.
I think this Court can comfortably believe
that it is the hearsay rules that should govern the
interactions at issue here and not be governed by the
Confrontation Clause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if you had --
maybe this is just a specific example of what Justice
Alito is talking about, but what if you have the teacher
who did this to you, Dee, the teacher knows there's
nobody in the immediate vicinity named Dee, and then she
asks, Well, has he done this before?  I mean, is that
something that's not subject to the Confrontation
Clause?  It's not related to the immediate concerns or
immediate safety but seems to be designed to compile a
case.
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, to the
extent to which the teacher is asking that question, I
think that one of the -- the presumptions here is that
it's not to gather, to collect evidence for a case
because she's not thinking police prosecution, and
there's good reason why --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How do you know
that?  Maybe she is -- you know, we've got to protect
the child.  The way we do is to get the person who did
this locked up, so she wants to confirm who is it.
Doesn't need to know that for the immediate safety of
the child.
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, and the immediacy --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, sorry, wants
to know whether he has done it before.
MS. EISENSTEIN:  The immediacy here is not
whether -- if I'm understanding your hypothetical, not
immediate in terms of at the school, but in this
particular case, there is the immediacy that, as was the
case here, the defendant was the one who picked up the
child and took him home at the end of the day leaving
him, as it turned out, in a far worse position when the
social worker finally tracked him down.  So that is
often -- I think that's one of the motives, frankly, for
these mandatory reporting statutes is because of the
recognition that there is an urgency involved when
children -- when there is suspected abuse.  And so --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, what am I supposed
to -- what are we supposed to do if we think 50 percent
of the motivation was to comply with the statute and --
and -- and her duty as a teacher not to send this kid
home, and 50 percent was in order to fulfill the
reporting obligation to the police.  Then -- then what
do we do?
MS. EISENSTEIN:  Well, Your Honor, I think
you still have to the look at the three parts that this
Court has addressed:  the declarant, the questioner's
intent, and the circumstances.  And this Court has
looked at those in tandem, and when you look at the
perspective of the declarant, which they -- Ohio Supreme
Court, in my view, erred in ignoring, he's not going to
see his daycare teacher as an evidence collector.  And
when you look at the circumstances like the
circumstances here of a spontaneous and informal
encounter in the classroom, it has no resemblance to the
type of abuses the Confrontation Clause is meant to
address.
If there are no further questions, thank
you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Fisher?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We are not here today asking for any sort of
rule that would ban prosecutors from using statements
like LPs in criminal prosecutions.  All we are asking
for is  for the State not to be allowed to have it both
ways, introducing such evidence while at the same time
prohibiting the defense from any form of confrontation
whatsoever.  And you don't have to look any further than
the facts of this case to see the grave dangers that
such a system would present to the accuracy of criminal
prosecutions.  The only --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I'm looking at the -- the
-- the judge said this witness is not -- this child is
not competent to testify as a witness, and you've read
the transcript.  How -- how can there be a question of
cross-examining a 3-year-old?  The -- this person is
incompetent as a witness because the -- the testimony is
unreliable?
MR. FISHER:  Well, two things, Justice
Ginsburg.  Remember, first of all, the State is taking
the position, by necessity, under its own hearsay law,
rule 807, that what the State said -- I'm sorry, what
the -- what the child said when he was, in effect,
interviewed by the teacher, was particularly likely to
be trustworthy.  And so it seems to us quite impossible
for it to take the position that 6 months later the
child cannot, in the words of the Ohio evidence rule
601, quote, "relate events truly."
So we think it's utterly incompatible, but,
Justice Ginsburg --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, just let me stop
you.  Part of your answer I don't follow because one
thing is the child is asked immediately, on the spot,
close  to the time to when this occurred.  The trial is
months later, and one of the problems with 3-year-olds
is they don't remember.
MR. FISHER:  Well, that -- that -- that is
an issue.  Of course, the Court's Confrontation Clause
jurisprudence squarely holds that even if a witness has
difficulty with memory, that does not impede
confrontation or defeat the defendant's rights to
confrontation.
But I think you're also asking, you know,
what good would cross-examination do in this setting,
and so let me answer that in two ways.  First of all,
there are innumerable reasons -- and perhaps, Justice
Kennedy, when you've talked about reliability, some of
these were in your mind -- as to why we might doubt the
veracity of LP's initial statements.  The teacher
herself said, I'm not sure he understood me, she fed him
a line, is it Dee?  Is it Dee who did it?  The child,
LP, knew that his three older siblings had already been
removed from his mother's custody because she had abused
them, so he would have had an incentive and knowledge of
how the system worked when he was answering that
question.
So there are numerous reasons we might be
very concerned.  All we're saying --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, you start by
saying she fed him a line.  I understood that she asked
him who did it and he said Dee, and she didn't know what
Dee meant.
MR. FISHER:  Yeah, she said, Dee, Dee, is it
Dee who did it.  That's what I meant, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but it wasn't as
if she got Dee out of thin air.
MR. FISHER:  Fair enough.  Fair enough.
But if I could turn back to -- I think the
other thing you're asking, Justice Ginsburg, is how
would cross-examination be useful here.  And let me be
clear, all we're asking for is something; more than
nothing.  You know, the State itself, after getting the
allegations from the teacher, the social worker
testified, I had to go out and ask this child myself to
see whether this was true, to see whether it was
believable.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  May I ask this --
MR. FISHER:  That's all we want.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose I'm in State X,
not -- not Ohio.  There's a mandatory reporting duty to
the social services by the -- by the teacher, and the
same facts.  And I'm the trial judge, and this statement
is offered, and I say, does the defense want to examine
the 3-year-old or the 4-year-old, and provide some means
2 or 3 months later -- 2 or 3 months after the Dee
statement, to cross-examine the child maybe in the
clinical setting that you suggested in your brief.
Any problems with that?  What -- what if --
if we're saying what the rule should be in that kind of
situation, that kind of State, what -- what guidance can
you offer?
MR. FISHER:  I -- I think you would start
with Maryland against Craig where the Court has held
that confrontation of children can be more flexible to
accommodate child's perceptions, understandings and
abilities.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That -- that case, the
child was held competent as a witness.
MR. FISHER:  That's right.  Now, remember --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This --
MR. FISHER:  -- competency, though, is a
creature of the State's own making.  It can -- many
other States, and we've provided an amicus  brief from
three illustrative States -- Arizona, Iowa, and
Connecticut -- like many others, deem all children
competent in this setting, at least competent to give
testimony.  We think that's a much better rule and it
gets me back to Justice Kennedy's question, I believe,
which is, we think it would be perfectly acceptable to
have testimony, if necessary, and if proper findings
were made taken outside of a courtroom, perhaps even
through an expert, I think a very strong argument could
be made, if it were necessary to be made to this Court
or any other, that if by interviewing the child outside
of a courtroom in a more therapeutic setting is more
likely to be able to enable the child to tell his story
and to answer questions, then that's what confrontation
is all about.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And if -- but if that
happened, would the statement to the teacher come in?
MR. FISHER:  Yes, of course, because once
you have confrontation, then you can bring in any prior
statement, and that's the essence of our position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But by confrontation you
mean the -- you -- you have a therapeutic expert, but as
the defendant's witnesses, you're not -- I don't think
you suggested that the Court could appoint its own
expert and the defendant would be out of it.  I mean,
this is -- the way we do things in our adversary system
is you're a partisan expert, you're the defense expert.
MR. FISHER:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think
the defense would have to have some inclusion in this
questioning.  We cite an Arizona case in our brief where
a child interview specialist conducts the interview, but
she has an earpiece with the defendant's lawyer in
another room that's able to direct questions for.
Her.  So I think the defendant would have to
be participating, but I'm not sure it would be an
irreducible requirement that the defendant's lawyer be
asking the questions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher --
MR. FISHER:  And Certainly the Court --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- I want to go back to
your basic premise.  I know that you're attacking the
competency question a lot.  But what is it about the
statement that makes it testimonial?  Is it the rule
that the State -- that she's a mandatory reporter, as
the Ohio court thought?
Tell me what you think.  Is it any
out-of-court statement?  What -- what is it that makes
it testimonial?
MR. FISHER:  Well, you start with the rule
the Court laid down in Davis and repeated in Bryant,
which is:  If the primary purpose of the statement is to
establish or prove past events potentially relevant to a
criminal prosecution, then you have a testimonial
statement.
And I think a helpful way to analyze this
particular statement is to start with Justice Kagan's
hypothetical.  If the teacher had said to a student --
and, as in this case, there's nothing spontaneous about
what happens here -- pulls the student aside and says,
"You" -- says, "I need to know -- tell me what happened
and who did this so I can tell the police," I think the
other side, if -- almost conceded that that would have
to be testimonial.
But on the facts of this case, that is, in
fact, precisely what you have when you conduct a proper
objective totality of the circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:  There's -- there's an
awful -- a -- a great distance between Justice Kagan's
hypothetical and what happened here.
First of all, there's the age of the
Declarant.  Do you really think a three-year-old or a
three and a half-year-old can have any conception that
the thing that the -- that this child is saying is going
to be used in court to prosecute somebody for a crime?
MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Alito.  I don't
think it's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  So the Declarant
is out.  And then you have the teacher, and the teacher
isn't saying anything about gathering evidence for a
criminal prosecution.  I would think the first thing on
the teacher's -- I -- I don't think the teacher probably
broke it down that way.  The teacher is concerned about
the safety of this child, period.
MR. FISHER:  Can I say one more word about
the Declarant shortly?
JUSTICE ALITO:  Sure.
MR. FISHER:  And then I'll respond to you
about the teacher.
I absolutely concede that a three and a
half-year-old doesn't have sophisticated knowledge of
how the criminal justice system works, but I think a
three and a half-year-old does understand when he's
asked to -- whether somebody did something wrong to him.
Again, remember that LP's three older siblings had all
been removed from the home already for his mother's
abuse and neglect.  I think he would have understood he
was being asked --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a big assumption,
to know that this child understood the criminal process
at three years old.
MR. FISHER:  I -- Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And when -- how long
before had the --
process."
removed?
MR. FISHER:  -- I didn't say "the criminal
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- children been
MR. FISHER:  I didn't say "criminal
process."  And -- and all I want to make the point is,
is that if we're going adjust for the age of children,
we also need to adjust across the board.  And I think it
would be enough, to the extent we're looking at the
declarant's purpose, to understand that he was being
asked to make an accusation of -- of wrongdoing.
Now, turning to the teacher's purpose, I
want to talk about four things that are very important:
First, the nature of the injuries; second, the teacher's
training; third, the teacher's actions; and fourth, Ohio
law, because when you put them all together, you end up
with the effect of the teacher having quite clear
understanding of where these statements were going to be
used.
First of all, the injuries --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, I would like
to ask you, before we get to the four -- your four
points, it just seems to me that a teacher looking at a
child who has been abused, the first reaction of that
teacher is just as Justice Alito suggested:  Get that
child out of harm's way.  Don't give that child back to
a potential abuser.
So the teacher, I would think, is not
thinking about prosecution down the road:  What can I do
to assure the safety of this child right now?
MR. FISHER:  Right.  So -- so I think that
does lead me right to what I was about to try to say.
First of all, the injuries were very serious
here, and the teacher quite well knew that they didn't
occur in the classroom.  They had occurred outside the
classroom, and so the -- and one of the teachers
testified, only once --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And why --
MR. FISHER:  -- over the past --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why did the teacher
bother saying that she wanted to make sure that it
wasn't another child?
MR. FISHER:  The teacher never testified to
that, Justice Sotomayor.  The closest you have is  this
quote the State pulls from J.A. 60, where the teacher
said, "I asked whether Dee was big or little."
But the teacher, in the very same paragraph
of testimony, says the reason why she asked that
question is she was wondering whether it was an older
brother or sister.  So the teacher knew it -- it wasn't
something that occurred in the classroom.  Of course, LP
had just gotten to school.  And as I'm trying to say,
one other teacher had said, "Only once in nine years
have we seen something like this."
So, secondly, that leads me to the teacher's
training.  We've cited to the reference for educators
that Ohio gives to all teachers.  It's at page 37 of our
brief.  And the teachers are told to look out for child
abuse, they have a special duty to look out for child
abuse, and when they see it, they're supposed to -- and
I'm going to quote page 31 -- they are supposed to
gather, quote, "information which might be helpful to
establishing the cause of the abuse."
They're told to gather information that
would be helpful to establish the cause of abuse.  So
she is gathering evidence.  That's what she's told to
do.  And, quote, "the identity of the perpetrator."
Later on in that reference guide, it tells
the teacher that a local prosecutor will then decide
whether to prosecute.  And then, understanding --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But before we --
MR. FISHER:  -- that training --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- get to the prosecutor,
is this child going to be returned to this person who
the child has identified as -- it seems to me that --
that there is a concern immediately with the child's
safety, and there is also, down the road, the potential
prosecution.  But the -- if you have to divide what is
the prime purpose, it seems to me that the well-being of
the child has got to be the first thing in the mind of
the teacher.
MR. FISHER:  Justice Ginsburg --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what Justice Ginsburg
has said is completely consistent with your No. 3.  She
wants to find out the cause.  She wants to know if
there's something happening at home where this kid
should not go back home that day.
MR. FISHER:  That -- that's right.  We don't
dispute that a teacher has a protective purpose, partly,
in mind.  And I think it's absolutely natural that the
teacher would.
But the problem is, and our position is,
that is inextricably intertwined with criminal
prosecution as well.  That's what the Ohio Supreme Court
said, construing Ohio law, is that one of the chief
methods of protection is prosecution.  And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Much too late.
MR. FISHER:  Well, it might be too late.
But, Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't make it that much
different than the situation you had in Hammon involving
domestic violence.  It doesn't make it -- that much
difference in a situation you have with a police officer
or someone else trying to get a drug dealer off the
corner, to try to get a white-collar criminal to stop
embezzling money.
All of those things are ongoing crimes, but
gathering statements that help both stop the harm that's
occurring and  useful in the criminal justice
proceeding, we think, still are testimonial when that
criminal incentive and purpose is intertwined with the
protective purpose.
Even my adversary, I think, acknowledged
that even if it were nothing other than the teacher
trying to get information for protective purposes --
that is, removing LP from the custody of an abuser --
that's a civil case and civil process, which I
wholeheartedly agree would still trigger the
Confrontation Clause.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Fisher, you -- in
Davis, when  a abused woman is separated from the
abuser, she can voluntarily say, "I don't want to go
back."  She can make her own choices.
How does a child make those choices?
MR. FISHER:  I think it's -- obviously, it's
more difficult, Justice Sotomayor.  I think the true
dynamics of domestic violence don't make that choice
terribly easy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I know for many
women it's not -- they don't perceive it as a real
choice.  I'm not naysaying that.
MR. FISHER:  Right.  But there are other --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But I think there is a
difference in terms of protecting a child and protecting
an adult.
MR. FISHER:  There are differences, but
again, I would give you my drug-dealing-on-the-corner
hypothetical.  There are numerous innocent victims that
are going to be harmed by the distribution of those
narcotics until the person is taken off the street, but
we don't therefore say that when statements are gathered
to do that as quickly as possible, that they're
non-testimonial.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's suppose that everybody
who could have possibly done this to the child was
immune from criminal prosecution.  They're all
diplomats.  They all have diplomatic immunity.  Would
the teacher have done anything different?
MR. FISHER:  Perhaps not, Justice Alito.
I -- I'm just not sure what that tells us, because even
if the teacher was gathering evidence for a civil legal
process, then I think you still have a testimonial
statement.
JUSTICE ALITO:  The Confrontation Clause
applies in civil cases?
MR. FISHER:  Well, it applies in the same
way Justice Scalia was adverting to earlier.  I think if
somebody made a civil deposition, I think that -- the
Confrontation Clause doesn't apply in that setting, but
if the statement were tried to be used later in a
criminal prosecution instead of testimony --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but all these people,
they are immune from prosecution, from criminal
prosecution.  Would the teacher have done anything
different?
MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure she would --
they -- they would have.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that would be the end
of the question, isn't it?
MR. FISHER:  I don't see why it is.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Because then the teacher has
no purpose of gathering evidence for use in a criminal
prosecution.
MR. FISHER:  Well, the purpose is gathering
evidence for use in serious legal proceedings, and I
think that would be enough, if I had to make that
argument.  I don't have to make anything like that
argument.  Let me tell you now about Ohio law that's
hanging over this interaction.  And, Justice Kennedy,
you asked about the social -- the relationship between
social services and the police.  Ohio law quite
explicitly and unambiguously requires the social
services agency to share information of any possible
abuse, criminal abuse with the police, and also the
Cuyahoga County's own guidelines which we cite in our
briefs.  So there's no doubt those two things are
intertwined.
And secondly, the independent -- the
mandatory reporter statute along with Ohio Rule 807
expressly make these statements admissible in criminal
court proceedings.  So you put all this together and
it's -- it's -- I just think it's frankly undeniable
that the criminal process is hanging over this.  And so
really, the only hard problem is I think the one Justice
Ginsburg is asking is, how do you disentangle that or
how do you weigh that against the protective purpose,
which the teacher must have had as well.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, can I ask
a question that steps back a little bit?  Because it
seems to me that the strongest part of your case goes
something like this.  This is a statement that's going
to come in and is going to have great consequence in a
trial.  It's going to function as the most relevant kind
of testimony imaginable, it's an accusation.  In a case
like this, there are two potential parties that could be
accused.  Essentially, this is fingering one of them,
and it's being done by a three year old.
And -- and the question of whether that's a
particularly reliable way to choose between which of
these two potential people did it is like a little bit
scary.  And then you're not being able to question it,
you're not being able to do the things that you normally
do.
Okay.  So all of that, seems to me, that's
your strongest case.  And it seems to me that it doesn't
fit very well with the test we have and what the
questions that we're supposed to ask.  In other words,
all of what I said seems to be -- or most of what I said
at least -- seems to me kind of irrelevant to the
question that we ask under the primary purpose test and
what do we do with that lack of fit?
MR. FISHER:  I think I can answer that
question while also going back to the question I posed
before you asked the question, which is what do you do
when it's too difficult to pinpoint a purpose?  The
Court has also described in its cases the very helpful
inquiry of whether the thing -- the statement when it's
introduced in court functions as an in-court substitute
for trial testimony.  That is exactly what the
testimonial test is designed to answer and I think part
of the power of the --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You see, I think I don't
think it really does.  I mean, the way I've always
understood the primary purpose test is that it's not
whether it functions at trial as testimony or how the
jury understands it; it really is how the declarant
understands it, maybe leavened by some -- you know, what
does the questioner think and what are the
circumstances.  But it seems to be mostly about the
purpose of the person who's making the statement
which -- which fits, you know, not very well with these
kinds of concerns that you're talking about.
MR. FISHER:  Well, I think the linkage
between the two is that when a statement is made outside
the courtroom for the primary purpose of establishing
facts that might be relevant to a later criminal
prosecution, then when it's transported into the
courtroom, it does perform the substitute of trial
testimony, which is exactly why you so accurately said,
there was such power in this statement.  The prosecutor
at closing said -- just as she would have said if LP had
taken the stand -- she said when this child of three and
a half years old is asked who did it, she said Dee did
it, he said Dee did it.  And so the way the prosecutor
presented it to the jury was as a precise perfect
substitute for in-court testimony.  And it's not I think
dis -- disjointed from the fact that outside the
courtroom, the statement was made to establish a fact
relevant to prosecution.  It's difficult.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But all -- all admissible
hearsay is a substitute for in-court testimony.  So the
test you just gave us seems to me to encompass all
hearsay, doesn't it?
MR. FISHER:  No.  I think a jury would view
a stray remark to an acquaintance, as the Court has put
it, as a piece of evidence, relevant evidence perhaps,
but not as testimony.  It wouldn't make sense to
describe somebody's -- I think this Court has put it
this way -- somebody's stray remark to an acquaintance
or somebody's cry for help, later on as somebody's
testimony.  But here, this is exactly LP's testimony.
That's what it is functioning as.
And if I could turn to one other piece of
Ohio law that I think is important to have before you.
We've talked about Ohio rules of evidence.  They're
both -- both the relevant rules are in the appendix to
our red brief.  On 2A, it is Ohio rule of evidence 807
that is very unusual.  And Justice Kennedy, you were
asking earlier about this, I think.
First of all, this is a rule of evidence
that no State had any rule of evidence like this until
1982.  This was a brand new thing that came up only
after Roberts.  And the entire purpose of this law is to
gather out-of-court accusations and to use them as a
substitute for trial testimony.  So let me point you to
two aspects that show that.
First of all, the only thing that the
State -- that the hearsay law gathers up are statements,
quote, "describing any sexual abuse or physical abuse
directed against the child."  So the sole target of this
hearsay law is to get out-of-court accusations of
criminal conduct.  And then odder yet, looking at the
first sentence, it says, "An out-of-court statement made
by a child who is under 12 years of age at the time of
trial, making such an accusation," ask yourself why the
words "at the time of trial" are in this hearsay rule?
If it were designed to pluck out reliable statements
from the world, it ought to be asking some question
about the world when the statement was made.  But it's
conditioning admissibility on some fact at the time of
trial, which is still further evidence that what Ohio is
doing is gathering up these statements to use them as a
substitute for in-court testimony.
And so the pedigree of this hearsay rule in
contrast to innumerable other well-established rules
that the Court has dealt with in the -- in the past show
the problem here.  And even Justice Thomas has talked in
his separate writings about evade -- you know, a State
system that would evade the confrontation right.  If
there's ever a State system that would evade the
confrontation right, it's taking this rule and then
coupling it with Ohio rule 601, which automatic -- which
presumes that all children under 10 are incompetent to
testify.
So it's telling the State you can -- you can
gather up selectively these out-of-court accusations,
using the reporter requirement, teacher training, all
the rest, and then you can go into court and introduce
those statements and at the same time completely bar the
defense from any form of cross-examination whatsoever.
The defense has no right to compulsory process.  He has
nothing.
And Justice Kagan, you asked about the facts
of this case, and this is where I was speaking at the
beginning, I don't know if you could have a more vivid
example of the true danger of a wrongful conviction than
the facts of this case, whereas the Ohio court of
appeals said the only direct evidence are LP's
statements.
And LP is found incapable of relating true
events.  And the circumstances under the statement --
under the making of the statement that I described give
you great -- I hope would give the Court great pause
before condoning a system.  And I want to emphasize that
word "system" that would allow convictions like this.
Because you don't have to look further than the back of
our red brief where we reference the -- the Texas
attorney general's own manual that it's issued to
teachers.
Under Texas, they already have the rule that
in effect Ohio is asking for here.  Statements that are
made to social workers and police officers are deemed
inadmissible.  But statements first made to teachers are
not.  And so what does the Ohio attorney general's
office tell its teachers?  Please gather up as much
accusatory evidence as you possible -- as you can -- as
is possible; otherwise, important testimony might be
lost.  So you have already a system set up for
prosecution by out-of-court statement -- out-of-court
accusation.
And that is exactly what the Confrontation
Clause is designed to -- to prohibit.  And I -- believe
me, I -- I understand the Court when it gets down into
the weeds of the primary purpose test and says to
itself, boy, it's really hard to -- sort of looking in a
vacuum to ask what is the primary purpose here?  But if
you have that difficulty, draw the lens back a little
bit and ask yourself whether this prosecution comports
with anything relating to the spirit of the
Confrontation Clause.
I submit to you, I just don't see how it
can.  Let me put the point another way.  I know that,
obviously, in some of the more recent decisions applying
the Crawford case, some of the Justices on the Court
have developed some misgivings about the full breadth of
that decision.  But I -- I want to really forcefully
tell you this is not the case to cut back on Crawford.
If you applied the old Roberts regime, it
would be an absolute lay-down for me and my client
because of the unreliability of the statements Justice
Kennedy has noted.
So it's not Crawford v. Roberts that's
driving the discomfort here.  I really think that if
anything is driving discomfort here, it's the discomfort
we have with putting this young child on the stand, and
for --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but isn't -- but
doesn't that indicate that the testimonial inquiry is
somewhat -- somewhat awkward and formalistic?
MR. FISHER:  No, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And -- there's -- just to
follow up, it's almost the same one, that there are
States in which every citizen has a -- has a duty to
report abuse; is that not correct?
MR. FISHER:  That is correct.  It's not
Ohio, but it is correct.  But we don't rest our case
solely or even primarily on the mandatory reporting
requirement.  There's the whole constellation of other
facts, involving the injuries, involving the teacher's
training, involving Ohio law, the way it's written and
the like that -- that make us far different than any
other ordinary mandatory reporting.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did we -- I'm going to
use the primary purpose test at all.  Maybe it doesn't
fit as has been suggested, but what of the information
that a few of the briefs conveyed, that in most of these
cases, the abuser is not criminally tried.  There is an
attempt to provide for the safety of the child and maybe
there is family counseling, but in most cases -- most
cases, a criminal prosecution is not waiting at the end
of the road.
MR. FISHER:  Let me say two things, Justice
Ginsburg.  First, that's because most cases don't
involve injuries as serious as this.  My client got
30 -- almost 30 years in prison because of the
seriousness of the injuries here.  And so, I don't think
there was any -- any possibility this wasn't going to be
a criminal prosecution.  And, in fact, the Cuyahoga
County guidelines that we cite tell social workers to --
to divide up cases between the really serious ones and
the less serious ones, so criminal prosecution is the
really serious one.
But even if -- even if I took your premise
to apply even on facts like this, imagine a State that
said, most drug cases we're going to put into a
divert -- a noncriminal diversion program.  I can't
imagine, then, that it would take the -- that that would
take statements alleging drug use or drug possession or
drug dealing out of the realm of the Confrontation
Clause, because everybody would know that criminal
prosecution was still intertwined with that system.
And I think that's where I would leave you,
is that if you struggle with the primary purpose test
here, look at the overall setting and look at the way
this is used at trial.
JUSTICE BREYER:  To be fair to you, I don't
think the misgivings come so much from -- they come from
the fact that you don't want -- I don't want to see the
Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions to the
hearsay rule, and therefore you have to draw lines.
This case is tangential.  This case involves tragedy
either way.  It's a tragedy to abuse children.  It's a
tragedy to put the wrong person in jail on the basis of
unreliable testimony.
Now, with that kind of tragedy, it seems
tailor-made for the Due Process Clause, allowing States
to experiment, allowing the bar to work out some of the
things you say.  What's at issue here to me, is the
problem of not having that Confrontation Clause swallow
up the 30 exceptions which are necessary in many
instances for the justices of a trial.  That's at a
general level, since you asked.
MR. FISHER:  Yeah.  No, please, I'm glad.
Justice Breyer, that, I hope, gets me back to rule 807,
though, which is that  shows the extreme unusual
nature of the hearsay law except at issue here.  So
we're not doing anything that would touch other hearsay
laws; those could be other Crawford cases down the line.
So you have a highly unusual hearsay law
designed to evade the Confrontation Clause.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But what you've -- but
you haven't raised a Due Process argument.
MR. FISHER:  We haven't pressed that and we
hope --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  This is not a
longstanding, traditional exception to the hearsay rule.
MR. FISHER:  No, it's not.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Whether this
would or would not be an excited utterance is another
issue altogether under -- depending on how strict the
State defines that.  But that's also part of why you're
fighting the unreliability here, but you're not raising
the right challenge.
MR. FISHER:  No --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is this really
Confrontation Clause.
MR. FISHER:  It's really Confrontation
Clause for all the reasons I've said about the objective
purpose of the statement made outside the courtroom to
partly aid the criminal process in the way it was used
in the court.
And, Justice Breyer, I agree with you these
are tragic cases.  All I'm asking for is that before you
put somebody away for 30 years, give them at least what
the State has.  The State itself is already conducting
interviews of these children in advocacy centers or with
their own personnel.  Give the defense at least the same
opportunity.  It's no additional -- it's a marginal
additional effort and trauma on the child.  And we do a
long ways to protect against these kind of wrongful
prosecutions and convictions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Meyer, you have five minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW E. MEYER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MEYER:  Thank you.
One key point of disagreement I have with my
colleague is the issue of Ohio law.  And specifically,
Ohio law does not impose upon any mandatory reporter a
duty to investigate.  And if it did, I think that would
be a fundamentally different analysis.  Because the
kinds of abuses this Court has told us the Confrontation
Clause was designed to address, are government abuses.
And where you have a situation where mandatory
reporters, who are simply people who interact with
children in their day-to-day lives, are required to
report to the social services agency what they learn
just going about their business, that is fundamentally
different than, let's say, the Marion magistrates who
are going out collecting affidavits and submitting them
in criminal trials as evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So in Ohio the teacher
satisfies his or her duty by just phoning social service
and then, "There's a kid with terrible bruises in my
class, good-bye."  That's it?
MR. MEYER:  That is it.  Now, the issue came
up, and I think it was pointed out, that you can also
satisfy your duty by reporting the -- the abuse to the
police.  The statute then, in turn, requires the police
to notify children's services.  So we have a regime
that's set up to protect children.
And I'd also point out that in many of
Ohio's 88 counties, you don't have a children's services
agency set up to go out and deal with these emergencies,
let's say, in the middle of the night.  You call the
person who is equipped to deal with it, and that's going
to be the sheriff most often.
In response to the indication that the
accusation is the most important component of this, I
would say certainly the -- there was an accusatorial
element in the declarant in Davis.  Even the victim,
Covington, in Bryant as he lay dying, I think, could
understand that, when he's telling the police that
so-and-so shot me, there's an accusatorial element
there.  The Dutton case, which this Court referenced in
Crawford, and the statement by the prisoner, "If it
hadn't been for that son of a bitch, Alex Evans, we
wouldn't be here," that is an accusatorial statement.
But that does not transform it magically
into testimonial statements for purposes of the
Confrontation Clause.  Ohio's teachers, I think, are
horrified to learn that the Supreme Court of Ohio used
them no different than cops when they're talking to
their child -- the children in their classrooms.  That
is fundamentally not the type of analysis that -- that
any court should be conducting when it comes to
testimony -- whether statements are testimonial.
So in closing, I would reiterate my prayer for reversal
and point out that this three-year-old child, when these
bruises were being described to his teacher, is just
fundamentally unlike the -- the treasonous conspiracies
of unknown scope aimed at killing or overthrowing the
king, which is the Sir Walter Raleigh case.  It's just
not the same.
Thank you.
