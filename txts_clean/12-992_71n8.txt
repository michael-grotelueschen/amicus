Gravel Company v. The Central Pension Fund.
Mr. Himmelfarb.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Thank, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Twenty-five years ago, in Budinich v. Becton
Dickinson, this Court unanimously held that a decision
leaving unresolved the request for attorneys' fees is a
final decision subject to immediate appeal.  The fee
awarded in Budinich was authorized by a statute that the
same rule applies to fees awarded under a contract.
In concluding otherwise, the First Circuit
below held that Budinich may or may not apply to
contractual attorneys' fees, depending upon whether the
fee award in a particular case is deemed part of the
merits or not.
The First Circuit's rule is inconsistent
with each of the core aspects of Budinich, which is
likely why Respondents no longer defend it.  Whereas
Budinich held that its rule applies regardless of
whether the fees are deemed merits or nonmerits, that
distinction is the very foundation of the First
Circuit's rule.
And whereas Budinich emphasized the need for
clarity, consistency, predictability, and practicality
in jurisdictional rules, and thus, for a uniform and
bright-line rule in this context, the First Circuit's
rule is case-specific, fact-intensive, abstract, and
hard to apply; in short, the very antithesis of a
uniform and bright-line rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  As I understand it,
the -- the First Circuit position is not what's being
defended; instead, it's the Eleventh Circuit's position,
which is a bright-line.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, it's not a
bright-line rule, Justice Ginsburg.  It's a different
rule, but it's still a case-specific, fact-intensive
rule.  The line is just drawn in a different place.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought it was that, if
it's statutory, Budinich controls; if it's contractual,
then you -- you treat it as though it's a question of
damages.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right.  It's not a
bright-line rule in a number of respects.  One of them
is that, like the First Circuit, it relies on a
distinction between merits and nonmerits fees, more
specifically on what Respondents call damages fees, as
opposed to cost fees.  And Budinich says it's
inappropriate to make this sort of case-by-case
determination of whether a particular fee award is
authorized --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I think that's not
right, Mr. Himmelfarb.  I mean, the rationale that they
use might have something to do with an underlying
merits/nonmerits determination, but the test is just
does the statute authorize it or is it authorized by
contract?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right.  And we would say
two things about that.  One of them is sort of a
practical point, a point about administrability.  The
one is an analytical point, a point about logic or, more
specifically, illogic.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, just focusing on
whether that's a bright-line rule or not, in other
words, whether it's easy to apply or not, I thought you
were suggesting whatever is true about whether it makes
any sense or whether it's conceptually justifiable, I
thought you were suggesting it wasn't easy to apply.
And it does seem to me that once you say
contractual provisions will be treated this way,
statutory provisions will be treated that way, that's
not a hard rule to implement.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  We actually think it is a
hard rule to implement or at least there are going to be
cases where it's hard.  And, in fact, this case is an
example.  In this case, in the notice of motion for
attorneys' fees of cost -- this is on page 74 of the
Joint Appendix -- Respondents invoked only a statute,
ERISA.  In the supporting affidavit, they invoked the
statute and a contract.
The district court interpreted their
request, apparently, to be made under statute and
awarded fees invoking only the statute.  Then the First
Circuit viewed this case as one in which fees were
requested and awarded under a contract, and that was the
basis for its jurisdictional holding that's now on
review before this Court.
So this case is an example of one where it's
not always clear.  There are many cases where a statute
in some capacity and a contract in some capacity are
both in play, where you potentially have two competing
attorneys' fees provisions, one statutory and one
contractual.
They could be identical in all relevant
respects, and yet, in one of them, the party happens to
happens to invoke the contractual provision, and under
Respondents' rule, you would have two different
outcomes.
But what we think is really fundamentally
wrong with Respondents' position is that, at the end of
the day, it's just the opposite of the rule that this
Court adopted in Budinich.  Budinich recognized that
statutory fees can be viewed as merits or non-merits,
depending upon the particular statute or decision law.
Contractual fees are precisely the same.
Some contractual fees, depending upon the
contract's provision and the relevant decision law,
could be viewed as costs.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't this view
contradict 54(d)(2)?  What do we do with that?  If we
accept your analysis that we should superimpose just a
flat rule that all fees are not --
MR. HIMMELFARB:  54(d)(2) simply requires
that, in the case in which fees are sought by motion,
they have to be made -- the motion has to be made,
within 14 days, unless the fees are such that they are a
part of the cause of action and they are submitted to a
jury.
54(d) doesn't say that, in a case where
the fees are made by motion, but they should have been
submitted to a jury, there's some other appealability
rule.  It simply says that, in a case where a fee
request is made by motion, it has to be made within 14
days.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I -- I'm a little
confused.  So is your rule that if a fee is made by --
if a request is made by motion, whether it's contractual
or statutory, that that then becomes a separate judgment
and not a part of the final merits?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's absolutely right.
That's what Budinich says.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  So you're
not blocking a party from coming in and saying, you've
got a -- how will a union know or a claiming party know
whether or not you'll come back later and say you should
have given it to the jury?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, our submission is
that it doesn't matter whether it should have been given
to a jury or not.  What matters is whether it was given
to the jury.  And let me just say, parenthetically, the
general practice in Federal courts, as I understand it,
is that fee requests are not given to juries.
At the very least, the amount of the fee is
almost invariably determined by courts, not by juries.
And, in fact, courts have held that there's no Seventh
Amendment right to have juries determine the amount of
attorneys' fees, and this makes sense when you think
about it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It does make sense.
We held that or just circuit courts?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  No, lower courts have held
that.  This makes sense because most attorneys' fees
request, very much including the fee request in this
case, go up to the very end of the case.  And by
definition, when the jury still has the case -- you
know, the meter is still going, and it's quite
difficult, indeed, it's impossible, for a jury to decide
what the fee award should be when there are more fees to
follow.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what do we do with
the auditor's fees, which aren't traditional attorneys'
fees, and those hadn't been decided in this case?  So
why is the judgment, nevertheless, final, putting aside
the attorneys' fees question?  Why is the merits final
when the auditor's fees weren't?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Our -- our submission is
that auditor's fees are treated, just like attorneys'
fees for purposes --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, that's the problem.
I mean, put Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor
together.  I don't see any problem that I can see in
deciding whether a case is contractual or statutory
because the judge has to decide.
If there's a contractual part of it, if he's
going to deny it, he has to decide the contractual part.
So if it's both, it's both.  It counts as contractual.
The Eleventh Circuit rule applies.
On the other hand, if we don't -- if we
don't follow the Eleventh Circuit, we get into the
question of, well, what about auditor's fees, what about
witness fees, what about prelitigation attorneys' fees,
what about some language in the contract that seems to
cover attorneys' fees, but we're not certain, et cetera?
And before you know it, that could even
shade into the merits.  And so the simple thing to do is
just say what the Eleventh Circuit said.  So we have one
argument, that yours isn't really an administrative
objection, and you have the other argument that, if we
follow you, there's a big administrative problem.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, auditor's fees or any
other sort of nonattorney professional fees or expert
fees or anything else, we think, are not a problem
because the truth of the matter is that that category of
fees, as a general matter, just like attorneys' fees,
are fees that are incurred in attempting to enforce the
underlying right or to defend against the enforcement of
the underlying right.
They are not some measure of the value of
the underlying issue.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So all we're
going to have is a contract which, in its discussion of
the merits, makes some general mention of fees.  And
now, what we have is the initial notice of appeal has to
be within 30 days of the judgment, when the fee issue is
not yet resolved, and you're going to try to separate
the merits from -- I mean, some -- you see what I'm
worried about, what Justice Sotomayor was worried about,
that these things will be very messy when you get to
many contracts.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  I don't -- I don't think
so.  I mean, just think about this from a common sense
point of view.  This was a case where there was a bench
trial.  At the conclusion of the bench trial, the
parties, including Respondent, submitted proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which they
said, judge, you should find Petitioners liable,
plaintiffs below, and you should award us damages.
Then a few weeks later, they separately
submitted something that they call "Motion for
Attorneys' Fees and Costs," in which they requested
attorneys' fees, costs, and auditor's fees.
All of those things -- I think the fact that
they did it that way just confirms what I said before,
which is that, as a general proposition, at least -- you
know, expert fees, nonprofessional -- nonattorney
professional fees are not the sorts of things that you
get to enforce the underlying right --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what if they hadn't done it
that way?  What if they had listed those fees in their
complaint, and what if they had argued for them as part
of the bench trial?  Are you saying something would
depend on that?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  I'm not saying that.  All
I'm saying is that this is the way people -- litigants
generally think about these two different categories of
things, and it's understandable that this is the way
they did it.  If they had requested auditor's fees and
if they had requested -- you know, attorneys' fees that
were incurred at the very beginning, before the
complaint was filed, in connection with their proposed
findings of fact and conclusions of law, then it may
well be that the judge would have awarded them -- you
know, with the ordinary damages, and they wouldn't have
that argument available to them.
But they chose to include them, as I say, I
think, because their intuition, if nothing else, was
that these audit fees and these attorneys' fees -- even
attorneys' fees incurred before the litigation
commenced, are attorneys' fees, in the same sense that
the kinds of things that courts decide separately from
the merits.
As far as the so-called prelitigation
attorneys' fees are concerned, this is the fallback
argument -- the second argument that Respondents make in
their brief.  And the argument is that, because some of
the fees requested were incurred before the complaint
was filed -- or at least at some remote time before the
complaint was filed, what you have here is not covered
by Budinich because the rule articulated in Budinich is
that it applies to attorneys' fees for the litigation in
question, for the litigation at hand, fees attributable
to the case.  And that's the language that Respondents
rely on in our fallback argument.
What we would say in response to that is
that what Budinich meant by that language is that its
rule does not apply to a case where the attorneys' fees
are for a prior case, as opposed to being attributable
to the case, meaning the case in which the fees are
incurred.
So if you have a dispute between a lawyer
and a prior -- a former client, over fees, the former
client hasn't paid fees, and there's a lawsuit to
recover the fees, Budinich won't apply in that
situation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wrote it.  I don't think
that's what I meant.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It would be a strange --
strange thing to worry about, it seems to me.  It's a
fairly infrequent situation, isn't it?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, yes, of course, it
is.  And not only is it infrequent, the situation you
have here that gives rise to the question presented in
this case just wouldn't arise there because, if you're
talking about a lawsuit by a lawyer against a former
client to recover fees owed, by definition, the fees are
known and quantifiable before the suit is filed.
So you would imagine that, in that case,
there'd be a liability determination and the award of
damages, which in that case just happened to be
attorneys' fees, and the case would be over, and this
situation wouldn't present itself.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why would the case
be over?  Presumably, you incurred attorneys' fees,
seeking to recover the attorneys' fees.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, it would -- it would
depend on what the -- you know, the contract between the
lawyer and the client said, Mr. Chief Justice.  I
suppose it's possible that you could have a contractual
fee provision that says, we get fees for attempting to
recover our fees, and then, you’re right, you would have the
Budinich situation, but it would be as to the fees
generated in attempting to enforce the underlying right,
which is exactly what you have here.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think the district
court here relied solely on the contract -- on the
contract and on ERISA, or just on ERISA, in awarding
these fees?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  It appears to us, Justice
Alito, that the district court relied only on the
statute.  That was the only -- only thing that the court
cited.  The court didn't cite the contract.  It was the
court of appeals that sort of reconceptualized it as a
case in which fees were awarded under a contract.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I can see how, if you're
talking about lawyers' fees pretrial and lawyers' fees
at the trial, that they would be interconnected, that it
would be improper for the jury to hear about either, if
there were a jury.
But -- what about the auditor's fees?  Can
you -- is there an argument that would support your
side, but I'm not sure there is the argument, that
auditor fees are also -- have an effect on what the
attorneys' fees are or should be.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Or are they really quite
compartmentalized?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  No, we say auditor's fees
should be treated exactly the same way.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but I'm asking if
there's a relation between the two.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Sure, there are.  I mean,
oftentimes, auditors or any other sorts of experts are
retained to -- you know, assist the lawyers in
litigating the case or investigating.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And to the extent auditors
have done a certain amount of work, then there should be
no duplicative attorneys' fees, so the judge considers
both together.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right.  I think that's
right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but I thought,
with respect to pre-litigation attorneys' fees, you said
you can treat those differently because they're set and
determined.  You know what they are.  It would seem to
me, in most cases of an auditor's report, that's also
true.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  No.  I want to be clear
about this because it's an important distinction.  What
I was talking about was a case where a lawyer sues a
former client, as an example, where the fees were
incurred in a prior case -- in a different case,
involving a different dispute.
And in the case in which the fees are
sought, that is the dispute, that's the case.  What I
would distinguish from that situation is the situation
here, where lawyers are retained, auditors are retained,
to resolve an underlying dispute.  The underlying
dispute is whether contributions are owed to union
benefit funds.
The lawyers and auditors investigate the
case.  They prepare to litigate it.  They research
potential claims.  They draft the complaint.  They file
a demand -- write a demand letter to the other side.
They're unable to resolve it, so they file a lawsuit.
It's all one case.  And the fact that some of the fees,
whether they're attorney fees or auditor fees, were
incurred before the complaint was filed is neither here
nor there.
I mean, the -- the contractual provision at
issue here authorizes that recovery.  Everybody agrees
with that.  And the truth of the matter is that, even
under the narrowest imaginable attorneys' fees
provision, surely, some fees incurred before the
complaint was filed would be recoverable, unless you had
a really odd-ball statute or contractual provision,
which made --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And the trial court needs
to know the amount of the pretrial fees and the -- and
what they were incurred for, so that he doesn't give
duplicative recovery when he provides for attorneys'
fees for the course of the trial.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right, but if -- if
Respondents' fallback position were correct, what that
would mean is that, in literally every case, contractual
or statutory, you would have to -- litigants and courts
alike -- would have to search through the request for
attorneys' fees, which are generally voluminous -- the
one in this case runs to more than a hundred pages in
the Joint Appendix; this was a three-day trial -- to
decide are there any fees here that are "nonlitigation"
fees?
And I put "nonlitigation" in quotation
marks.  And that -- that has two consequences.  One is
it requires sifting through this voluminous record, and
the second is it requires making a very difficult kind
of evaluative judgment about whether this particular
pre-complaint fee is -- you know, a "merit" – and I put
that in quotation marks, also -- fee or a "nonmerits"
fee.
If it's drafting a complaint, maybe that's a
nonmerits fee, but if it's -- you know, four months
before the complaint was filed, and it doesn't have to
do with any drafting of a pleading, there's some way to
conceptualize that as a merits fee.  We just think it's
completely --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So articulate, again,
for me your rule.  Would it go something like this:  To
the extent that a party leaves attorneys' fees for after
trial, it then -- that's a separate judgment that will
not run the finality of the prior judgment?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  I mean --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but you're
proposing not to estop parties if they choose to put
this issue to a jury?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you’re saying, if
they don't, then they have to treat it as the judgment
that comes out of the contract dispute as final, the
other aspects of it.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's right.  That's
absolutely right.  If there is a decision in a case that
leaves unresolved everything except attorneys' fees,
Budinich applies no matter what --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Because, now, you're saying
not just attorneys' fees, also auditor's fees.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  That's true.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And what about witness
fees?  Experts?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, witness fees are
costs, and there's no question --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  Experts, experts,
the payment of an expert.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  If -- if expert witness
fees are recoverable under the applicable statute --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  It's a
contract.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right, under the applicable
statute or contract, and everybody who --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So expert witnesses are --
are also, so we're talking about Budinich'ing or
whatever, you want to do that for the attorneys' fees,
auditor's fees, expert witness fees, experts who helped
the attorney, but don't testify, what's the rule of what
we're putting in here and what we're not?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Well, the rule is what I
was suggesting before, which is that, if these are fees
that are incurred in an effort to vindicate the
underlying right, then they're covered by Budinich.  And
that's -- I think that's what Budinich is getting at.
But if, instead, they are sort of -- it's a
standalone case -- and Justice Scalia, I think, may
disagree with me about this -- but if it's a standalone
case where you hire an auditor and you don't pay the
auditor's fees and then the auditor sues you for the
fees, that's like the example of the lawyer who didn't
get his fees paid and sues his former client.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what about a different
kind of standalone case?  I mean, suppose that the fund
had actually paid up what it was due prior to the
litigation, but -- but there was still all these
outstanding costs that had been incurred for auditors
and all of that, and -- and a suit was brought just
involving those?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  I think, probably, Budinich
would not apply in that situation because it would be
like the case I was talking about before, where a lawyer
sues a former client, and the case is just the case
about fees.
I also think, though, as with the case of a
lawyer suing a former client, the situation is unlikely
to arise, at least under this contractual fee provision
because, by definition, in your hypothetical, you would
know what the fees were at the time you filed the case.
Presumably, the judgment would be, if it was
a judgment for the funds, yes, you're entitled to
recover costs, and here's what the costs are, end of
case.  You wouldn't have this separate pending request
for attorneys' fees.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Himmelfarb, if --
if I think that we should aim for the rule that trips up
the fewest lawyers, what rule would that be?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  I mean, I just think that's
absolutely our rule.  It's the Budinich rule.  The rule
we're advocating says, if you have a case and the -- the
merits of the case are decided, liability is determined,
damages are awarded, but there's a pending request for
attorneys' fees, which may or may not include other
types of related professional fees, and you want to
appeal that initial decision, you have to file a notice
of appeal within 30 days.
Under either the First Circuit's rule or the
Eleventh Circuit's rule, you are going to trip up a lot
of people because they may guess wrong, and they may
think, I don't have to file a notice of appeal because
this is a, quote, "merits," end quote, decision and if
it turns out they were wrong, and it's easy to think
they might be because this is such a sort of -- you
know, esoteric kind of distinction, what's a merits fee
and what's not, you're going to get people tripped up
under either the First Circuit's or the Eleventh
Circuit's rule.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So on auditor's fees or
anything that might possibly be viewed as falling into
the same category as attorneys' fees, you can wait.
That would trip up the fewest lawyers; is that right?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  You -- you can't wait if
you want to -- if you want to appeal the initial
decision, if there's a pending request --
JUSTICE ALITO:  No, right.  But -- but if
you don't -- you can wait and contest those things at a
later time when you file -- when you appeal from the
attorneys' fees?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right.  You would have, in
effect, two separate appeals if you wanted to appeal the
attorneys' fees decision.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You would argue to the
contrary, no, that a rule that says wait till the end of
everything that needs to be decided in the case, that's
the finality rule, and that's the idea behind the
finality rule.
MR. HIMMELFARB:  Right, I mean, the -- the
relevant statutory provision is Section 1291 of Title
28, which speaks of final decisions.  And what a final
decision is under that statute is a decision that either
leaves nothing else to be resolved or leaves other
things to be resolved, but the only other things that
are left to be resolved are collateral to the merits.
And the holding of Budinich is that, as a
general matter, attorneys' fees are collateral to the
merits and that, even when they are not, as a matter of
the law that authorizes them, in the interests of
certainty and predictability and uniformity, you should
treat them as if they are.
So Budinich has already held that, in this
circumstance, the final decision is entered when the
initial decision is entered, and the attorneys' fees are
collateral, no matter how they're characterized.  It
seems to us it would require a very compelling case to
have a different rule, just because of the source of
authority --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no.  The words that
make your point, I think, not absolutely obvious were
when you said, "which may or may not involve other kinds
of fees."  Now, at that point, I'm thinking, well, if we
follow your rule, there might be quite a lot of
litigation going on about those words, "may or may not."
If you follow the opposite rule, we've got a
clear exception for statutory attorneys' fees and
nothing else.  All right.  So -- so do you want to add
anything?
MR. HIMMELFARB:  I'm not entirely sure I'm
following the question, but if the concern is about the
presence of fees other than attorneys' fees, for
example, auditor's fees or economist's fees or what have
you, I mean, keep in mind, the same -- the same problem
would arise under a statutory fee award.
Perhaps the most common statutory
authorization for fees, at least in the Federal system,
is Section 1988 of Title 42, which is sort of a
catch-all.  It applies to 1983 actions.  It authorizes
an award of expert fees.
So if you had a straightforward Budinich
situation, where you have a statutory fee award -- say,
it's a 1983 action -- surely, Budinich applies to 1988
requests for fees, and 1988 itself authorizes an award
of expert fees.
So it seems to us you can't have a different
rule for contracts if you -- if you accept our -- if you
reject their principal submission, which is that contracts
should be treated differently from statutes.
I'd like to reserve my remaining time for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Feldman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FELDMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
There are two principles that, I think,
resolve this case.  The first one is that all damages
claims, no matter how small or large, have to be
resolved before a judgment is final under Section 1291.
Although, occasionally, Petitioners have suggested that
the size of the award somehow makes a difference, I
don't think the Court has any basis to depart from that
long-settled rule.
The second is that, as this Court itself has
held in the Vaughan Distilling case -- I'm sorry, in the
Fleischmann Distilling case and the Vaughan v. Atkinson
case, attorneys' fees that are sought under a contract
are damages.  They are sought as damages.  They are
indistinguishable from any other kind of contract
damages that are sought.
When parties --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In a case with a jury,
would you submit the question of the amount of
attorneys' fees to the jury?
MR. FELDMAN:  There -- you know, there is
conflicting authority on that, but I would agree with my
friend.  The general rule is you do have to -- when
there's a jury, submit whether you get the fees to the
jury or not.  The amount then --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Your answer
was, I'm sure, clear, but I didn't get it.
MR. FELDMAN:  I'm sorry.  You do submit
whether or not you get the fees to the jury.  The amount
of the fees -- frequently waits later for practical
reasons.  It's a long history of that's the way it's
been litigated, it’s probably the way it was done in
1791.  It doesn't create a Seventh Amendment problem.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, that seems, to me,
to indicate that there's a final judgment when -- when
the verdict is rendered.
MR. FELDMAN:  You have to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If the fees are left,
it's just a collateral matter as to what the fees will
be.
MR. FELDMAN:  I don't think it's because
it's a collateral matter.  What you submit -- you do
have to submit to the jury whether or not you get the
fees.  That question has to go to the jury, and that's
because it is part of the merits.
When people get together and make a contract
and they decide about their mutual obligations and the
consequences of somebody breaching that contract, they
are defining what the merits of a contract claim is that
will --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Feldman, what about --
what about a statute that says the plaintiff shall
recover, as part of his damages, attorneys' fees?  What
do we do with that, for purposes of 1291?
MR. FELDMAN:  I think what the courts have
dealt with that, quite clearly, in Budinich --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Absolutely clearly?
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So it is clear, is it not,
that the criterion is not whether it is part of damages?
MR. FELDMAN:  No, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because, if that were the
criterion, Budinich would have come out the other way.
MR. FELDMAN:  I disagree.  I think that what
Budinich said is we're going to -- Budinich was based
on -- the question it was asking was are these merits
or nonmerits determinations.  And then it -- but what it
said is, because of the particular place this comes in,
in litigation, we have to deal with this on a -- as a
categorical matter, and it doesn't matter --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Essentially, it doesn't
matter whether it's merits or nonmerits.
MR. FELDMAN:  I don't -- that's actually not
what the Court said.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  For purposes of -- for
purposes of this rule.
MR. FELDMAN:  What the Court said --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know how else you
can read it.
MR. FELDMAN:  What the Court said several
times in Budinich, they said -- the Court said, for
example, it shouldn't turn upon the characterization of
the fees or whether the fees are deemed to be one or the
other because the Court had decided that it's
indisputable that, as a general matter, statute -- and I
think it's only true of statutes, that statutory fees --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  "As a general matter."
But -- but the case acknowledges that that's not always
true, and the holding says it doesn't matter when it's
not true, they will still be treated as -- as separate,
even though they are damages, we're not going to treat
them as damages.
MR. FELDMAN:  And as the -- what the Court
was -- it was correct in -- with respect to statutory
fees that was at issue in Budinich, the Court was quite
correct in saying those -- it is indisputable that
those, as a general matter, are not a part of the
merits.  They are costs, which have never been seen as
part of the merits.
But that's not true and never has been, of
contractual damages, and this Court, itself, has viewed
contractual damages --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why isn't it true?  I
mean, assume a contract which just says, if we go to
litigation, the prevailing party will pay fees, in much
the same way that a statute does.  And now, assume lots
of contracts basically have that provision as their
attorneys' fees provision.
Why wouldn't we just say -- you know,
whether -- whether the source of the law is a contract
or a statute makes no difference; they are essentially
doing the exact same thing?
MR. FELDMAN:  I mean, I wouldn't say that --
they are not doing the same thing.  And also, the source
of law is important because what -- the whole point is
that the law has always been that statutes define what
court costs are.
Court costs are basically a narrow segment
of the money that people pay each other under certain
circumstances.  They are defined by 28 USC 1920, by this
Court's Rule 43, and by the fee-shifting statutes, now
we know, after Budinich.
Okay.  But the -- that's what statutes do.
And in fact, the Court said, in United States v. Idaho,
in defining costs, costs are things that are provided
for by rule, and I'm sure the Court intended statute,
also.  But --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, but Budinich
acknowledged that some of these fees are not costs.  It
acknowledged that.
MR. FELDMAN:  I would actually think what
Court what Budinich acknowledged was that they are labeled
different ways.  They are deemed or characterized in
different ways.  The Court never actually said that they
weren't.  But they did -- the Court did say it was
operating on a categorical basis --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand the
difference between "deeming" and "being."  When the
statute deems it to be costs, they are costs.  They are
costs.
MR. FELDMAN:  The Court felt, as a
categorical matter, that -- and quite correctly, that
statutory fees are costs, but as a categorical matter,
contractual fees are not costs.
When parties agree in a contract that one is
going to pay another a certain amount of money in the
event of some -- something happening related to a
breach, that's what defines the -- the damages that are
due in a subsequent --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But we said in Budinich
that they are costs, even when the statute makes clear
that they are damages.  I mean, we're saying it doesn't
matter what the statute says, and I don't see why it
should matter what the contract says.
MR. FELDMAN:  I don't think it does matter
what the contract says.  It just matters that it's in a
contract because there's no history -- while there's a
history of statutes defining what costs are, there's no
history at all of contracts defining things that are
obligations between the parties, but that are not part
of the merits of a subsequent dispute.
JUSTICE ALITO:  If we have a different rule
for statutory fees and contractual fees, will we have
problems in some cases -- and maybe this is an
example -- in determining whether an award of fees was
based on a contract or based on the statute?
Here, the district judge's opinion on fees
says a lot about ERISA, and I don't see any references
to the contract in there.
MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't think that
there'll be any problem with that at all, actually, for
about three reasons.  And I could start with this case.
In this case, our complaint talks about the contract.
Our motion for summary judgment talked about the
contract.  As a base for fees, I'm talking about,
specifically --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I thought, also, ERISA, too.
MR. FELDMAN:  Also ERISA, also ERISA.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes.
MR. FELDMAN:  But it's -- for our purposes,
it's irrelevant whether there was also a statute.  The
question is:  Was there a contractual fees issue in the
case, and was it decided?  Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Let's be a little more
precise.  Your notice of motion referenced ERISA alone.
The supporting affidavit mentions both, and the district
court opinion mentioned only ERISA.
MR. FELDMAN:  That's true, but --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you didn't mention
the contract in your notice of motion.
MR. FELDMAN:  The notice of
motion actually -- what the notice of motion said --
this was the sequence of events:  The affidavit was put
in on, I believe, April 4th.  The notice of motion came
in the next day, and I think actually the reason is
because we didn't actually think we needed a notice of
motion and later figured out that we did.
What the notice of motion said was
defendants are liable for those monies, pursuant to
ERISA --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you tell me what
page you're reading from?
MR. FELDMAN:  This is page 72.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Of the Joint Appendix?
MR. FELDMAN:  Of the Joint Appendix.
"Defendants are liable for those monies pursuant to
ERISA and for the reasons detailed in the accompanying
Wagner affidavit filed on the day before."  Okay?
It didn't say -- it said ERISA and for the
reasons given.  And if you look back at JA -- at the
affidavit at JA 75, in paragraph 6, as indicated -- no,
I'm sorry -- it's paragraph 3 on 74.
"In accordance with a collective
bargaining agreement, the trust agreement, and ERISA,
the defendants are liable for all auditor fees,
attorneys' fees, and so on."
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feldman, before --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't want to have to go
through this in every case.
MR. FELDMAN:  But there's no need to.
All -- the only question that you have to ask is:  Was
the -- was there a contractual damages issue in the
case?  And then here's the other half of it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feldman, there's a --
there's a question that has not been -- that's not
surfaced yet, but after Budinich, however you pronounce
it, the rule makers changed Rule 58(e), and now, 58(e)
provides a mechanism for deferring the finality of the
judgment until the fee question is decided.
You didn't seek an order under 58(e), did
you?  You didn't ask the district judge, please defer
the finality of the judgment until the fee question is
decided.
MR. FELDMAN:  That's correct.  Well --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So you didn't make
that --
MR. FELDMAN:  I don't -- that -- that
wouldn't have worked in this case because that's a
situation where there's already been another judgment on
the other merits issues in the case.
At the time when we put in this affidavit,
this affidavit was actually -- I think my friend was
mistaken -- because this affidavit was put in right at
the end of the trial, actually, at the same time, in
effect, as the trial memorandum telling -- our
post-trial brief telling the judge everything that we
wanted.
It's just, for this part of it, we then --
we originally said we're going to get it in at the same
time.  We later said, can we get two weeks extra for
this.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You still could have said
to the judge, please defer the entry of judgment until
you resolve the fee question, and you -- you would not
be entitled to that relief, but it would be in the
discretion of the judge.
And so that's how the rulemakers thought
this problem could be handled.  You can't have a
judgment that does not become final until the fee
question is decided.  But if there's -- absent that
specific determination, then the judgment becomes final
when it's final, and the fees are a separate matter.
I mean, it seems to me that, now, that this
mechanism in the rules to handle this, we should not
depart from the rules, whether it's contract or
statutory, it's separate.  It's not part of the
underlying judgment.
MR. FELDMAN:  The problem with -- I do think
that that rule was designed to address an issue when
people put in their fees' motion two weeks after there's
been a judgment in a case, not at the time -- at the end
of the trial, before there's any kind of judgment of any
sort in the case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know the Petitioner
doesn't rely on it, but it really is supplemental to
Justice Ginsburg's point.  There was a judgment in this
case, the June judgment.  And it -- and it says -- it's
entitled, "Judgment in a Civil Case," and it says that
the interest runs from this date.
Now, I know there are cases in which we say
that the description the trial judge gives to the
judgment is not necessarily conclusive of this final
order, but it does seem to me that this is what the
judge thought he was doing.
MR. FELDMAN:  I'm not sure that that's
right.  The judge says, at the end of the other order,
he says, "Now, this case is concluded," and I have to
look to see when the actual -- I mean, I don't -- I
think the -- actually, I think the judge thought that
the final judgment in the case was the one doing the
attorneys' fees.
He was maybe running the -- the interest
from the other one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The interest ran -- the
interest ran from the June 17th judgment.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  That's correct.  But
I'd like to go back to a couple of other things.  One is
there's no sorting through things that's really a
problem.  First of all, there's very few cases that ever
have both contract and statutory fees.
We've looked through every case cited in the
papers in this Court.  None -- none -- actually, maybe
one or two did, but in those, there was no doubt at all
that there were contractual fees that were at issue.
But more importantly, unlike other kinds of
contract damages where, if you want lost profits or if
you want the cost of some replacement performance, you
don't have to tell the judge what the legal source of
getting those things are.  You just have to tell the
judge, this is what I want, I'm entitled to it, there
was a breach of contract.
But with fees, you don't get them, just as a
matter of saying, I want to get my fees.  You have to
give the Court some source that authorizes them and that
usually -- it is a statute, or it's a contract.  And
parties, I think you'll find -- I couldn't find cases
where there was any doubt as to where a court said, I
have some doubt as to whether it was statute or a
contract.
JUSTICE BREYER:  The -- in my own mind, what
matters is you have to have one clear rule, one way or
the other.
MR. FELDMAN:  That's right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And -- fine.  Okay.
Both agree that's right, I think.  The -- so the First
Circuit's approach is less referable.  Which should it
be?  Well, go back to Justice Alito's question.  What
are ordinary lawyers going to think?
What they normally think now, I guess, is
this:  There's a piece of paper separate.  It's called a
judgment.  Counsel, one set goes into the file.  You
have 30 days, if you're not going to change that
judgment, and the fact that you want costs doesn't make
a difference.
Now, what you want us to say is the fact
that you want costs sometimes makes a difference.  It
makes a difference when it's nonstatutory.  I grant you,
that's fairly simple.  But isn't it better to tell the
lawyers -- I mean, I think that's what they would say --
it's better to tell the lawyers, look, counsel, a piece
of paper is there, you have 30 days, and try to minimize
the exceptions to that.
MR. FELDMAN:  I -- I don't think it is, and
there's a number of reasons.  Okay?  One is that the --
what our rule does is you file the notice of appeal
after the case is finished, at the end.  Their -- under
their rule, you'll necessarily set a trap for the
unwary.
For lawyers who aren't sure or don't know
the law or whatever, for those people who aren't up on
it, they're going to find -- miss the earlier notice of
appeal, and they're going to lose their right to appeal
altogether, if you adopt Petitioners' rule.  That would
be what would happen.
If you adopt our rule, then that wouldn't
happen.  It would be true, there would be people who
would file a notice of appeal too early, but filing a
notice of appeal too early is much less of a problem
because, if you file a notice of appeal too early, you
can cure it by just filing another notice of appeal
later.
And under Federal Rule Appellate -- of
Appellate Procedure 4(a), there are times when an early
notice of appeal in, I think, a number of circumstances,
relates forward to a later judgment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Feldman, going back
to my 58(e) question, one thing that's interesting about
the rulemakers' response to Budinich is they didn't --
they didn't make any distinction between statutory and
contractual fee awards.
You would have us divide the world up that
way, statutes one rule, contracts another.  But the --
the Rule 58(e) doesn't -- it's not confined to statutory
fees.
MR. FELDMAN:  They do -- actually, they did
make a distinction between fees that have to be proved
as part of the substantive claims in the case.  And
actually for -- you know, attorneys' fees are actually
very close to that.
I would also point out that the other fees
at issue here -- this is the other problem -- aside from
the fact that there's a trap for the unwary set up by
their rule, but not by our rule, and that other things
being equal, procedural rules should be set up, so they
don't have those kinds of traps.
But even aside from that, they do have to
draw a distinction between attorneys' fees, auditor's
fees, accountant's fees, architect's fees, real estate
inspector's fees, there's many different kinds of
provisions people can put into contracts and say, if you
breach the contract, I want a right to inspect the
property, I want a right to inspect your books, I want a
right to figure out whether you've met your covenants in
this bond deal or in this business arrangement that we
have.
And you have to pay for it.  Or you have to
pay for it if it turns out that you really have breached
the covenant or there really is something wrong
with the building.
In all those cases, I don't know under -- I
don't know any way to figure out whether all those other
types of professionals that may be involved in the
case -- they're all the same thing.  They're all cases
where someone is saying there might be a breach here and
we want to figure it out.
In this --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I believe this rule was
cost of litigation.
MR. FELDMAN:  But in this case --
JUSTICE BREYER:  In this case, it's lawyers,
but it's going to treat the same -- experts, such as
1988, experts, real estate, all those things the lawyer
simply thinks, costs of litigation, if it's cost of
litigation I want, that doesn't make a difference, I
better file it.
MR. FELDMAN:  But these are not costs of
litigation.  I mean, when the auditors came -- this is
what happened, in this case -- and this is not uncommon.
The -- there was a suspicion that Petitioners were not
paying the contributions that were due.
There were no attorneys involved in the
case.  The auditors came in to do what they're
contractually entitled to do, which is look at the books
that -- the Petitioners' books, to figure out whether
they had or had not made the contribution.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  So limit it to
attorneys' fees, as the rule does.  That's a pretty
clear line.  Attorneys' fees -- you know, you -- you
have to file right away.  Anything else, it can extend.
MR. FELDMAN:  And we would prevail in this
case under that -- in that event.  But even on
attorneys' fees --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care about this
case, frankly.  I care about the rule that we're going
to be adopting.
MR. FELDMAN:  Right.  I think that there's
no -- I think that there's -- once you start parsing
contractual provisions out and saying, some of them are
merits-based, and some are not, even though they're all
doing the same thing, that is, they're all saying, in
the event -- this is what a damages provision --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I wouldn't be saying that.
I would be saying there's attorneys' fees and there's
stuff other than attorneys' fees.  Merits doesn't
matter.
MR. FELDMAN:  And even then -- even in
attorneys' fees, if I can just go back to this case for
a second, because I don't think this is all so unusual,
when the attorneys first came in, they didn't come in to
sue Petitioners.  They came in because the auditors
weren't getting cooperation and being given all the
books that they were supposed to be given.
And their first thing that involved a
certain amount of time at that point was trying to get
them to give the books to the auditors, which they
eventually did, okay?
But those are costs of collection.  Those
fees, under this contract and many, many contracts that
are similarly worded, those are costs, costs, including
attorneys' fees, of collecting money due, and those
costs are due and payable by Petitioners before any case
is brought and whether or not any case is brought.
If it turned out that the auditors had found
that there are some contributions that were not made and
the auditors then -- and then Respondents -- the
funds came to the employer and said, you owe us $5,000
in contributions that weren't made, your books were no
good, and we found it, and you owe us another $5,000 for
the auditor's fees, they might have just paid that.
They should have paid it.  And in many
cases, they will, or they might pay one or the
other.  But they're on an exact par.  That money is
totally due and owing under a provision like this.
It's not a prevailing party provision, which
is the sort of thing that -- that statutes almost
uniformly have.  It's covering obligations that one
party has to another, based on the fact that they didn't
comply with their contractual obligations.
You know, another -- another reason why it
is important that the Court pay close attention, I
think, to the rule against piecemeal appeals in a case
like this and the strong policy that, at the very least,
if there's any doubt you should avoid the piecemeal
appeals, is that, for people -- again, in this kind of
situation, it can be very, very important to know
whether you're going to get your fees paid before you
have to file a notice of appeal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the
procedure was, regardless of who prevails, it's not
piecemeal appeals.  I mean, they often combine the two
in the court of appeals for consideration.
MR. FELDMAN:  They can be combined if the
district -- they can be, if they come along at the right
time and if the district court can -- can see to it
under Rule 58.  If they -- after they --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, even if
it's -- if they don't need -- you don't need Rule 58, at
least the practice I was familiar with, you file for
attorneys' fees, they calculate it -- unless the
appellate court is moving with surprising speed, the
first appeal is still pending by the time the district
court rules on the attorneys' fees.
MR. FELDMAN:  It can be done, and there's
always -- of course, but that's true always when the
rule against -- or policy against piecemeal appeals
applies.  It always is a case an appellate court can put
things together that would otherwise be apart.
The point of that rule, though, and what I
was getting at, is, for people in the situation of -- of
Respondents here, we were -- there was, I think,
$143,000 in fees at issue that we have to pay -- they
have to pay the attorneys in this case.
And it's very important to them to know
whether they have to pay that amount before they decide
whether they want to appeal the case or not.
It's just as important to decide whether
they want to appeal that amount than to decide how much
they're going to get for the basic contributions that
was -- that Petitioners also owe us.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if they're worried
about it, they could always appeal and withdraw the
appeal later.
MR. FELDMAN:  They can do it, but --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If they -- if they don't
get the amount, right?
MR. FELDMAN:  They can do that, but it's --
the point of the rule against piecemeal appeals is these
kinds of decisions are much best left -- and this has
really long been accepted -- till the end of the
litigation, not to try to push it up earlier, which
creates traps for the unwary of the sort I was talking
about.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That would apply to
statutory fees as well, the argument about piecemeal,
duplicative appeals.
MR. FELDMAN:  It would apply, but -- first
of all, a statutory fees case are usually not as broad
as this.  They're usually prevailing parties' fees.
They're quite different -- they look quite different.
But they usually involve exercise of district court
discretion.  The court may, in its discretion, order
fees.  Nobody has ever written a contract, I don't
think, like that.
But more importantly, in the statutory case,
the court was quite correct, in Budinich, that it's
really indisputable that, as a general matter, statutory
fees are costs, and costs have never been seen as part
of the merits.  They're defined by statute, 28 USC 1920.
1988 is just another provision defining costs and
extending it a little bit farther.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you -- are you sure
that, as a general matter, contractual provisions do not
make attorneys' fees costs?  I've seen a lot of
contracts that say -- you know, shall recover costs
including -- including attorneys' fees.
MR. FELDMAN:  I think when contracts talk
about -- I don't think -- there's very little, if any,
history of contracts actually trying to allocate court
costs of the sort that statutes do.  I do think they
used the word "costs."  This provision here uses the
word "costs," but quite differently.
It uses the word "costs" to mean expense,
costs, including attorneys' fees, of collecting
payments, just like costs, including transportation of
obtaining substitute -- substitute performance, if
there's a breach, or any provision like that.
They don't use it in the technical sense of
referring to court costs.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I'm not quite sure
why the word matters.  I mean, you can say attorneys'
fees are costs under a statute and they're damages under
a contract, but why should that control the analysis of
what we do?  It's just which word we put up on it.
MR. FELDMAN:  I don't actually think it's
the word.  I think it's the underlying issue of what the
court is doing.  In the contract case, the court is just
adjudicating another claim by one party against another,
for some money, based on their performance under the
contract.  And the simplest way and the way you have to
make the least distinctions is say, all of those things
are damages and all those things are part of the merits
that have been viewed as part of the merits of a case,
always.
In fact, there's no authority that they are
not viewed as part of the merits of the case, and this
Court, in the Fleischmann Distilling and the Vaughan
cases, viewed it as part of the merits.
In the statutory case, the -- where Congress
may -- writes a statute, many, many of them are; the
court may, in its discretion, award fees to a prevailing
party.  I think the intuition of Budinich was that the
court -- Congress was tying into the long tradition of
taking litigation costs and extending it a little bit
farther, and that's something that Congress does.
And if Congress wanted to say the
contractual attorneys' fees are available under some
circumstances or under -- however, then that would
probably be defining costs, too, especially if they are
tied to what goes on in the litigation.
But when it's a provision like this one, and
like many, many contractual provisions -- and there's a
wide, wide variety of them -- that just talks about what
happens when there's a breach, and there's going to be
attorneys' fees, there's auditor's fees, there's other
kinds of things -- other kinds of expenses that the
nonbreaching party has, those are just the damages of
the case.
They've always been seen as the damages of
the case.  And it would be odd if you do start to try to
say, well, these have to be treated like they were
costs, then it does inevitably raise the question what
else has to be treated the way of -- the -- costs.
Petitioners said that -- you know, in this
case, there was no doubt that anybody had ever, in this
case, that we were seeking contractual fees.  And one
reason that I think is pretty conclusive on that, aside
from the fact that we mentioned it at every single
opportunity throughout the case, that we were seeking
contractual fees, in our summary judgment motion, in our
trial brief, post-trial, in the complaint -- it was
everywhere.
But we -- the auditor's fees that we were
seeking probably wouldn't have been awardable under
ERISA because the ERISA provision, 29 USC 1132(g) says
you get reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of the
action to be paid by the defendant.  And I'm not sure,
at all, that that would include -- I don't know any
authority that that includes auditor's fees.
But the contract was quite clear.  Costs,
including attorneys' fees of collecting payments, and
the auditor's fees did fit in that -- in that basket.
And nobody doubted it throughout the litigation.  There
was no litigation about whether we are entitled under
anything to auditor's fees because there's no point in
litigating the ERISA issue because it was clear under
the contract.
And the district court absolutely knew that
auditor's fees were involved in the case because the
district court awarded them separately and awarded us
all the auditor's fees that we sought, not just -- well,
just actually a relatively small portion of the
attorneys' fees.
In any event, if -- our submission is that
the Court -- that contractual attorneys' fees have
always been seen as damages, should continue to be seen
as damages, and the easiest, simplest, and best
procedural rule is to say that's what happens with
contractual fees, that's the category that we're dealing
with.  Budinich deals with a different category of
statutory fees.
But even if not, I do think that, in this
case, the nonlitigation fees, the attorneys' fees for a
time when they were enforcing the contract, which
ultimately got enforced and before there was litigation,
and the auditor's fees for examining the books that were
sums that were due and owing, entirely without regard to
whether there was -- to whether there was a judgment in
the case or whether there ever was a court case at all,
those things, at the very least, should be seen -- are
damages in the case.
They were due and owing before the case was
ever filed, and because those were in the case, at the
very least, the judgment wasn't final until those were
resolved.
Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HIMMELFARB:  One rule for statutory fees
and one rule for contractual fees is severely flawed,
both from the point of view of administrability and from
the point of view of logic.  My friend, Mr. Feldman,
suggested that the fees in this case, clearly, were
sought under a contract, and all I would say about that
is that it seems to me the colloquy itself that that
comment precipitated shows how confusing it can be to
make the determination.
Mr. Feldman also suggested that there are a
few other examples where you might be seeking fees under
a contract in the statute.  Keep in mind that there are lots
of State statutes that authorize an award of fees in
contract cases of different kinds.  Budinich itself was
a case involving an employment dispute, which was
necessarily a contractual dispute, and the Colorado
statute at issue there provided for the award of fees in
employment disputes.
So you can imagine a situation where you
have a contract and a statute that say the same thing,
there's an entitlement to fees, and yet, for whatever
reason, the party seeking fees invokes one, rather than
the other, and yet, the outcome under Respondents' rule
would depend upon which was invoked.
Mr. Feldman also suggested that our rule
presents a trap for the unwary.  I have to say I'm having a
hard time understanding that.  The consequences of our
rule are that you always have to file after the initial
decision, and if you do that, there won't be any risks.
It won't be too late, and it won't be too early.
The consequences of either the First
Circuit's rule or the Eleventh Circuit's rule are that,
if you file after the second decision, it may be too
late -- too late, you won't be able to appeal the
first decision, but if you file after the first
decision, it may be too early, if it's subsequently
determined that these are merits fees and the case isn't
over, and your appeal will be dismissed, and you have
expended your resources on having an appeal dismissed.
As to the logic, the -- the fundamental
premise of Respondents' position is that all statutory
fees are costs, all contractual fees are damages, and
all I'd say about that is that it's just incorrect.
There are statutory fees that look a lot like the
contractual fees at issue here.
There are contractual fees that are
straightforward prevailing party provisions, some of
which are bilateral, meaning that the defendants can
prevail.  If a defendant recovers attorneys' fees under
a contract, whatever else that contractual provision is,
it can't be damages.
Budinich said statutory fees can be merits
or nonmerits.  We're going to treat them as nonmerits.
Likewise, contractual fees can be merits or nonmerits.
There's absolutely no reason to adopt the opposite rule
for that category of fees.
Judgment should be reversed.
