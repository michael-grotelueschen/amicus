CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll here argument

Mr. Shanmugam.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
In McDonough v. Greenwood, this Court held
that a party is entitled to a new trial where it can
show that a juror was materially dishonest at voir dire,
regardless of whether the juror's dishonesty actually
infected the verdict.
A McDonough claim is thus an inquiry into
the composition of the jury.  It is not an inquiry into
the validity of the verdict.  And for that reason,
Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) unambiguously permits
the introduction of testimony about statements made
during deliberations in support of a McDonough claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But -- but wasn't that a
case in which a third party came and gave the
information?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct.  And so we
are certainly not arguing that McDonough itself resolved
the question of the scope of Rule 606(b).  But we do
think that the nature of the McDonough inquiry is really
critical here in determining whether Rule 606(b)
applies.
And in particular we think that the critical
fact is that McDonough in no way requires an inquiry
into what actually took place in the jury room.  It is,
as we say in the briefs, a type of structural error.
And by that, I mean that it has no prejudice component.
And in that regard it is critically
different from other types of claims, such as a claim of
outright jury bias, where prejudice is required.  And
it's really for that reason that we think Rule 606(b)
unambiguously permits evidence of this variety to be
admitted.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought that the whole
rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the
jury province with information about what went on in the
jury room.  And that's a pretty old rule.  And some
people might think it makes no sense.  You can have an
eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a
juror itself.
So this, what's involved here is a juror
reporting what she heard during the deliberations.  And
it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is
not permitted.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, we're
certainly talking about statements made during
deliberations, and we are not disputing that this is the
type of evidence that is subject to the rule.  Our
argument concerns the first requirement of Rule 606(b),
which goes to the type of inquiry during which evidence
that is otherwise covered by the rule would be
admissible.  And I do think that Rule 606(b) embodies a
balance.  It isn't simply about the countervailing
policy concerns, which Respondent and the government
understandably emphasize, of finality and jury secrecy.
There is, of course, a countervailing
concern here about fairness.  That is, after all, the
principal concern on which the rule of McDonough itself
was based.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it's too easy to
convert anything that occurs into the jury room as
reflecting on the voir dire.  So the judge instructs the
jury.  Can you follow my instructions?  Oh, yes, I can
follow my instructions.  In the jury room, that juror
says:  Oh, come on, let's just average it all up and go
home.  Didn't -- didn't follow instructions.  On your
theory that could come in, because it goes to dishonesty
at the voir dire stage.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  So two responses to that,
Justice Ginsburg.  First of all, as we point out in our
reply brief, our rule has been the rule, both on the
Federal level and on the State level, in numerous
jurisdictions.  And we would respectfully submit that
there is really no evidence of the floodgates problem
that Respondents suggest will follow if this Court
adopts our interpretation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, perhaps if you
prevail.  Why not?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that goes to my second
response, which is that I think that it is going to be
very difficult in the hypothetical you posit for a party
to make out a successful McDonough claim.  And that is
simply because the requirements of McDonough are in fact
quite stringent.
And in particular, the first requirement of
McDonough is that the moving party must show that the
response was intentionally dishonest.  And by that, I
think that the Court really meant intentionally
dishonest at the time of  voir dire.  So to take the
hypothetical that the government uses in its brief --
JUSTICE ALITO:  I think you're missing the
point of Justice Ginsburg's question.  The question is
not whether the McDonough claim ultimately would
prevail.  The question is whether the testimony from
jurors about what went on in the jury room is going to
be solicited in an effort to prove a McDonough claim.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --
JUSTICE ALITO:  And I guess your answer to
-- what's implicit in what you're saying is that it
would be permissible to receive that testimony in that
situation.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, Justice Alito, I think
there are two separate issues here.  The first is the
concern about undue solicitation.  And as we have
explained, there are a variety of rules that I think
impose appropriate limits on a lawyer's ability to go
out and get evidence of this variety.  And of course
lawyers always have an incentive to talk to jurors if
they are able to do so.
Our point is simply that, to the extent that
there is a concern raised about harassment of jurors,
that is already dealt with, and appropriately so, by
governing rules.
Now, I think Justice Ginsburg's question --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I didn't
follow that.  You said lawyers always have an interest
in talking to -- what's to prevent them from doing so if
the payoff could be as significant as you're looking for.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think at a minimum,
Mr. Chief Justice, lawyers certainly would have that
incentive, even if we were to lose this case, because in
talking to jurors, that conversation could very well
lead to evidence that unquestionably would be
admissible, because, after all, a party can always make
a McDonough claim based on extrinsic evidence.
And so, for instance, if in fact a juror had
posted something on Facebook that indicated that the
juror had been dishonest at voir dire, there's really no
debate that that would be admissible.
But to go to Justice Ginsburg's question,
really sort of the second part of this, I think it's
important to remember that the mere fact that the
evidence is admissible under Rule 606(b) is not the end
of the inquiry.  The evidence still has to be probative
and probative with regard to the requirements of
McDonough.
And I think perhaps the best example that I
would give is actually an example that the government
uses in its brief, the example of the situation where
the jurors go back into the jury room and they flip a
coin in order to resolve the case.
Now, the government suggests that perhaps a
party could seek to use that as evidence that the jurors
were in fact dishonest when they said that they could be
fair and impartial at the time of voir dire.  But if so,
that is pretty weak evidence of that for the simple
reason that the requisite showing under McDonough is
that the juror intended to be dishonest at the time of
voir dire.
And in the coin flip hypothetical, it might
very well have been that the jurors flipped a coin
because they were frustrated with their inability to
reach a decision.  They may have wanted to go watch the
football game.  There any number of reasons.  But that
is not really very strong evidence of intentional
dishonesty at the time of voir dire.  I think this
case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what is the strong
evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case?  The
woman says:  I can judge this case fairly, I can award
damages.  And one of the other things that the judge
instructs the jury:  You can take account of your own
life experience.
What is so blatant about that?  How do we
infer that she intended to be dishonest at the time of
the voir dire?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, again, I think that
this really goes to the requirements of McDonough as
opposed to the interpretation of Rule 606(b).  But I
think that there's a meaningful difference between a
juror simply bringing personal experiences to bear on
the one hand and a juror doing so in a way that
indicates that the juror was, as was true in this case,
simply unwilling to award damages to Petitioner in a
case of this variety.
And I think it's important to underscore the
extent that the facts of this case shed some light on
the legal question.  But this is not simply a case about
a question involving fairness and impartiality.  There
were also questions asked about whether the jurors would
be willing to award damages of various types in a case
of this variety.
And to point to the evidence of dishonesty
in the record at pages 40a, to 41a of the appendix to the
petition, Juror Titus said that Juror Whipple said in the
discussions that if her daughter had been sued for the
accident for which she was responsible, it would have
ruined her life.
In our view, that is evidence that the juror
was unwilling to follow the instructions and to apply
the law to the facts.  And we believe that it also
strongly supports the inference that the juror was
dishonest at the time of voir dire when she answered --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it's pretty
ambiguous.  She said if -- if she had been sued, she
would have to pay a lot of damages, right?  Well, this
guy has been sued.  I mean, I don't know that you can
just take that and says that means she's not going to
award a judgment in favor of the -- of the plaintiff.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, she said it would have
ruined her life if she had been sued.  And to be fair,
this is obviously not smoking gun evidence.  This is not
a situation where the juror comes into the jury room and
says, look, I really lied when I answered those
questions at voir dire.
It is inferential evidence, and it will be a
matter for Judge Viken on remand if this Court agrees
with our interpretation to determine first of all
whether this affidavit is in fact probative evidence of
intentional dishonesty, and second --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well I guess the reason
I ask is precisely for that reason.  In other words, it's
a fairly broad inquiry.  The circumstances in which you
would allow an inquiry are fairly broad.  It's not
simply when there's a smoking gun, but a very debatable
point about, well, she -- she didn't want to award
damages because if her daughter had been sued it would
ruin her life, as opposed to, well, she realized there'd
be a lot of damages here because the guy was sued.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  And again, that really goes
to the application of the McDonough standard.  And we've
now had 30 years of experience with the McDonough
standard.  This is not a recent decision of this Court.
Justice Kennedy:  But McDonough did not
have --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  My problem is not -- is not
that, the difficulty
of proving that it did demonstrate dishonesty during the
voir dire.  My problem is what you also have to
establish, namely that this does not constitute an
inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, thank you, Justice
Scalia, because this is obviously --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That’s 606(b)(1), and why
are you raising this issue?  Because you want to set
aside the verdict, right?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, this is obviously a
case about the interpretation of that language.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But I think it's critical to
realize that that language does not simply refer to any
challenge to the verdict.  It refers to inquiries into
the validity of the verdict.  And in our view, that
language unambiguously --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Except -- why -- why
would you have an inquiry into the validity of the
verdict absent juror misconduct?  You're not going to
use that statement in any other part of your case.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But the critical point,
Justice Sotomayor, is that that language focuses on the
inquiry and it focuses on the substantive inquiry
mandated by the claim at issue.
And again, as I indicated at the outset, a
claim of juror dishonesty during voir dire does not
require any examination of the verdict itself.  It does
not depend in any way on what took place in the jury
room.  And it's really for that reason that we think
that a McDonough claim is qualitatively different from a
claim --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I don't understand
that, Mr. Shanmugam.  I mean, one reason that a verdict
can be invalid has to do with what happens in the jury
room.  And another reason why a verdict can be invalid
might have to do with the composition of the jury
itself.
And why we should read that language to
include the first but not the second I guess I'm just
not getting as a matter of language.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Sure.  Well, I do think that
you have to give meaning to every word in this
provision.  And I really do think that this provision is
different from a provision that just refers to
challenges to the verdict.  And it certainly it true
that in this case, as in many others, we are seeking as
the remedy on our McDonough claim a new trial.  And a
component of that, once a verdict has been reached, is
obviously that the verdict should be set aside.
In other words, I'm not disputing the
proposition that our purpose here is to obtain a new
trial, and of course, therefore, to set aside the
verdict that has already been reached.
My point is simply that a McDonough claim in
no way turns on the manner in which the jury has reached
the verdict.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I know, but -- so maybe
we're just going back and forth here.  But an inquiry
into the validity of the verdict means asking the
question, is the verdict valid?  And the question, is
the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to
the deliberative process itself or to the composition of
the jury.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But that is not the question
that a McDonough claim asks.  And I think the best
evidence of that is that I think it's really undisputed
that a McDonough claim can be brought even before a
verdict has been reached.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I haven't -- I haven't
quite counted, but you keep saying this is a McDonough
claim.  If you read the McDonough case, Chief Justice
Rehnquist does not cite Rule 606.  He does not cite.
I think I'm correct.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  You're absolutely correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so you want to tell
us, don't look at Rule 606.  Just look at McDonough.
That's what you're telling us.  It's a whole --
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I am eager for you to look
at the language of Rule 606 because I think it supports
our position.  The only reason that we're talking about
McDonough at all is because Rule 606 requires you to
look at the type of inquiry that the claim at issue
mandates.  And I think in many ways this nature --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it also requires you
to look at who is producing the evidence.  And here, the
juror is producing the evidence and McDonough was a
third person.  It's different.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, the rest of Rule
606(b)is, of course, all about that, because it is all
about the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion.
And again, there's no debate that that portion of the
rule sweeps quite broadly and would otherwise include
the evidence at issue here.
Our point is simply that a McDonough claim
is a type of structural error and I think that that
points up the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're taking a case
that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about
what -- what -- the deliberations in the jury room.  I
think you're using the case for much more than it's
worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it.
It just didn't present the question of what about a
juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury
room.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  But, Justice Ginsburg, I do
think that the nature of a McDonough claim points up one
of the oddities of Respondent's position, which is that
there's really no dispute that if a McDonough claim is
brought before a verdict has been reached, that
evidence -- even evidence from the jury room would be
admissible.  And so, for instance, if a juror came
forward before the jury actually completed its
discussions and reached a verdict, I think there's no
dispute here -- at least I don't see any dispute in the
briefs -- that that evidence would be admissible.
And so, too, of course, in Clark, this Court
held that evidence of this variety would be admissible
in a contempt proceeding after the verdict has been
reached.  And so --
JUSTICE ALITO:  This is what troubles me
about your -- your argument.  I suspect, maybe I'm wrong
and you tell me if I am, that in a case where there's a
lot at stake, a really good lawyer loses a case and
there was a lot on the line.  And let's suppose this
lawyer gets a transcript of what was said in the jury
room.  Do you think it is going to be very hard for the
lawyer to find something that some juror said that can
be used to make out a somewhat plausible claim that
the -- that the juror was dishonest during voir dire?
The juror promises during voir dire to be fair, and it
appears from this transcript the lawyer was for the
plaintiff or for the defendant from the first minute of
deliberations.  Or the juror says, I will follow the
jury instructions.  And then at some point, the juror is
making an argument that's inconsistent with the jury
instructions.  Do you see the problem?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I -- I see the problem.  I
would just respectfully submit, Justice Alito, that it
hasn't proven to be a problem in practice.  And as we
note in our reply brief, this has been the rule in the
Ninth Circuit, it's been the rule in the nation's
largest State jurisdiction, California, for decades.
And yet in those jurisdictions, there is less than one
decision per year that we've been able to find involving
a McDonough claim based on this type of evidence.
And, of course, as we -- I was just going to
say, one last thing, Justice Alito, which is that, of
course, as we also point out, our rule was, if anything,
the prevailing rule at common law even before the
enactment of Rule 606(b) and there's no evidence that
there was a floodgates problem at common law either.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is -- under your
reading of 606(b), is there anything that is an inquiry
into the validity of a verdict other than a motion to
set aside the verdict?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, I think that there
might be certain types of claims of which prejudice is a
component.  And certainly, if you brought a motion that
was based on pure juror bias of the type that was at
issue in cases such as Remmer v. United States and Smith
v. Phillips --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what would --
that motion would be presumably a motion to set aside
the verdict.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  I assume it would be framed
that way rather than as a motion for a new trial.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The reason I ask is
because they don't say that.  It seems to me a broader
definition of any inquiry into the validity of a
verdict.  If they wanted to say, you know -- if they
only meant a motion to set aside a verdict, you'd think
they would have said that.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yeah.  I mean, I -- off the
top of my head, I can't think of another type of motion
for new trial that would be treated differently.  But
certainly, wherever the claim depends in any way on what
took place in the jury room, the evidence would, of
course, still be subject to the rule.  And again, that
sweeps in claims of juror bias, it sweeps in all of the
types of claims about which the framers of Rule 606(b)
were clearly concerned.  Claims involving the manner in
which the jury reached the verdict, claims involving
compromised verdicts, quotient verdicts and the like.
And I think if anything, to the extent that
the drafting history of Rule 606(b) is relevant, it
tells us two things.  First, there's no indication that
the framers of the rule intended to disturb what was the
prevailing practice at common law, particularly after
this Court's decision in Clark.  There is simply nothing
in the history of the rule that suggests that.  And if
anything, I think that the history of the rule suggests
that the central focus in framing the rule was on
excluding evidence concerning the manner in which the
jury reached its verdict, and not evidence that was used
to demonstrate that the jury was improperly constituted.
Now, again, because the rule focuses on the
inquiry mandated by the claim at issue, we think that
ours is the better textual interpretation.  But at a
minimum, if the Court thinks that the rule is somehow,
by its terms, ambiguous, I would simply make two points.
First, we do think that the canon of constitutional
avoidance would apply in this context.  At least one
court of appeals has held that there would be a
constitutional problem with excluding evidence in cases
involving racial bias.  We believe that there would be a
serious constitutional concern.  More generally, because
the right to adequate voir dire is, as this Court has
said, part of the right to trial by an impartial jury.
But even if the Court doesn't think that
this is a matter for constitutional avoidance, we
certainly think that there is a constitutionally based
interest here.  The interest in protecting a litigant's
right to a fair trial.  And we believe that that
interest does outweigh the countervailing interest in
finality in jury secrecy.  Now, in Clark --
JUSTICE ALITO:  A party has a right to a
competent jury, doesn't it?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Yes, that is true.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Constitutional right to
that.  And yet, you couldn't inquire -- we -- the Court
has held that there can't be an inquiry into whether the
jurors were intoxicated?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that is true.  But I
think that the Court reached that conclusion based
entirely on the outside influence exception.  And I
think part of the reason why that is true is that I
think that the Court viewed the inquiry in that case in
Tanner as requiring a showing of prejudice.  In other
words, I think that the Court was operating on the
premise that the underlying claim there would require a
showing that the drunkenness actually redounded to the
moving party's prejudice.
My point is simply that when we're looking
at the policy balancing that is required here, the
better point of reference is this Court's decision in
Clark where the Court suggested -- albeit in the context
of contempt proceedings -- the concerns about fairness
outweighed the litany of concerns about jury secrecy and
harassment.  And to be sure --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was leaving out the
conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict
impugned in the contempt case.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  That is correct.  Although
the Court did indicate that its rule was consistent with
the common law no impeachment rule.  But I think with
regard to the policy considerations, it certainly is
true that this case is different because it does possess
a final verdict.  But I think with regard to finality, I
would point to the experience in the jurisdictions that
have adopted our rule, which confirms that if evidence
of this variety is admissible, verdicts are only rarely
set aside and that is because McDonough itself sets an
appropriately high standard.
And, of course, the only question before the
Court in this case concerns the admissibility of this
evidence.  It would be open to the district court on
remand to decide what to do with this evidence if it is
admitted.  Our submission is simply that Rule 606(b) by
its terms permits the admission of this evidence because
it is not being admitted in an inquiry into the validity
of the verdict.
And if I can reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Miss Birnbaum.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May
it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice:
What the Petitioner would do here is change
the rules of 606 and how it would apply.  606 is clear.
This Court has said its language is clear.  What
Petitioner does not emphasize is that what they did
below was to make a motion for a new trial and to
invalidate the verdict.  The fact that the ground was
dishonesty of the juror doesn't change anything from the
Tanner case where the grounds for the new trial was that
the jurors were drinking during the trial and during
deliberations.
McDonough doesn't change the nature of
606(b).  All McDonough says, I think as you have pointed
out, is that if there is an inquiry, that inquiry would
have to be such, but it does not tell you why it's
admissible.  And Rule 606 tells us what's admissible.
And this, the Petitioner has conceded is not admissible.
It is jury testimony of what happened during
deliberations.  So that's clear.
So what are we fighting about?  We're
fighting about what did Congress mean by during an
inquiry into the validity of the verdict.  This is an
inquiry into the validity of the verdict.  You can't
just separate the grounds.  What they want here is a new
trial and the verdict invalidated.
And so it falls exactly into 606(b), and the
legislative history absolutely supports that.  Congress,
this Court made decisions and balanced the fairness on
one hand of allowing in this testimony and problems
about the sanctity of a jury trial and the entire
structure of our judicial system.  And to adopt
Petitioner's analysis would put this all on its head.
What would we have?  I think we all know what we would
have here.  Every lawyer, good ones or bad ones, Your
Honor, would try to ask generalized questions -- can you
be fair -- and then wait and see what happens.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your friend says
that hasn't been the experience in a large portion of
the country.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, that's not true
because, first of all, my friend doesn't tell you that
there are only five States that allow in this kind of
evidence at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is California one of
them?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  California is one of them.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well --
MS. BIRNBAUM:  But even in California, Your
Honor, there are different requirements.  These cases go
off -- I'll just give you a perfect example.  He cites a
bunch of cases in the Ninth Circuit that he says these
are the cases that apply the rule.  Well, they don't.
Even the cases that they rely on from the Ninth Circuit,
Henley and Hard, it is dicta in those cases that you can
admit testimony on -- of a juror on what happened during
deliberations if you're trying to determine whether
there's dishonesty.  In those cases themselves, that was
not the holding of the case.  There was dicta that says
you should be able to do that, but the holdings of the
case went off on extraneous prejudicial influences or
extraneous prejudicial information.
And there are --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your argument --
your argument is this is going to be something lawyers
are going to ask about in every case.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  And they will --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It seems to me -- it
seems to me if you're dealing with California, you would
have a lot more evidence of that, since they operate
under the rule that your friend is arguing for.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, they do and they don't,
Your Honor.  They -- you can introduce certain things in
California, but you can't introduce the mental processes
in California.
But the answer to that is we don't know
what's happening in California.  There is no -- no
experience that anybody has about what's going on in
California or how the courts are applying it.  We didn't
have an opportunity to respond to all those California
cases, because they are only cited in the reply.  But
we've gone through all those cases and in many of those
cases this kind of testimony was not let into evidence.
So we don't know what the experience was in
California, but we do know what Congress said.  And we
do know what Congress had before them and what Congress
wanted.  Congress did the balancing here.  Congress
balanced the fairness of jurors, the fairness of a jury
trial against all of the issues and policies of keeping
the jury in a black box because it's good for the
system.  Without it, we couldn't function.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Ms. Birnbaum, what sense
does it make to do what we did in Clark, which is to say
you can invade the jury deliberations in a contempt
proceeding.  So that -- the jury is not sacrosanct.  The
court has already said that the proceeding for contempt
doesn't involve the verdict and it's a criminal action,
and not permit the use of that evidence in the civil
trial.
The same thing will have happened in both
situations.  The jury's sanctity has been invaded.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  But, Your Honor, the reason
that we allow it in a contempt proceeding is it doesn't
affect the validity of the verdict.  It doesn't go to
what happened with regard to the verdict.
And the contempt proceedings are few and far
between.  Jurors aren't going to be harassed on a
regular basis, and if you have a criminal contempt
proceeding, you have a prosecutor who is going to make a
determination and stand between the jurors and the --
and the contempt proceeding before they will bring a
contempt proceeding.  We know how few these are.
Here we're talking about in every criminal
case, in every important civil case, or not such an
important civil case.  This is a run-of-the-mill case we
have here, a simple accident case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is -- Ms. Birnbaum, is
there no way, is there no way to police the honesty of
jurors' answers on voir dire?  This is an obvious way,
if it were permissible, to police the honesty.  But is
there any other way?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Your Honor, in this case
especially, and I'm not sure I'm answering your
question, we could have had a different kind of voir
dire.  There was no -- there was no specific question
here:  Has any member of your family or you been
involved in an automobile accident?  That was never
asked of the jury.  And bad if a juror lied about that;
well, they could, or the juror could have said yes.
Assuming there was -- assuming that the juror
foreperson's daughter was involved in an auto accident,
she could have said that, and they could have inquired.
But they didn't do that.
And look at the gamesmanship that can be
played with lawyers.  They don't ask specific questions
which they should to get to the right answers and to get
to the right jurors in voir dire, and then they sit back
and wait and game the system and see how the verdict
comes back, talk to the jurors, and then they have a
ground to set aside a verdict.
This is not what Congress wanted.  That's
not what the Supreme Court said should happen in Tanner.
And the Petitioner here says under the common law, this
was the rule.  You could admit this kind of testimony.
That's utterly untrue.  In Tanner, this Court said under
the common law, it is clear that you could not admit
this evidence.
That was the majority rule.  There was a
minority rule.  And you know what happened?  When
Congress looked at this issue, they adopted the majority
rule.  They said the jury room is a black box except for
certain extraneous influences, extraneous prejudicial
information.  This is not it.  Doesn't fall within that
category.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And why not?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Because, Your Honor, this is
generalized information.  When we talk about extraneous
prejudicial information, I think the case law is
absolutely clear.  It has to be about the case, about
information that you put into the jury room about the
defendant or about the incident, the accident.
If you went and looked at the scene of the
accident and then came back and talked to the jurors
about it, that would be extraneous.  But this kind of
generalized information, assuming it's true -- my
daughter was in an auto accident.  Okay, the Petitioner
talks about her unwillingness to determine certain
damages.  This case never came to damages.  What
actually happened in this case is the jury met for two
hours.  This was a question of contributory fault and
what happened was the jurors came, asked the court a
question:  If we apply -- if we apply contributory
negligence and we find that there's slight contributory
negligence, must we find for the defendant?
JUSTICE ALITO:  What would happen in the
really egregious case?  The jurors are asked during voir
dire, can you be fair to every -- to parties regardless
of race.  Oh, yes, yes, we can.  And then after there's
a verdict, a juror comes -- comes forward and says
during the jury deliberations, the jurors were making
all kinds of biased statements and they were clearly
prejudiced.  What would happen there?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  I think, Your Honor, under
606(b), there would be no difference.  You still could
not introduce that juror testimony.  Now, maybe that's
wrong and maybe Congress should change 606(b), but
that's a job for Congress in connection with the
judicial conference and with all of the people that
would ask Congress to come in and testify and Congress
can make that decision if they want to have an
exception.
But Congress knew about that when -- when it
passed 606(b), and it -- it didn't make an exception for
racial bias.  And if Congress wants to do it, it could
do it, but this Court can't do it or shouldn't do it
because it's not part of what Congress intended.
Congress knew quite well, there was a lot of discussion
here, and the Petitioner is correct.  Most of the
discussion did not go to the words "during an inquiry
into the validity of the verdict."
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think that with
respect to the kind of case that Justice Alito has in
mind, a case of racial bias and let's put it in a
criminal context, that maybe it's not up to Congress,
that at some point one begins to run into constitutional
issues?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  Well, I think at least if
this Court, in Tanner, looked at those constitutional
issues not in -- not in the racial bias context, but in
the context of having a drunk juror deciding a
particular case --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why is that the -- I
mean, would we make an exception to normal hearsay rules
where racial bias is the issue?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  You would not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think so.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  But the -- but the further
answer to that is this Court has already said there are
other safeguards that are in place that we feel will be
sufficient in order to safeguard the Sixth Amendment
rights in that particular instance, or the Seventh
Amendment rights, of a fair trial.  This Court has said
we can't give litigants a perfect trial.  We -- we know
that there are going to be some cases where a juror acts
improperly, acts with bias, but we can't change the
system and open it up to jurors being harassed, to
jurors being asked what happened in the jury room,
because we will then take a private process and make it
a public inquiry.  And Congress didn't want that.  This
Court in Tanner said that was not --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I suppose one idea --
because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other
safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just
say it's not this case.  But -- that those safeguards
might not be so effective in certain contexts and
particularly with respect to ferreting out racial bias
or religious or ethnic or something like that.
MS. BIRNBAUM:  I think, Your Honor, again
I'll come back to really this is an issue for Congress.
The rules of evidence are now adopted.  Even if the
Court feels there is unfairness in them, they have to
interpret them.  And they have to interpret them as
Congress wrote them.  Certainly, Congress knew about
racial bias and ethnic bias when it was writing these
rules and passing these rules in 1972.  There were
not --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is there any -- is
there any alternative remedy available that doesn't go
to the validity of the verdict?  You know, the
Petitioners allegedly were injured to a great extent by
the jurors' -- I could call it fraud, I guess.  Can they
bring an act -- direct action against her?
MS. BIRNBAUM:  No, Your Honor, I don't -- I
don't think so.  I think the only thing is if a juror
lies, there is the contempt proceeding that can be
brought.  It's -- it's part of what we have to live with
in the system because we can't provide perfect trials
for people.  We can only provide as fair as they can.
And in this particular case, the broad
questions that were asked, the fact that -- there was
no -- they didn't -- the Petitioner says there was an
unwillingness on this -- on this juror to find damages.
There's nothing in the affidavit that was presented that
even hints at that.  It says she may have influenced
other jurors.  By the way, do we bring in the other
jurors?  Well, this is what this would open up.
Let's say we go back.  The juror that put in
the affidavit goes and testifies.  The forelady goes and
testifies.  They have diametrically different views of
what happened in the jury room.  Do we then bring in all
the rest of the jurors?  That's what -- and the fact
that McDonough may, in certain circumstances, allow
jurors to -- and by the way, McDonough does not allow
jurors to testify.  As you said, there was no juror
testimony there.
And the fact is that the rule is clear on
its face.  This falls exactly within 606(b) and the
legislative history and the policy behind it, and we
should not be extending it to this kind of situation.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Harrington.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
FOR THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
Any hearing on a motion for a new trial is
an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.  That's true
when a plaintiff -- when a litigant brings a McDonough
claim because of what it -- the litigant is arguing is
that verdict that was issued in his case is invalid
because the tribunal that issued the verdict was
improperly constituted.  It would be the same if the
litigant were arguing that the judge that issued a
decision in a case should have recused herself from the
case based on some sort of conflict.  It would be the
same if a litigant were arguing that the jury had 5
members or 25 members.
In each of those examples, how the argument
goes is that the -- the tribunal was improperly
constituted and so the verdict that was issued was
invalid because an improperly constituted tribunal
cannot issue a valid verdict.
Now, Mr. Shanmugam says that we should limit
the phrase "inquiry into the validity of a verdict" to
cases where what you're inquiring into is what happened
in a jury room.  But just as a matter of normal English
usage, I think we -- it's not hard to imagine an inquiry
into the validity of a verdict that would not look into
what happened in a jury room.  For example, if a
criminal defendant who's convicted files a motion for a
new trial based on sufficiency of the evidence, I think
anyone would think that the hearing on that motion is an
inquiry into the validity of a verdict because a verdict
that's based on insufficient evidence is not valid.  You
wouldn't look at what happened in the jury room and so
you may have no occasion to apply Rule 606(b) in that
kind of inquiry, but it would certainly be an inquiry
into the validity of a verdict.
When someone brings a McDonough claim, it's
just not a freestanding thing.  They bring it as part of
a motion for a new trial; that's part of an inquiry into
the validity of a verdict.
Now, there's been some questions about
what's happened in California where this type of
evidence is admitted.  What Mr. Shanmugam says is that
there have not been -- there hasn't been an appreciable
increase in the number of successful McDonough claims in
California.  Of course, the problem that Rule 606(b)
targets is not too many successful McDonough claims,
it's overly intrusive inquiries into what's happened
in -- during jury deliberations and so that's really not
responsive.
But it is true that in California and in
about five other States, this type of evidence is
admitted because those States apply the common -- the
Iowa version of the common law rule.  And under the Iowa
rule, anything that jurors said during deliberations you
can admit testimony about because it wasn't something
that was internal to a juror's mind, it was something
that could be corroborated or rebutted by other jurors.
And so this type of evidence would be admissible in
those five or six States because of they apply a
different type of -- different version of -- in the
no-impeachment rule.
Of course, Congress was aware that that was
an option available to it when it adopted Rule 606(b)
and that was the version of the rule that the House of
Representatives wanted.  There's lots of back and forth
that's covered in the briefs.
It's not true that that was the prevailing
rule of common law.  The Wigmore Treatise of 1961
identifies 12 out of 50 States that apply the Iowa
version.  The other 38 States applied the majority
version, which was more restrictive or -- you know,
excluded more evidence.  That was plainly the version of
the rule that was adopted by the Senate.
And so I think that really points up the
fact that in this kind of area where you have these
competing important interests, it's really up to the
legislature to decide where it's going to draw the line.
Here the line is pretty clear.  Congress couldn't
have -- it would have been hard for them to write the
rule any more broadly than they wrote it.  It applies in
any -- during any inquiry to the validity of a verdict.
It covers anything that happens in the jury room unless
one of the specific exceptions applies.
The exception for extraneous information
does not apply here, it's our view, because that
exception has been construed only to apply to evidence
that specifically related to the case.  Congress
understood that.  That's reflected in the legislative
history.  It's reflected in the common law.  And if the
Court doesn't have any questions, I think I've hit the
highlights.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
MS. HARRINGTON:  Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Shanmugam, you
have 7 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice.
I think there are just four very quick
points that I'd like to make.  First of all, with regard
to the text of the rule and this question of whether
this constitutes an inquiry into the validity of the
verdict, I would just say one thing in response to what
Ms. Harrington has just said.  If, for instance, a party
files a motion for a new trial based on the
insufficiency of the evidence, that is, by definition, a
claim that can be brought only at the close of the
evidence in the case.
A McDonough claim is critically different
because that claim ripens at the point at which the
allegedly dishonest juror is actually empaneled.  And so
a McDonough claim could be brought before the verdict
has been reached or after the verdict has been reached.
And to the extent that the argument here is that the
jury is a black box and that one shouldn't look into the
jury's deliberations, I would note, again, that evidence
of this variety would plainly be admissible either
before a verdict has been reached or in a contempt
proceeding after a verdict has been reached.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  But, of course,
you'd -- you'd have no incentive to do that until you
lose, right?  So you would rather sit around and see if
the verdict goes against you at which point you -- you
would make the claim.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, that is -- that is
certainly true, but the --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Nobody is going to make the
claim before verdict comes out.  Is anybody going to do
that?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, there are cases where
the evidence comes to light, typically when a juror
actually comes to the judge and then the judge takes
some action based on the statements that have been
recorded.  But I think it's important to realize that a
McDonough claim doesn't in any way depend on the
outcome.  One could be the prevailing party and seek
relief on a McDonough claim, although one would,
obviously, have no incentive to do so.
That simply points up the fact that a
McDonough claim, again, in no way depends on what
actually took place in the jury room in terms of the
manner in which the jury reached its verdict.
Second, I want to address this question of
the state of the law which I think is critically
important here because it really goes --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain the
manner in which the jury reached its verdict?  I thought
that the testimony of Titus was she made this statement
about her daughter and she persuaded all the other
jurors to go along with her.  That's the manner in which
the jury reached its verdict.  It didn't follow the law,
it followed what this woman was alleged to have said.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Justice Ginsburg, the Titus
affidavit does contain those allegations, but those
allegations are utterly irrelevant to the resolution of
a McDonough claim.  In other words, it doesn't matter
for purposes of the McDonough claim whether the other
jurors were influenced or whether the other jurors said,
we don't care about your daughter's experience, that
doesn't affect our decisionmaking in the slightest.  And
that is because a McDonough claim is designed to
identify juror dishonesty at voir dire without regard to
the impact on the jury's deliberations.
Now, second, I want to say something about
the current state of the law --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, presumably that's
because we assume impact, isn't it?  So the impact is
sort of built into the rule.
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it's built into the
rule only in the sense that it has to be material
dishonesty.  And so, if a juror dishonestly answered a
question about his or her name at voir dire, a court
would say that that's immaterial.  My point is simply
that McDonough does not require any analysis of actual
prejudice as the proceedings actually played out, and
that in our view is the critical distinction.
Now, let me say something about the current
state of the law because I think there's a certain
amount of uncertainty based on this argument about that
and I want to clarify that.  It has unambiguously been
the rule in the Ninth Circuit since its decision in Hard
that evidence of this variety is admissible.  And I
respectfully submit that my friend Ms. Birnbaum simply
misreads the Hard case when she argues that that is
dicta, and the best evidence of that is how that rule
has been applied in the Ninth Circuit because I think it
has been treated as the law now for some three decades.
And it is clearly the law in California in the wake of
the California Supreme Court's decision in People v.
Castaldia.
Our point is that there has been less than
one decision that we've been able to find, whether
reported or unreported, in each of those jurisdictions
per year since those rules were adopted.  And when I'm
talking about decisions, I'm not just talking about
decisions in which McDonough claims were successful.
I'm talking about decisions in which evidence of this
variety has even been sought to be admitted.  And so
there's really no evidence that this is a problem in
those jurisdictions and we have been unable to find any
suggestion in the secondary literature that this is a
problem either.
And to the extent that Ms. Birnbaum
complains that we only cited those cases in our reply
brief, I would note that it's really Respondent's burden
here to identify evidence that this is, in fact, proven
to be a problem.
Now, Respondent and the government say that
there are five States in which evidence of this variety
is admissible.  I think that actually understates the
current state of the law.  We've identified
approximately 14 States where the evidence is
admissible.  But this points out another point of
confusion here.  Respondent and the government talk
about this distinction between the Iowa rule and the
Federal rule, and the Iowa rule applies to jurisdictions
where only evidence of the jurors' thought processes is
subject to exclusion and the Federal rule, like Rule
606(b), covers a broader type of evidence.
But even in jurisdictions that apply the
Federal rule, courts have held that evidence of this
variety is admissible.  And that's simply because we're
talking about two separate questions:  On the one hand,
the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion; and
on the other hand, the type of inquiry during which such
evidence is excluded.
So again, we would respectfully submit that
there is no evidence that this is anything other than a
speculative concern that our interpretation would lead
to these difficulties with juror harassment and
undermining the finality of verdicts.
Let me say just a word about the issue of
racial bias.  I think this is critically different from
a case involving, say, the application of the hearsay
rule, because this really goes to the fundamental
question of whether the factfinder itself was racially
biased.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  How about religious bias?
Is that also an exception?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about bias against
handicapped people?  I mean, all of those things are
difficult to find.  Right?
MR. SHANMUGAM:  Well, it raises
constitutional concerns, beyond the constitutional
concerns that we think are applicable in every case of
this variety, because, after all, regardless of the type
of bias, what we're talking about here is the right to
trial by an impartial jury.  A right that is founded
both on the specific constitutional rights involving
jury trials and the fundamental right to due process.
And our point is simply that to the extent that the
Court thinks the rule is ambiguous, those concerns
should come into play and support our interpretation.
I would just say one last thing before the
end of the argument and that is simply that Ms. Birnbaum
referred to this as a run-of-the-mill case and my
client, Petitioner Greg Warger, I think would strongly
object to that.  He, after all, lost his leg in this
accident.  And so, while this case doesn't involve
multiple millions of dollars or some fundamental
constitutional right, it is vitally important to him.
And while Ms. Birnbaum refers to the concern
about gaming the system, it's important to remember that
this was a case in which the juror in question, Stacey
Titus, actually came to the lawyer.  And if Mr. Warger
is unable to seek the admission of this evidence, he
will have no ability to obtain relief on his underlying
McDonough claim.
We would respectfully submit that the
judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the
