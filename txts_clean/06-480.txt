CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in case 06-480, Leegin Creative
Leather Products versus PSKS Incorporated. Mr. Olson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The per se illegality rule for resale price
maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated,
misguided and anticompetitive. It should be replaced
with the same rule of reason standard that applies to
other forms of vertically imposed marketing
restrictions.
The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable
restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies
a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a
restraint is unreasonable.
Per se rules should be rare and imposed only
where the court is virtually certain based upon
considerable economic experience that a practice is
nearly invariably anticompetitive. Vertical minimum
retail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not
invariably anticompetitive. In fact, a broad consensus
of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that
vertical restraints promote interbrand competition,
which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely,
if ever, anticompetitive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an argument
made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to
distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context,
that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made
with the dealers was more successful in getting a
horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers
had attempted it themselves, in which case some might
have held back.
MR. OLSON: Well, the economists who have
looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said
that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case. It
certainly could not be the case in this industry in
connection with this participant in the marketplace.
There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton
products are sold through. There are thousands and
thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of
products.
What the Court has said repeatedly is that
programs such as this may promote interbrand
competition, perhaps --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, suppose just
the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among
themselves on the price. Would that be lawful?
MR. OLSON: No. I think that that would be
covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say that it's
per se unlawful?
MR. OLSON: I think it would be, as
horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could
be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was
-- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way,
it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Why should that be any
different from the arrangement where those dealers all
got together in the convention and recommended to the
manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of
precisely the same dimensions? Why --
MR. OLSON: What this Court said in
Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan,
is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive
to increase --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm asking what if
he did, why should you draw a distinction?
MR. OLSON: Because the motivation for the
arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're
suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in
a particular area would get together to impose this on a
manufacturer. I think it's very unrealistic that that
would happen.
JUSTICE STEVENS: No. They just passed a
resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this
vertical restraint and ways to do it. Should that be
different from one in which the manufacturer does it
independently?
MR. OLSON: I think that if the manufacturer
makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would
like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in
Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of
course relationships between the dealers and the
manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in
doing this, because they may find for the same reason
that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of
products. The record is clear in this case that this
was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the
Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the
Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly
competitive marketplace, and it was successful.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe, Mr. Olson,
you could give us an example where the rule of reason
would find a violation in this situation?
MR. OLSON: Well, it might be a situation,
the economists have written about this, say that it
would be very rare, and would require retailers with a
strong powerful market power to impose a situation where
the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a
horizontal cartel. That certainly was not involved in
this case, and that would probably be found to violate
the rule of reason. In addition, it would probably be
unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this
Court. That was not an issue in this case. The
economists say that that would very seldom happen.
JUSTICE BREYER: You say very. Which
economists? I know the Chicago school tends to want
rule of reason and so forth. Professor Sherer is an
economist, isn't he? Worked at the FTC for a long time.
A good expert in the field. He points out the drug
industry after you got rid of -- after you got rid of
resale price maintenance, the margins fell 40 percent.
The drug stores it went down 20 percent. He says with
blue jeans, alone, it saved American consumers $200
million to get rid of it. And his conclusion is, as in
the uniform enforcement of resale price maintenance, the
restraints can impose massive anti-consumer benefits.
Massive.
MR. OLSON: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: What that sounds like is
that if at least he, who is an economist, thinks if you
get rid of Dr. Miles, every American will pay far more
for the goods that they buy at retail. Now that's one
economist, of course. There are other whose think
differently. So how should we decide this?
MR. OLSON: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: Should we overturn
Dr. Miles and run that risk?
MR. OLSON: In, in the vast majority of the
economist whose have looked at this have come out to the
opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer. Secondly --
JUSTICE BREYER: We're supposed to count
economists?
MR. OLSON: No. No. I think that --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that how we decide it?
(Laughter.)
MR. OLSON: But what this Court -- what this
Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such
as this where there's a consensus among leading
respected economists, that is one factor. There's
another factor --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I haven't seen a
consensus. A consensus? Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all
these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?
MR. OLSON: This is one factor that the
Court should consider and the Court has considered in
the past when dealing with something that the Court
itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically
schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain
vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with
respect to other vertical restraints. The Court -- the
Court itself has made those pronouncements.
The enforcing agencies have changed their
view with respect -- and they are here today, the
Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all
of whom have announced that they believe that it is very
rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as
this to be anticompetitive.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not so long
ago that the Department of Justice took a different
view. And of all of the vertical restraints, this is
the only one where Congress has been a player. I mean,
Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate. And
then it withdrew that. There's no other restraint where
they are has been congressional action, where the
argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of
this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if
they so will.
MR. OLSON: Essentially, the same argument
was made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania
case. The same argument was made just a term or two go
in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt
with tying arrangements. The same argument was made in
State Oil versus Khan. This Court has construed the
antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the
courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the
marketplace --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in those cases you
didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and
McGuire. That's what makes this -- this one different
in terms of congressional intention.
MR. OLSON: The repeal of those statutes,
Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules. It
was not a congressional expression against the rule of
reason --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but there was in the
patent case, though, Mr. Olson. We relied on the fact
that the patent law changed.
MR. OLSON: Yes, you did.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.
MR. OLSON: And that was a, that was one
factor, however, Justice Stevens. I think, as I read
that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact
that the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said
the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the
Weyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices
that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a
low threshold of illegality, especially low per se
illegality threshold. There were -- there have been --
it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly
said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a
substantial body of economic experience that shows us
that this practice --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what
about the reliance interest, though? I mean, hasn't a
whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance
on the Dr. Miles rule? And don't we need to be
concerned about the disruption to that established
practice?
MR. OLSON: There's really no evidence that
the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the
Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there evidence that
the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the
Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade?
So -- that there's that correlation.
MR. OLSON: Actually I looked into that,
Justice Souter. And me, my limited historical research
is that the -- those discounters were coming on strong
before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price,
whatever it was, act was passed in response to that.
There are -- the evidence basically shows
that -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand
competition that ultimately produces lower prices.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't know. We
have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of
the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called
resale price maintenance where he has five economists --
now maybe you're not going to count them as economists.
Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that
isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief
as single argument that isn't in the book.
There's one interesting thing about the
book. It was written in 1966. So I guess my question
is what's changed? Now I know two things have changed.
One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain,
and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that
when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices
went down. That's changed. And the second thing that's
changed is there's far more concentration, I gather,
today in the retail side of the market than there are
used to be, a factor which makes resale price
maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take
place at the request of the dealers.
Now, I see those two changes. My question
to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale
Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even
on Google, and -- what's changed? What's new?
MR. OLSON: Well, a number of things have
changed. The -- the number of respected individuals,
notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and
have focused on the marketplace, have said that because
it allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand
competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to
provide service, differences in the products. And other
things that have happened since then, are this Court's
decision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved
an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found
that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the
ruling -- the reason for a per se rule.
This Court's decision in State Oil versus
Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well
aware of where per se rules have systematically been
dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the
marketplace. This --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Olson, does brand
competition generally help retailers, or is this a
question that can't be answered?
MR. OLSON: Did you say inter --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Interbrand, interbrand
competition? Do retailers like interbrand competition?
MR. OLSON: Well, I don't know that -- I
don't know whether people like competition. But the
antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes
competition. And this Court has said that interbrand --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but we're talking
about inter -- we're talking about retailers. It, it
seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you
acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that
if the retailers themselves have this resale price
maintenance, it is invalid. Well, if the manufacturer
does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and
that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for
the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers,
then why shouldn't there be a per se rule? Why should
we allow the manufacturer to do something we that
wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the
retailers?
MR. OLSON: Well, the manufacturer is very
unlikely to do this for the convenience of the
retailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the
manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible
so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the
manufacturers' products as possible.
JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if, if indeed that's,
that's what he's aiming at, low price. Is it the object
of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to
produce low prices?
MR. OLSON: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was consumer
welfare.
MR. OLSON: Yes, yes, it is.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought some
consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.
MR. OLSON: Precisely.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it
would increase prices doesn't prove anything. It
doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare. If,
in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more
service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance
consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive
products at a lower price, wouldn't it?
MR. OLSON: That's -- that's absolutely
correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't know why, why we
should have to focus our entire attention on whether
it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not.
The market out there has different goods at different
prices which have different qualities that attract
different consumers.
MR. OLSON: I -- I agree completely. I
would like to reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has
said over and over again. If you -- the purpose of the
antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition,
because competition between competing manufacturers give
the consumers more choice. Some people may want the
cheapest product. Some people may want the product
that's more available to them. They may wish the return
policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that
the dealer provides. And in this marketplace
particularly, that system of providing competition is
consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced
success in the marketplace.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, before you sit
down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your
argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in
this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to
discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to
discount. And if that were true, as a matter of fact,
then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust
law, wouldn't it?
MR. OLSON: This -- but the case was never
litigated on that basis. It wasn't considered on that
basis in the Court of Appeals. It came up sort of as a
late thought in the opposition to the petition for
certiorari. But that is not this case. The case was
litigated on the per se rule of Dr. Miles.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in the complaint,.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
Mr. Hungar?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court.
The same considerations that led this Court
in Sylvania and State Oil to reject outmoded per se
rules compel that same result here. The Dr. Miles rule
conflicts with this Court's modern antitrust
jurisprudence in three fatal --
JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I'll put my question,
which is really just one for this. I understand
perfectly that the per se rule is a result of balancing
differ things. Of course, resale price maintenance does
raise prices, and it is very often anticompetitive. Of
course, sometimes, there are good reasons for it that
might help consumers.
Now, in addition, you need clear rules. Now
those three sets of things require a balance. And we
have a hundred years of history where this Court and
Congress and others have balanced those three sets of
considerations, and they've come out one way. Now, the
Department of Justice wants to rebalance them and come
out the other way.
There are good arguments on both sides. Why
should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the
absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that
that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a
difficult area of people reaching a slightly different
weight on some these three sets of things?
MR. HUNGAR: Several reasons, Your Honor.
It's not -- it's not a close question whether this Court
under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial
matter would impose a per se rule in this context.
There is economic -- there is consensus among the
respected economists --
JUSTICE BREYER: I would think it is quite a
close question.
MR. HUNGAR: I don't think you, Your Honor.
Given that --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right, even so. Go
ahead.
MR. HUNGAR: Given that this Court's test,
the question this Court's modern cases ask, in
distinguishing between the rule of reason and the per se
rule, is whether the challenged conduct is always or
almost always anticompetitive. That's what the Court
has said.
JUSTICE BREYER: Price fixing, horizontal, I
guess, or territorial divisions, we should overturn
those too.
MR. HUNGAR: Certainly not, Your Honor.
Because that, that is almost always anticompetitive in
our experience and in the experience of the courts. But
the same is not true in the resale price maintenance
context. Dr. Miles has foreclosed the courts from
conducting the kind of analysis that would actually look
into this question. But the empirical data that are
available would suggest that anticompetitive
explanations for resale price maintenance do not have
very much explanatory power. When you actually look at
the cases that have been litigated, they involve
manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated
markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases
of any cartelization going on. So the anticompetitive
explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do
not appear to explain most of the retail price
maintenance that has been litigated. It's true that
retail price maintenance can but does not always result
in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out,
price is not the only thing that consumers care about.
And there is widespread consensus in the economic
literature and in this Court's recent cases that
price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price
based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce
intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand
competition.
In Monsanto and Business Electronics,
this Court made clear that price vertical restraints,
like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in
fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the
non-price vertical restraints to which this Court now
applies rule of reason analysis. So the reason in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't your argument
also apply to a conspiracy among the New York dealers in
this product just to fix prices? Because there's plenty
of interbrand competition, I think. I don't think you
can say it's absolutely clear that that would always be
anti-competitive because they would also agree to
provide additional services.
MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because
horizontal -- the important thing to keep in mind is
that the incentive of the manufacturer when the
manufacturer --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about a case
in which it's the dealers who want to agree to provide
extra services at higher prices as their method of
better serving the public and they all agree that they
have to be conscious about the competition from other
brands. Why can we be absolutely certain that's always
going to be harmful to the consumer?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the reason why we
know that is always or almost always harmful is that the
incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel,
just like the incentives of the participants in a
manufacturing cartel --
JUSTICE STEVENS: They might be precisely
the statement as the manufacturers: We think we'll make
more, all make more money if we concentrate on service
rather than price.
MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the
manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits
of the retailers, but the retailers when they get
together obviously have a very different incentive,
which is not to benefit the manufacturer.
JUSTICE BREYER: What you say is right.
What you say there is right. I feel I'm back in 1966.
The argument against that is, we don't know which way
the push comes. The large retailers, Home Depot,
whatever they are, huge retailers, they want -- or maybe
it isn't the discounters, it's some other once. We
don't know which way. You're throwing it into court.
You're throwing it before 12 people who may or may not
work this thing out. So the argument against what
you're saying is not logic. It's empirical and
administrative.
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it was. That's
what it is now, I guess.
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in State Oil the
same argument was made. The argument was made that,
while we don't have compelling empirical evidence that
Albrecht results in harm to the economy, we don't have
compelling empirical evidence that resale price
maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, is
generally pro-competitive, and in the absence of such
empirical evidence there's no basis for overturning
precedent. This Court unanimously --
JUSTICE SOUTER: We do have empirical
evidence, though, don't we, that the decision of this
case is going to be very significant in the sort of
battle between Wal-Mart and the Main Street stores; and
why should this Court in effect take a shot in the dark
at resolving that, as distinct from leaving it to
Congress, which is in a position to know more about
where the shot is going to land than we are?
MR. HUNGAR: This Court -- I'm sorry.
There's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about
what impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the
Wal-Marts of the world.
JUSTICE SOUTER: That's my point. But it
seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence
that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and
the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with
the elimination of price maintenance by the States.
MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor.
In fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the
world began during the fair trade era.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They began, but they have
flourished in the post-fair trade era.
MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, but I think
considerations likes the opening up of international
trade and the development of markets like China to
supply low-cost goods have a lot more to do with the
success of the Wal-Marts of the world than a rule like
Dr. Miles.
Remember, it's perfectly legal under current
law for manufacturers to impose the same sort of
constraints as long as they do it by fiat and unilateral
enforcement rather than by agreement. So the suggestion
that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy
if Dr. Miles is overruled is simply unsupportable.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's
the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's
perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?
MR. HUNGAR: As the Ping amicus brief, the
Ping Golf Club Manufacturer amicus brief, indicates it's
extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the
Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom
resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy
like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many
circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption
that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without
further discussion for discounting one item in order to
keep your policy in place.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that answer
your argument that there isn't reason to believe that
there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes,
because now it's going to be easy?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in 1945 during the
height of the fair trade era the FTC did a study which
concluded only about 5 percent of the economy was
affected by fair trade. And the fair trade regime,
remember, is a different and more extreme regime. There
it was per se legality, not rule of reason. So it's
just -- there's just no basis for these assertions that
somehow the economy is going to be massively changed.
But it is also perfectly clear and undisputed that there
are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a
manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance. It will
enhance its ability to compete and it will provide
consumers more of what they want, and that is a good
thing and the antitrust laws should not automatically
foreclose that merely because in a small percentage of
cases it is conceivable that there can be
anticompetitive effects.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it fair to say that
there is reason to believe that there may be a massive
reorientation in the retail economy if Dr. Miles goes?
And that gets to my problem, why should we be the people
to make a guess as opposed to the Congress as the
institution to make the guess?
MR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of any reason to
believe that, Your Honor, based on the historical record
and based on the modern realities. The Wal-Marts of the
world have succeeded because of their discounting
strategy. That's not going to change, and manufacturers
have an incentive to have their goods sold through those
stores and that's not going to change either in the vast
majority of cases. And With respect --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the rule of reason is
the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly,
from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case
would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never
get to trial. How do you think the rule of reason would
operate if it were the rubric under which this case were
to be decided?
MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think it would
operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would
be required to establish an anticompetitive effect
resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that
burden is overcome the defendant would be required to
come up with some legitimate business justification,
some pro-competitive results that outweigh that. And
only if they could do that would they succeed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the formula,
but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that
the plaintiff could never get across the first
threshold?
MR. HUNGAR: We don't agree with that, Your
Honor. In cases where resale price maintenance is being
used to facilitate cartelization, either at the
manufacturer or the retail level, the plaintiff could
prevail. Also in, for example, in an oligopolistic
market.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this case, this
case has none of those features.
MR. HUNGAR: Well, right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin loses under the
rule of reason, right?
MR. HUNGAR: We don't know that. It seems
likely to assume that, though, and that's not a bad
thing. Leegin is obviously not dominant in the market.
It's obviously not going to succeed unless what it is
offering at a higher price is what consumers want, and
that is a good thing under the antitrust laws.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Hungar.
MR. HUNGAR: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Coykendall.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. COYKENDALL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COYKENDALL: Thank you, Mr. Chief
Justice, and may it please the Court:
As recently as last month, this Court
restated a guiding principle of antitrust jurisprudence:
Discouraging price cuts and depriving consumers of low
prices is bad antitrust policy. RPM prohibits price --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? I mean, You
really think that antitrust policy means when -- any
arrangement that produce a higher price is bad?
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, we aren't talking
about any arrangement --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a lot of consumers
want, you know, extended warranties. They want show
rooms where they can go and look at things. All of
which costs more money. And where you can not have
resale price maintenance the customers -- or you have
the free rider problem. The customers shop at the place
that has the big show room, likes at all the product
there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has
not incurred that expense.
Now, I just don't think that all the
customers want is cheap. I think they want other things
besides cheap. I think they want service. I think they
want selection. I think they want the ability to view
goods and so forth. Why do you discount all of those
things?
MR. COYKENDALL: I don't discount all those
things. All those things are available under our
current regime where we have a per se prohibition
against resale price maintenance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they aren't
available. This company thought that it could provide
higher service if it could assure its retailers that
they would not be undercut by people who are not
providing that kind of service.
MR. COYKENDALL: And there's no question
that even the plaintiff in this case was providing that
service. He was providing it more efficiently and he
just wanted to pass those efficiencies on.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't know that
there's no question about that. There's certainly no
question that this company was successful in breaking
into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring
its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the
service.
MR. COYKENDALL: The record shows that with
this specific company, most of the growth of its sales
occurred before it established a resale price
maintenance policy. So there are no demonstrated
benefits from this company of imposing and enforcing a
resale price maintenance policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your main
objection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of
reason. Why, why can't the rule of reason work to
promote the objectives you've just articulated?
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, as a practical matter
for someone in my position, or plaintiff's position,
it's impossible for a small dealer to muster the
resources in order to put forth -- CHIEF JUSTICE
ROBERTS: For a small dealer. But as we've already
heard, the dealers who engage in the discount policy are
prices like Target and Wal-Mart. Those aren't small
dealers. Those are behemoths in the retailing industry.
MR. COYKENDALL: I would suggest that those
are not the people that really are being protected by
this particular per se prohibition. It is the small mom
and pop operation like my client that wants to innovate
and expand and pass on efficiencies and compete with the
big discounters who might have power of their own in
order to secure discounts.
JUSTICE ALITO: So you don't agree with the
argument that we've heard this morning that the
transformation of American retailing since the 1970s and
the rise of the large-scale low-price retailers has
anything to do with the end of the fair trade laws and
that overruling Dr. Miles would reverse that?
MR. COYKENDALL: No, I absolutely agree with
that. But it's resale price maintenance that enables
these initiators, these small companies, these small
operations, to grow and innovate, achieve the
efficiencies, and pass those on, attract customers by
reducing prices. And all that is stopped by imposition
of a resale price --
JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest
that the large-scale low-price retailers who were
supposedly dependent on Dr. Miles are -- support its
retention? Have they filed amicus briefs here or
otherwise suggested that this is essential to their
continuing operation?
MR. COYKENDALL: Again, the large-scale
dominant players in the retail industry have their own
market power. They don't need the protection of the
per se rule in order to enforce them. It's the next
generation that this rule really aims to protect.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I
mean, if it was really the case that they were going to
be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been
here. I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the
Targets. They're not here on amicus briefs because
they're -- what they're selling is cheap. They are
selling price, and people who want low price and for
whom that's of value above all other things are going to
continue to go to those stores. So they're not going to
be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to
provide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try
to keep the price as low as possible -- but service.
I just don't see what, what harm can
possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance,
from allowing some people to make their money on service
and -- rather than cheap price.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again I would suggest
that under this current system the way it is we have
both the full service providers of complete service that
offer goods at a certain price and we have discounters
selling those same goods. There is currently a mix of
service and price that better serves the economy than
just having one cookie cutter -- a one size fits all
approach that you would have with resale price
maintenance.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought the per se
rule was the cookie cutter approach.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, in terms of
prohibiting price or in terms of, yes, prohibiting price
fixing, that's true. But it permits stores to have full
price and full service and charge high prices for that
service, and it permits discounters to reduce price,
reduce service and cater to those customers who want the
goods with lower service.
JUSTICE BREYER: The Internet -- is it --
you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in
this argument, you would have said that it's the large
discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of
the world who want to get rid of retail price
maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops. Okay.
They're in now, they're big, and they may want to
maintain resale prices because they may want to extract
the other profit, while the Internet little company
comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper.
Now I can imagine circumstances like you
say. I can imagine they're not like you say. I don't
know. And so what should I do if I really don't know?
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there is no doubt
that resale price maintenance raises prices to
consumers. The only economic doubt is whether there are
any redeeming effects of those prices; and that's where
the economic dispute of this is.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the
Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that
it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the
current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices
because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of
those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where
something other than price is important, and they have
to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, I would
suggest that, first of all, eliminating the per se rule
would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate
doctrine. If they want to impose resale price
maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned
approach, they would have to go --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even with the tremendous
anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the
manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do
it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that
won't go along? Those two are substitute of each other.
Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but
we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have
to do it on your own, and then you have to do the
draconian thing of terminating the dealer.
MR. COYKENDALL: I believe that anomaly
really lies at the heart of the Sherman Antitrust Act
which is aimed at contracts, combinations and
conspiracies. Unilateral conduct isn't reached by that,
it's the price of being in a fair country. People can
deal in ways that they want to with this particular
issue.
But again, eliminating the per se rule will
not help Ping out if they want to maintain their retail
price maintenance as legal, as unilateral. They'll
still have to go through these same machinations.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why
can't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point
was they would just put in their contracts, you have to
sell it at this price, and they could enforce the
contracts, rather than having to have these machinations
of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an
agreement with their retailers.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, again, then they
would be subject to a rule of reason analysis and the
uncertainties occasioned with that as to whether this
contract is lawful. If they want to avoid that, then of
course, they would have to stick with the Colgate
doctrine.
Your Honor, this particular case, we have
clear evidence that RPM was used to facilitate a
horizontal retailer cartel. We have evidence in the
briefs that Leegin would gather its dealers in a dealer
meeting, discuss the policy, agree to changes, and reach
a consensus, and then enforce that policy against
everyone.
One of the evils of resale price maintenance
is specifically this: It does facilitate the formation
of cartels.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but the conspiracy
that it facilitated was just with intrabrand
competition. There wasn't conspiracy that affected
interbrand competition.
MR. COYKENDALL: Retail --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So I'm not sure that
economically it makes any difference whether the dealers
are the one who decide to do it or the manufacturer was,
or they all did it at the same time.
MR. COYKENDALL: Horizontal conspiracies,
even among a single brand, has always been a per se
violation of the antitrust law. You can look back at
the --
JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if we say the rule
or reason should apply to all cases that just affect
intrabrand competition, I'm not sure why we should keep
this outmoded rule about horizontal conspiracies that
only affect intrabrand competition.
MR. COYKENDALL: There you're striking
really at the heart of the -- the heart of the Sherman
Act, et al., holding that horizontal conspiracies, which
nobody believes promote competition, could be justified
under the same thinking.
JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's a totally -- I
cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers
could ever produce consumer welfare. It will be a
horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the
consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to
impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to
give the retailer as much -- more money than the
retailer is now making. He's going to try to keep their
margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell
as many of his products as possible consistent with his
desire to sell his product by attaching to it more
service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever.
You know, horizontal conspiracy, the
incentives are entirely different. When you're dealing
with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is
still to keep the price as low as possible consistent
with the additional good that he wants to give consumers
to attract those consumers to his product.
MR. COYKENDALL: In this particular case
there is a complete alignment of incentives, because the
manufacturer was also a retailer competing in this
market. He has the incentive to increase retailer
profits.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that's the case
and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would
allow you to make that argument. But you -- but you
want to say it's bad across the board for everybody. If
indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the
rule of reason would allow you to argue that.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, Your Honor, we would
suggest that the horizontal conspiracy between Leegin as
a retailer and the other retailers offering his products
is more than just a rule of reason approach. That would
be per se illegal under this Court's precedents.
Retail price maintenance also has the
problem we discussed earlier of perpetuating incumbent
forms of distribution at the expense of the innovative
and more efficient distribution means. Retailers, in
retail competition matters, retailers should be entitled
to innovate, pass efficiencies along to customers in the
form of lower prices, attract new customers, and grow in
that manner.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Coykendall, the -- on
the question -- you alleged in the complaint that there
was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce
it, Leegin?
MR. COYKENDALL: Leegin.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Leegin. And Mr. Olson
says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?
MR. COYKENDALL: That particular aspect was
referred to; it wasn't pursued as a separate part of
this. Prior to trial, the judge did rule that the
Dr. Miles line of cases applied and the conduct would be
judged under the per se rule. So certain aspects with
respect to the horizontal conspiracy and the differences
in discounts -- I mean, developed that much.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose you were to lose,
you would still have that claim, I take it?
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, yes. We would
suggest the record is sufficient that on remand the
instruction given the jury as to the standard by which
their conduct could be judged could be sustained as a
per se violation under the rules related to horizontal
conspiracies as well. And again, I would suggest that
perhaps if the Court doesn't reach that, it should
remand to the Fifth Circuit for them to consider whether
that is a possibility.
Resale price maintenance can distort
consumer choice. The retailers -- so the person comes
into the store -- the retailers can exercise pressure to
influence the selection of higher margin products over
ones that may better fit the consumer needs. That is an
evil of resale price maintenance, whether or not it does
promote efficiencies.
And if resale price maintenance does act as
it is theorized, to increase retailer services, some
consumers will be worse off, they'll be paying for
services they don't want.
There are alternatives to RPM.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't suppose there's any
-- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against
the fallout to the consumer, is there? I mean if
indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a
product that's more expensive than what he needs or --
and what he wants, is this a real argument against this,
that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned?
I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the
situation.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, if -- what you're
doing is you're building in this high margin that gives
the retailer an incentive to do that. If there is no
resale price maintenance so that margin isn't
guaranteed, the incentive disappears. What is clear is
that retail -- resale price maintenance is a blunt
instrument to achieve any economies.
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're assuming that the --
that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale
price good. Why do you assume that?
MR. COYKENDALL: That's the only incentive,
the only reason for imposing resale prices
JUSTICE SCALIA: He's only going to be given
the thing if he does the kind of additional service that
the manufacturer wants. That's the whole purpose of it.
And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin
just as low as he can consistent with the -- you know --
consistent with selling as many products as he can.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, there are more
efficient ways than RPM to achieve any benefits of
efficiency, such as contracts with the retailers to
provide those additional demand creating services. He
could pay the retailers to provide those services. He
could provide those services directly, I would suggest.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would you argue
that those are more efficient than resale price
maintenance?
MR. COYKENDALL: The resale price
maintenance amounts to nothing more than throwing money
at the problem. You're guaranteeing a margin and you're
hoping that it's going to be used somehow for the
consumer's benefit, and you've got no guarantee that any
dealer is going to use the margin that they're
guaranteed in any way to service the consumers.
And I would suggest that in geographically
isolated areas --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can add
the contractual provisions you were talking about to a
contract that has a minimum resale price. The minimum
resale price is to take away the incentive from the
retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.
MR. COYKENDALL: If you have a contract
requiring those services, you don't need the minimum
resale price. That's just completely unnecessary. And
that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on
those efficiencies to its consumers.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that presume a
contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for
the service?
MR. COYKENDALL: It could be. It may not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If not, I don't see how
that would work under your rule.
MR. COYKENDALL: Well, under -- the idea is
the manufacturer chooses to deal with only those dealers
that offer this particular service. They sign a
contract to provide that service. If they don't want to
provide that service, they don't sign the contract,
these don't get the goods. It's as simple as that.
If the question is providing a larger margin
to the dealer, the most efficient way is for the
manufacturer simply to lower their wholesale price, and
the margin the dealer receives is higher.
Again, if there are other efficiencies, they
might be achieved by exclusive territories as permitted
by Sylvania or by the Colgate doctrine.
I would suggest the experience of the 30
years following the elimination of the fair trade laws
have shown the wisdom of the Dr. Miles decision which
places faith in the free market system. This Court
should continue to honor its precedents and respect the
will of Congress by adhering to the Dr. Miles rule.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your reference to
the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation
that supports the result you seek.
MR. COYKENDALL: Your Honor, as this Court
observed in Sylvania, Congress by repealing the
Miller-Tydings McGuire Act did indicate its support for
the per se rule. I believe the Court should adhere to
that holding as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Underwood?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD
ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
When a manufacturer agrees with its
retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point
of the agreement is to prevent price competition among
retailers, to prevent discounts. For almost 100 years
the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act
to prohibit such price fixing agreements. Any change in
that fundamental understanding of the statute should be
made by Congress and not by this Court.
The per se rule against resale price
maintenance is different in at least three ways from
other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned.
First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled
law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by
this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also been
settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that
manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more
inefficiently. Doesn't it make sense to allow them to
adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already
completely legal?
MS. UNDERWOOD: No. That tension that you
-- that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a
result of the fact that the antitrust rule -- law does
not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior. It prohibits
agreements that are anti -- that restrain competition.
And so it will often be the case that it is
possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that
has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately
the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that
line because of a different value, a value in preserving
the independent action of individuals.
It is, however --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's often the
case. Give me some other examples where you can achieve
the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.
MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, as you have observed,
virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished
by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing
function and become one entity instead of two entities.
Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is
eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates
the whole function, is -- can fix prices, fix his, what
are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of
the antitrust laws. There are other reasons why a
manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that
integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to
be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid
the prohibitions of the antitrust law.
It is also -- so, this is old and well
settled. Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial
restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it
was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum
resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years
after it was established, this has a much more settled
pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up
around it.
Second, it was endorsed and relied on by
Congress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and
relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair
trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this
Court is now asked to interpret.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Were they relying on
Dr. Miles or were they relying on us? That's the
question.
MS. UNDERWOOD: They were relying --
JUSTICE SCALIA: They left the situation
where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as
determined by this Court, and we had shown our
willingness to update the antitrust law when sound
economic doctrine suggests is necessary.
MS. UNDERWOOD: No. The legislative history
described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's
brief shows that actually they were returning the law to
the per se rule against resale price maintenance because
they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should
be prohibited.
This is -- it is also true that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But of course, they
could always pass a law saying that if their intent is
so clear. They didn't do that here.
MS. UNDERWOOD: That's true, they did not do
that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only
that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has
established in the antitrust area, this rule has
received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the
Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn
the rule should be at its peek as compared with those
other rules.
And third, price is different. This Court
has said that price competition is the central nervous
system of the economy. Other restraints, to be sure,
might indirectly affect price, but not with the same
absolute force. Territorial restraints don't absolutely
prevent price competition because customers can travel
or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under
territorial restraints there are often multiple
retailers in a particular territory who can compete.
Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at
all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really
Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which
case the Court in Khan said it's illegal.
Manufacturers can of course pay retailers
for the services that enhance the product that are being
advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price
maintenance. But the question for this Court is whether
the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing
agreement to make that payment to buy those services,
and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide
in a rule of reason trial. That's a question of
statutory interpretation for this Court. It's a
question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer
can use to buy those retailer services.
It's also true that the claim that
price-fixing works to induce those services is both
debatable and untested. The retailers have no
obligations to provide services under the retail price
maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other
cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they could. I
mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you
have to charge this much and because you have to charge
this much you also have to provide the training, the
service, whatever the non-price inducements are.
MS. UNDERWOOD: You could. You could also
require those things without resale price maintenance
and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise
the price to pay for that or to provide it so
efficiently that he could in effect engage --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the
retailer, but then the retailer might have a real
incentive not to do a good job on the service because
they really want to market it for price, not for
service.
MS. UNDERWOOD: That really depends, doesn't
it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if
it's correct, if the manufacturer -- if the claim on
behalf of the manufacturer here is correct that what the
customers want is service, the retailers are in at least
as good a position to identify that fact as not.
I think the point --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there you
have the free rider problem, which is you go to the
fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then
you buy it at the discount store.
MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That's at its peak,
perhaps, when you're talking about electronics. When
the shopping experience alone is what is thought to be
the benefit, which is often the case, you can't free
ride on that. You either shop in the place where you
like to shop or you shop -- or you have a different
shopping experience in Target.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But some manufacturers want
their product associated with excellent service, high
warranty, and all of that. And there is no way to get
that uniformly for that product without this kind
of agreement.
MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there is. The
manufacturer can contract for it. The manufacturer can
decline to deal with people who don't provide it. The
very same point that was being made earlier.
I think that the point here is that
permitting resale price maintenance would be such a
drastic change in the longstanding settled
interpretation of the Sherman Act that it doesn't really
qualify as the kind of common law evolution that this
Court has said is appropriate ordinarily in making
antitrust rules under the Sherman Act. If that change
is to be made at all, it should be made by Congress and
not by this Court.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct on the
congressional point that there was a period when
Congress would have prohibited the Solicitor General
from making the argument he made today?
MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, there was such a
period. And this Court noted that fact in --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So there was a legislative
expression of a position on this particular issue?
MS. UNDERWOOD: There was a legislative
expression of position on this particular issue.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that no longer
is applicable?
MS. UNDERWOOD: That is -- the Solicitor
General is no longer barred from making that argument,
as is evidenced today. What he --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess Congress changed
its mind then.
MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I think Congress found
it unnecessary or perhaps questioned the wisdom or
constitutionality of barring the Solicitor General from
making particular arguments.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to believe
that.
(Laughter.)
MS. UNDERWOOD: But Congress has
consistently -- well, and the repeal -- the reason the
repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly
relevant is that it is indeed -- it was an amendment to
this statute that this Court is being asked to
interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning
of this statute as it stands.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: As Mr. Olson pointed out,
under the fair trade laws this was per se legal. So
that's kind of a different thing.
MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. But when Congress
repealed that, there were considerable -- there was
considerable expression of legislative history, for
those who find legislative history helpful, that
declared opposition to resale price maintenance, not
simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes
hurtful. So to the extent Congress's intent can be
gleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent
to return to the regime of per se illegality.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe on the year by
year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided
that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has
used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?
MS. UNDERWOOD: It has, but I would question
the wisdom of that technique as a method of expressing
Congress's views. The fact that Congress went so far as
to use it once suggests a very strong view indeed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Underwood.
Mr. Olson, you have 3 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OLSON: The Respondent and its amici
seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil
versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a
single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate
interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand
competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand
competition on matters of service and availability and
other things in addition to price. The Respondent and
their amici seem to have acknowledged these
pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a
contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then
have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a
Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a
blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with
which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits
even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small
problems.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're just giving
them an additional ground for termination.
MR. OLSON: Pardon me?
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're just giving, you're
just suggesting we should give them an additional ground
for termination.
MR. OLSON: No. What we're suggesting is
that the agreement is something, the details can be
worked out. The manufacturer can -- and the Ping brief
explains this. The manufacturer can go to the retailer
and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your
sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because
we want to be dealing together. The antitrust laws --
in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or
they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire
all your retailers.
The benefits of these type of arrangements
provide the consumers with choices. It stimulates
interbrand competition. It promotes intrabrand
competition on things other than price. It provides
consumers with more choices. It ultimately gives more
freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its
products, to enter the marketplace.
These are things that the Court has said,
and provides a more varied market price. The court has
repeatedly raid that the presumptive rule is a rule of
reason. Per se rules should be crossed out or not
adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is
invariably anticompetitive. This practice, as
acknowledged, is procompetitive. It provides many
opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical
restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price
area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of
reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a
rigid per se rule that cannot be changed.
And as this Court has repeatedly held,
Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and
the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to
continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the
antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the
benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules
which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do
something that's rational in the marketplace, to give
consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that
is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare
makes no sense at all.
For all those reasons, the rule of reason in
this area, as in the other areas, should replace the
per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the
end of the day.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Olson.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., The case in the
