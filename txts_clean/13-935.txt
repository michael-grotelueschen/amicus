CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument
next in Case 13-935, Wellness International Network v.
Sharif.
Ms. Steege.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. STEEGE:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Stern v. Marshall held that a bankruptcy
judge may, consistent with Article III, enter judgment
in an action that stems from the bankruptcy itself.
The claim at issue in this case meets that
test.  Wellness asked the bankruptcy court to decide the
first and most fundamental question that arises in every
bankruptcy case, what property became part of the debtor
Sharif's bankruptcy estate under Bankruptcy Code
Section 541 on the day Mr. Sharif filed for bankruptcy.
As this Court recognized over 100 years ago
in Mueller v. Nugent, it is essential that bankruptcy
judges have that authority.  As long as there have been
bankruptcy laws, there have been debtors like Mr. Sharif
who devised creative ways to keep property in their own
possession and out of the hands of their trustees and
creditors.  Here, Mr. Sharif's case is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But we've already held
that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor is an
Article III violation, is a Stern claim, essentially.
MS. STEEGE:  Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Or non-Stern claim.  So
why isn't this the same thing?
MS. STEEGE:  Because this action is a
case --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it's not the
same thing because he actually possessed this trust,
it's in his name as trustee --
MS. STEEGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- and so it's a little
bit -- it's a lot different, but --
MS. STEEGE:  Yes.  But the allegations of
the complaint were that Mr. Sharif owned the property
and to the extent the trust existed, it should be
ignored by virtue of the way he handled his property.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, but -- but that's
the same in a fraudulent conveyance.  It was his
property and he was just trying to deny his other
creditors the benefit of that money.  So it's not quite
that.
MS. STEEGE:  Well, it's different, Your
Honor, because in a fraudulent transfer claim, the
debtor actually passes title over to someone, under the
definition of 548 or the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But here, he's claiming
that the beneficiary has title.
MS. STEEGE:  Yes, but that's the very
dispute that the Court was asked to decide under
Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum, the issue is not what
the debtor claims his title is, but whether he has
actual possession.  And so here -- the assets what we
have here are the condominium that he lives in and he's
lived in for 20 years, a pharmacy business, he's a
pharmacist, that he's been operating for many years and
that in the past, he had reported as his business on his
personal tax return; we have his own personal retirement
account that somehow inexplicably ended up in the
mother's grantor trust and then we have bank accounts
that he owned.
And so the allegations of the complaint were
that he really owned this and this charade that he put
up in front of the bankruptcy court of saying, this is
owned in a trust, that was the dispute the court had to
consider.
And a way, I think, to think of it as
differently from a fraudulent transfer action, where
you're going against a true third party to whom title
has passed, that chosen action, the intangible right to
sue on the fraudulent transfer claim, or as in Stern,
the right to bring the breach of contract or tort claim
in these other cases, that asset, the right to sue
exists in the estate at the time of its creation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  The ben -- who is the
beneficiary of this trust?  His sister, right?
MS. STEEGE:  Well, that's --
JUSTICE ALITO:  That's what's claimed.
MS. STEEGE:  That's what's claimed, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And so what would be the
effect of a declaration by the bankruptcy court that --
that Respondent was the alter ego; that it was actually
his property?  The sister -- would the sister be bound
by that judgment?  Would the sister have to appear in
the bankruptcy court as if she were a creditor?
MS. STEEGE:  Well, yes, she would be bound
because if we accept their characterization, the
trustee, through his litigation conduct, binds the
beneficiary under well-established Illinois law, the law
of -- of it's just basic trust law.  But more importantly,
she did appear in this action.  She appeared through
counsel.  She, too, was subpoenaed.  She, too, failed to
produce the trust documents in response to requests.
She was given notice of the case as a creditor,um and could
have filed a claim.  And there was a safety valve for
her and she's, in fact, exercised her ability to -- to
have that safety valve.  She could have filed a proof of
claim in the case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would the –would the court,
the bankruptcy court, have had the power to notify her or to
subpoena her to come in as a party?
MS. STEEGE:  Yes, because if -- if she was a
necessary party to the action, the normal rules of
Federal Civil Procedure apply through the bankruptcy
rules and she would have been required to be brought in.
She's not a necessary party under the construct they
created.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because she's the
representative.  Right.
MS. STEEGE:  They -- they created this construct
of this trust --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So am I right about the
basic facts?  Creditor wants some money from debtor,
who's in bankruptcy; creditor says, I look at your list
of assets, it seems to me something's missing.  I have a
piece of paper here that you filed one year ago at the
bank which says you have $5 million more.
MS. STEEGE:  Right.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Where is that on the list?
He thinks about it and he says, oh, yeah, there was
5 million more, but that wasn't mine.  That belonged to
Saudi Arabia.  Or that belonged to my cousin.  Or -- and
so they say, let's prove it.  And that's what we're at
issue.  That's what's at issue.
MS. STEEGE:  That's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Can the bankruptcy court,
it happens here, that the claim is not Saudi Arabia, the
claim is not my cousin, the claim is that the $5 million
was a living trust of which there seems to be very
little record, which belonged to his mother.  But in
principle, it's no different, is it, in your view?
MS. STEEGE:  No.  That's exactly what we
have here.
JUSTICE BREYER:  It's a simple claim.  But
we'll hear from the other side, which will say it's very
different.
MS. STEEGE:  Right.  And that is the basis
of bankruptcy.  If we -- if we think about what
bankruptcy is and what it has historically always has
been, it's been about the in rem jurisdiction of the
court to take control of the debtor's property.  And
this case really is easy because the debtor is in
possession of the property, the nature of this property
he's personally --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that the only basis for
distinguishing Stern?
MS. STEEGE:  No, it's not, Your Honor.
There's a number of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What else?
MS. STEEGE:  Okay.  This is decided as a
matter of Federal law.  Section 541 determines what
comes into the estate and what doesn't.  It's not --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Whether there's a trust or
not is not a question of Federal law, is it?
MS. STEEGE:  But the question of whether
something belongs to the bankruptcy estate is a Federal
question, even if State law informs the answer.  This
Court's precedent --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well --
MS. STEEGE:  -- in other -- under other
statutes.  It's Law v. Siegel last year indicated --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a question of Federal
law even if State provides the answer. I – I don’t know
what that means.
MS. STEEGE:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's --
the Court has Interpreted federal statutes dealing with
property rights, the Paulsen --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that wasn't the case in
Stern?
MS. STEEGE:  That was not the case in Stern.
The claim there was --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, likewise there, what
was in the estate is a question of Federal law, even if
State law provided the answer.
MS. STEEGE:  The difference here would be if
there had been a dispute between the debtor and Stern
and her bankruptcy trustee over who got the right to go
sue Pierce, the -- the son-in-law, that would have been
this case.  That would have been the 541 question.
The chosen  action is what exists in the
estate at the time of its creation.  And so that chose
of action, when you go out and you seek to go liquidate
that, bring the lawsuit, that's the augmenting-type
claim that the Court has talked about in its precedent
in Stern and in Northern Pipeline.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose that Illinois law,
and suppose that Illinois law governs the -- this -- the
issue of the trust, and suppose Illinois law says that
when a -- when it is held that the trustee is -- that --
that the trust is the trustee's alter ego, that the
property does not become the -- that the -- the property
at issue does not become the property of the trustee
until there is a judicial declaration that that -- that
occurs.
MS. STEEGE:  Well, I don't think that
changes the analysis, because, ultimately, in a
bankruptcy case, if you're going to have to have a
dispute with the debtor --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's -- that would be a
question of the status of this under Illinois law --
MS. STEEGE:  Correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:  -- not under Federal law,
right?
MS. STEEGE:  It would inform the decision.
But, ultimately, whether the property comes into the
estate or not is determined under Section 541.  And so
the -- the court of appeals, who have addressed this
issue, and we list a number of those cases in the third
footnote in our brief, all are very uniform.  They are
looking to State law in a variety of different contexts
to figure out what the debtor's rights are in the
property because that's the Butner decision of this
Court.
But, ultimately, when you make that final
determination that it is property of the estate, you
look to 541.  And Congress would have intended that
disputes over trusts be part of that 541 determination
by its inclusion of Section 541(d), which talks about
what title the debtor holds, whether it's legal title or
equitable title, which is directly, you know, driven
toward trusts because that's when you have a division of
title.  And so it was intended that Federal law would
cover that.
And I also think that, you know, a -- a key
difference between this and Stern in the form of claim
that we have here is this is being brought against the
debtor.  This isn't being brought against a third party
who's been hauled into bankruptcy court against their
will.  The debtor has chosen to file a bankruptcy,
knowing by virtue of the statute that he or she will be
required to turn over their property to the bankruptcy
trustee; that there may be disputes over that.  And
there can be legitimate disputes.  It doesn't
necessarily just have to be a dishonest debtor, like we
would contend we have here.  And that they're going to
be in front of the bankruptcy judge in the first
instance having those disputes determined.
It's part of the Federal scheme, exactly
what bankruptcy is supposed to accomplish, which is to
get all of the debtor's property put into the bankruptcy
estate for distribution to creditors.  That's the
central key point of every bankruptcy case.
And if you don't do that, you lose your
discharge like Mr. Sharif.  It really is -- this action
really is the flip side of the denial of his discharge,
which no one disputes the bankruptcy judge had the
authority to decide.
She couldn't decide if he should receive a
discharge if we didn't know what it was he was supposed
to be doing in the case in terms of the property that he
had.
And the two claims really overlap each
other; they're the flip side of each other.  That's why
I think this is different than a cause of action against
a third party such as you had in Stern or Northern
Pipeline or Granfinanciera and the like.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you've not explored
the consent question completely.
MS. STEEGE:  Sure.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Basically the argument
that the SG and the -- of you and the SG is that you
need express consent -- or I guess the other side,
saying you need express consent and they didn't give
express consent.  How do you get around that?
MS. STEEGE:  Well, Your Honor, we think that
you don't need it.  The Court has held and ruled that
implied consent is permissible.  The argument is based
upon the bankruptcy rule, Bankruptcy Rule 7012.  And if
you look at Section 157(c), it uses the term "express
consent" and then just the term "consent."  In
connection with Section 157(c)(2), which deals with the
consent of a litigant to proceed to judgment on a
noncore Stern claim, it uses the word "consent."  So if
we assume Congress meant to require express consent in
157(e) dealing with consenting to a jury trial right,
they must not have required express consent, and then we
have a rule that's going beyond what the statute
provides.  That's exactly the situation in Roell.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't have to reach both
of these questions if we find one of them in -- in your
favor, do we?
MS. STEEGE:  That's correct.  If you don't
find it to be a Stern claim, then consent would not
matter.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which one is the better
one?  Which is the prettier question or -- or the one
that you think has more real world effect?
MS. STEEGE:  Well, I think the first
question has real world effect in the sense that if the
Court were to take away from bankruptcy judges the power
to litigate disputes with the debtor over what they
possess comes in or out of the bankruptcy estate, you'd
see a sea change in how cases were handled.  Because
that's the basic dispute you're going to have with the
debtor.  You're going to have three disputes with the
debtor.  It's going to be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Even -- even if consent
were sufficient to confer jurisdiction?  And that's --
that's -- maybe just to continue Justice Scalia's
question, are the bankruptcy courts more confused by
Question 1 or Question 2?
MS. STEEGE:  I think there's a lot of
confusion out there, Your Honor, and I think that
certainly people are also concerned about the consent
question, because the situation that you have today is
that both parties could consent, and the bankruptcy
judge could enter a judgment, and then the party who
loses can turn around and say, well, there's a question
about whether I really consented or not or whether it
was appropriate.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can -- can --
MS. STEEGE:  So both are -- are problems for
the courts right now.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I ask, you said implied
consent should be sufficient.  How would you go about
implying consent?  When would there be implied consent?
On the basis of what?
MS. STEEGE:  Well, I think would you would
have implied consent where you have -- here you have a
debtor who moved for summary judgment.  He asked the
bankruptcy judge to enter judgment in his behalf.  He
never sought withdrawal of the reference.  He never
sought to ask the district court to take this matter
away from him.
We have -- I think the act of filing a
bankruptcy puts you in front of the bankruptcy judge for
at least the basic administration of estate, property of
the estate determinations, but I would -- would submit
for all matters involving the debtor, because they all
really do relate to that.  It's basically property of
the estate determinations, whether property can be
claimed as exempt and whether debtor gets the discharge.
That's what will involve 99 percent of litigation of the
debtor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You've -- you've said, I
think, that the consent has to be knowing and
intelligent.  Is there something that has to be told to
the debtor to make the consent knowing and intelligent?
MS. STEEGE:  Congress didn't require that
here in Section 157, and, you know, it's a maxim of the
law that knowledge -- you know, lack of knowledge of the
law is no excuse.  The statute puts you on notice that
there is a list of proceedings, the core proceedings,
that are like the old summary proceedings under the
Bankruptcy Act, that the bankruptcy judge can decide the
final judgment without the consent of the parties.
And the statute also puts you on notice that
if you don't agree with that, you can ask the bankruptcy
judge to make a determination, you can ask the district
court judge to make a determination for withdrawal of
the reference.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There -- there is a problem,
however, here, and that problem is that Stern wasn't
decided until the appeal.  On rebuttal, I want to talk
about the American Colleges' appellate waiver argument.
MS. STEEGE:  Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Gannon.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
MR. GANNON:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We agree with Petitioners on both questions
presented.  With respect to the first question, we don't
think this is like a Stern claim for the two reasons
that have already been discussed, that is that the
question of whether something is property of the estate
under Section 541 stems from bankruptcy itself.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that's too broad an
answer, because that would be true of fraudulent
conveyances.
MR. GANNON:  Well, and -- and it also does
not involve an attempt to augment the estate.  We're
talking about a determination about --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about a simpler
rule, if you have legal title to something?
MR. GANNON:  Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you -- if you possess
it physically or you have legal title to it, then the
bankruptcy court can determine.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  They -- he has -- the
trustee had legal title.  He's just claiming --
MR. GANNON:  The trustee had bare legal
title and you think that that's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- that there's an
equitable requirement to hold it for someone else.
MR. GANNON:  And -- and under 541(d), if it
is true that the trustee only -- only holds bare legal
title, and then ultimately the trust is not looked
through because it's found not to exist or because it's
found to be the alter ego of the trustee, then the --
then the equitable interest would not have come into --
to the estate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yeah.  I'm trying to get
away from the --
MR. GANNON:  And so that's true.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm trying to get away
from the augmentation argument because it's really
difficult to apply in a case like this.  Anything that's
in the estate augments it or anything that comes into
the estate.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I don't think that
that's true.  I think that when the Court in Stern and
Granfinanciera and Northern Pipeline was talking about
the difference between questions that stem from the
bankruptcy itself and are integral to the restructuring
of the debtor/creditor relationship --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then --
MR. GANNON:  -- they were talking about the
baseline that you have there with the estate is the
property --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, tell me why my
rule is not simpler.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you -- if you
physically possess it at the time you declare bankruptcy
or you have legal title to it --
MR. GANNON:  I think that --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- then the bankruptcy
-- then it's not a Stern claim.
MR. GANNON:  I suppose that -- that that --
what this is feinting towards is the system that the
parties have talked about that developed under the 1898
Act that ended up being a relatively reticulated system
as described in the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller case, in
which there are multiple categories in which the
bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction to make these
determinations.  And we agree with Petitioners that on
facts like these where there was possession of the
property, which we think indisputably the trustee had
possession of the trust assets here, and that would be
enough to give the bankruptcy judge the jurisdiction --
or the referee under the 1898 Act cases -- jurisdiction
to determine who had title.  And then if -- if --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Stern we said we
would look to history.
MR. GANNON:  Pardon?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In Stern we said we
would look to history.
MR. GANNON:  Portions of the Stern opinion
looked to history but it did not indicate that the
historical precedents for this were going to be
dispositive and we don't think that -- that the
rationale of Stern, Granfinanciera, and Northern
Pipeline requires that as an Article III matter, nor
does the statute here, because the statutory definition
of -- of property of the estate refers to property
wherever located and by whomever held.  It still
ultimately has to be property of the debtor.
And so, if you're going to say that if it's
-- if it's -- if the debtor holds title to the property,
that is the ultimate determination and if you say that
that's not --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So let's to go -- let's
go to the hypothetical.  The sister holds title, but
you're saying that it belonged to him.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That she holds legal
title but, in fact, she -- it's really his money.
MR. GANNON:  Well, I -- I think -- I think
it would -- if she held legal title and the property had
already been transferred to her and that's what the
bankruptcy judge determined, then it wouldn't be
property of the estate.  And -- but we don't know the
answer to the question of who holds title until the
so-called Stern claim or non-Stern claim has already
been decided, and so I think that that's the trouble
with assuming that the answer to the title question or
the ownership question -- because that is the answer to
the property of the estate question, we can't -- we
can't wait to know the -- the merits determination
before we know whether it's a Stern claim I think is --
is the problem with approaching it that way.
But it is sensible to say that the question
of whether something was property of the estate on day
one such that it was the debtor's property -- because
that's the determination here -- that that is not like a
Stern claim.  It's not like a fraudulent conveyance or
avoidable transfer where you're attempting to go out,
after the bankruptcy has already been initiated, and
trying to reduce a chosen action to judgment and
liquidate it and therefore increase the size of the
estate after the fact.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, on the
consent question, is -- under your theory, is there
anything wrong with Congress adding a proviso to every
Federal contract saying the contractor hereby agrees to
waive any Article III objections to having disputes with
the government resolved by something we'll call the
congressional courts where the -- the individuals serve
for 3 years and Congress has a lot more sway over their
decisions?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I suspect yes, if for no
other reason than be -- I mean --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, yes what?  I forgot
the question.
MR. GANNON:  Yes, if for no other reason
than because --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, it's okay.
MR. GANNON:  Yes, that that would be a
problem -- I'm sorry, that that would not be
permissible.  I've forgotten the question.
But the reason why this would not be --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought it was an
unforgettable question.
(Laughter.)
MR. GANNON:  I promise you I won't forget it
now.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  Yes, we have no
bananas.
MR. GANNON:  The reason -- the reason why
this would be a problem is -- is because of the
structural concerns that you raise there which we don't
think are present here.  When you said that those were
-- were congressional courts that would be more subject
to supervision by Congress, we do not think that that
describes the bankruptcy system.  We think the
bankruptcy system is akin to the magistrate judge system
where this Court has repeatedly recognized that the
structural concerns that were at issue in Schor were not
sufficient to create a problem --
JUSTICE BREYER:  You --
MR. GANNON:  There is two things here.
There is both the consent of the parties but also
adequate judicial control, both in the aggregate over
bankruptcy judges who are appointed by and removable by
Article III judges, and also in every individual case
because they don't get any bankruptcy case --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, there's
judicial control in the sense that you have deferential
appellate review and whatnot, but it still takes out of
the Federal courts our constitutional birthright to
decide cases and controversies under Article III.
MR. GANNON:  And I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's hard for me to
see how --
MR. GANNON:  But I think --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- sort of vague --
vague notions of, oh, well, the judges are involved
there somewhere.
MR. GANNON:  But I don't think that this is
vague.  We're talking about something different from
just having appellate review after the fact.  We're
talking here about supervision of the bankruptcy judges
just like magistrate judges by Article III judges,
they're appointed and removed by them.  They don't ever
get a case unless the Court agrees to give it to them
and that seems to me the principal difference between
your hypothetical congressional support scheme, which is
that the parties are all not even making a voluntary
choice because Congress -- Congress is deeming them to
have made the choice, and then also no court is able to
say, I don't want the transfer to happen.
And both of those things are not true here
because the parties are able to make the choice and the
courts are able to withdraw the reference.  The parties
are always able to ask for the courts to withdraw the
reference.  This makes it just like the bankruptcy
system with respect to whether it's a consentable
constitutional violation.
And so we don't think that this is like
subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court in Stern said
that, that the division of authority between bankruptcy
judges and district court judges and 157 is not a
question of subject matter jurisdiction.  And we think
that is why it's one that's waivable.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You can  go back to your
experience in your office.  I just want to know -- it
seems to me by memory, but I'm not positive -- it is not
totally unusual and we do have the power to give two
affirmative answers where either answer would be
sufficient.  That is, we could answer both questions.
Now is your -- as a representative of the
solicitor general, is your reaction the same as mine,
that there are cases where a court had -- where we had
two questions.
MR. GANNON:  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And you say one would be
enough for the party to win, so would two, but we think
it's important to answer both and we will.
MR. GANNON:  I do believe that the Court has
done that.  I don't have any particular cases at the tip
of my --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Perhaps so.  Perhaps we
made other mistakes as well, you know?
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I wondered.  Is
there any reason that --
MR. GANNON:  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- strikes you that that
would be a mistake?  I don't know anything in the
Constitution --
MR. GANNON:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  -- or in any precedent of
this Court that prohibits it.
MR. GANNON:  I --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So I think saying it is a
mistake does not necessarily make it one.
MR. GANNON:  I think that that's something
that would be in the discretion of the Court.  I do
think that both of these questions are independently
important.  It is the case that Petitioners can prevail
and you can reverse the judge of the court of appeals on
either ground and without having to reach the other.
I do think that until a case -- there
probably was not confusion in the bankruptcy courts
about whether questions involving the definition of the
property of the estate were Stern claims, and so -- but
I do think that there is confusion about that just by
virtue of the fact that this case is here.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you --
MR. GANNON:  The second --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this quick
question before your time runs out.  If Federal
Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) applies to Stern claims because
they're non-core, do you agree with Petitioner that the
rule is invalid because it requires express consent and
the statute does not refer to express consent?
MR. GANNON:  I don't think you have to get
to the point of saying that the rule is invalid.  That's
not the way the Court approached the case in Roell where
the situation was, as my friend just said, exactly
parallel.  The statute did not require express consent,
or it did in some places but not in this one, and the
same thing is true if you contrast 157(c)(2) with
157(e), the relevant statutory provision period does not
require express consent.
The Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that was
applicable in Roell did, and the Court nevertheless said
that it was going to overlook the lack of an express
waiver there because it found that there was
sufficiently implied consent on the record.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that there's
--
MR. GANNON:  There is --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Excuse me.  Do you agree
there's implied consent merely by filing a voluntary
bankruptcy petition?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I – I think that the Court --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought that I heard
that that's what the Petitioner said.
MR. GANNON:  When you said, "a voluntarily
bankruptcy petition?"
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.
MR. GANNON:  The Court didn't grant cert on
that question but we do think that there's lots of other
conduct here but ultimately there's also the forfeiture
after Stern itself was decided that we think would be
adequate to decide that there was consent in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Gannon, I hate to
protract your presentation here.  I wasn't clear about
what your answer to Justice Breyer covered.  Did you say
there are prior cases in which we have decided two
constitutional questions?
MR. GANNON:  I said two different questions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ah.
MR. GANNON:  I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  What about two
constitutional questions given that we're supposed to --
MR. GANNON:  I think that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- avoid the determination
of constitutional questions?
MR. GANNON:  I do realize that that is the
general prudential rule that the Court applies, but I
think that it normally does so in a context of --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I understand --
MR. GANNON:  -- here it would be upholding
the statute in both regards and therefore I don't think
that the normal concerns about constitutionality rise to
the same level.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel.
Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  You were saying that you
wanted to talk about the importance of both questions.
I think you got the first one out.  What, in your view,
is the importance of the second?
MR. GANNON:  Well, I do think that the Court
was not able to decide the consent question in executive
benefits last term, and that there is a circuit split on
it.  It would be very useful to know that Stern claims
are the sorts of things to which parties consent or
those claims are waivable as they are in the magistrate
judge context which we think is parallel.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The government agrees
with the Petitioner that the first question, what goes
into this estate, that if we had to choose between the
two, which would you say is the more important?
MR. GANNON:  I -- I think that -- that it
would be good to settle that for the purposes of
bankruptcy courts, but you would still have the
unsettled consent question that has been kicking around
ever since Stern and on which there's already a circuit
split.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And vice versa.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hacker.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HACKER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We agree with what I understand the
solicitor general's position this morning to be, that
the Stern rule is relatively straightforward, which is
that a common law claim that seeks to augment the estate
with third-party property cannot be withdrawn by
Congress from Article III jurisdiction.
We also know that the alter ego claim
asserted by Wellness was a common law claim seeking to
augment --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That really begs the
question, your client possessed something and he says it
really belonged to someone else.  Don't you have to
decide who it belongs to if there is no clear indication
of it?
MR. HACKER:  Two -- two point --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, there may be a
clear one, but it still begs the question.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  Two points on that,
Your Honor.  Let me start with where this Court started
and where the law has been for decades, if not
centuries, which is that the trustee of the trust
possesses, if anything at all, no more than bare legal
title.  And so this Court said in the Hardinsburg case,
it said in Whiting Pools, and more import -- maybe most
importantly there is no case anywhere to the contrary,
that when a trust -- a trustee of a trust declares
personal bankruptcy, the trust assets do not become part
of the estate at the commencement of the bankruptcy.
So what Wellness had to do was establish
through its common law alter ego claim that the -- was
to bring the assets of the trust into the --
JUSTICE BREYER:  So you're just saying that
they didn't decide it correctly, but it's terribly easy
to imagine a different debtor who goes into bankruptcy
and he lists Item 1, 2, 3, and 4.  And the creditors
come in and say, you know, it's awfully surprising, four
or five, six months ago I have a similar list you gave
to the National Bank, and it had 10 items on it.  What
happened to 6 through 10?  Ah, the debtor replies, oh,
they didn't really belong to me.  Why not?  Because
State law gives it to somebody else because State law is
the source of all property law.  And they say, no.  And
now we have a dispute.
So forget about the trust.  Maybe I don't
see why that's special.  This is simply a question of
whether a bankruptcy judge can litigate who owns Items 6
through 10, and one party says State law gives them to
my cousin Mary and the other party says State law gives
them right to you.
Now, if we say, no, and side with you on
that one, what happens to the constitutional grant to
Congress to make uniform laws of bankruptcy?  I imagine
it would still exist, but I can't imagine in what form.
Now you see a pretty hostile argument, so I
would like to hear your reply.
(Laughter.)
MR. HACKER:  I -- I -- and I think the
example is a good one because I do think the trust is
very important because we do have decades of law on
that, but the example is not problematic because if in
that situation the trustee says, I see some other
bankruptcy trustee, sees -- I see some other property,
and the debtor says, that's not mine, I do think it's
true that there wouldn't be a litigable claim there
unless the third party also asserted ownership to the
property.
But if that happened, if the third party
says, that's not the debtor's, that's all mine, I've had
it for years, that's my car, that's my boat, that's my
house, then I think it's absolutely clear that under
that circumstance the trustee could not extinguish the
third party's rights, the bankruptcy court could not
distinguish the third party's rights by itself.  That's
an Article III claim, a classic private rights claim
where the bankruptcy trustee, the bankruptcy court is
reaching out to take the third party's property on the
trustee's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And what is the example of
6 through 10 that you could find that wouldn't involve
the issue you have described?  Because if there is a
piece of property and the debtor is saying it isn't
mine, it must be somebody's, and by definition it's not
the creditor's, and so it must be somebody else's.  And
so that other person, if there is a dispute, will say
it's mine.
And therefore, isn't your answer to say to
my property -- to my question, too bad, the bankruptcy
trustee cannot litigate who owns 6 through 10?
MR. HACKER:  So long as the third-party
asserts --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.
MR. HACKER:  Yes, that's right, but --
but --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, he can't do it.  All
right.  Then we're back to where are we with bankruptcy
courts, when you have taken from them the power to
litigate what I would think is the most fundamental
thing imaginable:  How much money does the debtor have
in cases where that is in dispute?
MR. HACKER:  I don't -- I don't think that's
fundamental because you have -- what you're talking
about, I mean, this Court already crossed that bridge I
think in Stern in saying when you're augmenting the
estate with third-party property, you don't assume at
the beginning of the Article III litigation that the
other side has a claim.  That's the whole point.  The
other side says don't take my property.
JUSTICE BREYER:  You said for thousands of
years -- I got that point -- for thousands of years this
has been the law.  So can you think of any case -- I
find it rather interesting, I'm reading about Henry II,
who, in fact, created many of the laws of England.
So from the time of Henry II onward, is
there a case that you have found somewhere which said
that the bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy judge
cannot litigate who owns property, the bankrupt or
someone else, in the state -- in the estate.
MR. HACKER:  Well, a couple of --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I'll read it.  I'll read
it.
MR. HACKER:  First of all, all of the
cases --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Besides -- besides Stern,
he means.
MR. HACKER:  Well, Stern -- yes, Stern is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Stern is a case of a third
party and counterclaim, and there never would have been
the money in the estate had it not been for the fact
that the debtor in fact asserted a claim, a counterclaim
against a claim that was being made by an outsider to
the estate.  It's not too hard to distinguish Stern.
But I am saying other than Stern -- I don't
even think Stern -- let's go back to Henry II.  Maybe
you have so many you'd have to send them on a list, but
maybe not.
MR. HACKER:  I -- if you look at all of the
cases cited on both sides' brief, I think the rule is
best stated in the Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller -- which is
one word -- case that says when there is a bona fide
claim of adverse possession -- or excuse me, of
ownership by a third party, that can't be extinguished
except through plenary proceeding.
And that's the exact same situation you're
talking about, Your Honor.  There's no difference, and
there's decades of that law, and that law and that rule
was never disputed.
And so going back now to the trust
proposition, I think it's important to make clear that
Wellness is asserting --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is the third party?
You said it's just -- it's no different, no different
than a third party coming in and saying that's my vote.
Who is the third party here?  And what --
MR. HACKER:  The third -- go ahead.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  There is only the
trustee.  This is supposed to be his mother's trust, and
his sister is supposed to be the beneficiary, so who is
the third party?
MR. HACKER:  So two -- there's -- well,
three.  There's the trust, but importantly, during her
lifetime, Soad Wattar was the owner, the only owner of
the beneficial interest in the trust assets.  So she's
the third party.
So to the extent the bankruptcy court wants
to decide for itself --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought she was dead.
MR. HACKER:  When the bankruptcy was
commenced, she was still alive, and she had the -- it's
a revocable living trust right.  She has the absolute
right to use all of those assets to revoke the trust.
That's -- they're her assets.  If she had declared
bankruptcy, those assets would have been in her estate.
There's --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did she say, when she was
alive, did she say, bankruptcy court, wait a minute,
this belongs to me?
MR. HACKER:  She was in Syria, I think, I'm
not sure at what point.  But the point is the trust
itself was an existing document and -- and was an
existing entity.
And I want to be clear about something.
Wellness doesn't dispute that.  I mean, Exhibit 13 to
Sharif's deposition was the trust amendment in 1996.  It
was an existing trust.
And, in fact, their first primary argument,
which pervades their reply brief, depends on the
proposition that the trust was a real entity because
what they're saying is a version of what you were
saying, Justice Sotomayor, which is that he had
possession because he was the trustee of the trust.  The
possession only exists because he's a trustee of the
trust.  The trust assets aren't listed in his name.  If
they're not in the trust, there's no tenable theory that
he is the -- on the face of the assets, that they start
in the estate, they're going to have to be gotten
somehow.  So their theory is, well, he's the trustee of
a trust and therefore he has sufficient possession.
And our answer to that is simple.  Not one
case ever in the history of western law that anybody has
found says that trust assets go into the personal
bankruptcy estate of a trustee, if and when the trustee
declares bankruptcy, this Court said the opposite in
Hardenburg, it said the opposite in Whiting Pools in
saying that when you have only bare legal title, which
is at most the only thing a trustee has, only bare legal
title goes in and no other beneficial interests go into
the estate.
So then there's a second question, a second
argument, which is that well, because in 2002, not one
year, Justice Breyer, but seven years before the
bankruptcy, we have discovered these documents that
suggest that he was treating the trust as trustee was
treating the trust assets as his own.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But in the cases you just
cited, did the courts say who decides the question of
whether there's bare legal title?
MR. HACKER:  Those cases were --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You -- you said the case
very clear, only bare legal title goes.  But who -- did
it -- did it go on to say that the bankruptcy court
cannot decide who has the bare -- whether you have only
bare legal title?
MR. HACKER:  Right.  Those cases were not
about that proposition.  This -- this is about this --
this threshold proposition that because he's the trustee
of the trust and in possession of bare legal title,
that's all we need to know.  That's their --
JUSTICE BREYER:  No argue -- so -- so where
you have brought me so far is these cases say -- what
they say is you have to -- you can't just grab it; you
have to proceed under Section 23 and have a proceeding.
But the -- the -- a proceeding -- some kind of a
proceeding, I don't know exactly what that kind is, you
probably do, but that doesn't mean the trustee doesn't
get it.  I mean, it's the trustee who litigates it out,
it's the trustee who decides, but I don't know what a
Section 23 proceeding is.
MR. HACKER:  In the older cases --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.
MR. HACKER:  -- the rule that would apply,
Justice Kennedy, would be the Talburg v. Scott
Kitzmiller rule, you have to have a plenary proceeding
to go get it.
JUSTICE BREYER:  A plenary proceeding.  But
where does that take place?
MR. HACKER:  That would have been -- it's
sort of the equivalent now the parties are treating, I
think, not incorrectly as equivalent now of an
Article III proceeding.  This would have to be --
JUSTICE BREYER:  It didn't take place before
the bankruptcy judge?
MR. HACKER:  Well, at the -- most of these
cases at the time, remember, the district court was the
bankruptcy court and the question was whether it's the
exercise of summary jurisdiction versus a plenary
Article III proceeding.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, I see the problem.
MR. HACKER:  A plenary proceeding.  Now it
would be an adversary proceeding that would have to be
determined finally by the -- the Federal court.
So -- but I want to get to the second point,
because it's an important one.  Wellness doesn't just
rest on the proposition that just because the trustee is
a trustee, the trust assets are part of the estate,
which I think is completely unsupportable.  They go on
to say because seven years earlier, as trustee, he
treated them as -- the trust assets as his own;
therefore, we should disregard the trust.
That argument, I think, as I think
Justice Sotomayor pointed out, is functionally
indistinguishable from a fraudulent transfer claim
because they're saying, based on his alleged misuse of
trust assets at some point in the now distant past, we
should treat them as part of the estate, we should
disregard the trust, which is just like a fraudulent
transfer, which it says because of something the debtor
did before, transferring the assets, we should disregard
the transfer and treat them as part of the estate.
In that respect, it's -- it's
indistinguishable and it is in that respect in the same
way because you augment the estate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Just to clarify the
record, I asked the question whether they were or
weren't.
MR. HACKER:  Fair enough.  And -- and I will
try to answer it, which is I think they are in that
respect indistinguishable.  And then if you follow from
what the -- all of the lower courts have said, that a
fraudulent transfer action is a Stern claim --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we've said that,
too, against --
MR. HACKER:  Held that it's an Article --
basically an Article III claim in Grand Financier.  So I
think for all of these reasons, it is quite clear that
the action to bring these claims into the estate is a
common law action seeking to augment the estate with
somebody else's property.  Property that Soad Wattar
owned during her life and that Ragda Sharif owned upon
Soad's death.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Alright, so give me examples.
The suggested rule that I have for the Solicitor
General , which he would like the broader one, but if at
the time you have legal title to or in physical
possession of something, then it's not a Stern claim,
not an Article III claim because that is the
quintessential question that bankruptcy judges decide
are the things that you possess either by title or by
constructive holding -- or by holding.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  I think there's two
problems with that analysis.  First is that all the
trustee has is bare legal title as a matter of law, does
not have any property interest, which is what the
current bankruptcy code focuses on, what are the
debtor's interests in property and it's the -- the
trustee of a trust does not have any interest,
beneficial or legal interest in the assets, it's only
bare legal title.
So to get more interest as part of the
estate, you have to have some common law way to do that,
some claim for doing that and a classic claim is an
alter ego claim, if that's what you think because of
something the trustee did, then --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But -- but you say that's
always going to be the case, that you need an
Article III proceeding whenever the bankruptcy trustee
determines that something belongs to the debtor and is
in the bankruptcy estate and some other private party
says, no, it belongs to me.  That always has to be
litigated in an Article III court?
MR. HACKER:  I don't think this Court needs
to decide that.  That's not quite the question here
because the property interests from the start are
outside the estate.  But I do think --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is that what you're arguing
here?
MR. HACKER:  I -- I -- I would not be
surprised if this Court were to hold one day that if a
third party has a claim to property, comes into court
and says, that's my -- that's my house, I know the
debtor says it is, that says it's his and the trustee
thinks it's his, that's my house, that that person is
entitled to an Article III adjudication --
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's exactly --
because -- it's interesting.  I mean, I've read the page
you have there now with the cases.  And I see you can --
the distinction will drive you towards that, not 100
percent, because there will be some instances of
colorable -- colorable title and so forth, not 100
percent, but 99 percent, items 6 through 10 go to a
different court.
But what -- the constitutional question is
the deepest one to me, is we do have a constitutional
provision specifically giving to Congress the authority
to create a uniform system of bankruptcy courts which
have served our economy well, I think.  That's what I
read.  Makes us richer.  And on the other hand, we do
have the question, as you point out, that this is
determining a title where there are two people under
State law contesting it.  And so which prevails?  And
until I think Stern, it would have been Congress's
delegation, maybe.
And what is the strongest argument for not
giving weight?  These are sort of like administrative
agencies defining -- you know, deciding things that
never have been done before.  What's the strongest
argument?  No, don't do it, it might gut the bankruptcy
court, but don't do it.  Or maybe you want to say it
won't gut the bankruptcy court.
MR. HACKER:  --I don’t – that- That was my
answer was I don't think it will gut the bankruptcy court.
We think this is just a straightforward application of
where we already are -- where we already are with Stern.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  I agree with you
to this extent.  It's either Stern marches forward or
it's -- I'd say steps in place.
MR. HACKER:  Well, and I don't think -- I
don't think we're pushing Stern forward.  I do think
we're just applying Stern.
But I also want to address your point about
uniform bankruptcy code.  I think the fact that this
Court has long said and understood and the lower courts
have accepted that bankruptcy law takes State law and
property rights as defined by State law as they find
them.  That's all we're talking about here.  To the
extent there is a State law property dispute between a
third party and the debtor/bankruptcy trust trustee,
that -- that doesn't change the uniformity of the
bankruptcy code.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I suppose the
constitutional provision authorizing Congress to
establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize
Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide
questions which would normally be decided by Article III
courts.
MR. HACKER:  That's clearly right.  You
could establish bankruptcy law, but it's going to be an
Article III question, the extent to which the bankruptcy
courts can exercise judicial power.
As to one more point on Justice Sotomayor's
question, I had two responses.  The second one was that
physical possession is not a great test.  As this case
shows, Sharif as trustee didn't physically possess
anything.  If anybody did, it was the banks where the
trust assets were, so you can't think about it in terms
of physical possession.
JUSTICE BREYER:  That's -- let me proceed
with this question one more step.  Every day of the week
administrative agencies change State law.  Every day of
the week they change State law, even involving property.
And in such a case, the question is whether -- has this
administrative agency, under authority of Congress,
changed State law affecting people's property rights in
a way that deprives them of due process of law?  Have
they gotten fair procedure?
And so is a possible answer to your problem:
If the procedures of the bankruptcy court are fair when
they litigate these questions of property right, the
fact that they do affect State law and take property
among persons switching it is not forbidden by the
Constitution where it indeed is authorized as part of a
uniform system of bankruptcy law?
MR. HACKER:  I think due process viewed that
way is not sufficient.  I think, again, this Court
answered that question in Stern.  There wasn't a claim
that there wasn't going to be due process for the
disposition of the -- of the property rights there.  The
problem was that the bankruptcy court was exercising the
judicial power of the United States in entering a final
judgment.  And if I can turn to that argument, I will.
Stern itself is based on a structural
separation of powers concerns, that private rights of
this kind are exclusively committed to -- by the
Constitution, to Article III.  It's about the exercise
of judicial power, which entails the implementation and
enforcement of judgments of the United States that are
entitled to full faith and credit by courts both in the
United States and elsewhere, pursuant to treaties.  They
are precedential.  They can be law -- they are law of
the case in what can be very complicated cases that
stretch around different courts and go on for years.
That's --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  By the way, is -- are
the arguments you're raising now any different as
applied to magistrate judges?  If we rule in your favor
in this case, are we calling into question our -- our
acceptance of magistrate judge positions?
MR. HACKER:  Well, a couple of points.
First of all, with respect to magistrate judges, it's
only with respect to final adjudications.  Magistrate
judges can still perform the functions --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your answer is yes,
because you can do -- on express consent, you can do
reports and recommendations.
MR. HACKER:  As -- as to final adjudications
of private rights matters, magistrate judges can still
do something, can still litigate and resolve public
rights, whatever those kinds of rights and matters are.
But I do think it would be difficult after this case to
say that a magistrate can exercise judicial power of the
United States to enter a final judgment based solely on
consent.  I think this Court answered that question in
Schor, effectively.
Schor would have been an easy case, an
incredibly easy case, if consent alone were enough,
because that was an issue in Schor, and the parties
there did consent.  But the Court didn't stop with that
one sentence:  The parties consented; that's all we need
to know.  The Court went on to do an elaborate analysis
of the structural concerns involved and why there were
no structural concerns, such that the consent was
sufficient.  And when you boil it all down, basically
what Schor said, which is what I think the Court
recognized in Stern, was that the structural concerns
exist when you're talking about the adjudication of a
private --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I agree, but we didn't
say that you couldn't consent in Schor.
MR. HACKER:  I understand that.  I'm just
saying, it would have been a very easy case if consent
were enough.  And the Court nevertheless went on to say
consent is enough here, because we're talking about what
is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, consent is enough
for arbitration, and there you give up --
MR. HACKER:  I understand that.  And
arbitration is fundamentally different.  Arbitration is
not the exercise of the judicial power of the
United States.  An arbitrator doesn't issue a judgment.
It's not entitled to full faith and credit.  It's a
fundamentally different kind of exercise of authority,
of which --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but it's something
which has to be enforced by a court except in very
extraordinary circumstances.  You know, there's much
less supervision over the arbitration system than there
is over a typical bankruptcy court.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  But the decision by the
parties to go to an arbitrator -- which, by the way, is
their own decision.  What arbitrator they choose is
their own choice.  The arbitrator is not controlled --
the salary of the arbitrator is not controlled by
Congress.  The tenure of the arbitrator is not
controlled by Congress.  And when the FFA -- excuse me
-- the FAA --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  There's very little
difference --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  All those things make it
worse.  You know, this is a proceeding that's totally
divorced from any kind of control by anybody, and yet
Federal courts, under the Arbitration Act, simply have
to rubber-stamp it and say it's valid except in
extremely unusual circumstances.
MR. HACKER:  But that's pursuant to
Congress's Article I power to say, here is a type of
contract that we're going to say is enforceable under a
particular situation.  That's all arbitration is, is a
private contract.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's just contract law,
isn't it?  I mean, they're just enforcing the parties'
contracts.
MR. HACKER:  Right.  And that --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  This is the parties'
contract.  It's -- I mean, the entire question is that
the parties are consenting to go to bankruptcy court,
and the question is:  Will that consent be sufficient in
the same way that it is in the arbitration system?
MR. HACKER:  I understand.  But it adds the
element that what you're consenting to, by hypothesis,
is the exercise of judicial power by the entry of a
judgment that will be given full faith and credit, the
entry of a judgment by an entity in a --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, because that's what
happens in arbitration.  You're agreeing to the entry of
a judgment, of an award.  Perhaps not even, because you
don't even put that into the contract.  Congress is
saying, we're going to do it anyway.
MR. HACKER:  What I'm saying is, you're not
-- you're not consenting to the exercise of the judicial
-- judicial power, to the dilution of the Article III
court's authority --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I understand that --
MR. HACKER:  -- to issue judgments that are
precedential.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Please.  I'm sorry.
MR. HACKER:  Well, that's all I was going to
say.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I -- you know, I understand
that formalism matters in many contexts, but the fact
that the arbitrator himself doesn't issue the judgment,
and instead you have to take it across the street and
the Federal court has to issue the judgment, basically
on the arbitrator's say-so, again, seems to me -- I
mean, the arbitrator case seems to me much more
threatening to the integrity of the Federal judicial
system than a system of bankruptcy courts which are,
from the very beginning all the way through, supervised
by -- by district courts.
MR. HACKER:  Well, I mean, the -- the key
difference, though, I think, is that, as I said,
bankruptcy courts are exercising judicial power.
Arbitrators aren't.  And then when the district court --
in an arbitration proceeding, all the district court is
doing is enforcing a judgment -- excuse me -- enforcing
an arbitration award, a contractual choice, pursuant to
a Congressional judgment that says, here are the rules,
the decision rule for enforcing this particular type of
contract.  That's an Article I issue.  It's within
Congress's Article I power to constrain -- to establish
the decision rule that the -- the part of the -- the
entity exercising judicial power will apply.
In this situation, the party exercising, the
entity exercising the judicial power is a
non-Article III court.  It's as if you said -- you
changed the FAA and added another paragraph to say, an
arbitrator's awards are exercises -- they're final
judgments of the United States, entitled to full faith
and credit, subject to appellate review by the -- by
appellate courts.  And I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you spend a moment
just talking about the forfeited argument on appeal?
MR. HACKER:  On the -- the --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The -- the argument that
consent can be presumed from your forfeiture of the
argument on appeal.
MR. HACKER:  And I'm glad you put it this
way, Your Honor, because I think they're -- they're
different points.  The -- the law clearly requires
consent, and I think everybody agrees it requires
knowing and voluntary consent.  You have to have at
least that.  The rule which we think is applicable, and
agree with the American College of Bankruptcy, that the
rules writers and this Court in implementing the rule
required express consent.  I don't think there's a
credible argument here that there was express consent.
And I think this Court ought to adopt
express consent as the requirement and hold that there
was not express consent here, precisely for the
constitutional avoidance reasons that Justice Scalia
mentioned earlier, to avoid getting into the whole
discussion we just had, because if there's insufficient
consent here, then we don't need to decide the
circumstances under which consent is sufficient.
JUSTICE ALITO:  But isn't forfeiture quite
different from consent?  It's not a species of consent.
It's different from consent.
MR. HACKER:  And I'm sorry I delayed getting
to Justice Sotomayor's question.  The reason there's no
forfeiture here, among the reasons, is that this was a
problem of appellate jurisdiction.  There was no
appellate jurisdiction here because there was no final
judgment in the bankruptcy court.  If our first argument
is right, then the bankruptcy court lacked authority to
issue a final judgment.  So when we went up to "appeal,"
quote/unquote, in the district court, there was no -- it
wasn't permissible for that court to exercise appellate
jurisdiction --
JUSTICE ALITO:  You think a final judgment
has to be a valid final judgment in order for there to
be an appeal?
MR. HACKER:  I think it has to be --
JUSTICE ALITO:  It can be final and it can
be invalid.
MR. HACKER:  Well, it's not a question of
being a defect.  I think the problem here is there's an
absolute lack of any authority to enter a final
judgment.  There wasn't something from which the
district court had any authority to exercise appellate
jurisdiction.  That was the problem.  It wasn't a
question of the date it was entered.
JUSTICE ALITO:  I mean, if a court enters a
judgment against you and you say that court never had
jurisdiction to enter that judgment, you can't take an
appeal because there wasn't a final judgment because the
court below lacked jurisdiction.  That's the argument?
MR. HACKER:  Well, no, the argument would
be:  If -- at any point on appeal, I can raise the
problem that the court to which I'm appealing lacks
appellate jurisdiction, lacks jurisdiction to resolve
the case, that's the kind of non-waivable problem.  And
it's -- something that cannot be waived also can't be
forfeited.  And -- and so that's the reason that there's
no forfeiture problem here.
Beyond that, it's quite clear that
Mr. Sharif made every effort to preserve the issue to
the extent he became aware of it.  It was only 6 weeks
after Stern was decided that he filed his opening brief.
Did not cite Stern, that's true.  But only a month or two
later his sister, Ragda Sharif, files a motion to
withdraw the reference.  And then he immediately --
essentially; his lawyer realized what's happened.  As
soon as he's aware of the Stern argument, as soon as the
Seventh Circuit issues its decision in Ortiz actually
applying Stern, then he promptly raises this issue.
He's not sandbagging.  There's no
gamesmanship here.  As soon as it's clear that he
understands that his consent was required before what
happened to him could permissibly happen, he
demonstrated that he did not consent to the exercise of
that -- of that -- of that jurisdiction.
Now, of course, our primary submission is
the bankruptcy court never had that jurisdiction.  And
to -- and we think that's a correct argument, but to
avoid that argument, we think the simpler approach for
this Court is to say that express consent was required;
it wasn't satisfied; or that if implied consent was
sufficient, to apply what this Court applied in the
Roell case in finding implied consent, which clearly was
not applicable here.
In Roell, the Court found implied consent
only because, quote, "the litigant or counsel was
made" -- "was made aware of the need for consent" --
didn't happen here -- "and the right to refuse it" --
also didn't happen here -- "and still voluntarily
appeared to try the case."
Further, the Court emphasized in Roell, the
party later actually did consent in writing.  That also
didn't happen here.
So none of the factors that created implied
consent in Roell were sufficient, and for that reason we
think the Court should affirm the judgment below.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Steege, you have five minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. STEEGE:  In response to the test that
Justice Sotomayor proposed about possession, that, in
fact, under the historic cases -- the
Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller case, that's the easy situation,
the situation we have here where the debtor has actual
possession of the property.
And we don't contend that Mr. Sharif had --
had just a legal fiction as a trustee possession.  This
was the house he lived in, the business he ran, his own
retirement accounts, and his own bank accounts.  These
were assets he was enjoying while trying to take
advantage of the bankruptcy system, having, not
incoincidentally, left an Article III court where he was
litigating and where the Article III judge had held him
in contempt and thrown him in jail several times.  So he
made a choice to go to bankruptcy court.  He had actual
possession of these assets.  And that, under the
historic precedent, has always been the easy case for
the bankruptcy judge to decide.
That case goes the other way.  But that's
because the litigant was trying to bring a preference
action.  What was happening in that case is the sheriff
had seized some property, and the argument was he had
done it within what was then a four-month preference
period, and they were really trying to bring a
preference case under the constructive actual
possession.
That's different than the situation with a
debtor that has actual possession of the property.  And
so when you look at these cases, whenever it's the
debtor who has possession, going back to the historic
English law, the courts have always allowed the
bankruptcy referee or judge to make that determination.
With respect to the cases that were
discussed, the Whiting Pools and the State Bank of
Hardinsburg cases, neither of those cases actually
involved trustees.  Whiting Pools was decided shortly
after this Court decided Northern Pipeline.  Northern
Pipeline was cited in that case, and that's a case where
the bankruptcy judge's judgment ordering the Internal
Revenue Service to return property back to the
Chapter 11 debtor's estate because it belonged there,
subject to their rights as a secured creditor.  The
Court upheld that.  So I don't think that stands for the
proposition that bankruptcy judges don't have the
authority to decide disputes about where property should
come into the estate.
With respect to the issue of consent, yes,
this does have an impact.  You know, our -- our argument
is very much based upon the fact that the Magistrate Act
has been held -- upheld in Roell and Peretz and
Gonzalez.  There is authority in the Fifth Circuit --
six of the judges in the -- in the Fifth Circuit have
issued a dissent in a bankruptcy case saying that they
see no basis to allow the magistrate system to exist,
given that the Fifth Circuit has held that 157(c)(2)
consent is unconstitutional.
So you do have a circumstance where the
courts are -- the lower courts, anyway -- are seeing the
two systems as the same.  And they are the same, because
the Article III judiciary has control over the
bankruptcy process at every step.  It refers the cases
to the bankruptcy judges; it can take them away.  Anyone
who ever has a problem with the bankruptcy judge can
always seek a motion to withdraw the reference.  And
it's the district court judge who decides that.
There's also macro-control over the system,
in the sense that bankruptcy judges are pointed by the
Article III courts, they can be removed for cause by the
Article III courts, and for all of the reasons that the
Courts of Appeals that address this issue unanimously,
across the board and upheld the magistrate system, all
of that rationale in those cases applies to the
bankruptcy system.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Taubel-Scott.
MS. STEEGE:  Yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Burrell, he says that --
they say that where possession was assertively held, not
for the bankrupt, but for others prior to bankruptcy,
the party in possession who is not subject to summary
judgment can be divested only if a plenary sued under
Section 23.
By that, I take it he means it's this case.
It's true that he said he was trustee.  His mother says,
no, no, it is my property, or whatever, and -- and
therefore that fits within that case; therefore this is
one of the ones that went to a full court and didn't go
to the -- a bankruptcy case.  So that's his case.
What's your response to that?
MS. STEEGE:  But that's not this case,
because the debtor has possession.  And Taubel-Scott
sets out five circumstances in which we have plenary or
summary jurisdiction under that statute.  And on the
easy side of the line, on the constitutional side,
post-Stern, is debtors' possession of that property.
You can't make a claim like we have here.
And Wellness never conceded that the trust
was valid.  That was the dispute before the court.  You
can't let a debtor -- well, you can, but you -- it would
be very difficult for the system if a debtor were
allowed to say, I don't really own it.  I'm using it; I
have it; I have possessed it --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the money here is in
his bank account.  That's the point.
MS. STEEGE:  Yeah.  I mean, you -- you would
have a circumstance where the bankruptcy judge would
have no authority.  And Mueller v. Nugent, decided back
in 1902, recognized that and said you would have courts
that would have no ability to supervise the system that
they're charged with supervising.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
