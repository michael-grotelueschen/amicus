CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear
argument first this morning in Case 13-854, Teva
Pharmaceuticals v. Sandoz.
Mr. Jay.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JAY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In our judicial system, the trial judges
find the facts.  Courts of Appeals review those
fact-findings deferentially under Rule 52.  The Federal
courts apply that familiar standard, even whenever the
ultimate question is one of law, but it rests on
subsidiary fact-finding.
Now, the Federal Circuit says that claim
construction is different, that there are no facts in
claim construction, but more than a hundred years of
practice from this Court makes clear that that's not
right.  Facts can enter claim construction and they do
so when the trial judge does what this Court has
instructed her to do, to find what a person of skill in
the art already knows as relevant to interpreting the
patent.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you bring it down to
this case and tell -- tell us what are the facts to
which the Federal Circuit should have applied clearly
erroneous rule?
MR. JAY:  Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.
There are three in our view.  The first is that the
Federal -- the Federal Circuit failed to defer to the
trial court's finding about the presumed meaning of the
term "average molecular weight" in the -- in the
relevant context.
The second is that the trial -- Federal
Circuit failed to defer to what the district court
expressly found resolving an expert dispute was the
import of Figure 1 and where the peak of the curve in
Figure 1 appears.
And the third is how a person of ordinary
skill in the art would have read a piece of the
prosecution history.
So if I may, I'll begin with why the -- the
reference to average molecular weight in the patent and
the -- and the specific reference to size exclusion
chromatography, the particular technology being used to
find that, fits the rule that we're asking this Court to
adopt.
Before you --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I want you to answer
that, but would -- would you say that it's whether a
skilled artisan would make this inference?  Is that part
of the finding?
MR. JAY:  Part of the finding is the
knowledge of a skilled artisan.  That's right.
Sometimes -- sometimes the finding is just about pure
science, how an invention works, what -- what this Court
called it in the Winans v. New York and Erie case is
terms of art or the state of the art.  And the way the
state of the art can enter the analysis is when you're
using science to construe the patent.
So, for example, at this temperature the
invention would work; at that temperature the invention
would not work.  Therefore, you know, the temperature
must be Celsius and not Fahrenheit, for example.
When you do that, when you're using science
and not words or structure as the -- as an
interpretative guide, that rests on fact-finding just as
much as -- as knowing the meaning of terms of art to
people with skill in the art does.
Now, the terms of art has a lengthy pedigree
in this Court's cases, not just in patent cases,
although it's certainly strong in patent cases as well.
But in the interpretation of other written instruments,
the -- the meaning of terms of art in a community to
which -- an interpretative community to which the trial
judge does not belong is exactly the kind of thing that
trial judges need the input from experts to determine.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that's not true of
terms of art in statutes, is it?
MR. JAY:  Terms of art in statutes, Justice
Alito, are not -- are nonetheless written to be read by
the general public.  And what -- when they have a --
when they have a legal meaning, the determination of
that legal meaning is still a question of law.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, some of them are very
technical, and I doubt that the -- the general public
has any understanding of some very technical terms that
appear in statutes.  So would they not be read in light
of what someone who is knowledgeable in that field would
understand the -- the term to mean?
MR. JAY:  I think it's very rare for
Congress to adopt statutes that have terms -- that have
terms that are meant to be read by a specialized
audience --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'll give you an
example.  The Dodd-Frank Act refers to Tier 1 Capital.
Do you think that the average person on the street has
any idea what Tier 1 capital is?
MR. JAY:  I -- I expect that it has an
established meaning, but -- although I certainly don't
know for sure.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Among the general public or
among people who are knowledgeable in that particular
area?
MR. JAY:  I think when you're interpreting a
statute that it's generally clear at least what the
right frame of reference is.  Now, in the -- in the
patent case, what the frame of reference is is itself a
question of fact, as this Court said in Graham v. John
Deere.  Ascertaining the level of skill in the art, who
is the skilled artisan, who is this patent written for,
that is itself a factual question, and then figuring out
what that -- what that person knows is also a factual
question.  You know, that's terms of art or the state of
the art.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Jay, could you tell
me what you see as the difference between your position
and the government's?
MR. JAY:  I think that the government agrees
with us that the answer to the question presented is
that Rule 52(a) applies and that clear error review
should apply to findings of fact.  I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  To some, because they
differentiate others.
MR. JAY:  I think that -- I think that our
test is largely the same as well, but we disagree on how
the test comes out on these facts.  We submit that the
three fact-findings that I mentioned to Justice Ginsburg
at the beginning of the argument are -- they are factual
findings.  The government agrees that some but not all,
and they -- we agree on the ultimate disposition that
the Federal Circuit's judgment can't stand.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If you and the
government can't agree, why should we defer to a
district court?  Why don't we defer, as has been done
now forever, to the Federal Circuit and let them review
these things de novo?
MR. JAY:  Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor,
what's been done forever is deferring to district courts
on matters of subsidiary findings.  And I think it's
significant that in the first patent case that came to
this Court from the Federal Circuit, the new Federal
Circuit, Dennison, what this Court did was direct the
Federal Circuit to apply deference to subsidiary
fact-finding in the context of obviousness.  And this
Court has --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What we did -- in
Martin, we -- we talked about claim construction being
the odd hybrid.
MR. JAY:  It is an odd hybrid -- well, it is
a hybrid.  I don't know that it's odd, Justice
Sotomayor.  I think that it actually fits of a piece
with other mixed questions of law and fact.  And the
universal practice for mixed questions of law and fact
is that when they rest on subsidiary fact-finding, you
review the fact-finding part deferentially, even when
the leap from the fact-finding to the ultimate legal
conclusion is a short one.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In the Markman context,
the trial judge says to the jury:  Now, the construction
of the claim is for the court, and the court's
construction of the claim is X, Y, Z.  Could that
determination by the district judge, which is for the
trial judge, involve some subsidiary questions of fact
as to which he must be given deference?
MR. JAY:  Sir, I may have missed the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's a jury case like
Markman and Markman says the construction of the claim
is for the court, and the court tells the jury:  This
claim is to be construed as follows, A, B, C, D.  Does
that determination, that interpretation by the district
court -- would that error contain factual determinations
as to which deference must be given to the trial judge?
MR. JAY:  A claim construction can contain
factual determinations.  It might not.  In many cases it
will not, because the ultimate question is a question of
law and when it rests just on looking at the words in
the patent and applying the canons of claim
construction, it remains a pure question of law.
When -- when facts enter the analysis, those facts
decided by the trial judge in the context of findings
are reviewed deferentially.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, is -- is it the same
question whether a particular fact has to be submitted
to the jury?  And whether a particular fact-finding by
the judge is entitled to deference or are they -- are
they the same question?
MR. JAY:  They are not the same question,
Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I didn't think they were.
MR. JAY:  This Court resolved the judge/jury
question for claim construction in Markman, but -- and
there were no subsidiary fact-findings of the type that
we've been talking about in Markman, because
Mr. Markman's expert was an expert in document
construction.  That -- that's not the kind of rule that
we're advocating here.  We're advocating for deference
to classic fact-finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You -- you've
referred several times to subsidiary facts.  You know,
the difference between questions of law and fact has not
always been an easy one for the Court to draw.  What do
you mean by a subsidiary fact?
MR. JAY:  I simply mean, Justice --
Mr. Chief Justice, that the ultimate question this Court
said in Markman is a question of law, but it often rests
on factual findings, knowledge of the -- excuse me -- of
the state of the art and of how the art works.  And
that's -- that's just as true in other mixed question
cases.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what's your
definition of subsidiary fact?
MR. JAY:  A subsidiary fact is a fact that
is not the ultimate question the court is looking at,
but one that is an ingredient in that -- in that
judgment.  So in the context of claim construction, what
often happens is the beginning of the analysis is:  What
is the meaning of this specialized term to people in the
art?  That may not be controlling because the
interpretation of the patent may show, as a legal
matter, that that can't be the right meaning because the
text of the patent itself, under -- applying the canons
of claim construction, for example, or simply applying
the patentee's own definition, rule out the ordinary
meaning to skilled artisans, making that finding
irrelevant.  Then it wouldn't be a subsidiary finding of
the ultimate claim construction at all.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then maybe the evidence
shouldn't have come in.
MR. JAY:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The evidence should not
have come in.
MR. JAY:  Well, Justice Ginsburg, the court
may not anticipate at the time what the -- what the
ultimate outcome is going to be.  At the time, the court
must make a judgment about which experts to allow.  But
I think that's an important point, that the judge
retains gatekeeping authority, and ultimately the judge
will decide how many terms she will allow the parties to
dispute and which -- what evidence to take and in what
form to take it.  So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If these are -- these are
truly fact questions, then what happened to the Seventh
Amendment?
MR. JAY:  I think, Justice Ginsburg, that --
first of all, this is not a jury case.  But, of course,
I'll answer the question for patent cases more broadly,
in which some are jury cases.  These are subsidiary
fact-findings that go to a threshold question for the
court and in that respect they're no different than the
fact-findings that go into other pretrial judgments that
are not for the jury.
Rule 52 has been applied to judicial
fact-finding in any number of jury cases, pretrial and
post-trial matters that don't -- that don't go to the
jury.  And this Court decided in Markman that the
ultimate question of claim construction is one of law
and thus not for the jury.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And the government's
brief said -- and I think you agree with this, but
you'll tell me -- that inferences to be drawn from
fact-findings get de novo review.  And my understanding
is that in a typical civil case, a jury finds the facts
and can draw inferences from the facts, but here --
well, first do you agree with the government that
inferences from -- from the facts get de novo review?
MR. JAY:  No.  I don't think I can agree
with that, Justice Ginsburg, because that's not what
Rule 52 says.  And we may be conflating jury cases -- in
our colloquy here, we may be conflating jury cases and
judicial fact-findings because -- you know, the scope of
Rule 52 is set out in the rule itself and in the -- the
Advisory Committee Notes in 1937 and this Court's
decision in Anderson all talk -- and Pullman Swint as
well -- all talk about the inferences to be drawn as
being part of the trial judge's role, because the trial
judge has heard the entire factual record.  The trial
judge is in the best position to draw the inferences
from the record as -- as well as to resolve direct
head-to-head conflicts in the evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't your --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Jay --
JUSTICE ALITO:  Go ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- I -- I just want to make
sure I understand your answer to what the gap is between
a certain kind of fact and then the ultimate question of
law.  So when an expert gets on the stand and gives
testimony about what a person in the field, a skilled
artisan in the field, would understand to be the meaning
of a particular patent term, and you are saying that
that's a -- that's factual and that the decision whether
to credit that or not is a factual determination.  But
how is that different from the ultimate legal question
that the Court has to answer, which is kind of the same
thing, it's how a person -- a skilled artisan in the
field, what -- what that person would understand a
patent to mean.
MR. JAY:  Well, the difference is that the
instances, and they will be frequent, where it's not
kind of the same thing.  Let me -- let me spell that
out.  The first part of your question is, is what the
expert says factual, the meaning to skilled artisans.
And it absolutely is, just as it is in this Court's
contract and tariff cases where the Court specifically
says that the meaning of a term to people in a
particular field, to which the judge doesn't belong,
that's a fact question, and -- so as to whether there is
a specialized meaning.
But where there is no specialized meaning or
any specialized meaning is irrelevant because the patent
itself, through the process of document construction,
tells you what the answer is -- so, for example, here's
the ordinary meaning of this term, but that won't work
in the context of this patent because it would run up
against the canon of claim differentiation.  That won't
in this patent because it would make the invention not
work.  That wouldn't work in this patent because then
the preferred embodiment in the -- in the specification
wouldn't -- wouldn't be encompassed.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So what you're saying is
that in certain cases the factual finding truly is the
legal determination, but that in other cases, other
matters can come in to drive a wedge between the two.
MR. JAY:  Correct.  And I think that this is
a case where the out -- the facts come very close to
pointing to the correct outcome because --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Two -- two cases, and this
is part of Justice Kagan's question, I think.  Case one:
District judge says a reasonable police officer would
think this is probable cause.  Case two:  A person
skilled in the art would think that this was an average
molecular weight.  Do the courts give the same deference
or lack of deference in each case.
MR. JAY:  I think, as I understand your
question, Justice Kennedy, in each question the person
on the stand is actually opining about the ultimate
question.  But if -- if I may, in each case -- for
example, if the -- if the question is did the police
officer see the gun, that -- that may rest on a
credibility finding about whether the police officer is
telling the truth or lying.  The resolution of that
question may be absolutely dispositive of whether there
was probable cause or not, on and off.  One way there's
probable cause; the other there isn't.  But it's still
an underlying factual finding as the Court said in --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  But to say -- to say -- I
don't -- I don't agree with your response to Justice
Kagan.  To say that the -- that the fact-finding will be
dispositive of the legal question is not to say that it
is the same as the legal question, which is what I think
you responded.  I don't think it's the same as the legal
question.  The legal question is are you liable for
violating this patent.  And indeed, it -- it may be
that -- that given a particular meaning that is
established by a factual finding, the outcome is -- is
virtually dictated, but it is not the same.  It is not
the same question.
MR. JAY:  I do agree that it's not the same.
It's not even -- it's not even the same as the ultimate
question of claim construction.  But the -- the step
from the factual finding to the claim construction may
rest on something as simple as this:  There is nothing
else in this patent to get me, the judge, off of the
ordinary meaning of this term to people with skill in
the art.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But how would you define the
standard?  I mean, it's absolutely true what Justice
Scalia says, that at a certain level of generality there
is a gap.  But I thought that in order to determine
liability, what the court has to  inquire into is how a
person with ordinary skill in the relevant art at the
time of the invention would understand the claim.  And
that seems like exactly the question that the expert is
testifying to.
MR. JAY:  The expert is not testifying to
how the person of ordinary skill would understand the
patent writ at large.  And the patent -- that is the
ultimate question for the Court.  What the expert is --
can testify to and what Dr. Grant testified to in this
case is how particular terms in the patent have a
recognized meaning with -- within the art.  The art is
not going to take a position on how the doctrine of
claim differentiation applies, for example, but the
skilled artisan can testify about what the established
meaning of the particular term is.
JUSTICE BREYER:  So let me try this and if
you don't agree with it, just say no and I'll stop.
Okay?
MR. JAY:  Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I thought the classical
distinction is pretty much what I think Justice Scalia
was driving at, that there are a certain number of
factual questions where the question is of the kind,
does this label belong on this thing, this thing being
not in dispute.  It might be a South African yellow
canary up there.  The statute might use the word "South
African yellow canary."  But we are not certain whether
that is a South African yellow canary.
If we call in a bird expert who looks at it
and says it is, that is a question of fact.  If we call
in a lawyer to say how are these words being used in the
statute and does that fit within it, then it is a
question of law.
MR. JAY:  I think that that's basically
right, Justice Breyer.  Though in this case, we have an
expert who came in to testify about why these terms have
a particular meaning.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  But we also have the
Federal Circuit in the two cases where you disagree with
the government accepting the fact that, in fact, the
experts or the lawyer who talked to the patent guy did
use the wrong words.  They accept that.  And then what
they say is, well, in their view it is that that didn't
really concern the Federal Circuit, but for the weight
that the judge gave when trying to interpret the terms
in the patent.
MR. JAY:  Well --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And that at least is a
legal question.  Have I got that right basically, what
the argument is?
MR. JAY:  That's more or less what they've
said.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And what do you say in
response?
MR. JAY:  I -- I say two important things in
response.  One is that in predicting what the Federal
Circuit would do under the correct standard, I don't
think you can disaggregate the pieces of its incorrect
analysis because it rested on the -- on the view that
everything went in favor of Respondents and nothing went
in favor of Petitioners here.
But the second thing -- this is also very
important -- on the -- you alluded, Justice Breyer, to
the prosecution history piece, but that skips over the
very important piece, what the specification, the use of
size exclusion chromatography as the technique in the
specification teaches.  And as the district court found,
page 43a-44a of the petition appendix, the presumed
meaning of that term "average molecular weight" when you
-- when you're using this technology is peak average
molecular weight.  And the -- there are other
technologies such as osmometry and light scattering that
give rise to a different presumed meaning of what
average molecular weight is, because they produce
different measurements.  But the only kind of peak
average that you can read from the chromatogram is peak
average molecular weight.
And the Federal Circuit went right by the
finding that the presumed meaning would be peak average
molecular weight and gave -- essentially treated the
three possibilities, peak, number and weight average, as
though they were equal.  But that's not what the
district court found in the context of this technology.
JUSTICE ALITO:  In a recent law review
article written by two authors, one of whom is a -- is
the deputy solicitor in the Patent and Trademark Office,
the office -- the authors said that they surveyed a very
large number of cases to try to find any in which the
difference between de novo review and clear error review
of factual questions by the Federal Circuit made a
difference in the outcome and they couldn't find any
case in which this fascinating legal debate had a
practical significance.
Now, you want to introduce a level of
complication to this.  The Federal Circuit says de novo
for everything, and you want the court -- you want the
Federal Circuit now to struggle to determine which are
factual questions as to which there's clear error
review, which ones get de novo review, whether it's the
ultimate question.  Is it worthwhile as a practical
matter?
MR. JAY:  It is, Justice Alito.  I'd like --
like to respond to your question and then, if I may, to
reserve my time for rebuttal unless you have follow-up.
First of all, does it matter?  It does
matter.  It matters in cases like this, and I don't know
whether the study that Your Honor referred to would pick
up this case because that's -- that's precisely the
problem.  If you read the Federal Circuit's opinion in
this case, you -- it makes no reference to the
fact-findings as fact-findings and you would not
understand, for example, the finding that I was just
alluding to about presumed meaning because it's not
referred to anywhere.
There are a host of cases like that.  There
have been for years.  And more systematically, as
Professor Menell points out in his amicus brief, I think
pages 17 to 18, the de novo standard produces the
problem that encourages the Federal Circuit to blow
right by the skilled artisan's perspective.  It doesn't
talk about it; it doesn't talk about the evidence that
supports it.  So that's one point.
Another point is about whether the Federal
Circuit could handle this.  This is the -- this is the
standard, disaggregating subsidiary factual questions
from ultimate legal questions, that courts of appeals
apply all the time and that the regional courts of
appeals did in fact apply before the Federal Circuit
came along.  The best example of that is the Harries
case we've cited in our brief written by Judge Hand.
So to apply that standard practice we think
would not be unduly disruptive to the Federal Circuit,
and it would not insulate every single claim
construction from review.  It simply would make the --
have facts treated as facts.
If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of
my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr. Jay.
Ms. Anders.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE
MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Just to start with the distinction between
factual findings and legal inferences here, we think
that factual findings are those that are based, at least
in part, on evidence that is outside the patent and its
prosecution history and that concern matters that are
distinct from the patent itself.  So those could be
factual findings about what kind of data a particular
scientific technique produces or how the inventions,
prior inventions in the field worked.  Those are factual
findings.
We then think that when the district court
takes those findings and now it can understand the --
the concepts that are described in the patent because
it's made those findings, when the district court takes
those findings and then looks at the patent and asks how
would a person of skill in the art interpret the words
in this patent in light of all the pieces of the patent
document and the canons of claim construction, those
inferences that it draws are legal ones.
So I think to take -- to take the size
exclusion chromatography as an example of this because
it's probably easier to discuss it concretely, I think
what happened there was that the district court made a
factual finding that when SEC is used the type of data
that -- that just is spit out is -- produces peak
molecular weight, and if you wanted to produce any other
measure of molecular weight you would need to do more
calculations.  That's the factual finding that the
district court made.
It then took a look at the patent document
and said, in light of that, what inference can I draw
from the specifications referenced to SEC, and the legal
inference that it drew was that probably the patent
meant to refer to peak molecular weight when it used the
term "molecular weight."  And I think the court of
appeals understood the factual finding in the same way
that the district court did.  I think it accepted that
when you use SEC, the data that comes out is MP and you
would need further calculations to produce other types
of data.  But what the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why do you reject what
Mr. Jay tells us were also fact-findings?
MS. ANDERS:  I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I think you have just
told us that the peak, and that that's a fact-finding.  But
you don't accept the other two things that Mr. Jay
characterized as fact-findings.  Can you tell us why
not?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, to take SEC first, I
think what -- I think we agree --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  To take what first?
MS. ANDERS:  SEC, which is the use of size
exclusion chromatography in the specification.
I think we agree that it's a fact-finding to
say that -- that if you use SEC, then peak molecular
weight is produced and that you'd need further
calculations to do other things.  The district court
then made a legal inference where it said because --
because the specification uses SEC, we know that -- that
the patent, in the context of the patents-in-suit -- and
this is a quote from the district court's opinion:  "In
the context of the patents-in-suit, the meaning of
'average molecular weight' must be peak molecular
weight."
That's a legal inference because it's --
it's taking one part of the document and using it to
interpret another part of the document.  The Court in
Markman said that that is classic textual analysis, when
you look at the patent and you say, this part of the
specification tells me something about the claims.
So we think with respect to SEC what the
Federal Circuit did was it disagreed with the legal
inference that the -- that the district court made.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But suppose an expert just
says, in my field skilled artisans think that molecular
weight means the following.  Is that a -- and then the
district court accepts that finding.  Is that a factual
determination in your view?  Because I think Mr. Jay
would say it is.
MS. ANDERS:  I think -- well, first of all,
that's not what the district -- what the expert
testified to here and what the district court found, so
I think we disagree about what the district court
actually said in its opinion.
But if that were what the expert testified
to, then I think that would be a statement of fact, that
in -- in the world we understand generally that SEC
means MP.  I think that would be a finding of fact.
But I would make two points about that.  The
first is that there is then a significant legal analysis
that the district court has to do to figure out how to
construe the patent, and I think that's particularly
clear in the context of indefiniteness, which is what
this case is about, that even if the district court has
some evidence that generally artisans might understand a
term in a particular way, the court then has to look at
the claims themselves, the terms that -- that surround
the term we're trying to construe, the specification,
the embodiments in the specification, the prosecution
history.  It has to look at all of that and decide,
given all of that, would a person of skill in the art be
reasonably certain about how to construe this patent.
So that is a legal inquiry that the court
would have to do after receiving the fact-finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Under your view, two
different district courts construing the same patent
could come out to opposite results based on a subsidiary
factual finding, and neither of those would be clearly
erroneous, and yet on a public patent that is going to
bind a lot of other people, people won't know what to
do.  You have two different interpretations of the
patent.  What happens then?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think that concern is
overstated for -- for two -- two reasons.  I think the
first is that it's -- it's pretty unlikely that that
scenario is going to occur, and the second is that, even
in the rare circumstances in which it did, there are
reasons to think that that's not actually a -- a problem
from a policy standpoint.
So -- so just to elaborate on that, I think
because -- because this inquiry needs to remain
primarily legal, because even after the court makes
fact-findings, it needs to engage in a contextual
analysis of the patent as a whole in light of the canons
of claim construction, we think that the legal questions
are generally going to predominate in the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's just
kind of avoiding the question.  I mean, you can easily
envision this case coming up differently in the district
court depending upon what district courts find as the,
you know, accepted understanding to artisans.
And again, each of those opposite results,
neither one may be clearly erroneous.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think another point is
that district courts I think have a way, have ample
tools to try to avoid that scenario from occurring.
They can, when there are seriatim cases, there can be
pre-trial coordination in the same district so that --
so that the situation doesn't arise.  Of course,
preclusion will -- will prevent a patentee from having
an issue of claim construction decided against it and
then coming back and trying to relitigate the issue.
JUSTICE BREYER:  What do we do when there's
a bus accident on a technical thing and different people
who were injured sue in different places at different
times?  Same problem, isn't it?
MS. ANDERS:  I'm --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Same problem.  I mean, you
can think of a thousand cases like that where -- where
you have a big bus accident, technical problem with the
motor, different place -- people from different places
who are victims and they sue in different places at
different times.  Juries or tried to the bench, they
could reach different factual conclusions.
MS. ANDERS:  I think that is exactly
right and I think --
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So what do we
do --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  It's because
you have a patent which is a public document that is
binding the world in terms of what other inventors can
do and another inventor looking at it can say, well,
what can I do?
JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He doesn't know.
That is very different than just a particular negligence
case that comes up.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, I was actually
curious what we did, because I can think of examples in
antitrust, I can think of examples in corporate law, I
can think of examples versus every area of the law,
where often it does happen, as the Chief Justice says,
it could -- the different factual things have enormous
public implications.
What I was interested in and asked because I
wanted to know, what are the legal devices for dealing
with that?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I would make two points.
I think that, first, because of the way preclusion
works, it only runs against the patentee.  All right.
So if the patentee loses on an issue of claim
construction or indefiniteness, he cannot then
relitigate that issue, but other -- other accused
infringers can relitigate it and try to build a better
record.
We actually think that that -- that keeps
this from being a policy problem, the possibility that
you could have a subsequent decision that reaches a
different conclusion.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  I guess a deed is a private
document that's -- has public effect, right?  It
prevents certain people from trespassing on the property
that is conveyed, and I suppose that could be construed
in the various courts that reach different results.  So
the mere fact that -- that this binds the public is --
is not conclusive.
MS. ANDERS:  I think  that’s right.  And of
course in the patent system now, there's a -- there's
toleration of a certain amount of disuniformity and I
think  that’s because we generally think that there are
other values that -- that supersede that uniformity.
So, for instance, you could have, in the case of
infringement, you can have two different accusers in
different suits; one makes a better record than the
other, and the patent could be held to infringe one
product but not infringe another materially similar
product.
JUSTICE ALITO:  And you say that factual
findings that are subject to clear error review must be,
quote, "in some sense distinct from the meaning or
validity of the patent."  I don't understand what that
means when the issue is the meaning or validity of the
patent.  If the evidence is -- is relevant, then it
is -- there is a connection.  So what does that mean, in
some sense distinct?
MS. ANDERS:  Well, it means that the
district court is making a finding based on -- based on
science, based on expertise, somebody's -- somebody's
expertise in the field and making a finding about a
matter that isn't just what does this term mean in the
patent.  It's making a more broad finding.
So for instance, what does this type of
scientific process, what type of data does it produce?
You can say that's related to the patent because of
course the patent uses SEC and one question is what kind
of data does it produce.  But it is also a finding of
fact to say, as a general matter, the way science works
is that SEC produces MP without further calculation.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, that sounds like every
factual finding.  It sounds like you're saying that
anything that is a factual issue is subject to clear
error review.  But I thought you were saying something
less than that.
MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think  that’s a factual
finding, but then what the district court has to do is
take that information which allows it to assume the --
the perspective of a skilled artisan and then decide
what it tells it about the patent itself.  And that's a
question of looking at -- at the document itself.  So
the fact that the patent uses SEC, does that raise an
inference about what the term "molecular weight" in the
patent means or not.  That's a question of textual
analysis.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,
Ms. Anders.
Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
It seems to me that the two questions that
were asked in the opening portions to my colleagues and
friends -- one came from Justice Alito, one came from
you, Mr. Chief Justice -- are matters that this Court
already has effectively decided in the Markman case and
are the reason why de novo review is appropriate under
these circumstances.
In effect, Justice Alito asked the question
is all of this worth the candle, because the debate
between the government and the Petitioner in this case
and the difficulty of trying to decide which facts do
you defer to and which ones don't you defer to and when
is it a credibility determination, when is it not.  This
Court said unanimously more than 15 years ago in Markman
that all of those kinds of issues get subsumed within
the fundamental question of how best to interpret the
patent, and that that's the ultimate question and that's
a legal question, and therefore, all of the disputes,
factual in nature or however you want to describe them,
get subsumed within that.  It seems to me the final --
the ultimate conclusion from that then is whatever
determination is made is ultimately subject to de novo
review.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I think that Markman just
dealt with judge/jury, not which court gets the fact up
-- decides the facts basically, which is where I do
start.  So if you want to -- but if I take that as a
given, then I'd say why should you treat fact matters
here any different than any other case.  The main reason
for letting the district judge, I've always thought,
decide facts as an initial matter in a technical case is
because there are all kinds of facts, you know.  We
happen to have some particularly odd definitional ones
here, but there are all kinds of facts.  In technical
cases, there are all kinds of facts.  And the
traditional reason is you've seen the witnesses -- but
there is one thing he's done that the -- that the court
of appeals has not done, and in a technical case, it
seems to me that makes an enormous difference.  He sat
there the whole time and listened to these experts talk.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Actually, that's not true.
JUSTICE BREYER:  And that, I think, is a
very powerful reason for saying in a technical case,
don't overturn the judge's factual findings whether they
are -- particularly scientific matters, but no
particularly here -- unless those three judges who will
not even read the whole record normally and certainly
won't hear those witnesses, don't let them do it unless
they are convinced that it is clearly erroneous.
Now, that's the argument, and I would like
to say that's different from a statute.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But it's not --
JUSTICE BREYER:  Whether or not it is
different from the -- it's different from -- it's the
same as any technical case.  Now, why is this different?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I think, Judge, that's the
question the Chief Justice asked, which isn't it
possible and isn't it likely when we gave you the
example of seven district courts interpreting three --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But I mean, that same
thing, as we know, could happen in dozens of -- of
technical cases.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But --
JUSTICE BREYER:  And you go on importance, I
could make up some important hypotheticals.  You want
trivial ones, I'll make up some of those.  You want to put
a definition on a thing, fine.  You know, we can all
both -- and you're probably better than I am at it.  And
you say is that the only answer that patents are somehow
different?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Patent claim
construction is different.  I think that's exactly what
this Court said in Markman --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can we go -- can we go
back to the question?  If it's technical, it's all right
for the judge to find the fact.  I thought in our
Seventh Amendment cases we have rejected the notion that
if an issue is difficult, technical, the judge can
decide it even though it's a fact.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  No.  There are lots
of -- there are lots of technical issues that juries are
allowed to decide.  What the -- what the Court
recognized in Markman was that the nature of the inquiry
under claim construction -- and it's important to just
step back for a second and put it in context.
Claim construction is based, first, on the
plain language of the claims.  Regardless of whether
they are written for scientists or not, you're supposed
to start with the plain and ordinary meaning of the
claim language itself.  And then as construed through
the specifications, which are, again, designed to
provide a reasonably clear exegesis of what the patent
and the invention is, what the claims mean.  And then
you have the prosecution history, which can, in some
instances, be complicated.
But in this particular instance where the
very specific word in this patent was inquired about by
two patent examiners, experts in the subject matter, and
asked what does average molecular weight -- excuse me --
mean in this context, they got the answer peak asked in
the exact same context they got the answer weight.  And
what is -- I mean, the notion in that circumstance that
this is not indefinite under the -- in this situation
seems to me completely indefensible.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips --
MR. PHILLIPS:  And that --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.
MR. PHILLIPS:  No, go ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is your argument that there
are no subordinate factual determinations in these kinds
of cases or as you opened by saying, as your argument,
sure, there are factual determinations; we can come up
with a zillion of them, but it's not worth the candle to
figure out which is which.
MR. PHILLIPS:  It's not -- it's not worth
the candle because all you're going to do is create a
cottage industry of trial lawyers fighting with the
judge about which bucket some particular evidence fits
into and whether you can -- whether it's --
JUSTICE BREYER:  But normally, normally is
not difficult to distinguish the one from the other.
Sometimes it is.  But in the cases where it isn't, which
I think are vast, did that dial read 7?  I have 4
witnesses who said it did, and I have 3 witnesses who
said it read 5.  And now let's complicate that, but it
all has to do with what happened in a laboratory at a
particular time.  Are we going to have the 3 people from
the Federal Circuit going in and second-guessing the
judge without giving him any weight on that kind of
factual question, which I suspect, I have no reason to
believe it won't, will turn up comparatively just as
often?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, I think
that -- I mean, I don't want to go to war with your -- I
don't want to go to war with your hypothetical.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I want the answer.  I want
the answer.
MR. PHILLIPS:  The problem with the
hypothetical is that it assumes that there -- that there
will be instances in which the question of pure science
is a matter about which there is disagreement.  And
that --
JUSTICE BREYER:  What happened in --
MR. PHILLIPS:  And it's very, very uncommon
and that's why it's not worth -- this Court -- this
Court said it specifically in Markman.  It said, "Our
experience in interpreting documents teaches us that
they will rarely, if ever, be resolved."
And the evidence we have from the patent
office is never resolved on the basis of differences of
opinion by an expert under -- under these circumstances.
So as I was saying before, what are you doing?  You're
creating a cottage industry --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  But Mr. Phillips, if that's
your argument, I mean, then you'd just have to deal with
Rule 52(a) because Rule 52(a) sets out the very blanket
rule.  It doesn't say except where it's not worth the
candle.  It just says what it says, that these are
matters for the trial court.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But if -- but if, as this
Court said in Markman, treating interpretative issues as
purely legal and the reason for doing that is to avoid
the problem the Chief Justice identified, which is that
otherwise, you're going to end up with a single document
that is binding on the rest of the world having
inconsistent meanings and, therefore, it is different.
It is different from every other issue in patent law,
and I think it's different from every other issue of
litigation.  It is a --
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Explain why it's
different from obviousness because the other side said,
well, why shouldn't the fact law division for claim
construction be the same as it is for obviousness.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And the reason is, is
that obviousness carries with it a whole slew of
additional factual questions that ultimately will
predominate whereas -- and also begins with the
proposition this is what the claim means.  All right.
So you start with that as a given, which is a pure
question of law.
The obviousness issue at that point can turn
on the success of the -- of the product, can turn on how
the market responded to it.  Those are lots and lots of
pure factual issues that this Court had already
recognized in John Deere -- Graham v. John Deere, and
said, you know, there's no reason to have pure question
of law even if at the end of the day there is a question
of law.
What I took Markman to mean -- I'm going to
go back to that same language -- treating interpretative
issues as purely legal is that there are -- is that
it's -- it is, it's literally not worth the candle, that
the right way to analyze it.  The only way effectively
to provide notice to the world is to have one court
that's expert make the final judgment.  That's the other
part of the analysis, it seems to me at least, worth a
little bit of comment, which is which is the better body
for making this decision?
You say, Justice Breyer, you like the
district court because the district court, 1, may have
the opportunity to -- to listen to the witnesses,
although in this case, claim construction was done
strictly on the papers.  There were no witnesses who
testified.
But number 2, if you go back to what the
ultimate inquiry is, which is what does the term mean in
the context of the patent, which is what Markman says,
so it's got to be against the claim language, the
specification and the prosecution history, what -- what
are we -- what is the undertaking there, under those
circumstances, treating it -- giving that kind of a
decision-making process, which is something Federal
Circuit does every day.
JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, it isn't that I
like it better.  It is that Rule 52(a) says that
fact-finding of the district court should be overturned
only for clear error.  And once I start down this road,
well, that's true on some facts and not other facts,
and -- and I get into this.  See, I'm not an expert.  I
don't see where the stopping place is.  I don't see how
to manage the system and I am moved by the fact that the
lawyers here are pretty much -- who know patent law are
pretty much in favor of district courts as far as amici
are concerned.  They're pretty much in favor of district
courts making the fact-finding.  So -- so I don't  see
where to go to start drawing the lines you want to draw.
MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm -- I'm not sure I -- I
agree with your assessment about how comfortable the
world is with the district courts making fact-finding in
the patent context.  My experience is --
JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't know.  Rule 52(a)
and that's the -- what do I do about that?
MR. PHILLIPS:  And it seems to me Markman
answered 52(a).  Markman says it's a pure question of
law and it should all be treated as a pure question of
law in order to guarantee uniformity and to provide
adequate notice to the world.
JUSTICE ALITO:  So if a patent is --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I clarify a point
that you made in response a little earlier?  You said
that this was not a hearing.  It is a hearing, but is it
always on papers?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Doesn't have to be.  But in
this context, this was all done on the basis of the
submitted declarations and -- and depositions.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So there was no live
hearing.
MR. PHILLIPS:  There was no live hearing on
this, no.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, Markman hearings
certainly have expert testimony, don't they?
MR. PHILLIPS:  They can.  They don't have
to.  You don't have to have Markman --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  When they do have expert
testimony, you want it to say that that's -- it doesn't
involve any findings of fact to which the court of
appeals must defer.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  I mean, I think that's
the right answer.  And the reason for it is, is that,
again, you've got to put it in context.  And if you use
the government's theory, it's particularly striking
which is if it's a dispute about a scientific principle
apart from the patent, they're virtually -- that doesn't
happen.  I mean, you can read the first 25 pages of
Grant's declaration.  There is no disagreement between
anything he said and anything that our experts said on
any of those general principles of law.
It is only when you get to the
interpretation in the context of the patent, which is
language he uses repeatedly, and then tries to -- tries
to take his interpretation, his reading of the patent,
elevate it to a finding of fact and giving deference to
the decision-making of the district court.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So what do you want the
district court to do?  Do you want the district court,
nonetheless, even though what it finds is not going to
be given any deference, do you want them to listen to
witnesses?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Or to take at least written
testimony where there's what you say is a rare
scientific question comes up?
MR. PHILLIPS:  No --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if it's going to be
decided by the court of appeals, why should the -- why
should the district court have any witnesses at all?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And why should it say that
if you want also just to follow the same question
just -- not to separate conclusions of law -- findings
of fact and conclusions of law, that's all out.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, in reality --
JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No findings of fact at
all.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, actually, the
claim construction analysis is just a claim construction
analysis when she goes through it.  She doesn't -- the
district judge didn't accord findings of fact,
conclusions of law analysis to it in the first place.
She just analyzed each of the claims including the
average molecular weight.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  So this district judge
should not have even taken this testimony; is that it?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, I think it's
perfectly sensible to take the testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?  Why?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Because it helps inform
even the district judge's understanding of what the
patent is about in order to be able to apply the claim
language, the specification, and the prosecution
history.
Remember, at the end, all you're talking
about is if you can't figure it out from everything else
that's in front of you, which you should be able to,
will there be a situation where there is some testimony
about a scientific principle, apart from the patent,
that could get you there, and the situation is virtually
unheard of.  The patent office says no.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Phillips, can I try this
out and see if you agree with me.
If a patent is like public law, if it's like
a statute or like a rule, then factual findings
regarding the meaning of that patent are not entitled to
clear error review.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Any more than factual
findings regarding the meaning of a statute are -- or
the Constitution are entitled to plain error review.
What was the original understanding of the Second
Amendment?  That's a factual question, but it's not
subject to plain error review.  What did Congress intend
if you think Congress intended things?  That's a factual
question, but it's not subject to plain error review.
Now, on the other hand, if a patent is
private law, if it's like a deed or if it's like a
contract, then Rule 52(a) comes into play.
Do you agree with that?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, I agree with that.  As
I've said all along --
JUSTICE ALITO:  So it all turns on which --
how we --
MR. PHILLIPS:  Which one you think it's
closer to.
JUSTICE ALITO:  Okay.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But actually, I think Markman
answered that, because I think Markman recognized that
this is a public document that is going to be binding on
third parties, and that therefore ought to be construed
as a matter of law in order to ensure the stare decisis
component of it.  And they rejected it.  Remember, the
Court -- this Court specifically rejected the
alternative argument put forward, I think by the
government's lawyer, suggesting that you can use
collateral estoppel and other methods of dealing with
fact-findings or fact determinations.  This Court said
no, that's not adequate.  You need stare decisis in
order to guarantee the kind of uniformity that only the
Federal Circuit can apply --
JUSTICE BREYER:  How many patents do they
issue a year about, do you have any rough idea?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.  How many patents?
JUSTICE BREYER:  How many patents are issued
every year?  Roughly.  Do you have any idea?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't.  The SG's lawyer
would almost certainly be in a better position to answer
that.  But obviously it's a significant number of them.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips, there might be
very different kinds of factual determinations that are
relevant to patentability than are relevant to
interpretation of a statute, so let me just give you
one.  I mean, suppose that the validity of a patent
depended on when a particular invention was made.  You
know, was it done in 1980 or was it done in 2000.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, the priority date.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that was absolutely
critical to your determination of whether a patent was
valid.  But that seems like so within the province of
the trial court and --
MR. PHILLIPS:  You mean -- or the jury.
JUSTICE KAGAN:  How do I deal with that?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, but that's -- that's the
priority date and the priority date's always been
recognized as a question of fact.  I mean, the court --
JUSTICE KAGAN:  So a question of fact which
the trial court ought to get deference on, no?
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, absolutely.  But that's
not -- that's not a claim construction issue.
That's just a question of what is the
priority date for purposes of -- you have to go outside
the patent to get that.  Because you've got to be -- you
have to find out at what point other things were
available, you know, how does it react to other filings
that would have been made?
JUSTICE KAGAN:  I see, but are you saying
that there aren't similar things that could arise within
the context of claim construction, just different
people's view of what the facts on the ground are?  You
know, is molecular weight usually measured in
kilodaltons or something else.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, but that's the whole
point.  There isn't any disagreement about that.  Most
of the -- of those kinds of issues that are completely
distinct from the patent itself where you're not just
trying to figure out the language of the patent, there
are very few differences of opinion about it.  Everybody
acknowledged, even the Federal Circuit acknowledged that
suggesting that average weight was -- implied average
molecular weight, weight average molecular weight was
implied by the reference to kilodaltons, right, was a
misstatement of law.  It was a misstatement of science.
But I think quite rightly, then drew the
precise legal conclusion that I would hope this Court
would affirm, which is that when a patent holder
identifies flatly inconsistent positions in the
prosecution history in order to get two separate patents
issued, one using a measure for one and one using a
measure for the other, where -- where, just to be clear
about this, this patent is all about molecular weight.
The whole purpose of this was to get --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Phillips, why do you
think that the court below just didn't make that
holding?  To be frank with you,  when I read the
background of this case, your intuitive or your reaction
was my own.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But they didn't.  They
didn't actually say that clearly enough.  And I'm going
to ask on the  rebuttal what Mr. Jay would say if they said
that.  Is that an issue of law?  If you have
inconsistent positions in patent prosecution, you're
bound.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  I mean, I think
that's -- I mean, whether you can -- whether it's an
estoppel, I don't know, but whether it's the best way to
interpret the patent, regardless of what else there is
in the record and the evidence, I think that's one place
where the Solicitor General and we are in complete
agreement, that the one thing you cannot do is take
fundamentally inconsistent positions in the prosecution
history, create a record that says, average weight means
-- average molecular weight means weight and average
molecular weight means peak, when the whole purpose of
this exercise is to get the weight into a certain range
of kilodaltons in order to protect it against toxicity.
I mean, that's the whole patent.  You would
have thought in the ordinary course, if I were writing a
patent, and I thought everything turned on average
molecular weight, I might actually bother to define the
term.
JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That may be
true, but what you -- and I know I'm not going to get an
answer from you, because I know what  it would
be.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, you always get an
answer from me.
JUSTICE BREYER:  My question is, where are
we going if we start carving out one aspect of the
patent litigation, namely the construction, and say that
fact matters underlying that, root facts, even when they
are one witness versus another, are for the court on
review to decide, but in all other matters, they're
really clear error.  I don't know where I'm going with
that, because I'm not an expert in this area.  But you
see that I'm nervous about it?
MR. PHILLIPS:  I do.  And I guess what I
would suggest, Justice Breyer, and hopefully this is an
answer to your question, is that the Federal Circuit has
followed this path for well more than 20 years.
JUSTICE BREYER:  Oh, you've seen the figures
in here.  The figures are they followed the path and
they reverse non-stop and it's, like, 30 percent or 40
percent of all the cases get reversed.
MR. PHILLIPS:  But those numbers have
continued to come down, and the reason they've continued
to come down is that there was an enormous fight between
both the district courts and the Federal Circuit about
the methodology of claim construction.  But the en banc
decision of the Federal Circuit in Phillips made it very
clear, you look at the claims, the specification, the
prosecution history, the learned treatises and
dictionaries, and as a last recourse, if need be, you
can turn to experts to help you understand it.
And nobody -- and I'm not discouraging,
Justice Scalia, the use of experts.  I mean, there is
reason to testify.  Anybody who wants to understand
certain kinds of patents are going to want to have
experts come in.  I can guarantee you parties are not
going to present these cases to the judge without coming
in with a tutorial that provides a very good explanation
of how that patent operates.
All of that's legitimate.  And I would give
a district court, if I were the Federal Circuit, the
deference that the district judge is otherwise entitled
to based on the strength of the argument to kind of --
the kind of lesser deference courts pay to courts -- to
administrative agencies in certain circumstances.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You're talking about
Skidmore.
MR. PHILLIPS:  Skidmore, thank you.  I was
looking for the word, but it wasn't coming to me.
You know, the notion that you're entitled
to whatever deference the -- the power of your logic
gets you to.  But if you use that test here where, as I
said, Justice Sotomayor --
JUSTICE SCALIA:  If you're right, we'll say
the same thing.  I mean, you could call that deference
if you like, but --
MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's a measure of --
but at least it gives the district court an incentive to
do harder work in order to be in a position to lay claim
to more deference.
But what we do know here is that the -- the
fundamental -- the prosecution history creates to my
mind an insolubly ambiguous patent and there's no way
out of that box.  And then what the district -- what the
court of appeals said is, is there anything in the SEC
calibration data or the shifting of this and that that
somehow makes this suddenly become definite enough, and
the answer to that is no, none of that does anything
except suggest to a person of skill in the art that peak
could potentially have been a legitimate way to
interpret that.
But none of that gets you out of the box.
And indeed, every time their expert testified to this he
kept saying, well, it's because the prosecution history
refers to peak.  But that's only because he discounted
the other half of the prosecution history that referred
explicitly and completely to the weight.
And it's in that context that I would hope
that this Court, if it decides to go past de novo, if it
thinks this exercise is worth the candle, will go beyond
just simply saying there's a new standard to be applied
and analyze each of the facts of the -- that have been
put before the Court by the Petitioner, and make a
determination because it's -- one, it would be very
helpful to know what the indefiniteness standard means
in light of last year's decision in Nautilus and that
can be elucidated here.  But two, it seems to me that,
whatever else you want to say about this, this is a
hopelessly indefinite set of claims.  It is not entitled
to protection.  It should be regarded -- it should be
regarded as invalid, and my client should be able to go
forward with the generics that would bring this medicine
to -- at less expense to the population.
If there are no further questions, Your
Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Jay, 3 minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. JAY:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  I
would like to make, I think, five points.
One is in response to Mr. Phillips's
suggestion that there aren't going to be many cases with
contested facts.  This is a case with contested facts.
This is a case in which -- let's talk about figure one
in particular because we didn't touch on that as much in
the top half of the argument.
The meaning of figure one is crucial to the
Federal Circuit because it said its understanding of
figure one was that it made it hard to credit our
interpretation of the patent.  But there was directly
opposed scientific evidence in the district court, would
the peak shift or would it not shift.  Dr. Ryu said,
page 375a of the joint appendix, no, it wouldn't.  The
district court found as a fact that, yes, it would.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why does the government
disagree with you about that?
MR. JAY:  The government agrees with us
100 percent about figure one and I think the government
says, and we agree with this as well, the error on
figure one is itself a sufficient basis to remand.  And
what might happen on remand I think you can't
necessarily predict because you can't disaggregate the
-- all of these de novo conclusions from each other.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Which From the facts that you
say are facts and the government says do not qualify as
to their test.
MR. JAY:  The government says that the SEC
point about presumed meaning, and I think -- the
government doesn't pay sufficient attention to the
presumed meaning fact-finding.  But we disagree on that,
and on -- relating to the prosecution history.
Now, Mr. Phillips alluded to the prosecution
history, and, Justice Sotomayor, this gets to your
question that you asked me to address.  Can the
prosecution history by itself answer this case, and the
answer is no, it can't.  The Federal Circuit couldn't
say that it did because when you have a patent that is
sufficiently definite in light of the specification,
that's the end of the matter.
As the Federal Circuit said in Phillips, the
prosecution history ranks below the specification as an
interpretative aid, and if the patent is sufficiently
definite in light of the specification, and we say that
it is, and Dr. Grant said that it was -- Dr. Grant
referred to a number of things besides what Mr. Phillips
just told you about why peak was the more likely
meaning.  So, for example, number average and weight
average are usually seen together, peak by itself.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry, you didn't
answer my question.  If the Federal Circuit just simply
said, mistake or not, you said it, you said it was
molecular weight, not peak, you're stuck.
MR. JAY:  It can't say that, Justice
Sotomayor, because its own doctrine says -- what you're
positing is some kind of disclaimer, and a disclaimer --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, I'm positing an
estoppel of some sort.
MR. JAY:  Well, whichever way you see it,
that rises -- that requires a clear and convincing
standard, a clear and unambiguous standard that they did
not apply here, they could not apply here.  And in
particular what we have now is the '808 patent.  These
two statements were made 4 years and 6 years after the
'808 patent issued.  If it was definite when it issued,
it's still definite today.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
MR. JAY:  Thank you.
