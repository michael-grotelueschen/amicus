CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Corporation.
Mr. Monahan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MONAHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley
Sperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal
proceeding litigated by George McCollins. They never
received notice of that prior proceeding; they never
received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they
never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never
received an opportunity to appeal the decision denying
class certification.
No precedent of this Court would justify
treating -- treating people as parties under preclusion
principles under these circumstances. Recently, in
Taylor v. Sturgell, this Court addressed the rule
against nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized
exceptions. The Court in that case discussed a properly
conducted class action as being one of the exceptions.
The Court, in discussing these preclusion
rules, noted that they are limited by due process
concerns, and the Court noted that the properly
conducted class action is an exception due to the due
process protections incorporated into Rule 23.
Obviously, this Court has discussed the due
process protections with class actions in prior cases,
particularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in
cases such as Eisen and Shutts. The Court has noted
that whenever a class is certified notice must be
provided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they
must have the right to appear and be heard in person or
by counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well
as protection of adequate representations.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a class action
based on diversity is filed in one of the Federal
districts in West Virginia, and the district court
denies class certification. The same plaintiff, the
same plaintiff's attorney, takes the old complaint,
writes in the name of the new named party, files exactly
the same complaint in another Federal -- in the other
Federal district in West Virginia. Would your argument
be the same? That can go forward, get another shot at
class certification?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, under the -- yes,
under those circumstances, as outlined by -- by Your
Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: All you have to do is get
a new named plaintiff?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, as long as it's not the
same party. If it's a different party -- and that --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it could be the same
attorney?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, it could be the same
attorney. This Court noted that in Taylor v. Sturgell,
in South -- South Central Bell v. Alabama, and also as
discussed in the Richards case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- would the
decision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have
not been met, the individual issues predominate over the
common issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of
respect when the same thing is tried again?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, but that
would be under stare decisis principles, we believe, and
that's the situation, since it is a different party,
since it's not the same party itself. And, certainly,
the district courts in West Virginia would look to other
district courts' opinions and would likely render them
persuasive -- or consider them persuasive under those
circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO: But they have no obligation
to follow another district court opinion, do they?
MR. MONAHAN: Technically, no, Your Honor.
If the Fourth Circuit, for instance, had spoken on the
matter, though, and it was something that was decided by
the Fourth Circuit, or of course by this Court, then
clearly they would. And the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this one was
determined by the multidistrict panel, right?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, a district judge in
Minnesota. Yes, Your Honor.
Interestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted
that adopting a broad theory of virtual representation
based upon an identity of interests, adequate
representation, and a close relationship would -- would,
in essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class
action or recognizing a common law class action without
any of the procedural due process protections provided
by Rule 23.
Obviously, in dealing with these cases, the
main reason a certification is -- the main reason the
due process protection is provided upon certification is
to go ahead and justify binding the class members to any
judgment issued by the court at that point. Until you
have that, unless you have the certification and the due
process protections for a Rule 23(b)(3) class, until you
have those, the absent class members remain strangers to
the proceeding.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the absent class
members retain their individual right. I mean, they are
not being precluded as to their individual claim. It's
only they can't be a class representative.
MR. MONAHAN: That's -- that's true, Your
Honor. We submit, however, that any procedural rights
which have been recognized and adopted -- those
procedural rights, just as the substantive claim itself,
have to be adjudicated consistent with due process. And
West Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West
Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has
the right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees
fit to manage its own docket and administrate its own
docket as it sees fit.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right to read the
supplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia
Supreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on
what the content of West Virginia law is?
MR. MONAHAN: That's not correct, Your
Honor. All of the issues raised in our petition for
cert remain just as they were. At worst -- if White v.
Wyeth withstands petition for rehearing, at worst we
lose our CCPA claim. That certainly is a valuable claim
to us. I will not dispute that. But we also have a
common law fraud claim. We also have breach of warranty
claims, and those are still in existence.
And the critical fact of this case in that
regard is the question of whether or not a class may be
certified under West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure
has never been litigated, has never been decided by any
court.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Monahan, do you
mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a
decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never
be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I believe it would
depend upon whether or not that State has said that not
only are we going to look at these Federal decisions as
being persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself
bound by the decisions of the Fourth District or the
United States District Court for the Southern District
of West Virginia.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose the State
says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have
our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll
go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't.
Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine
whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case
would have gone along, would have interpreted its own
rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal
court interpreted the Federal rule?
MR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance, what Your
Honor suggested is essentially what the West Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals does. I mean, they will --
they will consider them to be persuasive. They will
consider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the
court noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit
judge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions
denying class certification in medical device or
prescription drug cases. And the court noted that, you
know, although we will look at those rules and they may
be persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on
us, and that's because we do not want our legal analysis
to be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to
Federal decisional rules.
JUSTICE ALITO: What is -- what is the
difference between the Federal law and the West Virginia
law on the class certification issue? Not the
application to this particular complaint, but as to the
-- the standard. What do you see as the difference
between the Federal standard and the West Virginia
standard?
MR. MONAHAN: The main difference, Justice
Alito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in
In re Rezulin, for instance. They cite Newberg on Class
Actions as one of the authorities to support this
principle, but they note that in -- in our court that
normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and
damages will not bar certification on a predominance
basis, because those go to the right of the individual
to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of
the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as
common issues in many cases and save the court an
extreme amount of time addressing those common issues.
Now, the court indicates that if individual
trials need to be conducted later on, on any of those
issues, if there are truly individual issues that need
to be resolved concerning those claims, individual
trials can be accomplished.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the ground that the
court here, the Federal court, decided that there
weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact
that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that
there is no economic loss, what were the differences?
What were the differences here? How would
the difference in standard play out here?
MR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance -- and this
is an interesting aspect of this case -- that the
court's not only trying to bind us on the procedural
ruling but is also trying to bind us in a substantive
ruling as to what the elements of the claims in West
Virginia are and as to what's needed to prove those
claims.
For instance, the Eighth Circuit has -- has
held that, in looking at the district court's opinion,
that it has held that an actual physical injury is
required, that economic loss alone is not enough.
Clearly, that's not consistent with West Virginia law.
An economic loss alone can be sufficient. In West --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- I'm sorry. I
don't mean to cut you off. But you're really arguing
that due process requires the same treatment,
essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard
that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks
a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, very similar, Your Honor.
I mean, in this circumstance -- I mean, these rights are
provided. These procedural rights, once they are
created, are being provided, and they can't be taken
away without due process. West Virginia has recognized
the right to -- to proceed in our court under our rule,
and not -- you don't have a guarantee --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're almost treating
it as a property right, and -- and you're basically
saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property
right.
MR. MONAHAN: Well, I think -- I think what
I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that these type of
procedural rights -- whenever you have a substantive
claim which is a property right, and you seek to
litigate them, you shall have available to you all the
Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted and
recognized, and those procedural elements of the claim
should be treated or adjudicated just the same as a
substantive claim, consistent with due process.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you,
because there is a difference of some sort between
procedure and substantive rights, then what would
command the due process violation in a situation in
which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the
same standard that the State has and there has been
adequate representation on the procedural question,
where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been
extinguished?
That's a lot of conditions, but those are
the three conditions of this case. So, what in due
process requires that outcome, your outcome?
MR. MONAHAN: Well, I believe that the
basic -- because we are not the same party, we believe
the basic elements of just the notice and the right to
be heard, which our party has never had. May I --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're extinguishing a
substantive right. If I return to my question of what
makes a procedural right substantive --
MR. MONAHAN: Well, this particular
procedural right is very closely connected -- I mean,
one of the main purposes of a class action is to level
the economic playing field and to enable people with
small individual claims to aggregate them in order to
seek justice. Without those --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually not true. The
plaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is
how much money the lawyers are going to receive,
really --
MR. MONAHAN: Well --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because plaintiff
gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation
amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a
class action or an individual action, so it's really not
the plaintiff who stands to win.
MR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, what --
what -- the assumptions you just made I don't believe
are correct in this -- in this particular case, because,
one, obviously if we lose the CCPA claim in light of the
White case, there would be no statutory attorney fees.
And even if we had the CCPA claim, it's -- the court has
discretion. It may award them. There's no requirement
that it do so, no requirement whatsoever.
And how can anybody bring -- any lawyer
trying to bring one of these small damage claims -- if
the damages are only $100, $200 per plaintiff, for
instance, how could any lawyer justify facing a
defendant such as Bayer in a complex product liability
action? Just the cost alone of having experts, of doing
discovery -- all those matters would greatly exceed the
value of the claim itself. So the class action is the
only way in which to aggregate the claims and level the
economic playing field for everybody.
The other thing, I would note for the common
law fraud claim, West Virginia does have a bad-faith
exception for attorney fees, but that depends on the
degree of fraud that the court finds, and that -- that,
in and of itself, is discretionary.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- how far
does your procedural right extend? Let's say in the
second action, the court says, look, we've been through
all this before; we have had a million pages of
discovery from the prior action, no protective order at
all. So while, if you were the first person here,
you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories,
because we've been through this before, I'm going to say
you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you
only get 5 interrogatories.
Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to
the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here
first? Is that right?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I think the court
does have some flexibility, depending upon the
procedural rule at issue. And -- and, in essence, the
court is applying almost essentially the stare decisis
type of principles there. We have resolved this exact
discovery issue before, the exact arguments --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now it's not only
that you're entitled to your day in court substantively;
you're -- you're entitled to your day in court
procedurally as to some procedural aspects but not
others?
MR. MONAHAN: Well, I certainly think the
Court needs to examine the procedural aspect and its
importance, and the part that it plays. I mean, for
instance, one of the problems we have in this situation
is that normally res judicata and collateral estoppel do
not normally apply to mere procedural rulings. They're
not normally used for that purpose.
Most cases where they are used for that
purpose are cases where a dismissal has occurred based
upon a procedural ruling or a procedural failing. And
whenever they apply collateral estoppel and res
judicata, it's almost -- every case I've seen deals with
the exact same party in another proceeding. And there
they preclude them. But here is a totally different
party. And the issue under West Virginia law has never
been litigated by any court.
JUSTICE BREYER: A totally different
party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a
litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural
rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as
he finds it. Now, he could go to the judge and say:
Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling
in light of the fact I'm here.
How does the situation I've just sketched
differ from this one? I mean, you have a client who's
coming to the litigation late. He's separate from the
litigation, I know, but he could send a representative
to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider
in light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not
joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.
But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief
Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply
it. And is your client analogous to that person who
joins litigation late?
MR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, because -- I
mean, for instance, this Court has noted -- and they
noted it, I believe in the -- you noted it in the
Richards case. The Chase National Bank v. Norwalk and
Martin v. Wilks has noted that a stranger to litigation
has no duty to seek to intervene in the case; however,
they can; they can seek to intervene if they have
notice, if they so choose.
If you take that affirmative step to
intervene, knowing what has happened in that case, you
obviously have notice of the case because you're
choosing to intervene. And if you seek to intervene
having that notice, then you take it as you find it.
Now, you can certainly ask the court to
reconsider because you want to raise new arguments, but
there would be no obligation to do so.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here you have a different
forum. You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to
a different forum. How -- and I guess your answer is
that you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe
you find a judge who will certify this class.
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't
believe so. I don't believe that's the case because
there are limitations to that. One would be, I think,
if you filed at another Federal court, for instance,
Rule 23 would be the same legal standard. Federal Rule
is the same legal standard in all Federal courts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have a new
plaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice
and an opportunity to be -- to be heard.
MR. MONAHAN: For preclusion purposes,
that's correct. But I think the Federal court certainly
would look at those cases for stare decisis purposes in
looking as to whether or not the class should be
certified under the same legal standard.
Now, here we do have a different forum. We
have the State of West Virginia, as a separate
sovereign, has its own rights to do this. But, once --
once -- if a class would be denied in West Virginia at
one time, I believe that the chances of having another
one succeed are very low, because courts will look to
those stare decisis principles.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but there are 50
States.
MR. MONAHAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are 50 States. And
if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide
class action.
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the issue
with that, though, is this Court has -- in Taylor v.
Sturgell, for instance, which Your Honor authored, the
Government argued in that case that, you know, we should
adopt this virtual representation theory because of
repetitive litigation. We had this FOIA request. Any
person out there can file asking the government for
these documents, and the government may have to go on
thousands of times, millions of times, conceivably, to
do this.
And this Court note -- noted that the threat
of repetitive litigation is not sufficient to justify
adopting a new exception to the rule against nonparty
preclusion.
JUSTICE ALITO: What kind of notice do you
think due process would require? If the court in which
the case was first filed thought, I'm not going waste --
I don't want to waste my time on this class
certification issue if it's just going to be re-
litigated over and over and over again, so I want to
provide sufficient notice so that the members of a class
will be bound by my -- by my class certification issue,
what -- what would have to be done? Would they all have
to be given individual notice and asked to opt out?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I believe so.
I believe -- I mean, consistent with Shutts, this
Court's ruling in Shutts and Eisen, I think they would,
because once they had the notice and that they would
decide not to opt out, then they would be bound by any
ruling that the -- that the court issues there. But
if -- if they don't have that opportunity, especially
whenever -- and this case also involves the
Anti-Injunction Act, of course, the principles of
federalism and comity, and any question under the
Anti-Injunction Act, any doubt, should go against
issuing injunctions.
And the -- the exceptions to that Act are
narrowly construed in light of principles of federalism,
and because we do have a separate State here and we're
trying to apply or seek State relief and seek the State
rules and follow the State rules, I do believe you would
need the same notice that we have in Shutts, the notice,
the opportunity to appear, and the opportunity to opt
out.
Now, certainly, other issues -- if we're
talking about policy concerns, another thing that I
would note is that in CAFA recently -- whenever Congress
adopted CAFA, certainly if they believe that basing
one -- using one class denial in Federal court as a
basis to preclude all other similar classes seeking --
seeking certification, if they thought that was
consistent with due process, certainly they could have
considered adopting that as part of CAFA. But they
chose to deal with it in a very different way, a very
different manner, and that was to go ahead and change
the jurisdictional status in diversity cases, make
minimal diversity and allow removal with certain -- you
know, certain exceptions for certain discretionary ones,
stay at home and local controversy exceptions, but they
didn't -- I mean, that's how they chose to deal with it.
Now, certainly, we would admit that since
CAFA has been enacted, the chance -- certainly, there's
not nearly as many of these cases which will occur where
this would -- where this will be an issue, because many
large classes now will get removed. And --
JUSTICE KAGAN: When -- when Congress
enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise
issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about
a lawyer going from State to State with a different
named plaintiff? Was that -- was that part of what
Congress was reacting to?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Justice Kagan, it's my
understanding that that was something they were
concerned about. And they were concerned about, again,
some States being too permissive in granting class
certifications, and they were worried about some of
those same factors.
But, you know, one of the primary concerns
on all -- in CAFA itself, though, was protecting the
absent class members' rights, and this Court's noted
those same rights in Amchem and Ortiz. In many of its
cases, your cases, you've noted that that's a principal
concern. And this Court has heightened the standard in
those class -- class settlement certifications for the
court to make sure that each and every element and
requirement is met, to ensure that -- that the
settlement itself is fair to all class members,
including the absent class members, and that, you
know -- and that the attorney fees are fair.
JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't it be a violation
-- wouldn't it be a violation of due process if Congress
enacted a statute or if there were a rule adopted that
said that the first ruling on class certification by a
Federal court binds all members of the class in any
other Federal litigation? Would that be a -- then they
would retain their individual claims, but there could
not be another -- another class action -- another class
action filed. Would that be a due process violation?
MR. MONAHAN: In all other Federal cases, I
believe that that might survive a due process challenge,
because you're limiting it to the same legal standard in
those cases. Certainly, I think you could -- because --
because it would be applying, though, to absent class
members who were not truly parties, I believe some of
those due process concerns could be raised.
But you certainly would not have the
elements of the federalism; you would not have the
different legal standard that we have with State courts
applying their own rules.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is there a due process
right to have class action?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, this Court has
noted a procedural right to seek class certification.
There is no right to have one. We have to meet the
requirements in order to --
JUSTICE ALITO: But what if Congress just
decided to get rid of class actions altogether? Would
that be unconstitutional?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I certainly
would hope that they would provide notice and an
opportunity for people to come and make their arguments
and to argue both sides of the question. But, no, I
don't believe so.
JUSTICE BREYER: Did it ever happen -- did
you ever come across an instance before where in a
Federal court a judge in the district court says, no,
you can't have a certification, no; and then a different
plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a
different part of the country and asked for a similar
certification? Have you ever found anything like that
in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather
than the State/Federal?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe
that maybe Thorogood, the recent Thorogood case out of
the Seventh Circuit, might involve something similar to
that.
JUSTICE BREYER: And did they say -- did
they say in -- in that case that the second judge is
bound as a matter of stare decisis, or is he bound as a
matter of collateral estoppel?
MR. MONAHAN: Based on a collateral estoppel
preclusion principles, Your Honor, which --
JUSTICE BREYER: So it's the same issue as
here?
MR. MONAHAN: Well, it's even somewhat
worse, in my opinion, because not only did they have a
different party, but they went from a nationwide class
to a statewide class, and that itself is -- you know,
that's -- even Bridgestone that would be all right
under.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you -- you would
say that the subsequent plaintiff is not bound if he was
not given notice and an opportunity to opt out, even if
he came back to the same court, right?
It would be a stupid thing to do.
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And he's probably going to
lose, but you'd say he's not bound, right?
MR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, that's because he's
not the same party, but the legal standard would be the
same, and it would not be a wise move.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Beck.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The core issue here is whether absent class
members can be bound by a denial of class certification
where there was adequate representation on that issue
but not notice and opportunity to be heard.
JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say "on that
issue," Mr. Beck, on what issue? Because I think that
there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia
approach to class certification is different from the
Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have
been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have
approached the class certification question.
MR. BECK: The issue that was decided and
preclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor,
and what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge
who was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he
made a determination under West Virginia law as to
what's required to make out an economic loss claim, and
he concluded that what is required is individual proof
of injury as well as individual proof of causation. And
then he went on to describe what kind of evidence would
be necessary to do that.
So he made a legal determination, and then
he went -- and then after looking at what kind of
evidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a -- I
think a mixed law and fact determination that, given
that, individual issues would predominate over common
issues. His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law
was later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court
in White, where they held that -- that there is a
requirement of individual proof of injury, which had
been contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's
going to require the same exact kind of inquiry.
So what we have is that there's no
suggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the
predominance requirement under the West Virginia version
of Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the
Federal version, has any other content that's different
from the Federal version.
In Rezulin, there's a suggestion that when
-- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences
in -- in damages or reliance as less significant than
some Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in
any way that if the underlying cause of action requires
individual proof of injury and causation, that somehow
that common questions are going to predominate over
individual questions. There's no suggestion of that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: We couldn't know. We
couldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme
Court, that was before this White v. Wyeth. They were
arguing a question of substantive law: What do we have
to show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't
hurt by the drug? We're saying -- we're not saying we
didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we
paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't
of the quality that it was represented to be.
When the Federal judge said, having to make
a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the
law; you have to show causation, some harm to you. But
then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West
Virginia court, that was still an open question of West
Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have
decided it differently than the Federal court, right?
MR. BECK: Yes. Well, yes -- when the
Federal district judge made the determination, it was in
Mr. McCollins's case, and he's called upon to resolve
questions of State law just like courts are every day in
diversity actions. And he resolved the question of
State law, what's required by the West Virginia Consumer
Credit and Protection Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But sometimes Federal
judges -- they try their best, but they're not the last
word on what the State law is.
MR. BECK: And some -- and, Your Honor, if
-- if for example, Judge Davis had found as he did in
McCollins, and then he had issued the same injunction,
and then the White case had come down the other way,
that -- that says that there is no requirement of
injury, then conceivably the Petitioners could have gone
back to Judge Davis and asked for relief from his
injunction. And then we'd have an interesting
question --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not these Petitioners.
They weren't parties to the case before --
MR. BECK: No, but they were -- they were
parties to the injunction proceeding. They were the
defendants in the injunction proceeding. So they're
subject to an injunction, and then -- then the law
changes, or the law is declared differently by the West
Virginia Supreme Court.
Nothing would have precluded them from
coming back in front of Judge Davis and said:
Respectfully, sir, you -- you were wrong in your
prediction, and we'd like to be relieved from the
injunction.
And then we'd have a very interesting
question about whether being correct or incorrect is --
is something that can eliminate the law of preclusion,
because normally if -- if a party is precluded, they're
not allowed to say I shouldn't be precluded because I
think the judge made a mistake on the law. But we don't
have that here because, in fact, Judge Davis was
vindicated on the content of West Virginia law.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not
sure that White answers the question that I asked,
because White decided a matter of substantive liability,
and the question I asked was whether the approach to
class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit
and in West Virginia.
MR. BECK: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: If you look at Rezulin, if
you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems
to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about
the extent to which a finding is required that common
issues predominate.
MR. BECK: I think that, actually, Judge
Davis took into account the difference in tone, and he
looked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what
Rezulin was focusing on was individual questions of
damages, which defendants often argue is enough so that
individual questions predominate, individual questions
of reliance, which we also often argue mean that
individual questions predominate.
But he said this is different, because this
is -- in order to prove liability, they've got to
establish individual injury, which means, on a
person-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by
the drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their
cholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have
to show that whatever the violation of the Consumer
Fraud Act was is causally linked there.
And he said that's a different animal from
questions of reliance and damages. And -- and I've
heard or read no conceivable explanation about how,
under any standard of predominance, you could have
common questions predominating when every single member
of the class is going to have to examine the medical
records to see whether their cholesterol came down,
whether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if
their cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer
side effects, how that could be linked to a violation of
the Consumer Fraud Act.
So what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart
from Rezulin at all. Judge Davis said: This goes to
core questions of liability, and as I interpret the West
Virginia statute, in order to establish liability,
they're going to have to show that on an
individual-by-individual basis.
And the relevance of White is that he's
correct. Of course, White even goes further and says,
because of that, there's no cause of action under the
West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer that
they have claims that do not involve the consumer,
whatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some
other kind of claims?
MR. BECK: A warranty claim, Your Honor.
There was also a warranty claim in the McCollins case,
the original Federal case. Their warranty claim is no
different, and the requirements of a warranty claim are
no different.
Fraud, obviously, requires individual proof
of injury and causation. The fraud is -- I mean, the
Consumer Fraud Act is -- is an effort to make it easier
for plaintiffs to make out a cause of action. If you
can't make out a cause of action under the Consumer
Fraud Act, it certainly can't be made out under fraud.
And in terms of preclusion law, what the
Eighth Circuit observed was that when there's the -- the
same core set of facts that make out a cause of action,
adding another label to it doesn't change the preclusion
analysis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Beck, if you're right
about issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the
West Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge
Davis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal
District Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing,
but what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that
is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say:
We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to
apply issue preclusion. We're going to stop that court
from proceeding altogether.
And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a
very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the
clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to
another court: We're not even going to let you get to
this question; we're going to stop you.
So maybe you could be right about preclusion
but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.
MR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, the -- any time
that someone invokes the re-litigation exception to the
Anti-Injunction Act, by definition, an alternative would
be to go into the second court and -- and just simply
plead preclusion. That would always be available. And
if that were sufficient, then there would be no
re-litigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.
Here's a reason why it's very important in a
case like this: Under their theory, they -- they could
not only file a class action in one county in West
Virginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but
we pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they
could file one in another county. And in West Virginia,
county judges don't look to judges from other counties
as stare decisis.
And so they could go, under their approach,
to another county, and that judge might agree with us.
And then they go to another county, and eventually
they're pretty confident that they'd find one judge in
one county in West Virginia who would reject our
preclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward.
And in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal
heard. There is no intermediate appellate court, and
there's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme
Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, you're
arguing the principle. What would have happened if the
class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class
had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West
Virginia court had denied class certification? Would
that preclude a later Federal court from granting class
certification?
MR. BECK: If the -- if the West Virginia
court had denied class certification on an issue that is
present in Rule 23, then it would be preclusive under
Rule 23. It would be under the full faith and credit
statute, where Federal courts have to give full faith
and credit to State judgments to the same extent that --
that a State would.
If, however, Your Honor, the court said in
West Virginia, well, they meet all of the requirements
of our Rule 23, but under West Virginia law, we have
discretion to deny a class even if they meet all the
requirements of Rule 23, then that would be an
interesting question, because under Federal procedure,
under this Court's opinions, if someone meets all the
requirements of Rule 23, then class certification is
appropriate.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, the re-litigation
exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of
judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a
judgment?
MR. BECK: I'm not sure that it would be
in -- in the mine-run case, but we don't have it. We --
one of the reasons that this case is unusual is that we
actually have a real-life final judgment that
incorporates the denial of class certification.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But the judgment, if I
understood it correctly -- there was just a
contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court
granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of
class certification isn't responsible for the judge's
dismissal of the suit.
MR. BECK: Well, but it is -- it is merged
into the judgment. It's explicitly a part of the
judgment. It's in the judgment itself. I think it's
our Joint Appendix 83, is it?
JUSTICE KAGAN: So that sounds like a very
contingent answer to my question. If that were not the
case, if it -- if it was the denial of a class
certification, but then the action proceeds as a
non-class litigation, you think that there would be no
judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not
apply?
MR. BECK: No, Your Honor. I think that
would be a tougher question. It's posed in some of the
other cases percolating up, the Thorogood case, for
example, or some of them out of the Seventh Circuit.
I think that, under normal preclusion
analysis, decisions that have not reached the point
where there's a formal final judgment can still be given
preclusive effect if they're sufficiently final, that a
court says it's exceedingly unlikely that we could
reconsider. There's another --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's true about --
that's true about preclusion, but -- and so that you
might go into the West Virginia court and say this
second plaintiff should be precluded, but as Justice
Kagan pointed out, you're dealing with the
anti-injunction statute --
MR. BECK: And I --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that talks about
judgment.
MR. BECK: And I was about to say, Your
Honor, that -- that under the Anti-Injunction Act, it
might actually be a different analysis, and because the
issue isn't present here, we haven't briefed it, but I
could see under the -- looking at the statutory language
of the re-litigation exception that talks about
judgments and also looking to the federalism concerns
that -- that inform the -- the Anti-Injunction Act, one
could argue, in an appropriate case, that whatever the
law is as to preclusion generally, when it comes to the
Anti-Injunction Act, we're going to require more in the
form of a -- of a formal judgment that -- that
incorporates the particular ruling. As I said, that's
not our case, but I could --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, but why isn't it really,
because here what happened was that there was a denial
of class certification and there was a granting of a
summary judgment motion at one and the same time? But
the thing that was responsible for getting the case out
of court was the granting of the summary judgment
motion, not the denial of class certification. That was
extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed.
MR. BECK: Well, I think it's actually --
while -- while it was collateral to the summary judgment
motion on Mr. McCollins's individual claim, it's
actually essential to the judgment in -- in terms of
including it, in terms of who's bound by -- by -- by the
judgment. If class certification had been -- we -- we
need to know once the judge has ruled on class
certification, whether he's granted it or denied it, in
order to know who's affected by the judgment on the
merits and otherwise.
And if he had granted the motion to certify
the class, then there would be one set of effects coming
out of a final judgment. If he denies the motion to
certify the class, there's a different set of effects
that come out of that judgment.
So, it is essential to the judgment, in our
mind, and, incidentally, the essential-to-the-judgment
point under preclusion law is not one that -- that the
Petitioners have ever raised below. It's not one that
is in their questions presented or their cert petition
or their brief. So this isn't an issue that -- that
they've preserved or argued, but we do believe, quite
clearly, that the class certification denial was an
integral part of the final judgment, and -- and,
obviously, it's in there on its terms.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, under the
Anti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket
injunction that says, against all future State court
class proceedings across the United States? Could a
court just order a re-litigation bar?
MR. BECK: I don't believe so, Your Honor.
I think that -- I think that in this Court's Chick Kam
Choo decision, there was an emphasis that under the
Anti-Injunction Act you have to have, you know, the same
issue litigated, and there was a concern about whether
there was a significant difference in standards.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question to
you.
MR. BECK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So articulate what we're
comparing when we're saying that the re-litigation bar
can apply to a procedural ruling.
MR. BECK: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We started a little bit
on the question. Is there any requirement that that
issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the
prior proceedings?
MR. BECK: Oh, I think -- I think that for
the -- for -- for preclusion to apply, even before one
gets to the Anti-Injunction Act, there's a requirement
that the issue be fully and fairly litigated. I think
that -- I think the focus would be, as Judge Davis's
was, is there a difference in -- in the class
certification procedures that would -- that would result
in a -- in a different outcome, given the particular
issue that's been decided. So that -- so that there --
you know, I could conceive of issues that would be
dispositive in a Federal court on class certification
that would have nothing to do with --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's
take --
MR. BECK: -- with certification in State
court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You talked about
different standards. Your adversary said that, in this
State, reliance doesn't need to be proven. Let's assume
that fact. And the district court's ruling here was
based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance
because each individual plaintiff will have to prove
reliance. Does that become the same -- a different
standard or not?
MR. BECK: Judge Davis's opinion was not
based in any way on reliance.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- I'm posing it
as a hypothetical.
MR. BECK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As a hypothetical.
MR. BECK: If -- if a State court had said
that this thing, that -- that reliance, or whatever,
that is talked about so much in Federal courts, we don't
care about that, that's not part of our standard,
then -- then that would be -- and that was the basis of
the Federal court's decision, then I think you would be
applying different standards, and under Chick Kam Choo,
there wouldn't be preclusion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, the problem is
that I don't know how you get and when you get to the
question of whether reliance needs to be proven or not,
if you're going to bar the State court from reaching
that -- that substantive question, not that substantive
issue, but that substantive question --
MR. BECK: The --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is not very
different from here, which is, what does economic loss
require in terms of proof?
MR. BECK: Well, we're -- we're moving now
from what is in Rule 23 in Federal and State
jurisprudence to what is the underlying cause of action
when we -- when -- you know, whether reliance is a part
of the claim. We keep saying "reliance" and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm shifting them
only to try to get --
MR. BECK: Okay.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a sense of what
different standards mean --
MR. BECK: Okay. And -- and --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to you, and how we
articulate that rule in a way that doesn't preclude --
doesn't permit the barring --
MR. BECK: I think --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of claims when
there's a different standard.
MR. BECK: I think -- I think, Justice
Sotomayor, that you have to distinguish between Rule 23
and the underlying State law that's the subject of the
lawsuit. And any time a -- a Federal court is looking
at whether a class action can be certified for a
violation of State law, it has to make a determination
of whether -- of what State law is in terms of how you
prove a violation, what the elements are. And that's
what -- that's just -- you have to do that every single
day.
And you make that kind of determination, and
then you move to the next step of whether that should be
preclusive, which is when Rule 23 comes into play. And
I think that's the point where you say, are the State
standards under Rule 23 different from the Federal
standards?
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm the -- I'm the
party trying to bring the later class action, and you
tell me I can't do it because somebody else sought a
class action, and -- and it -- and it was denied. And I
say: Well, I don't care. I -- you know, that's
somebody else. That was not me. I was not -- and not
only was I not a party to that case, I think that person
had a lousy lawyer, and had I chosen the lawyer, we
wouldn't have lost that point.
What's your response to that? You cannot
even say, as you can where the class has been certified,
well, at least there was a determination by some judge
that the absent parties were adequately represented.
There hasn't been even that determination.
MR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, there was that
determination in this case at the injunction stage.
They did claim -- they -- they said, well, was this --
was this lawyer from West Virginia who made exactly the
same arguments that they made, was he -- did he
adequately represent our interests?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you do that ex post.
MR. BECK: Well, I think, under the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to litigate this
later, and --
MR. BECK: Well, adequacy, of course, is
part of Rule 23 analysis, but it's also independently a
part of preclusion law analysis, where in order to be
precluded -- for a nonparty to be precluded, then you
have to do the analysis that's called for in Taylor v.
Sturgell, where you have to say in order to preclude a
nonparty, does it meet the two-part test of Taylor v.
Sturgell?
The first part: Were their interests
aligned? Here their interests were perfectly aligned.
And then the second part is an either/or: Did the party
in the first action understand herself -- in this case
himself -- to be acting in a representative capacity, or
did the court take care to protect the interests of the
nonparties?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a very
subjective decision whether the lawyer is -- right here.
MR. BECK: I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether the --
the lawyer is adequate or not. People have different
views about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see
somebody who doesn't even know that this action is going
on saying: Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer
is adequate. I don't think he is. Besides I wanted my,
you know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer.
MR. BECK: Well -- and in every preclusion
case there's a -- there's a question about adequacy, and
it focuses not on whether someone likes the lawyer or
they've got a brother-in-law who is a lawyer. It
focuses on whether the parties' interests are aligned,
and McCollins's interests were identical to Mr. Smith's
and Ms. Sperlazza's. And it -- and it points to whether
Mr. McCollins understood that he was acting in a
representative capacity and to whether Judge Davis took
care to protect the interests of nonparties.
So it doesn't say that everybody gets to
pick their own lawyer. If that were the rule, there
would be no law of preclusion because nobody would ever
pick the same lawyers.
My -- one other point I want to make --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to
say -- it's odd to say you're precluded. The whole
point is the basic principle that you're entitled to
your day in court. And you're saying, well, you're not
entitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day
in court and they had a good lawyer.
MR. BECK: And -- and that is exactly the
question that's posed by the law of nonparty preclusion,
and -- and as this Court's opinion in Taylor v. Sturgell
said, there are circumstances where a nonparty can be
precluded based on litigation from someone else, and
I -- I referenced the test, and the first point I wanted
to make --
JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you -- how can you
possibly find that in the first action the lawyer
understood that he was acting in a representative
capacity?
MR. BECK: Well, it's the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: He tried to act in a -- but
-- but his representation was denied.
MR. BECK: It's the party rather than the
lawyer, and -- and it's when -- when he commenced that
litigation and when he litigated the issue that we're
talking about, of class certification, there's no doubt
in the world that he is -- that he understood himself to
be acting on behalf of a class. That -- that's why he
was litigating class certification.
And -- and, Your Honor, what we -- we have
here also, because we're -- we're kind of verging into
the due process analysis, you have to start with the
question of what is the interest that's at stake here.
The injunction doesn't forbid any -- any plaintiff from
pursuing their individual claim or arguing anything they
want about underlying West Virginia law. It only
precludes them from going forward in a class action, and
that is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's
often theoretical because on these small claims, it's
class action or nothing. Nobody's going to pay a lawyer
to go to court with a $100 case.
MR. BECK: These I don't think fall in that
category, Your Honor. There's -- it's $200 statutory
penalty per violation, which means per prescription
refill. There's -- there's attorney's fees on top of
that; there's punitive damages on top of that. The
McCollins case in Federal court was that kind of case,
and he pled that he satisfied the jurisdictional amount
of $75,000. But even if it's a small claim, the -- that
doesn't mean that the opportunity to litigate it in a
class action and join other parties is a property
interest that implicates due process protections. That
is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Thank you.
Mr. Monahan, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MONAHAN: In this case, the MDL court
did not seek to bind any parties. The decision was deny
class certification; the decision was not to bind any
absent class members.
Moreover, in cases talking about adequate
representation, such as Hansberry v. Lee and the
Richards case, one of the things this Court noted was
that normally you have a judgment that indicates who it
purports to bind. There's nothing in the district
court's initial judgment indicating that the absent
class members are bound by the denial of class
certification, nothing whatsoever.
In Devlin v. Scardelletti, which they say
supports their opinion, clearly it supports our
position, because that was a case dealing with a
certified class settlement, where there was objections.
And because the objections were made and overruled, this
Court noted that those people could appeal directly
without having to intervene in that case. And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you have to -- I
think you would concede that the Seventh Circuit's now
two decisions, one in Bridgestone and then the other in
Thorogood -- the Seventh Circuit thinks it can do this.
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the
Seventh Circuit, for instance, in Bridgestone, which --
which the Eighth Circuit relied on in this case,
indicated that adequate representation was one of the
factors, our right to appeal was one of the factors, and
then our individual claims still existing, consisted
sufficient due process. But, one, we had no notice, so
how can we appeal anything if we don't know it exists?
And this Court has noted that in many cases, in Mullane
and Richards and throughout, that if you have no notice
of a matter, how can you ever have an opportunity to be
heard, because you don't know about it?
Now, as to adequate representation, that was
something I wanted to turn to --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just on notice, does
the record show when the client first came to the
attorney?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, our case was filed
in September 2001. The McCollins case was filed in
August 2001, and nobody knew about the other one at all.
I mean, these cases were filed almost the same time,
less -- less than a month apart in different counties,
different attorneys, different named plaintiffs.
I did want to note in Devlin v.
Scardelletti, Justice Scalia noted in his dissent that
not even petitioners were advancing "the novel and
surely erroneous argument" that absent class members
were considered parties before class certification.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do we know that in the
record, that the attorneys didn't even know about each
other's cases? Is that borne out? I mean, is that an
issue?
MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, we've argued that
throughout. We knew nothing about it. And see, the MDL
proceeding -- we had, like, one or two cases that were
filed, individual actions where the plaintiffs did not
want to seek class action status, and those got removed
to Federal court and transferred. The MDL court
provides notice of the orders affecting all cases in
general and then provides you with orders in your own
case. You do not get orders about other individual
cases. So we never knew about McCollins when it was
seeking class certification.
I would note that the White case here in no
-- no way vindicates the district court. The White case
did say that reliance did not have to be proven if you
have fraudulent concealment or suppression. Rather, the
standard is all you have to do is you have to show:
Would an objectively reasonable person have bought the
product had they known all of the information that was
concealed and suppressed? And, clearly, that can be
dealt with on a common basis.
But a confusing aspect here, it seems like
many people try to argue that for class actions that you
have to have all common issues or else you can't have
one. And that's unfortunate because I'm not aware of
any class action where you don't have at least --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I just go back to
what you said before? I thought the West Virginia
Supreme Court said you can't have actions for drugs
under the consumer whatever.
MR. MONAHAN: Yes, they added -- they added
a syllabus point 6, the last paragraph of the opinion, a
paragraph that says that, from now on, the --
prescription drug purchasers cannot have such a claim.
And that was unknown to anybody. It was not raised as
part of a certified question and had not been litigated
or argued. So that's part of the petition for
rehearing, is my understanding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,
counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon at 12:05 p.m., the case in the
