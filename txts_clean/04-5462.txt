JUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in
Rompilla against Beard.
Mr. Nolas.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NOLAS: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it
please the Court:
Profound mitigating evidence concerning Mr.
Rompilla's life history was not heard by the capital
sentencing jury in this case because his trial counsel did
not secure a single scrap of paper about his life history.
As to the trial prosecutor, his argument, what
he elicited from the defense witnesses, and what he
presented affirmatively sent the message to this jury of
future dangerousness.
When the jury inquired whether in Pennsylvania
there is parole from a life sentence, they were not given
the simple, straight answer that Pennsylvania law clearly
indicates, no. Instead, they were told -- instead, their
question was not answered.
What I would like to do, unless the Court has
specific inquiries, is to make certain points about the
ineffectiveness issue and then turn to the sentence issue.
Page 3
As to the ineffectiveness issue, Your Honors,
this Court has made very clear in Williams v. Taylor, in
Wiggins v. Smith, reiterating the concept established
originally in Strickland v. Washington, that a trial
defense counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough
investigation for mitigating evidence in a capital case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're asking us, I
suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper
records. We've seen a number of capital cases, you know
-- as you know. This counsel seemed to me to be quite
articulate and -- and had a very sound theory of -- to
argue to the jury for mitigation. It didn't work, of
course. I -- I just don't know what constitutional rule
you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record
evidence?
MR. NOLAS: We are not asking the Court to set a
constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must
obtain records in every capital case. We are asking this
Court to apply the rule articulated in Strickland v.
Washington itself where the Court indicated that counsel
has a duty to make a reasonable investigation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you had three forensic
experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think
the papers were relevant either.
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. And as to the
Page 4
experts themselves -- and that's actually -- the experts
and the family are the core of respondent's argument
against Mr. Simmons' claim.
The simplest answer is to look at Wiggins v.
Smith where this Court held very clearly that the
retention of mental health experts sheds no light on the
reasonableness of counsel's life history investigation.
That is especially appropriate in this case because in
this case the counsel who had contact with the experts
testified very clearly at the post-conviction hearing that
the experts were never asked -- never asked -- to develop
life history mitigating evidence. And as my friend, Ms.
Zapp, indicates in her brief at page 43, there was no
tactical decision in this case by counsel to not pursue
life history mitigating evidence.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel -- counsel did
make use of several relatives of the defendant who
testified. I -- I think weren't there about four
relatives who testified?
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, including his son.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And he talked to all of them
and talked to the defendant as well. So would a
reasonable person think that's enough to find out family
history and -- and the concerns that you had?
MR. NOLAS: This Court made very clear in
Page 5
Strickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment
of counsel's representation must be done from counsel's
perspective at the time. Counsel's perspective at the
time, as Ms. Dantos clearly testified at the hearing, was
that the family were not good sources of information for
petitioner's life history. She gave three reasons for
that.
She said, number one, whenever life history was
pursued with them, they did not want to deal with it
because they thought he was innocent.
Number two, whenever they were --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that seems to me an --
an extraordinary non sequitur. I don't understand. They
didn't want to deal with it because they thought he was
innocent. I -- how does that make any sense?
MR. NOLAS: That -- that's what she testified
to, Your Honor. I'm not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What she testified to makes no
sense.
MR. NOLAS: She gave a second reason which was
that counsel, when they pursued life history mitigation,
the family would respond, we hardly know him. He was in
juvenile facilities as a youth, and then he was in prison
as an adult. We don't have any knowledge of his life
history.
Page 6
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the -- the portions of
his life history that -- that are the most appealing are
the portions from his youth, before he went into the --
into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly
with him during that period.
MR. NOLAS: And third and most significantly,
Justice Scalia, she testified that they were not willing
to provide life history mitigating -- facts about his life
history because of, quote, whatever else was going on with
them, unquote. Or as Mr. Charles, the other attorney, put
it, these were not the type of family that would provide
information when asked.
Bear in mind, both of these counsel knew what
the respondent's post-conviction rebuttal psychologist
testified to, that when you're dealing with abuse,
neglect, a dysfunctional home, people don't want to talk
about that. They want to withhold that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me take you back
to the -- to the experts. You say he did not specifically
ask the experts to go -- to go into his childhood
problems. You know, I can imagine when the expert comes
on the stand, the first question being asked is, now, Mr.
Expert, were you told by counsel to look into the
childhood problems? You know, as though counsel were
planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say.
Page 7
What would anyone who hires a psychologist or a
psychiatrist -- what would anyone expect him to look into
in -- in determining whether the person is -- is mentally
injured but -- but the childhood? Do you really think
counsel could not have expected with total assurance that
these people would do that?
MR. NOLAS: Sure, because counsel themselves
testified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the
experts themselves said -- now, let me --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas?
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't it the case that those
experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for
mitigation purposes? They were hired in connection with
the possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number
one, that he was insane at the time he committed the
crime, in which case what he was when he was a child would
be irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently
incompetent to stand trial. So they were asked
specifically to inquire into his present mental situation,
and their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the
trial. So that's the instruction. Naturally they -- what
-- why are we engaging you? We're engaging you to tell us
do we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a
basis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.
Page 8
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and the -- the
respondents use the word mitigation that Ms. Dantos used
in her testimony. I only ask the Court to look at the
joint appendix at page 472 where Ms. Dantos says very
clearly, I explained to them the purpose for my contacting
them, and the purpose was to initially see if there was
any issue of mental infirmity or mental insanity for the
guilt phase and subsequently to possibly use in mitigation
any mental infirmity if it -- if the jury came back first
degree.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there any indication that
after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing
phase began -- I take it it was just a matter of hours or
almost days till the sentencing -- till the sentencing
phase began. Was there any contact with the psychiatrists
or with experts after the sentencing phase and the --
pardon me -- after the guilt phase and before the
sentencing phase?
MR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. The record is very
clear that the experts were asked, as Justice Ginsburg
indicated, about mental infirmity at the time of the
offense. They reported back that they could provide no
assistance in that regard, and then there was not further
contact with them. They were also asked about competency,
which is not at issue before the Court.
Page 9
The -- the key thing to bear in mind is you can
look through Ms. Dantos' entire testimony and look -- you
could look through Mr. Charles' entire testimony at the
hearing. Nowhere do they say we asked the experts to
develop life history mitigating information. This isn't
the case where the lawyers say to the doctor, Doctor, I'm
looking into this man's life history, go investigate it.
Tell me what there is. Tell --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what you just quoted
said that they -- that they would intend it to be used in
the mitigating phase.
MR. NOLAS: Mental infirmity at the time of the
offense at the penalty phase, not life history mitigation,
not how did he do in school, was there abuse in the home,
was there neglect in the home, was their mistreatment in
the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't all that
bear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense?
Isn't the reason that -- that one considers these factors
mitigating is that they reduce the guilt at the time of
the offense? I -- I thought that that's the whole --
MR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. That is -- with all
due respect, that is too constricted a view of what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we just let him off
because we're -- we're sympathetic to his present state?
Page 10
I thought that mitigation means that it reduces the guilt
of the offense at the time that he commits it.
MR. NOLAS: It's -- it's not let him off, Your
Honor. It's a -- a request to the jury, that was out for
over 12 hours, that this man receive a life sentence.
And you've already resolved this issue in
Wiggins v. Smith. In Wiggins v. Smith, counsel hired a
mental health expert, provided that expert 200 pages of
DSS records, provided a PSI, had the expert interview all
of Mr. Wiggins' family members, had the expert report back
on, quote/unquote, mitigating evidence, and this Court
found that counsel had failed to provide reasonably
diligent effective assistance because counsel had not
developed life history mitigating evidence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nolas, you haven't
mentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest
that there be a -- a follow-up inquiry into the -- the
abuse of alcohol by the defendant?
MR. NOLAS: Dr. Gross suggested that there be a
follow-up inquiry into -- into alcohol, and that --
JUSTICE SOUTER: My understanding is that
nothing was done in response to that. Is that correct?
MR. NOLAS: In response to that, the reasonable
thing would be why did this man's parole records indicate
that he should abstain from alcohol. Let's look into his
Page 11
alcohol history.
And to back to -- to your question, Justice --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Which -- which you're saying
they did not do. I mean, just to get it --
MR. NOLAS: They testified that what they did
they asked -- they asked the other experts to look into
it.
And bear in mind, all of the experts in this
case had less than the expert in Wiggins. All of the
experts in this case had less than the expert in Williams.
What these lawyers gave the expert is a client that they
themselves said is not a reliable source of information, a
client who did not want to discuss his life history, a
client who misled counsel, a client who these lawyers said
we can't rely on -- on this fellow.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas, there were some
records that the prosecution sought and used. Was it --
the records that were in the very courthouse.
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and that was, I
guess, the simplest way to respond to Justice Kennedy's
original question, which is what is the duty that these
lawyers have. Well, at its simplest, in Wiggins this
Court said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough
investigation for mitigating evidence, a thorough
investigation into the aggravation. The trial prosecutor
Page 12
tells these counsel, I'm going to use that information in
that file against your client.
The file was maintained in the same courthouse
in which this case was tried. Counsel never goes and
looks at that file. When the prosecutor brings it to the
penalty phase, they complain, we've never seen this file
before. In that file --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What did the prosecution use?
The fact of early -- early conviction and the details of
the crime. Right?
MR. NOLAS: And the transcript that's included
of -- in that trial of the prior offense victim's
testimony.
But the thing is what if these lawyers what --
what I -- I hope this Court would expect any lawyer to do
when the prosecutor says, I'm going to use that folder
against you. You go and you open up the folder.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And what would they have found?
MR. NOLAS: They would have found achievement
test scores in that prior conviction case file indicating
that Mr. Rompilla had never progressed beyond the third
grade, indicating that he functions below 96 percent of
the population. He lived a nomadic life. He -- and --
and test results indicating that he was elevated on scales
for schizophrenia, paranoia, neurosis, indicating that he
Page 13
grew up in a slum environment, and that he was an
alcoholic, bearing in mind Dr. Gross' original inquiry.
These are also lawyers who knew that Mr. Rompilla had a
juvenile history and had a prior adult criminal history.
And Pennsylvania lawyers know -- we've discussed
this in the brief -- that PSI records, presentence reports
in Pennsylvania, and juvenile records are very special
things compared to such records in other States. In --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nolas, are you telling us
that all that information would have -- was in the file
that described the -- the criminal history that the
prosecutor used in his case?
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And they didn't even look at
that file?
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens, what I just
read to you.
Now, Pennsylvania lawyers --
JUSTICE BREYER: Is this the document that's on
the lodging at page 31-34?
MR. NOLAS: If I may have Your Honor's
indulgence for a moment. Yes, Your Honor.
That -- because in this case, that prior
conviction court file contained records that were produced
when Mr. Rompilla was evaluated for that prior conviction.
Page 14
One point that I don't want to escape this
Court's attention is in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court and Pennsylvania -- the Pennsylvania
statutes indicate that presentence investigation reports
and juvenile records have to contain information relating
to, quote, educational history, psychological history,
marital history, family history, military history --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to adopt a
constitutional rule that at least in Pennsylvania counsel
have to consult these -- these records --
MR. NOLAS: When --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as a constitutional matter.
MR. NOLAS: Justice Scalia, when State law tells
you that what you're going to find in juvenile and adult
records is exactly what the ABA standards say capital
lawyers should pursue, it's not diligent to ignore the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your answer is yes.
MR. NOLAS: Yes --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You want a constitutional rule
that in Pennsylvania counsel must look into these records.
MR. NOLAS: Yes, plus.
JUSTICE BREYER: What about a rule that says you
must consult the file of the case that's being used by the
prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance,
at least where that file is readily available, and you
Page 15
must follow up indications in that file that suggest a
significant mitigating defense?
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. NOLAS: And --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's nothing special to
Pennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to
use a certain file.
MR. NOLAS: The -- the only that's special to
Pennsylvania is what Pennsylvania law tells you you're
going to find in those files. That makes it different
than, say, Georgia where there's no provision for having
that material in those files.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --
JUSTICE SCALIA: For what purpose did the
prosecution use the files?
MR. NOLAS: The prosecution told counsel I'm
going to use these files as part of my case and eventually
use them for aggravation purposes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Use them for -- he did use them
for aggravation.
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in what respect?
MR. NOLAS: He put on -- he -- he had an
assistant district attorney take the stand and read the
Page 16
transcript of the victim's testimony in the prior case,
which was included in that folder. He also used
information about when Mr. Rompilla incarcerated, paroled,
et cetera that was reflected by that folder. So plainly
these lawyers knew that that trial was going to be used
because the prosecutor told them.
One other factor on -- on the duty of the
counsel. These counsel testified that they knew that Mr.
Rompilla had problems in school and left school early.
The school administration building in Allentown is across
the street from the capital case courthouse. Ms. Zapp
will confirm this. It says school administration
building. You walk by it when you go into this
courthouse. They knew he had problems in school. They
never walked in there and asked somebody, let me look at
the file.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't like to either
direct your own argument or the questions from my
colleagues, but the Simmons issue here --
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me is important
and --
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, I will turn to
that. I will to turn to that with more sentence on the
ineffective issue, and that sentence is that the
Page 17
respondent's argument in this case misstates, with all due
respect to -- to my friend, Ms. Zapp -- misstates the
holding of Wiggins. The respondent reads Wiggins as
holding only that when counsel has a lead, counsel should
pursue a thorough life history investigation.
I -- I think it's pretty clear these lawyers
here had leads, but even if they didn't, the holding of
Simmons -- the first holding of Simmons is that counsel
has a duty to conduct a thorough life history mitigation
investigation and cannot rely on rudimentary knowledge
from a narrow set of sources. These counsel had less of a
rudimentary knowledge than the counsel in Simmons because
they relied upon --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins.
MR. NOLAS: In Wiggins. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins.
MR. NOLAS: Because they relied upon what they
themselves knew was a remarkably set of sources, a family
and a client who were not willing to discuss the
information when they knew records were available that
would have discussed the life history.
Turning to the Simmons issue, Justice Kennedy,
the core of the Simmons issue, the core debate before the
Court, is what does Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion
in Simmons mean. The --
Page 18
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there had been no questions
from the jury, it seems to me that you wouldn't have had
an argument at all because the counsel was allowed -- the
counsel was allowed to argue this to the jury and did
argue it to the jury.
MR. NOLAS: The -- the questions are very
significant, Your Honor. My -- my instinct would be there
would be --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you agree
that but for the questions from the jury, Simmons was
complied with? The counsel argued the point to the
jury --
MR. NOLAS: The --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- without being -- without
being contradicted.
MR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, the caveat is that
the court instructed the jury that the arguments of
counsel are not evidence and that the law would come from
the court. And in that context, how much weight did they
give on the passing reference in Ms. Dantos' closing
argument? You don't have to reach that issue in this case
because we know what the jury was concerned about. They
were concerned about parole and they were concerned about
that because the prosecutor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. So now -- now we have a
Page 19
situation where the case, by my suggestion in any event,
was properly presented to the jury, and the only question
is what the constitutional obligation is once the jury
brings in a question.
MR. NOLAS: The constitutional obligation under
Simmons itself would be to say is there something here or
in -- in the words of Justice O'Connor, did the State put
future dangerousness in issue. And in this case --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't expressly. I
mean, there -- there were arguments about his behavior,
but the problem I think we have with the Simmons claim
here is that the Kelly case had not yet been decided, and
you now have the AEDPA situation of trying to show that
the State court's resolution was objectively unreasonable.
And prior to Kelly, that's a pretty tough road for you.
MR. NOLAS: And that may be -- that would have
been the case, Your Honor, had the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court not adopted the very interpretation of Your Honor's
concurrence in Simmons that Kelly adopted. The
Pennsylvania Supreme Court three times said Simmons means
you get a life without parole instruction in Pennsylvania
when the State puts future dangerousness at issue. The
construction that the respondent gives to Simmons and that
the court of appeals below gave to Simmons, specifically
that it only applies when the prosecutor argues that the
Page 20
death penalty should be imposed because of future
dangerousness, not only is not to be found in Justice
O'Connor's concurrence, but it is not to be found anywhere
in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion in this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the best argument
you have that future dangerousness was an issue?
MR. NOLAS: There are several factors in that
regard, Your Honor. As to the argument itself, the
prosecutor called Mr. Rompilla a very strong individual, a
very violent individual. He asked the jury, isn't it
frightening the similarity between his past crime and this
crime? He sent the clear signal to the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that also
bears on the -- on the fact of his depravity, that he was
just -- he just didn't learn.
MR. NOLAS: He -- he sent the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know if that's
necessarily future dangerousness or -- it's equally
blameworthiness.
MR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, he sent the clear
signal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening
man, and then he tied it all together with this comment.
And I think he learned a lesson from his prior -- prior
crime, and that lesson was don't leave any witnesses.
Don't leave anybody behind that can testify against you.
Page 21
Don't leave any eyewitness.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that goes to his
blameworthiness. He didn't learn anything in prison. I
-- I suppose future dangerousness is -- in a sense is
always in question, but I think our precedents say it has
to be specifically or -- or clearly implied.
MR. NOLAS: I would submit to the Court that
that argument indicates to a reasonable jury future
dangerousness as much as the argument in Simmons itself --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you imagine any capital
case, if we accept that argument, in which future
dangerousness is not at issue? Because whenever you show
the depravity of the defendant, what a horrible crime it
was, you're going to be able to make the same argument.
Any jury is going to be frightened of this man and think
he's going to be dangerous in the future. If that's all
-- if that's all that Simmons means, we should just say in
all capital cases, you assume that it's at issue.
MR. NOLAS: And -- and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that seems to be not what
we've said.
MR. NOLAS: And, Justice Scalia, that's not,
however, the issue before the Court. What this prosecutor
told the jury is this man learned a lesson that when he
commits his repeated crimes, he shouldn't leave any
Page 22
witnesses behind.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that --
MR. NOLAS: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that goes -- I -- I would
make that argument to show how -- how horrible this crime
was. He killed this person specifically in order to
prevent testimony, which makes the -- the crime worse. I
don't think it necessarily goes to future dangerousness
any more than any of the element -- other elements of
depravity or -- or the horribleness of the crime goes --
goes to future dangerousness.
MR. NOLAS: And -- and this is in the context of
a prosecutor who elicited that Mr. Rompilla had been
paroled 3 and a half months before the offense, that his
niece and nephew were scared of him, that he could not
rehabilitate yourself. Indeed, I -- I urge the Court to
read the cross examination of the defense witnesses at the
penalty phase. It's short, it's narrow, and it focuses on
this guy couldn't rehabilitate himself. This guy was just
paroled 3 and a half months and then goes and commits this
brutal murder. And this guy's niece and nephew are afraid
of him. That's the context.
Also, the prior victim --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you -- you expect us
in all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and
Page 23
-- and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his
depravity into he's future -- you know, he's going to be
dangerous in the future?
MR. NOLAS: But --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that puts too much of a
burden on -- on the Federal courts.
MR. NOLAS: But, Justice Scalia, it's not just
the depravity argument. The argument is he learned a
lesson to leave no witnesses behind. And the -- the
simplest answer to your question is to compare the
argument in Simmons to the argument in this case. You
quoted the argument in Simmons in your Simmons dissent.
It was the -- this is the prosecutor in Simmons. The
defense in this case as -- the defense in this case as to
the sentence is a diversion. It's putting the blame on
society, on his father, on his grandmother, on whoever
else he can, spreading it out to avoid his personal
responsibility. But we are not concerned about how he got
shaped. We are concerned about what to do with him now
that he is within our midst. And that was the argument
that Justice O'Connor and the plurality in Simmons cited
as bringing future dangerousness to the jury's attention.
To put it --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this prosecutor also
said, before he got into isn't it frightening, I'm not
Page 24
asking you for vengeance. So if he's not putting it on
for vengeance or the bad acts that he did, then what else
could it be?
MR. NOLAS: Future dangerousness is -- is what
we would submit to the Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: How about justice? I mean, is
that the only alternative to vengeance, is -- is future
dangerousness? I don't think so at all.
MR. NOLAS: When you tell a jury that a person
is a violent recidivist who learns the lesson -- he's a
recidivist. He's going to commit more crimes if he's out.
The lesson he learns is when he commits those more crimes,
don't leave anybody behind.
I -- I see that as an argument that -- that is
far beyond Simmons itself as to future dangerousness. In
future dangerousness, Justice Scalia, you -- you argued in
the dissent that the future dangerousness -- that what the
plurality and Justice O'Connor construed as a future
dangerousness argument could have had another purpose.
Only in a State like Texas where you have a pure future
dangerousness argument, in every State where you have
other aggravators before the jury, of course you can
construe it for another --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was no
problem in any State but Pennsylvania because now all of
Page 25
them -- when the jury wants to know does life mean life,
the judge says yes.
MR. NOLAS: In all of them except Pennsylvania,
Your Honor. I'm not saying it's a problem, but in
response to Justice Scalia's question, only in a pure
future dangerousness State will you have a pure future
dangerousness argument.
And just one final comment on Simmons. As a
prosecutor, if I'm putting on a future dangerousness case,
I do it just like this prosecutor do it. I put on this
man's significant violent criminal history. I tell the
jury the lessons he learned from that history is to be
violent and to not leave anybody behind. And I tell the
jury that's what he's like. That's what he learned from
his prior crimes. That's the message of future
dangerousness you send to the jury. That's the message
that this prosecutor sent, exactly how you would do it if
you were arguing future dangerousness. You know from the
jury's question they got that message.
If I may, I'd reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may reserve your
time.
MR. NOLAS: Your Honor, thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Zapp.
Page 26
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY ZAPP
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. ZAPP: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may
it please the Court:
I'll address first the Simmons issue and then
move on to the ineffectiveness issue, which will also be
addressed by the Solicitor General's office.
The ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in
this case, which denied the petitioner relief under
Simmons v. South Carolina, was objectively reasonable and
therefore did not provide a basis for habeas relief.
Simmons could reasonably be understood to
require an instruction about parole ineligibility only in
situations where the prosecution had argued that the
defendant posed a future danger when it was asking the
jury to sentence him to death. Simmons was a narrow
exception to the abiding practice of this Court to allow
the States to make decisions about what types of
information the sentencing jury should receive with
respect to the potential for early release.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take the
position that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor
makes has got to refer explicitly to future dangerousness,
a kind of talismanic words criterion so that we'll have a
bright line rule and everyone will know where -- where he
Page 27
stands?
MS. ZAPP: Well, I think Simmons could be
understood -- and in fact did establish a bright line rule
that the prosecutor had to actually argue it had to invite
the --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But has -- has the
prosecutor got to use a phrase like future dangerousness
or a synonym for that phrase?
MS. ZAPP: I think he had to use words that
communicated that. I'm not sure there's any one
particular phrase, but a prosecutor can certainly put that
into issue --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --
MS. ZAPP: -- using different -- different
words.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we -- if we don't adopt
that kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that
the -- that the argument that the prosecutor made,
particularly the -- by -- by introducing the -- the
evidence of -- of the prior crime for purposes of the
aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how
the defendant had learned from his prior crime -- do you
-- do you deny that -- that those were in fact, not with
the talismanic words, but that those in fact were -- were
arguments that suggested future dangerousness?
Page 28
MS. ZAPP: I do, Your Honor. And my -- my
reason for that is when you look to the argument itself,
those words were used in a very controlled situation.
They -- they did not by their tone or the overall tenor of
the argument or their content tell the jury to take the --
the defendant's future dangerousness into account.
JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see how the --
I -- I guess my -- my point is I don't see how you can
avoid it. The -- the argument -- I think we would all
agree that the argument was this person has committed
repeated crimes. We're asking you to bear that in mind
for the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating
factors. In the course of committing repeated crimes, he
has learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time
not to leave any witnesses.
How can you divide the tendency of that
argument, repeated crimes for purposes of aggravation,
from the tendency of that argument to say repeated crimes
in the future if he gets a chance? This is the kind of
guy we're dealing with. How can you draw that line?
MS. ZAPP: Well, I think this Court has said
that you can draw that line because -- and you have to
draw that line because in this situation -- because in
every situation, every capital situation, the evidence
that necessarily has to be discussed as part of sentencing
Page 29
can be --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but this is -- this is a
special case. This is not a general argument to the
effect that this is a very bad person and we can expect
bad persons to be bad in the future. This is a more
specific argument. This is an argument that says he's now
done it twice. This is the second crime and he's getting
better at it as he goes along because now he kills the
witnesses. This isn't just generalized badness. This is
criminal repetitiveness. It is recidivism. And it seems
to me that that is a much clearer argument. It is much
closer to the explicit argument that he will do it in the
future.
MS. ZAPP: I -- I don't think so in the specific
context of this case, Your Honor, and that's again because
the evidence in this situation really did not show a
continuing sequence of -- of conduct and only talked about
two episodes. And the fact that there was evidence in --
or there were remarks in this case about how the violence
had escalated did not, again, go to -- suggest and -- and
clearly the tone of the prosecutor did not suggest that
the jury should draw from that a conclusion that the
defendant would be dangerous.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Zapp, I guess -- I guess
Page 30
I'm confused about your case. I had thought that you were
not arguing that Simmons requires a talismanic word or
even that it requires much more than existed here. I
thought what you were arguing is simply that Simmons could
at that time have been interpreted that way.
MS. ZAPP: We are, Your Honor, and -- and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're not -- you're not
making the argument.
MS. ZAPP: We are not making the argument.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying the argument
could have been made at -- at the time of this trial --
MS. ZAPP: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and before our later
jurisprudence.
MS. ZAPP: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And why would that argument
have been reasonable?
MS. ZAPP: Because --
JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, why -- why
would we -- why would it be reasonable to assume that this
Court had -- had established a constitutional rule going
to jury instruction that rested on a kind of talismanic
criterion?
MS. ZAPP: Well, because the concurring opinion,
which provides the -- this precise holding, identified
Page 31
that specific conduct as triggering and could be
understood at the time to require that specific conduct to
trigger an instruction in these circumstances.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what specific words in
-- in the concurring opinion gets to the talismanic point?
MS. ZAPP: The specific words were the -- the
Court's instruction that an -- about a charge on all
ineligibility had to be supplied, and I'm going to quote
from the Court's opinion where -- where the prosecution
argues that the defendant will pose a threat to -- to
society in the future.
That -- that opinion -- and just a few lines
earlier it also said, again -- and I'm going to quote the
words -- if the prosecution does not argue future
dangerousness, the State may appropriately decide that
parole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration
even if the only sentencing alternative to death is life
in prison without the possibility of parole.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and you're -- you're
depending on the word, in effect, argue as -- as requiring
-- or as -- as being a basis to say the argument has got
to use talismanic words.
MS. ZAPP: Not -- not that -- not that it has to
use talismanic --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it has to be
Page 32
argued.
MS. ZAPP: Exactly, that has to be argument as
opposed to some other form of communication --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not just intimated, not
just suggested, but the jury -- you have to argue that
this person --
MS. ZAPP: But by --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is dangerous in the future.
MS. ZAPP: But by contrast --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a reasonable
interpretation of it I would think.
MS. ZAPP: Exactly.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And on that interpretation, why
wasn't it an argument within the meaning of -- of your
point, when the prosecutor here got up and said, isn't it
frightening, he has, in effect, learned from his past
experience, now he knows enough to kill the witnesses?
MS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't that an argument which
-- which goes to future dangerousness?
MS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor, he
did not make that argument. He never asked if it was
frightening that he had learned from this. The word
frightening -- again, this has been used out of context by
my -- my learned colleague -- went to -- strictly went to
Page 33
the discussion of similarities between the crimes, not the
defendant. And in this situation --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but what immediately
follows -- first he said it's absolutely frightening
twice. But there is one difference, one major difference,
and the difference is that he has learned to leave no
witnesses. That is tightly connected. He says this is an
absolutely frightening crime, but there's something more.
He's learned not to leave any witnesses.
MS. ZAPP: But -- but again, Justice Ginsburg,
that goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up
his crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to
reform his life, he's gone further and that makes this
crime worse and -- and more worthy of harsher treatment
from a punishing standpoint.
MS. ZAPP: It is our position that in 1998 when
the State courts ruled, it was entirely reasonable for the
Supreme Court to view Simmons as requiring that issues of
future dangerousness be generated by the prosecution's
argument.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I know you want to get to
the other issue in this case, but let me ask you. You've,
I assume, read these cases. In -- in other States where
this instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say,
well, sure, there's life without parole, but that can
Page 34
change? We don't know what the law will be like 3 years
from now, 5. Have there been any problems along that --
along those lines? Have there been any problems generally
in giving this instruction to the jury?
MS. ZAPP: Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure of the
practice in other States, but I can tell you that in
Pennsylvania -- and this is a point I need to correct from
my opponent's argument. The answer to the question about
parole eligibility is not a simple no. And that -- our
supreme court has said that. We have a statutory
prohibition in granting the -- granting parole to someone
who's sentenced to life, but we also have a constitutional
provision that allows the sentence to be commuted to,
among other things, parole or other forms of early
release. Our State supreme court has said you -- in order
to be entirely accurate for sentencing jury, you've got to
communicate both of those conducts.
And -- and the second part that has over the
years -- and this goes to respond to your question -- has
caused our court some pause in why we retain the rule.
And that is they are very concerned. Our courts have
expressed the view that by letting the jury know that the
operation of the constitutional provision which can
theoretically -- and, in fact, in the past often has
resulted in a life sentence being commuted -- it may be
Page 35
skewing the jury's perception of the punishments adversely
to a defendant. It's one of the reasons why they have
made a decision not to introduce sentencing information
into -- early release information into the sentencing
process in Pennsylvania, the concern that if a jury hears
that there's some theoretical possibility or learns that
it has been -- been actual -- there's been actual early
release in the past, that it may -- may, out of an
exercise of caution, automatically choose a death
sentence.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And that explains why your
State is the only holdout.
MS. ZAPP: Well, I'm sorry. Well, that it's --
they -- they have serious concerns, Your Honor, that --
that this is something that is necessary to the integrity
of the process.
And there are two other concerns they've also
mentioned too. They're -- they're concerns that -- that
the jury be deflected from the specific process that we
have under law which -- which is -- which is specified in
our law for -- for imposing a sentence and not be
distracted by undue speculation about whether or not the
defendant is ever going to be released from prison.
And the second -- or excuse me. The third point
that they're worried about is that a sentencing jury who,
Page 36
for whatever reason, becomes reluctant to -- to carry out
its duties may see this as an opportunity to shift the
sentencing burden to somebody like a parole board or -- or
other sentencing authority. And so that's why they have
-- they've enforced this rule because they just see it as
underscoring the integrity of the process.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question about
the competence of counsel issue? One -- I'm -- I'm very
sympathetic to the problems of busy lawyers who have so
much to do and they're preparing for a penalty hearing.
But one -- one aspect of this case -- I hope you'll
comment -- and that is, the fact that the prosecutor had
told the defense they were going to use certain
aggravating circumstances, and the files in those --
relating to those circumstances were available in the
courthouse. And as I understand -- and you correct me if
I'm wrong -- counsel did not examine those files, and had
he examined those files, he would have opened the door to
a wealth of information. Isn't that a fairly serious
mistake by the lawyer?
MS. ZAPP: Not in this circumstance, Justice
Stevens, and -- and for this reason. The information that
is typically contained in those files -- and -- and again,
I -- I want to add some additional information for the --
for the Court on this point. As Mr. Nolas says,
Page 37
Pennsylvania law does require preparation of records,
including certain types of information. But as -- as is
often the case, the -- the -- in -- in practical -- and
the practical realities are not necessarily all records
are equal. So as a matter of practice, in Pennsylvania
attorneys cannot necessarily -- or would not automatically
have reason to think these may give them a wealth of
information.
But in this situation we had counsel seeking to
obtain that very same information, in fact, had previously
discussed that sort of thing with the family members. And
so they at that point would have reasonably expected that
they had a fair picture of the defendant's formative
years --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe they -- assume
that's all true. They thought they knew everything --
MS. ZAPP: Right.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- they needed to know. But
still, if you say to me I'm going to put on certain
exhibits, A, B, and C, and the defense says I'm not even
going to even take a look at them before you put them on,
I find that quite unusual.
MS. ZAPP: Well, they knew from interviewing
their client what his criminal history was, and at that --
this point, they had every reason to believe they
Page 38
possessed a fair and accurate assessment of his
background, and the decision not to -- to go -- to -- to
take a look at this was -- was reasonable under the
circumstances. Counsel thought they already had that
information and no reason to expect there was anything
else in there based on their discussions with their own
client.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They thought they had -- it
was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that
this man might not even be competent at the moment to
stand trial, that he -- that they might have a -- a basis
for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to
rely just on what he told them without looking at the
record that was in the prosecutor's hands?
MS. ZAPP: Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg.
And again,
we're talking about the sequence of events here. The --
this -- this came up relatively later on in the
proceedings after counsel had already expended much of
their time gathering information in the -- the information
about what was going to be introduced. It -- it happens,
in -- in terms of the time line of this case, relatively
late, after counsel has already talked to experts and
obtained information, talked to family members and --
and --
JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. You're
Page 39
repeating that point which -- so I might ask this question
on this very point.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could I find out what
she said came late? I -- I didn't understand. You
said --
MS. ZAPP: The -- the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it came -- what came
relatively late?
MS. ZAPP: The -- I'm sorry. The -- the file
itself, the -- the information the file was going to be
used.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Came up late.
MS. ZAPP: Comparatively late over the course of
this case. The counsel had already done things in that
respect that would have led them to conclude that there
would be no profit in -- in searching out additional
records.
JUSTICE BREYER: My question is this, that I
take it on page L31 is the record that existed in this
horrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the
bartender. And the prosecution was making an enormous
amount out of that. We've just heard about it. That's
true, isn't it? Am I right about the case? Have I got
that right?
MS. ZAPP: This is the record that did exist.
Page 40
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. This is -- I'm thinking
of it correctly, that this is the record in the case that
the prosecution made a lot out of.
MS. ZAPP: I believe --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I'm back with Justice
Stevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer
wouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to
see if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation
accurately. And had he done so, he would have seen on the
next page, alcohol problems. He would have seen a
complete list of siblings, and he would have seen, four
pages later, a one-page list of criminal behavior with
identification of crimes that took place when he was a
child. That's all true.
Now, if he had then noticed these early criminal
records when he was a 17-year-old and simply gotten the
record in that one, he would have come across the document
that is on page L44 and L45 which says, among other
things, Ronald comes from the notorious Rompilla family.
And then there is a list of why they are called the
notorious Rompilla family which is fairly horrendous.
Now, I do not understand how any person, getting
the first record, wouldn't have been led to the second,
and I do not understand how any person who read pages 44
and 45 of the second would not have thought what the
Page 41
siblings are telling me is wrong. I better go check on a
few more siblings who happen to have their names and
addresses here right in the pieces of paper he's looking
at. And he would then have discovered this absolutely
horrendous background that Judge Sloviter mentions. So I
do not understand why that one incident, leaving aside all
the other ones, but I do not understand why that one
failure to consult the record that is being used by the
prosecutor horrendously against him is not a failure.
MS. ZAPP: Well, Your -- Your Honor, in response
to that, I would say this. It's clear from the testimony
of counsel in the State post-conviction proceedings that
they had interviewed their client in great detail about
his prior conviction, that they were aware of what had --
what it had involved.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: This sounds to me like a
constitutional argument for serendipity. You're held to
be negligent if you don't look at the record for -- for
one purpose and -- and discover by accident something
that's there for another purpose. I -- I don't know what
the logic of that is.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with that?
MS. ZAPP: Well, I think there is --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. We don't -- you agree with
that or not?
Page 42
MS. ZAPP: Well, I think there's -- there is an
element.
JUSTICE BREYER: You either agree with Justice
Kennedy or not.
MS. ZAPP: I can agree with -- I do agree with
it in part.
JUSTICE BREYER: You do agree. All right. Now,
if you --
MS. ZAPP: I -- I do agree that there is -- that
there is certainly that involved in -- in this.
JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my question, obviously,
is, is not the reason that you want to examine the
criminal record in the case that is being used
horrendously against your client is to find out both as to
what happened at the time and also the background that
would be relevant in respect to your client? For example,
alcohol abuse, which happened to be checked.
MS. ZAPP: But -- but, Justice Breyer, yes,
certainly looking at a record would serve those purposes.
But again, the information in those records was available
from other sources. It was not the only source. And --
and the question that we have to look at here was did
counsel set out on a plan to try to get the same
information, which clearly they did, and they -- they
sought to get it from people who ostensibly knew that
Page 43
information.
Thank you.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Zapp.
Ms. Lovitt.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACI L. LOVITT
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MS. LOVITT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may
it please the Court:
Petitioner's ineffectiveness argument seems to
be hinging on four things which are the court records in
the aggravation case, the charge to the expert, the family
members' level of cooperation, and the petitioner's level
of cooperation. But a fair reading of the record
demonstrates that counsel was reasonable with respect to
all. But I want to start with the court records because
that appears to be what's concerning the Court.
I think there's a misperception here that
counsel did nothing to prepare for the aggravation case.
The record, fairly read, reflects that they received
through the discovery process the rap sheet and everything
they needed to know in order to challenge the -- the
aggravation case, and that's at JA664 and 667, is Attorney
Charles testifying that he received the rap sheet through
discovery and that the prosecutor, in order to try and
Page 44
induce a plea, was very, very clear about what he intended
to do in aggravation and what the aggravation case would
be.
JUSTICE BREYER: But a rap sheet and so forth
will not have normally what this person is like. You're
dealing with a client who has serious problems of some
kind as the crimes themselves reveal. They're terrible.
MS. LOVITT: I -- I think --
JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- don't you
think it's a reasonable -- or do you think it's a
reasonable constitutional requirement to say that where
cases of prior history of the client are being used by the
prosecution to say what a terrible person he is -- and he
may be -- that you -- the -- the lawyer in a capital case
at least should look at the court records in that case to
learn something about what this human being is like and
why? Because court records, but not rap sheets do contain
that kind of thing.
MS. LOVITT: I think there are two answers to
that question. First is that counsel was, in fact,
looking at the testimony that would be read at -- during
the aggravation and sentencing case to determine how to
challenge that, how best to challenge that.
And second, the assumption of the question is
that the court records were somehow superior to the
Page 45
sources that counsel actually looked to. And I don't
think on the record of this case, that's objectively true.
Counsel is -- has -- has hired three independent experts,
all of whom are specifically trained --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Experts that were hired
primarily to say what is his present mental condition, not
what happened in the past.
MS. LOVITT: No, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm glad
you brought this up because I'd like to point the Court to
JA1069 and 1079 which is where Dr. Cooke testifies, as
Justice Scalia anticipated, that he was, in fact, asked to
-- asked to look at the mitigation evidence, and he did
look at mitigation evidence. Dr. Sadoff has the same
testimony --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the primary reason
that those experts were engaged?
MS. LOVITT: Dr. --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The primary reason.
MS. LOVITT: Dr. Cooke's and -- Drs. Cooke and
Sadoff testified that they were given an open-ended charge
to look at mitigation --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is this?
MS. LOVITT: First, Dr. Cooke is at JA1079 and
1069. Dr. Sadoff is at 1105 and 1122.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was not
Page 46
contested that in fact the primary reason why these
doctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted
to see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity. He
wanted to see if there was a basis to claim that his
client was incompetent to stand trial.
MS. LOVITT: That is -- that is definitely
contested with respect to Drs. Cooke and Sadoff. With
respect to Dr. Gross, who was the first expert that was
hired, he testified that his marching orders were fairly
limited, and I think that's where this idea is coming
across that all the experts were only charged to look for
competency to stand trial.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And Dr. Gross is the one who --
who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I
think.
MS. LOVITT: Yes.
JUSTICE SOUTER: And one way, at least a kind of
a threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have
been to look at the -- the personal history report in the
file of the prior case. If they had done so, they would
have found something on that subject.
So even -- even if we forget the question of the
-- the scope of the expert's original brief and we look to
Dr. Gross' suggestion and we look to the failure to look
in an obvious place, i.e., the -- the personal history
Page 47
report and -- and the case file, which the State said it
was going to use, don't we have a problem with competence
of counsel?
MS. LOVITT: No, because counsel looked --
followed up in an objectively reasonable place. Their
testimony was that they hired two more experts to look at
this issue, and Dr. Gross did not conclude --
JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the two other
psychiatrists or psychologists?
MS. LOVITT: The two -- the two other
psychiatrists. Because the issue wasn't alcoholism.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Wel, were they -- were they
hired to -- to look into alcoholism?
MS. LOVITT: No. Dr. Gross' report says he
might have a violent reaction to alcohol. And he
testified that was -- I was throwing that out as a theory.
I have no idea. I had ruled out alcoholism. I had ruled
out blackouts. And so the question to me was maybe
there's something out there about violent chemical
reactions to alcohol. Counsel testified that the -- that
they followed up on that by hiring experts who they
thought could examine that issue, and they both concluded
that there was nothing there.
This is not an instance where you have, you
know, open inquiries that counsel didn't follow up on.
Page 48
Every court in this case has recognized --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you tell me again? I'm
-- I'm just afraid I missed it before. What is your
justification for failing to look at the -- at the
criminal files?
MS. LOVITT: That they received everything they
needed to challenge the aggravation case through
discovery. And there's a little bit --
JUSTICE STEVENS: So even if they did, would it
-- you still think it would be prudent not even to look at
the file?
MS. LOVITT: They had everything they needed to
challenge the aggravation --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't have as much
as they would have had if they'd looked at the file.
MS. LOVITT: But the Sixth Amendment question --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with that?
MS. LOVITT: I -- I think that they had --
obviously, in retrospect, the court files would have been
helpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court
files would give them more information.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that. I'm
just -- I'm just asking you whether, as a matter of
routine preparation for a contested hearing, it is not the
duty of counsel to take -- at least glance at the exhibits
Page 49
that the other side is going to offer.
MS. LOVITT: They did. They received them
through discovery. And this is -- there's some testimony
during -- during the court proceedings, Attorney Dantos
does not have the transcript with her, and she clarified
in the testimony at post-conviction --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying they did get
copies of the --
MS. LOVITT: Yes, yes, and that's her testimony
at JA506 to 508. She says, we received it in discovery
and I had it and I've looked it, but I didn't have it with
me at that moment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the it? What is the
it?
MS. LOVITT: The it being the transcripts of the
proceedings that were used in the aggravation phase.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not everything that was
in that file.
MS. LOVITT: But they did not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a lot more than
just the transcript of the proceedings in that file.
MS. LOVITT: Exactly. Because they had
conducted an objectively reasonable investigation into
anything else that might be in that file.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the serious question to
Page 50
me is -- is -- in many of these cases which we see, there
are horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a
terribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that
might not convince most juries of anything because they're
all over the place. But nonetheless, counsel should have
to make a reasonable decision about whether to take the
child abuse route or to take some other route. And would
it cause constitutional harm, that is, would it cause harm
even from a prosecutorial point of view, if you just said,
well, you should follow up and look at records of prior
cases being used against you to see if you get a clue
there?
MS. LOVITT: Well, the testimony is clear.
Counsel knew about the abuse denial dynamic and they did
follow up on it by hiring three experts who were charged
to ferret this out. And it would do constitutional harm
to say, notwithstanding the fact that you did that, you
still have to go to records because as Strickland
recognizes, counsel, even where you have diligent, devoted
counsel, as here, have to make decisions about resource
and time allocation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Strickland was about a
strategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather
than another.
The Government's brief, I must say, was candid
Page 51
and, I think, useful. I'm talking about footnote 5 on
page 22 where you say the Federal public defenders in
Federal death penalty cases -- they get a mitigation
specialist and the mitigation specialist, of course, gets
records. What records? Exactly what we're talking about
in this case. Gets records, birth, schools, social
welfare, employment, jail, medical, and other records.
And here, not one of those -- not one -- was sought.
MS. LOVITT: But this was the current -- this is
the current Federal practice. I think Attorney Charles
testifies at length that the prevailing practice in 1988
in Pennsylvania was not to get records, that it was, as
the ABA guidelines and even the Goodpaster article
suggests, to first sit down with your client, have an
extensive conversation with your client, get a
relationship of trust, talk to family members, talk to
friends, get experts, and then get a game plan together
about what records to go to. And in this case --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: About what records to go to,
and here they went to none.
MS. LOVITT: Because that objectively reasonable
investigation affirmatively indicated that the records
would contain nothing.
In hindsight, we have the benefit of hindsight
to know that they did contain something, but at that point

you have three experts, siblings who bracket petitioner in
age and were living in the same household that -- during
the time that's at issue here, and you have extended
family members, including an ex-wife, who aren't subject
to an abuse denial dynamic, and they're all saying the
same thing. There's no abuse. There's no alcohol problem
with either him or the family. And the experts are
telling you he's not mentally retarded. And you have
experts who are specifically charged to look at the
mitigation case and they're not finding anything.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Lovitt.
Mr. Nolas, you have about 4 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honors. Thank you very
much.
Justice Kennedy, you asked a question about
serendipity. That's why you conduct an investigation.
That's why you look into records. That's why this Court
has said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough,
diligent investigation. When I go and I look at a prior
conviction court file, I don't know if it's going to say
that my client is the worst person on the face of the
earth or, as in this case, that it's going to provide
evidence leading to mental retardation, significant mental
Page 53
disturbance, and a critically abusive childhood. You do
that investigation because the prior conviction court file
may contain information that reduces the weight of the
aggravating factor.
In this case, had counsel gotten that court
file, as Justice Breyer summarized, they would have had
evidence that not only would have reduced the weight of
that prior aggravating factor that -- but that would have
provided something mitigating for this jury. Indeed, Ms.
Zapp quotes at page 41 the 1980 ABA standards that very
clearly say, please, for mercy, do not substitute for an
actual thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and
presentation of mitigating evidence. And all these
lawyers ended up with was an unconnected plea for mercy
because they didn't take the steps that reasonable counsel
take in a capital case.
I also urge this Court not to be misled by -- by
some commentary today about the testimony of the lawyers.
At page 506, Ms. Dantos very clearly says that she's read
the transcript of the penalty phase when that prior
conviction court file is brought in by the trial
prosecutor. And at that point, Mr. Charles, her co-
counsel, says, I object. I've never seen that before.
And the trial prosecutor says, you could have walked down
the hall and gotten it just like I did. That's -- that's
Page 54
what's she referring to at page 506.
As far as the doctors are concerned, I'll just
read to Your Honors just from Ms. Dantos herself. She has
read at pages 473 and 474 what Dr. Gross had said. I only
looked at mental state at the time of the offense. Is
that the purpose of the -- is that what the purpose of the
evaluation was? Yes, that's what it was as to Dr. Gross.
Then at page 475, Dr. Cooke, the second guy.
Did the same evaluation? Yes, the same evaluation.
At page 476, Dr. Sadoff, the third doctor. And
is that also what Dr. Sadoff did? Yes. Page 476.
All three of the mental health professionals
looked at Mr. Rompilla's mental state at the time of the
commission of the crime.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Only? Only? Only?
MR. NOLAS: That's the lawyer herself saying
what she asked the doctors to do. And if you look at --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's uncontested that
all three looked into that, but the point that has been
made is that the last two went beyond that. Do you
disagree with that?
MR. NOLAS: I disagree with that, Your Honor,
and you should look at those pages from Ms. Dantos and
then look at the pages from Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff.
This is Dr. Sadoff at page 1105. I would have
Page 55
examined him, Rompilla, for competency to stand trial. I
would have examined him for criminal responsibilities, and
I would have examined him for possibility of mitigating
circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime.
There is a universal difference between that
type of mental health examination and a life history
mitigation examination that looks to are there factors in
your life that the jury should consider as mitigating.
Was there abuse? Was there neglect? Was there
mistreatment in the home? Was there all the stuff that is
in the records about this case that these counsel did not
obtain? Not one piece of paper. Justice Kennedy, not
even to rebut the aggravating factor, not even to do that.
A basic duty. Even if you put a spin over mitigation, I
as a lawyer want to rebut that aggravating factor. The
prosecutor tells me that's the file to go look at. I go
look at it. Any reasonable lawyer, I would think, would
do that.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Nolas.
MR. NOLAS: Your Honors, thank you very much.
JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is submitted.
