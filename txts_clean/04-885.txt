CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next in
Central Virginia Community College versus Katz.
Mr. Thro.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. THRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
This case involves a conflict between two
constitutional values. On the one hand, Congress has the
sovereign power to make laws which apply to everyone, including
the States. On the other hand, the States have sovereign
immunity from all aspects of suit.
In the past, this Court has reconciled this conflict
by drawing a line between sovereign power and sovereign
immunity. States are bound by Federal law, but the States are
immune from monetary damages for violations of those laws.
In the bankruptcy context, this line means the
States are bound by the discharge decisions, but that the States
are immune from the trustee's attempts to augment the estate
through monetary judgment.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Can you tell us how often States
are creditors in bankruptcies around the country? Do you have
any idea?
MR. THRO: There is some information to that effect
in the amicus brief of Ohio and every other State of the Union,
Justice O'Connor, but my recollection is that the States are
creditors in probably the majority of bankruptcies around the
country.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, if you're correct, how would
the result you want affect all the other creditors in these
bankruptcies?
MR. THRO: It would have some impact on the other
creditors, in that you would not be able to augment the estate
by collecting a monetary judgment from the State.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And probably, on your theory,
States can disregard the automatic stay that issues --
MR. THRO: No, not at all --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- when a bankruptcy --
MR. THRO: -- Your Honor.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- commences?
MR. THRO: No. Under our -- under our theory, the
-- theory, the States are bound by the automatic stay. The
States are also bound by --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How is that, on your theory?
MR. THRO: Well, because --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why wouldn't the sovereign
immunity extend to that?
MR. THRO: The automatic stay is an exercise of
sovereign -- of the sovereign power of Congress, just as the
discharge decisions of a bankruptcy court are an exercise of the
sovereign power of Congress. The States are bound by the
discharge decisions. States are also bound by the automatic
stay. Where we draw the line is where the trustee attempts to
get a monetary judgment as a means of augmenting the estate,
which is what is happening with this case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why don't we say that that's
the exercise of the sovereign power of commerce, just -- of
Congress, just like you said? That --
MR. THRO: The automatic --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it seems that that answer
is just conclusory, that it's an exercise of the sovereign power
of Congress, okay. That's just -- that's just a conclusion.
That's not a reason.
MR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. The -- this Court's
decisions have struck a balance between respecting the need for
the States to obey Federal law and, at the same time, respecting
the constitutional value of the States' sovereign immunity.
What we have here in -- with respect to the automatic stay and
with respect to the discharge decisions, is States being bound
by Federal law, no different than the States being bound by the
minimum wage law, for example. But what we have with respect to
the trustee's attempts to augment the estate by collecting a
monetary judgment against the States is an attempt to invade the
State treasury, which this Court's decisions clearly state is
barred by sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me, if you're -- if you're
right -- let's suppose you're right. I'm over here. That's --
[Laughter.]
MR. THRO: Sorry, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's all right. So, it's hard to
figure out, because the direction -- you can't tell by the
sound. I don't know if there's a modern system that would help
with that, but -- you're right.
Suppose that the State -- suppose you're right.
What I'd worry about -- and I'd like your response to this -- is
that in bankruptcies, or weak firms -- a lot of firms are weak,
and they owe a lot of money to the States. So, the States
figure this out after a while. It takes a few years to seep
through, but once they see what they can do, they say, "Here's
what we'll do. Settle your claims against the State, which
happen to be pretty good, for 50 cents on the dollar. Give us
the money. And you're -- we're out of it." So, they settle it.
A month later, bankrupt.
Now, two things have happened. The States got 50
cents on the dollar, every other creditor gets 5 cents on the
dollar, because they were a month ahead of it. The second thing
that happened is, the creditor -- the firm lost the chance to
come in and be rehabilitated. So, the result of this is two bad
things: bankruptcy's law's basic purpose, to treat creditors
fairly, bankruptcy law's basic purpose, to give firms a chance
to rehabilitate, are both seriously undermined. So, given the
Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution, how is it possible to say
that Congress does not have the power to prevent those two very,
very seriously harmful results -- harmful in terms of the basic
purpose of the Bankruptcy Clause?
MR. THRO: Your Honor, the Constitution --
specifically, the eleventh amendment -- confirms that the States
are not to be treated like private parties. Private parties are
not immune from contract actions; States are. Private parties
are not immune from torts -- from tort actions.
JUSTICE BREYER: But there is not a Tort Clause of
the United States Constitution. There is not a Contract Clause.
And there is a Bankruptcy Clause.
MR. THRO: There is a Bankruptcy Clause, Your Honor,
and that clause empowers Congress to make bankruptcy laws which
apply throughout the entire Nation and which apply to the
States. However, the Bankruptcy Clause does not authorize
Congress to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity from suit.
When -- while abrogation can be accomplished using other
provisions, it cannot be accomplished using the bankruptcy
provision.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Bankruptcy Clause presumably does
not allow Congress to set up the bankruptcy law in such a way
that it would amount to a taking of property without just
compensation, right? Wouldn't allow another constitution to be
violated. So the only question here is whether the
constitutional protection of States' sovereign immunity can be
taken away by the Bankruptcy Clause; whereas, other provisions
clearly can't, right?
MR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. And this Court said, in
Seminole Tribe, that the Article 1 powers could not be used to
take away, or to abrogate, the States' sovereign immunity. Now,
obviously, section 5 of the fourteenth amendment can be used to
do it, but there is no suggestion that Congress used section 5
of the fourteenth amendment in enacting its attempt to abrogate
sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE STEVENS: But, may I ask, how do you -- how
do you reach the conclusion that you're bound by the automatic
stay and the discharge? Why aren't those also an infringement
of State sovereignty?
MR. THRO: I think there is a strong argument which
can be made that both the automatic stay and the discharge
decisions infringe upon State sovereignty. However, this
Court's decisions, dating back to at least New York versus
Irving Trust in 1933, have made it clear that the States are
bound by the provisions of the discharge orders. I think, also,
the automatic stay is something similar to the Ex Parte Young
doctrine, in terms of the States being enjoined from doing
something else. However --
JUSTICE SCALIA: To say -- to say that the State
can't be sued is not the same thing as saying that the State can
sue, is it? You --
MR. THRO: No, it's not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you can prevent the State from
suing, even though you can't sue the State. There's no
incompatibility, is there?
MR. THRO: No, there's not, Your Honor. What we
have --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, do you -- do you agree that
there are situations where, notwithstanding the sovereign
immunity of States, there can be in rem jurisdiction in a court
to resolve claims against property --
MR. THRO: Certain --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- and bind the State, as well?
MR. THRO: Certainly, this Court's decisions
indicate that, in some instances, there can be in rem decisions
which --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, maybe bankruptcy estates
are one such instance.
MR. THRO: As this Court noted in Hood, the
bankruptcy decisions regarding the discharge are in rem and, of
course, are binding upon the State. But what we have here is
not an in rem proceeding. As this Court noted in Nordic
Village, an action to recover a preferential transfer claim is
not an in rem proceeding. Rather, as this Court noted in
Schoenthal versus Irving Trust in 1932, and Granfinanciera
versus Nordberg in 1989, actions to recover preferential
transfer are much like actions to recover a contract claim.
That is, like a contract claim, they do not involve the core
bankruptcy proceedings, but, rather, involve matters that are --
or controversies that are tangential to the core bankruptcy
proceedings. They're nothing more than an attempt to augment
the State.
And where we would draw the line, and where we
propose that this Court draws -- draw the line -- and a line
that we believe is consistent with this Court's previous
decisions -- is that the States are bound by discharge, the
States are subject to the automatic stay, but the trustees'
attempts to obtain monetary judgments, and thereby augment the
value of the estate, are barred by sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it at least be
theoretically possible to differentiate between setting aside a
preference, on the one hand, and just bringing a suit for a tort
or a breach of contact, on the other? One could treat the
assets that are -- were transferred prematurely -- or hastily,
whatever you call it -- as part of the estate. At least it's
conceptually possible.
MR. THRO: Right. Conceptually, it's possible. And
certainly there is an argument that the bankruptcy code says
that preferential transfer is, in fact, property of the State.
With respect, however, to a preference to a State, we would say
that that particular reading, as applied to the State, is
unconstitutional. I don't believe Congress can make a law which
would require the State to divest money or something to which
the State has in its possession in which the State has a
colorable claim of ownership. Here, there is no dispute that
the money is in the State treasury. What they are trying to do
is to recover a monetary judgment from the State. As this Court
said in Schoenfeld [sic] and in Granfinanciera, this is very
much like a contracts claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say that a --
the intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too,
right? It's --
MR. THRO: The current bankruptcy code does not say
that. In theory, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But, I mean, you could be --
there's no less reason to say that that's part of the res than
there is to say that the preferential transfer is.
MR. THRO: That's correct, Your Honor. And just as
the contract claims are barred, so are the preferential --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Except Congress --
MR. THRO: -- transfer claims.
JUSTICE STEVENS: -- has drawn that very distinction
hadn't it?
MR. THRO: I'm sorry, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS: I said Congress has drawn the
distinction that -- between the preferential claim and the
contract claim.
MR. THRO: Congress has drawn a distinction between
preferential transfer claims and contracts claims. However,
this Court has noted that the difference between an action to
recover a contract claim in order to augment the estate and an
action to recover a preferential transfer in order to augment
the estate, that there really is no difference. Both are --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the theory of the second is
that you're not augmenting the estate, you're merely preserving
the estate, isn't it?
MR. THRO: I think -- Congress has certainly defined
the estate so that a preferential transfer is considered
property. I'm not sure that Congress can do that when the
preferential transfer involves the estate. That strikes me as
the effect of Congress, in effect, saying that property which
clearly belongs to the State no longer does. I think that's
probably an affront to tenth amendment federalism concerns. But
what we do have here is a situation where, like in a breach of
contract claim, they are trying to recovery a monetary judgment
in order to augment the estate. It's our position that that is
barred by sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now --
JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Mr. Thro, doesn't the
Respondent want to dismiss the contract claims here?
MR. THRO: The Respondent had asked the bankruptcy
court -- after reading our brief, the Respondent asked the
bankruptcy court to dismiss --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. So, why do you insist that
they be adjudicated?
MR. THRO: Well, Your Honor, I think this is an
attempt by the Respondent to rewrite the question presented.
Neither --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but why --
MR. THRO: -- our petition --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- why should we force a
plaintiff below to pursue claims they want to give up? That
just seems so odd to me.
MR. THRO: It is rather odd, Your Honor, but my read
of this Court's rules are that there is no mechanism for a
Respondent, the party that won below, to, in effect, give up its
victory once they get in this Court. I'm not quite sure why
they wish to drop the breach of contract claims. Perhaps they
feel that by dropping the breach of contract claim, they somehow
obtain a tactical advantage. And, if that's the case, certainly
this Court should not allow them to rewrite the question
presented in order to obtain a tactical advantage. But, in any
event, both the breach of contract claim and the preferential
transfer claims are attempts to augment the estate and are
barred by sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you think the waiver
argument that's made is properly before us?
MR. THRO: No. The waiver argument is not properly
before you. It was not passed upon by the Court of Appeals
below. Moreover, it was, for the most part, not preserved in
the Court of Appeals below. While they did argue that Virginia
Military Institute waived sovereign immunity for all claims
involving Virginia Military Institute in the Sixth Circuit, they
made no such argument that filing proof of claim constituted a
waiver of sovereign immunity for the transactions involving the
other institutions.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You may be right about that, but,
while I've got you here, let's assume just one State entity, not
multiple State entities. And the State has received a
preferential transfer of $2,000. It still has an outstanding
claim -- a different claim against the same bankrupt for $1,000.
And it goes in to enforce its claim for $1,000. Could we hold,
consistently with the eleventh amendment, that that is a waiver?
MR. THRO: I believe that this Court's decisions
indicate the following position. When a State files a proof of
claim, it exposes itself to the trustee's defenses to that
claim. So, in other words, if the -- if the -- if the
preferential transfer was part of the same transaction or
occurrence --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, different claim. The --
MR. THRO: Different claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: One, the State received $2,000
worth of taxes, but it -- still have its $1,000 contract claim.
MR. THRO: Then I believe that this Court's opinions
indicate that that would not be a waiver with respect to the
different transaction or occurrence. Certainly, by filing the
proof of claim you would expose yourself to the trustee's
defenses with respect to the same transaction or occurrence.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Go --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So was -- there's a section of
the Bankruptcy Act -- I think it's 160(c) [sic] -- that says if it's an
unrelated transaction, then -- so, it would be a permissive
counterclaim if we had ordinary civil proceedings. Then there
can be a setoff to the extent of the claim that's being made
against the bankrupt estate. There can't be any affirmative
recovery, as there could be with a permissive -- with a
compulsory counterclaim. But you're saying that that section is
unconstitutional -- 160(c) [sic]?
MR. THRO: To the extent that 106(c) goes beyond the
rule announced in Gardner, then, yes, it has constitutional
problems. But you need not reach the constitutionality of
6(c). What we were talking about here is basically a
straightforward application of this Court's precedence in a line
that you have drawn in other contexts.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we're talking just about
VMI, not about the other schools, then you -- if this claim is
unrelated, so that it would be a permissive counterclaim, then
you would say not even against VMI could you have the setoff.
MR. THRO: That's correct, Your Honor. In -- this
Court's decisions dealing with what effect happens when a
sovereign entity initiates litigation indicate that the
sovereign, by initiating litigation, certainly exposes itself to
defenses, but does not expose itself to affirmative recoveries.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't a setoff be a
defense, even if it's unrelated? I mean, there were such things
in -- at common law, were there not, that you could set off an
unrelated debt?
MR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. And to the extent that
a setoff is a defense, it would be permitted. But I may have
misunderstood your hypothetical that you were talking about, a
setoff which involved an affirmative recovery against the State.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I mean a setoff --
MR. THRO: Okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- only --
MR. THRO: Then I misunderstood your hypothetical.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Thro, I -- am I correct in
assuming that if the -- if the preference in a case like this,
that had been given to the State, were not a bank transfer, a
check, but were some tangible object, like a gold bar, that
there would be in rem jurisdiction on the part of the court to
get the gold bar back as a -- even though its function is that
of a preferential transfer?
MR. THRO: I don't think so, Your Honor. I --
although this Court has recognized certain in rem exceptions to
sovereign immunity, particularly in the admiralty context, this
Court has never recognized -- said that sovereign immunity
allows a Federal court to order the State to return something
where, number one, it's in the State's possession, as it would
be in your hypothetical, and, number two, the State has at least
a colorable claim of ownership, which, if I understood your
hypothetical correctly, the State does have a colorable claim of
ownership. But you need not reach -- deal with the intangible
or personal property issues. The only thing that is at issue
here is a demand for a monetary judgment.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- with respect to --
I mean, you can say that of any claim that is valued in dollars.
But, I mean, your -- you know, what I'm getting at is your
position that there is no distinction to be drawn between the
contract action and the preferential transfer. And my point
was, some transfers might be satisfied -- might be sought in
what, at least in the traditional classification, would be an in
rem, rather than an in personam, action. Would your answer be
any different if the -- if the gold bar were simply sitting on
the -- on the desk of some State purchasing agent, as opposed to
deposited in the -- in the State treasury or sold by the State
for the monetary value?
MR. THRO: As I understand this Court's decisions on
this, if the -- if the property is in the possession of the
State, and if the State has a colorable claim to ownership, then
sovereign immunity will bar the -- a court --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so --
MR. THRO: -- a Federal court order to --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in effect, you're saying there
are some in rem exceptions, but not all in rem actions are
exceptions. And this would not --
MR. THRO: This Court has certainly recognized
certain in rem exceptions, notably in the Treasure Salvors case,
where the State did not have a colorable claim to title, and
also in Deep Sea Research, where the State did not have
possession of the object. Also, in the Whiting Pools case, the
Federal Government had possession of a intangible asset, but it
was clear that the debtor still had the ownership interest, and
this Court said that, in that circumstance, the Federal court
would -- could order the return.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could have a
--
contract action that -- in which the State promises to turn over
a particular parcel of land that it owns, or even, for that
matter, a gold bar that is on somebody's -- some State
functionary's desk. And I guess you could have a suit for that
gold bar or for the piece of property. And I guess you could
call that an in rem action, if you wanted to. But it wouldn't
MR. THRO: Right. It would be a gross in -- a
radical in -- expansion of in rem jurisdiction. Traditionally
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, because --
MR. THRO: -- in rem --
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we normally deal with
that as specific performance of the contract, and what -- you
know it's in rem, in the sense that we're talking about an
object, but that's not what we mean, traditionally, by "in rem
jurisdiction," is it?
MR. THRO: Traditionally, in rem jurisdiction has a
couple of characteristics. One is, it is -- it is everyone
against the world. It binds --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, you sue -- in effect, you sue
the race, rather than --
MR. THRO: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: -- than the person.
MR. THRO: And --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And in the -- in a -- in a specific
performance contract action, you sue the person.
MR. THRO: Right. And a specific performance
contract action, while barred in Federal court, would, of
course, be allowed in State court, to the extent that Virginia
has --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What about a rescission action in
which the private party has conveyed property to the State, and
the State doesn't pay, and the private party seeks to rescind
the action and to receive back the property that it turned over,
which is real estate or a gold bar? Could that not --
MR. THRO: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not be a -- characterized as an
in rem action? He's seeking back the property he gave over.
MR. THRO: I don't believe it could be characterized
as an in rem action, given the traditional understandings of "in
rem." But, regardless of whether you call it "in rem" or "in
personam," sovereign immunity would still bar such a thing in
Federal court. This Court has never said that there is an in
rem exception to sovereign immunity. To the contrary, you
explicitly rejected an in rem exception to sovereign immunity in
Nordic Village, at least where money was concerned. You have
allowed recovery in certain limited circumstances, such as the
admiralty cases. Those do not exist here. This is not an in
rem proceeding. Preferential transfer is not an in rem
proceeding under Nordic Village. Moreover, as this Court's
opinions in Schoenthal and Granfinanciera make clear, it's more
-- it's a traditional sort of common law, similar to a contract
action.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to get away from in rem
and back to the waiver aspect that's being argued here. Let's
assume that there is an offset obligation that the State has to
comply with, that there's been a preference and it has another
claim, and with just one entity. If that's true, it seems to me
somewhat unfair to say that the State can proceed on multiple
fronts with different entities and fractionate its immunity so
that if there are more than three entities -- or if there are
three or four entities, each one is judged separately as to the
offset obligation. It seems to me that if one State entity is
subject to offset, then all of them are.
MR. THRO: I believe --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Otherwise, the State immunity, it
seems to me, can be -- can be fractionated.
MR. THRO: Well, I believe that this Court's
decisions in the bankruptcy context draw the line with respect
to the same transaction or occurrence. So, to the extent that
it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence, then you've
got that, sort of, partial or limited waiver. Where --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I --
MR. THRO: -- however, with --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I thought, with respect to
Justice Ginsburg's colloquy -- and my own, earlier -- that we
said that there is an offset obligation, even if they're
different claims.
MR. THRO: There is an offset. I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And now -- and now I want to
extrapolate from that to multiple entities, each of which
asserts its own immunity.
MR. THRO: Right. I think the offset obligation --
my understanding of Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was that the
-- was that we were talking about an offset that would not be an
affirmative recovery, but would merely be using as -- an offset
as one of the trustee's defenses to the claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Against the entire State --
MR. THRO: Against the entire State.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- including any money owed to the
other -- to the other State institutions. You acknowledged that
that --
MR. THRO: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- offset could be --
MR. THRO: Yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- applied not just against the
college here, but against the --
MR. THRO: No.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- other entities.
MR. THRO: The offset with respect to that
particular -- with respect to that particular transaction or
occurrence, not to the other transactions or occurrences.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you're not -- I thought your
position was: VMI, okay. If they filed a claim, then they're
open to affirmative recovery if it's a compulsory counterclaim;
offset, if it's a permissive counterclaim. But I thought you
said, as to the three other schools, no waiver. There's not --
no way you can lump them in. I thought that was --
MR. THRO: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your position.
MR. THRO: There is no way that you can lump in the
other three schools. With respect to VMI, by filing a proof of
claim, VMI exposed itself to the trustee's defenses. To the
extent that the setoff is a defense for the trustee, then, of
course, that setoff would apply to VMI.
Before I sit down, I'd like to make three points.
First, Seminole Tribe controls. Congress may not
use its Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign
immunity.
Second, to rule in favor of Virginia does not
require any alterations in this Court's jurisprudence; however,
to rule for Mr. Katz on any theory requires certain fundamental
changes in this Court's jurisprudence.
Finally, regardless of context, sovereign immunity
bars monetary judgment claims. States are immune from contract
actions; private parties are not. States are immune from court
actions; private parties are not. States are immune from
actions by the trustee to augment the estate; private parties
are not.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Ms. Lewis.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIM MARTIN LEWIS
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. LEWIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:
The -- if the States are permitted to opt out of the
collective bankruptcy process, and they're permitted to
disregard Federal preference statutes with impunity, it will
have a negative effect on the bankruptcy process.
States are large creditors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's the same problem
in the patent area, isn't it? And yet, in the Florida Prepaid
cases, we've enforced the sovereign immunity with respect to
patent proceedings.
MS. LEWIS: Your Honor, in the Florida Prepaid case,
there was an alternative State remedy. In that case the
plaintiff could sue the State of Florida -- I'm sorry -- yes,
could sue the State of Florida in that particular case. In this
case, they can't do that. There is a -- an estate
representative, who has one option, and that option, to preserve
the collective benefit of the estate, is to sue the estate -- or
to sue the State in the bankruptcy court.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Assuming that's so, for sovereign
immunity purposes, why should it make a difference?
MS. LEWIS: For -- well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, I mean, this is a tougher
case, but if sovereign immunity is the issue, why does it make
any difference?
MS. LEWIS: I do believe that it makes a difference
that there is no alternative remedy. However, in this case, I
don't think --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? What does that have to do
with the theory of sovereign immunity?
MS. LEWIS: I'm not sure that it has anything to do,
directly, with the theory of sovereign immunity, but --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Believe me, I -- I mean, I -- as
you know, I'm not a big fan of sovereign immunity in these
circumstances, but I'm not quite sure how to get around it,
based on the fact that there is no alternative remedy here.
MS. LEWIS: Well, Justice Souter, the thing that I
think is very troubling in this case is that there's a very
basic bankruptcy policy, and that basic bankruptcy policy on
preferences is equality of distribution and to prevent
abusive debt-collection practices on the eve of bankruptcy.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Then, basically, you're making the
argument from the uniformity phrase -- uniform bankruptcy laws.
That's essentially your argument. And you're saying, in the --
in this case, that that trumps the sovereign immunity, and that
gets you out of Seminole Tribe.
MS. LEWIS: I believe that it -- I believe that it
does, Your Honor. But I -- I'm not sure the Court even has to
reach the uniformity argument in this case, because the fact
that Virginia Military Institute, on behalf of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but, of course, that
doesn't hold true for the other agencies, necessarily, unless
you think VMI can waive it for all of them. That seems to me to
be only a partial argument.
MS. LEWIS: Justice O'Connor, the -- VMI waived the
only sovereign immunity that existed, which was the Commonwealth
of Virginia's sovereign immunity. And, as a result -- all of
the agencies of the Commonwealth of Virginia served as unitary
creditors -- and so, when VMI waived the only sovereign immunity
that existed, there was nothing left to waive. And, at that
point, the recoveries of the estate -- which were recoveries
against other agencies, not only VMI -- were -- the Respondent
was permitted to bring those actions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your waiver argument is --
is it under 106(b) or 106(c)? It's beyond both of those, isn't
MS. LEWIS: Chief Justice, it's not under 106(b) or
6(c), because the waiver of sovereign immunity -- 106(a)
provides that, with respect to preference claims --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an abrogation, that's
not --
MS. LEWIS: That --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a waiver.
MS. LEWIS: -- that's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my question would be,
How can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute
with a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and
6(c), and you're saying, "Well, they waived it much more
broadly"? It would seem to me that the most you can argue is
that there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't
get rid of the whole case.
MS. LEWIS: Your Honor, I don't believe that 106(b)
or 106(c) limits the waiver in this case, because, again, the
sovereign immunity that was waived was the sovereign immunity of
the Commonwealth of Virginia. And so, the claims that were
asserted in that action, the preference actions that are served
against VMI and the other institutions, are preserved, because
we can --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying that much of
the language of (b) is ineffective and superfluous? (b)
certainly tries to limit it. It says "has waived sovereign
immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit
that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same
transaction." You're just saying all of that is ineffective,
then?
MS. LEWIS: I'm saying that, in this context, it
isn't -- it isn't effective, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: In what context would it be
effective?
MS. LEWIS: The -- 106(b) was intended for claims
that didn't -- that did not arise under the bankruptcy code.
6(a) claims, which was the abrogation of sovereign immunity,
are claims that arise under the code. 106(b) and 106(c), there
is no sovereign immunity to waive. So, 106(b) and 106(c) were
designed for the contract claims that Justice Scalia referred to
earlier in the Petitioner's argument.
And then we looked to the Federal -- this Court's
jurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a waiver of
sovereign immunity. And we would most naturally look at the
Lapides case, in which -- in which a State came into this --
removed a case from State to Federal court, and the court said
it didn't matter the type of claim that was being asserted, or
that there was affirmative recovery that was being asserted,
but, in fact, they constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity.
And the State certainly can't say, here, that they
didn't know the filing of a proof of claim would constitute a
waiver of sovereign immunity, because back in 1947, in the
Gardner versus New Jersey case, this Court acknowledged that
filing a proof of claim constituted a waiver.
And there are ways that a State could avoid this.
They could have a process by which they had to go through --
whether it be the Attorney General's office, or whomever -- that
in order to file a proof of claim, they had to first go
somewhere to get authority to do that. And that most naturally
happens with corporations, because, as this Court is aware in
the Granfinanciera case, if you -- if you assert a proof of
claim, you waive your jury-trial right. And that is a large
issue for corporations --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we interpret the
statute to establish that Congress intended the States to waive
their immunity with the filing of the claim? I don't see that
anywhere in the statute.
MS. LEWIS: I'm sorry, can you --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're arguing that by
filing the claim, the State has waived all of its immunity, but
I don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver
upon States. I see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's
different than saying that there's a waiver. Is your argument
that just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out
they didn't -- may or may not have that authority, they
necessarily imposed a waiver?
MS. LEWIS: I don't think 106(b) applies with
respect to the preference claims, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then where is
the waiver of sovereign immunity in this statute?
MS. LEWIS: The -- in -- 106(b) and 106(c) specifies
the conduct by which a sovereign must -- must engage in, in
order to waive sovereign immunity in a noncore matter, in those
matters not set forth in section 106- --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought -- you're not
relying on 106(b) and 106(c).
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, where is the waiver of
immunity on which you're relying?
MS. LEWIS: The waiver of sovereign immunity is the
jurisprudence of this Court, that eleventh amendment sovereign
immunity is not absolute, that a sovereign can waive that
sovereign immunity. And it did, in Gardner versus New Jersey.
And, again, this Court looked at that in the Lapides case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no argument
that Congress imposed a waiver.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And, again, I still don't see how
you distinguish (b) when you say "(b) doesn't apply here, it may
apply in other cases." If it doesn't apply here, why would it
apply in other cases?
MS. LEWIS: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you are appealing to
this broader principle, that you either waive all of sovereign
immunity or you waive none of it at all, and you can't just
restrict it to the particular claim, which is what (b) says, I
don't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.
MS. LEWIS: Justice Scalia, again, it's because we
do not believe 106(b) governs here, because it deals with claims
that are not abrogated under 106(a) of the bankruptcy code.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if Congress had thought
it had successfully abrogated, there would be no reason to
provide for a waiver, I don't suppose.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice Stevens. And I
think this Court has recognized that bankruptcy is different in
other contexts. And I think that it's very important to talk
about bankruptcy differently. This Court has looked at, in --
just last term, in the Hood case, which was the debtor's
discharge. And the Court said that that constituted in rem
authority.
This Court, in Perez versus Campbell, said that
somebody cannot be denied a driver's license simply because they
failed to play a discharged obligation.
The Court, in the Irving Trust case, said that a
State is required to satisfy the procedure of bankruptcy if they
want to participate in the claims process.
In Van Huffel and Straton, this Court said that a
bankruptcy estate is permitted to sell property free and clear
of the State's tax liens.
In Whiting Pools, this Court said the IRS, who
seized property on the eve of bankruptcy on behalf of a -- of a
lien, had to return that in its in rem jurisdiction.
And I believe it was Justice O'Connor who asked the
question of Petitioner with respect to, How would this affect
the automatic stay? And how I've thought of that is, sometimes
the automatic stay, there may be an effect with respect to
monetary relief, and there may be an effect as far as an
injunctive relief. For example, if there was a judgment that a
State had, prior to bankruptcy, against the estate, and then
sought to enforce the judgment, executed on the debtor's bank
accounts post-petition, debtor didn't know about it, because, in
a -- in a debtor's reorganization, the first month of the
debtor's bankruptcy, you can't -- you're not following
everything that's happening the case. There is an execution on
the bank account, the money is taken into the State's coffers.
Does that mean that the State is bound by the automatic stay, or
is the State not bound by the automatic stay? It was money that
was transferred from one -- from the estate to the State.
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought (b) and (c) -- tell if
I'm right about this -- but suppose an individual bankruptcy,
and sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an
automobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked
it. All right? Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't
waived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not
bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages
caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something. Each
is claiming the other is negligent. I guess the person wouldn't
be able to file. And the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't,
either.
MS. LEWIS: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the
State happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought
his negligent suit against him, he can respond.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor. That --
JUSTICE BREYER: So, if, in fact, you were to lose
on (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it
wouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the
whole thing, (a), (b), and (c).
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Your Honor. It was --
it was a --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, then the case
really turns on the extent to which the Government can -- sorry,
the extent to which Congress can waive sovereign immunity, as
they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution
permits them to do what they did in (a).
MS. LEWIS: Right, to abrogate sovereign immunity.
JUSTICE BREYER: And if you win on that, you win.
And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably
fall.
MS. LEWIS: I believe 106 would fall, but, if 106
falls, doesn't mean that Respondent would lose, as far as the
waiver argument, because --
JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure, because if you lose
on the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't
have the power to do anything there. I just wonder if (b) and
(c) would survive, because they may have had something else in
mind. But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.
MS. LEWIS: Well, Justice Breyer, I think that (b)
and (c), as pointed out by another one of the Justices, may be a
limitation on the general concept of common law waiver. So, to
the extent that 106 would be -- this Court were to rule (b) that
would -- unconstitutional, you would look to the general common
law waiver of sovereign immunity, which would be the Gardner
versus New Jersey case and the Lapides case.
The --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you -- how do
you have an informed waiver if the argument is over the
authority to abrogate? In other words, the Federal Government
is saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your
immunity. And the State's saying, "You don't have that
authority." And how do you get an informed waiver, simply
because the State participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on
the basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today,
that Congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the
immunity?
MS. LEWIS: We believe, obviously, Congress had the
right to abrogate sovereign immunity --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that. But your
theory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is
that there was a --
MS. LEWIS: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- waiver. The State waived
its immunity by participating through -- in the --
MS. LEWIS: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- bankruptcy proceeding.
How is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the
authority to abrogate?
MS. LEWIS: Well, Your Honor, I believe, because
this Court has recognized, in Gardner versus New Jersey, that if
a State files a proof of claim, it constitutes a waiver, that
the State had to have to been informed, it had to know that the
actual conduct of filing a proof of claim would have a
consequence of a waiver.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but all the -- all the
statute does is abrogate.
MS. LEWIS: All --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In 106(a). It's --
MS. LEWIS: That's correct --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- an attempt to --
MS. LEWIS: -- Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- abrogate.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if it turns out that
Congress doesn't have that authority, I don't see how you can
say the State has made an informed waiver, when their theory is,
"Guess what? You don't have that authority to abrogate."
MS. LEWIS: Well, Your Honor, 106(a) certainly
didn't exist back in Gardner versus New Jersey in 1947 either.
And I think that the -- the fact that -- if sovereign immunity
exists, sovereign immunity can be waived. I'm not sure --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, he's -- so, I'm wrong.
What I said is wrong. The answer has to be that -- we're only
talking about (a) at the moment. And what Congress tried to do
in (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is
constitutional to do so. So, then, you say, if you lose on it,
it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could -- it
is constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this
situation that the State brings a case against the estate, and
--
you can do an offset, et cetera. But it would have nothing to
do with (b) and (c). It would have to do with reading that into
(a), I guess.
MS. LEWIS: I believe that's correct --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MS. LEWIS: -- Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- I don't follow that,
because I thought the theory of the cases were that you can
waive something by conduct. And so, when you ask a court for
relief against a party, then it's reasonable to say, "If you're
coming in and asking the court to give you something, then it's
only fair that your adversary should be able to" --
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: A light bulb exploded. A light
bulb exploded.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think we're -- I think
it's safe.
JUSTICE BREYER: A light bulb went out.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a trick they play on
new Chief Justices all the time.
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE SCALIA: Happy Halloween.
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask this --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Take your time. We're interested
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're even -- yeah, we're
even more in the dark now than before.
[Laughter.]
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you lose on the abrogation
notion, and the Court holds that there is no authority in
Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity, still the bankruptcy
code codifies what is, across the board, the law. That is, if
you come to a court and say, "Give me X against D," that D
should be able to come back and say, "Either I want full relief
because it's a compulsory type counterclaim. I have to bring it
here. I can't bring it separately. Or at least a setoff." I
mean, that was understood, that a party over whom the court
would not have jurisdiction otherwise, is amendable to the
court's jurisdiction to the extent of a counterclaim or a
setoff. So, I don't see why (b) and (c) are not discrete from
(a). (b) and (c) are implementing the idea of a setoff. You
come to court for a claim, you are deemed to have waived any
jurisdictional objection to the counterclaim or the setoff.
MS. LEWIS: I understand that argument, Justice
Ginsburg, but I believe when Congress enacted 106(a), (b), and
(c), that they enacted it -- (a), being those actions which were
abrogated, (b) were those actions that remained. And those
actions that remained, there were limitations to that waiver.
Because this is not -- there was nothing to waive on sovereign
immunity on 106(b) as to preference actions, for example.
Contract claims are different. Contract claims would have --
are not abrogated under 106(a), so, therefore, the only way they
can be waived is under 106(b).
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's the same question. But
let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the
argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be
treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the
bankruptcy court. How is that issue preserved in the question
you raise? You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to
abrogate the State's sovereign immunity.
MS. LEWIS: Did you ask how it's preserved? We
raised the --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to -- seem to me to
be part of the question presented.
MS. LEWIS: Your Honor, I think, to the extent that
this Court can avoid addressing the Constitution about
constitutionality of a statute -- and, in the situation of
waiver, we believe that it can -- then we believe that's the
appropriate jurisprudence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you asked -- you framed the
question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. No.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, no, you -- you're right.
You're right. You're exactly right.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, to what extent was
this argument raised below, I guess is a --
MS. LEWIS: Chief Justice, it was raised, to the
extent of VMI's sovereign immunity. And the reason that it was
is, at the time that the motion to dismiss was filed, as
recognized by the Petitioner in their brief, and as recognized
by the court, at the bankruptcy court level, the Hood decision
at the Sixth Circuit had been a decision. And so, there was no
necessity for the court to engage into any other proceedings,
other than to deal with the Hood decision.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question on another
subject, just talking for a minute about your in rem theory of
the case? And I understand you would contend that assets have
been subject to a fraudulent transfer or a preference should be
deemed to be part of the estate. But is it not true that this
case also involves a claim on the accounts receivable? And do
you contend they also should be treated as part of the estate?
MS. LEWIS: Justice Stevens, we did seek to dismiss
the causative action with respect to the accounts receivable and
the causative action that we --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that because you concede, in
effect, that they would not be part of the estate if we adopted
an in rem theory that included the preferential transfers?
MS. LEWIS: They would not be part of the estate --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.
MS. LEWIS: -- in a situation of -- if this adopt --
Court adopted an in rem theory, that's correct.
JUSTICE BREYER: Which would not? I'm sorry.
MS. LEWIS: Any recoveries on behalf of State
contract claims, account receivable as collections.
JUSTICE BREYER: And you have some of those.
MS. LEWIS: We do, Your -- Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER: Are you trying to get those in this
case?
MS. LEWIS: No, we are not.
JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay.
MS. LEWIS: We sought to dismiss them.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you were, but you're not.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're --
MS. LEWIS: -- Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- trying to get rid of that,
right?
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, that doesn't fit into your in
rem theory, but why wouldn't you have been able to recover that
on a waiver theory? If you -- and I understand your waiver
argument is, you can defend the judgment on the ground not --
you know, any ground to uphold the judgment is okay for the
Respondent. But why wouldn't you have tried to defend that part
of your case on the waiver theory?
MS. LEWIS: It would have been the waiver with
respect to just VMI's contract claims. And, I apologize, off
the top of my head I don't recall what the value of just the VMI
contract claims would have been. But that's what we believe the
waiver would have been limited to. It would have not included
the contract claims of Central Virginia Community College, Blue
Ridge.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you explain to me again why
it's okay that your waiver argument below was only directed to
the claims against VMI?
MS. LEWIS: At the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I didn't understand your
answer to that. You made a much narrower argument there than
you're making here.
MS. LEWIS: I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't -- you didn't assert
that all the sovereign immunity for the entire State and all of
its institutions had been waived simply because of the claim by
VMI. You didn't make that argument.
MS. LEWIS: At the time of that decision, Justice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MS. LEWIS: -- Scalia, the Sixth Circuit Hood
decision had already been decided, and, just as it was
acknowledged in the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- which said what?
MS. LEWIS: Which said that sovereign immunity is
waived, or abrogated, for preference actions in -- it was
actually across the board -- an abrogation of State sovereign
immunity. And, at that point, there was notice --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why didn't you make the
argument? I mean, if Hood said, when you make a partial -- or
one institution -- if I understand what you're saying, Hood said
that a waiver by one institution waives for the whole State. Is
that -- is that what Hood said?
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Hood said --
MS. LEWIS: No.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that Congress could abrogate.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct. Congress could --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- through the Bankruptcy Clause.
The -- what -- and then when the case came to this Court, we
didn't --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- address that issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But if you're making a separate
waiver argument, apart from the abrogation argument, I don't see
why you would not make that waiver argument as broadly as
possible. It's a separate argument from the abrogation
argument.
MS. LEWIS: We --
JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're making it as a separate
argument here. But here, you're making it as to all claims
against all State institutions; whereas, below you made it only
as to the claims against VMI. I don't understand that.
MS. LEWIS: At the time, 106(a), in the Sixth
Circuit, it was determined that that was constitutional. So, at
the time, the only thing left for the States to waive was the
contract actions. And the contract actions of VMI were the only
things that could be waived as part of the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.
MS. LEWIS: -- underlying --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the -- so, the long and
short of it is, for good and sufficient reasons you did not make
the same waiver below that you're making here today.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct, Chief --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.
MS. LEWIS: -- Justice.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the proof of claim in VMI was
$43,000, and the preference was $25,000.
MS. LEWIS: That's correct.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, on your in rem argument, how
do you distinguish Nordic Village's case?
MS. LEWIS: In the Nordic Village case, the trustee
in that case focused on the money damages. They didn't focus on
the portion of the preference statute that says you can get the
transfer back, you can get the property back. And as this Court
recognized in Bowen versus Massachusetts, just because it is
monetary relief doesn't mean that it's money damages. And
that's how we distinguished the Nordic Village case, Your Honor.
The -- this Court, I believe, would be extending the
Article -- its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy
estate not to be able to sue the States. This Court has
recognized that a private citizen, Indian tribes, and foreign
sovereigns cannot be sued. But this Court's never recognized a
Federal entity cannot pursue a State. And this Court -- this is
a situation where there is no alternative remedy. We aren't in
a situation where we have the ADA, the ADEA, where the EEOC can
bring an action on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the
individuals to enforce a Federal law. We have no other
enforcement in bankruptcy, other than the collective bankruptcy
process, the bankruptcy code. And the bankruptcy code assigns
to the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to
collect on behalf of the estate.
Bankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application
and its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the
bankruptcy system. The framers recognized the critical nature
of binding the States in a uniform scheme. The decision below
ought to be affirmed on the basis of in rem, on the basis of the
Constitution, and on the basis that Virginia, the Commonwealth
of Virginia, waived its sovereign immunity.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
Apologize for the fireworks.
[Laughter.]
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Thro, you have three and
a half minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. THRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
The question presented is whether or not Congress
may use the Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign
immunity.
In Alden versus Maine, this Court held that there
was a presumption that the States had retained their immunity
unless it could be shown by conclusive evidence that the States
surrendered their immunity in the plan of convention. If
Congress can use the Article 1 bankruptcy power to abrogate
sovereign immunity, then one would expect there to be
discussions to that effect at the constitutional convention, in
the federalist and antifederalist writings, and in the ratifying
conventions. Yet, as the Sixth Circuit conceded in its version
of Hood, there is no compelling evidence. There is, at best,
silence. Silence cannot equal the compelling evidence.
Therefore, the Article 1 bankruptcy power cannot be used to
abrogate sovereign immunity.
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the question you've
presented, Mr. Thro, but it was the same question that was
presented to us in Hood. And in Hood, we decided that we were
not going to answer the question presented, we were going to
decide the case on a lesser ground. So, the Court, certainly if
our venture in Hood was proper, here, too, we could decide the
case on some other ground than the one you presented in your
question.
MR. THRO: Yes, you could, Your Honor. But you
should not address any of the alternative arguments raised by
Mr. Katz.
JUSTICE SCALIA: We couldn't decide it in your
favor, on some alternative ground, though, could we?
[Laughter.]
MR. THRO: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that distinguishes it
MR. THRO: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: The difference between this and
Hood.
MR. THRO: -- Your Honor, but I believe that the
proper exercise of judicial restraint is to decide the question
presented, and only the question presented, and do the other
grounds for perhaps another day.
All of Katz's -- all of Katz's novel arguments raise
--
complex constitutional issues and, quite frankly, ask for
radical alteration of this Court's jurisprudence.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if you think, within the
text of the question presented, we could decide whether the
sovereign immunity was abrogated by the convention itself, not
by Congress? There is that argument out there, you know.
MR. THRO: Yes. Within -- I think, in effect, if
you were to decide -- if you decided that the convention itself
had intended --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Abrogated.
MR. THRO: -- for the States not to have sovereign
immunity in bankruptcy, then you would conclude that the Article
Bankruptcy Clause includes the abrogation power. So, I think
it's, sort of, two sides of the same question.
Returning to Justice Ginsburg's question, a second
reason for not addressing Katz's arguments were, they were not
passed on below. As this Court noted in Granfinanciera, where
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then that would be a ground
to allow them to present it below. They had a total winner --
MR. THRO: Yes. Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on that hands below.
MR. THRO: Yes, absolutely. You -- it -- you can --
you should decide the question presented. And if you decide the
question presented in our favor -- that is, that Congress has --
does not have the power to abrogate sovereign immunity -- you
would presumably remand to the Sixth Circuit for further
proceedings, consistent with your opinion. At that time, Katz
could attempt to present these other defenses. We would, of
course, argue that some of those defenses had not been properly
preserved. But it has not been briefed below.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
MR. THRO: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the
