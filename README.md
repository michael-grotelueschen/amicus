# Amicus

Predicting Supreme Court decisions based on oral arguments.

Amicus has 4 parts:
  - Obtain oral argument transcripts
  - Process them
  - Extract behavioral features from the text
  - Model

Amicus achieves accuracy comparable to [Katz, et al., 2014](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2463244), even without features based on legal expertise.
