# Amicus

Predicting Supreme Court decisions based on oral arguments.

Amicus has 4 parts:
  - Obtain oral argument transcripts
  - Process them
  - Extract behavioral features from the text
  - Modeling

Amicus achieves accuracy comparable to Katz, et al., 2014, even without features based on legal expertise.
