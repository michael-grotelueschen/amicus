 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first in case 05-381 Weyerhaeuser Company versus 

Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Company. 

Mr. Pincus.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether the 

standards this Court adopted in Brooke Group to 

determine whether a seller's prices violate the 

antitrust laws because they are too low also should 

apply in assessing the claim that the buyer's purchase 

prices are illegally high. We submit that the Brooke 

Group test applies because the four key underpinnings of 

the Court's ruling apply fully here.

 First, there's a high risk of mistaking 

aggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior. 

Increasing the prices that are paid for inputs like 

lowering sales prices is a mechanism by which a firm 

competes. It's the result that we would expect from a 

buyer's ordinary competitive instincts. So the conduct 

targeted here is on its face identical to core

procompetitive conduct. It's also very hard to 

distinguish losses suffered by a more inefficient 

competitor from hard -- to anticompetitive behavior, but 

the antitrust laws --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you a 

preliminary question before you get too far into your 

argument? Is it your understanding that the 

instructions to the jury were that finding that 

predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to 

establish a Section 2 violation? I know the Court of 

Appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think 

the jury was so instructed?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. Our position is that that 

is what the jury was instructed, because the predatory 

pricing instruction said one of plaintiff's contentions 

is that defendant purchased more logs than needed or 

paid a higher price for logs than necessary in order to 

prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining the logs they 

needed at a fair price. I'm reading from page 14(a) of 

the appendix to the petition. And then it concluded, if 

you find this to be true, you may regard it as an 

anticompetitive act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You may consider it as an 

anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard 

it as a violation of Section 2.

MR. PINCUS: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And as I read the 

instructions, it did require there be three elements of 

the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not 

discussed by the Court of Appeals.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, there is no, 

there is no contention here about monopoly power. The 

focus here is on the conduct element of Section 2.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you concede there is 

monopoly power?

 MR. PINCUS: We are not disputing it before 

this Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But is that relevant to 

the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an 

attempt to preserve that power or require that power, 

plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of 

section 2.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, our view is 

what the Court has said in cases like Trinko, is that 

the test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct. 

Those are the two elements. We are not contesting the 

monopoly power element. We are looking at whether there 

was anticompetitive conduct here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree that the 

conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a

violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the 

monopoly power --

MR. PINCUS: Yes. Because this is a claim 

under Section 2, there would have to be either monopoly 

power or a danger of probability to the monopoly power. 

It's single firm conduct so there would have to be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And so you're arguing not 

only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient 

to prove a violation, but it also was not even an 

anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. We are 

arguing both things. I think, I'm not sure that there 

is much space between the two, but to the extent there 

is, we are arguing both.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Obviously, if there's just 

an anticompetitive act without a violation of the 

statute, then there would be no basis for damages.

 MR. PINCUS: I think that's right, but I 

guess the way I think the Court has approached 

determining anticompetitive act, anticompetitive 

conduct, is it's the kind of conduct when engaged in by 

a monopolist or an entity that has a dangerous 

probability of cheating it, it is a violation of this 

statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course in the Brooke

case, it may not have even been a monopolist.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, because Brooke involved a 

claim under the Patent Act. But this Court in the 

Trinko case has certainly interpreted the Brooke 

Standard as also applying to claims under Section 2. 

And in fact the Court explicitly said that in Brooke 

Group.

 As I said, the first critical underpinning 

is the risk of mistaking aggressive competition for 

anticompetitive behavior. Second, this case involves --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a little 

different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of 

course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing 

too low, which has at least a direct benefit to 

consumers either in the short term, certainly in the 

short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while 

here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive 

conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct 

takes. So isn't that a reason not to think that we 

should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?

 MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, we don't, we don't 

think that that difference is a distinction that 

warrants a different test, for several reasons. First 

of all, we are dealing here with single firm pricing 

conduct and it's recognized that that's key to the

proper functioning of the markets. As the court said in 

Professional Engineers, fixed pricing is the central 

nervous system of the economy. It allocates goods and 

ensures that, that they are allocated to the most 

efficient use.

 Here, although there's no immediate benefit 

to consumers, there is an immediate benefit to the 

sellers of the logs, who certainly benefit when 

competition drives up the prices that they achieve. And 

we think that the Sherman Act protects them and gives 

them the benefit of full competition just as much as it 

does consumers. Over the course --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever 

identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try 

to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. In Mandeville Farms, 

which was a Section 1 case, the Court did talk about the 

fact that the antitrust laws protect sellers as well as 

buyers, and that was a case in which there was allegedly 

a Section 1 conspiracy to price too low, and the Court 

said that's per se unlawful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in Brooke Group, 

we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers, 

and in this other case we said it's a benefit when 

prices are high to suppliers.

MR. PINCUS: Because the benefit that I 

think the Court is looking at in both cases is not the 

particular price levels, but in achieving and ensuring 

free price competition because of the central role that 

price plays in the economy. That's what the Court is 

trying to protect in Professional Real Estate -- in 

Professional Engineers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it's a benefit to 

consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased 

because of higher prices being paid for those needed 

goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of 

those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit 

consumers who want those goods.

 MR. PINCUS: That is our second argument, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't have that 

in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought 

one of the arguments on the other side was the 

inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what 

they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was 

ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. The claim is 

that the supply was relatively inelastic, not that it's 

perfectly inelastic, and as long as the supply market is 

not perfectly inelastic, an increase in price may lead

to more supplies, maybe not as much as if there were 

higher elasticity, but more. But there's another 

benefit to consumers here, which is that if one would 

expect that a buyer bidding more can make a more 

efficient use of the product and therefore generate more 

output, and that output expansion which doesn't depend 

on supply expansion is also beneficial to consumers 

because that means there will be more output in the 

downstream market and a corresponding decrease in price.

 So we have those two benefits to consumers 

and we also have the fact that as the Court said in 

Professional Engineers, the Sherman Act reflects a 

judgment that price competition generally, a free and 

open price competition will produce lower prices and 

better goods and services, and the Court has not 

required that that be traced to consumer welfare in 

every particular case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I presume it could lead to 

lower consumer prices too. If you have a firm that has 

developed a new, a new technique for processing the 

logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and 

sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and 

thereby make even more profit, that firm would be 

willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would 

sell them for less than competitors might sell them.

MR. PINCUS: That's exactly right, Justice 

Scalia, and that's what the record reflects here, that 

Weyerhaeuser invested in its lumber mills and created a 

process that got more value out of a log. The record 

reflects that plaintiffs, for example, did not do that. 

And there is testimony that plaintiff's mill was quite, 

relatively inefficient compared to Weyerhaeuser. 

Weyerhaeuser invested new processes that had less waste, 

produced more output as Justice Scalia suggested, and 

therefore it was able to sell, sell that output at a 

lower price and still make a profit, because it was 

getting more output for log and therefore could pay more 

for the log.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there any argument in 

the trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals 

as to how to calculate cost? You basically have two 

markets. You don't usually think of cost when you buy 

something. But was there any argument as to how to 

determine whether or not this was below cost in the 

Brooke Group sense?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, our view, Justice 

Kennedy, there really wasn't, because the district judge 

had made clear his view in the pretrial motions that 

there wasn't a need to prove prices, and that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was the end of it

at the trial court.

 MR. PINCUS: But our position is, and there 

has certainly been some writing on this in the 

literature, is that what one does is take the cost of 

producing the output which includes the allegedly 

predatory price of the log, and here logs are 75 percent 

of the cost so it's a very big cost. Compare those 

costs to the revenues that are received in the 

downstream market and if those revenues exceed costs, 

then you're in a position where the defendant is 

behaving perfectly economically rationally. If they're 

less, then you go on to recoup it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, how do you 

determine the price of the logs? Because we, the 

charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive 

price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to 

determine cost, that's one thing. But we are, also in 

this picture is that some of the logs came from 

Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term 

contracts that it had, and those, the price was not 

inflated on those. So if you take those into account 

you may get one figure, but if you take only the high 

bid logs you might get a different picture. So how, 

what is it? How do you determine costs? Do you look at 

all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that

were allegedly bid out?

 MR. PINCUS: No. You would look, you would 

look, Your Honor, at all of the, at all of the logs, 

just as in the downstream market if you have a sell side 

case, you look at, you look at prices of all sales. 

Here it's interesting that the record reflects that 

plaintiff received more than, between 30 and 50 percent 

of its logs from the same kind of long-term sources that 

it argues that Weyerhaeuser received it from. So in 

this case there really isn't the kind of disparity, but 

our position would be that you add all of those up and 

compare them to revenues.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me that 

we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure 

about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. If 

you have your own logs that you own already and if you 

have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant 

logs are the logs that both people are competing for. 

That's the only relevant market that we are talking 

about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.

 MR. PINCUS: And it might be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if Weyerhaeuser wanted 

to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after 

the logs which are open to both parties.

 MR. PINCUS: And Your Honor, as the Court

observed in Brooke Group, there really wasn't a need 

there to get into how the test works and we think there 

isn't here. We think the issue is symmetrical and it 

might be that the focus is on the incremental costs that 

are associated with the alleged predatory volume, and 

therefore that might focus on those incremental costs. 

But in this case there's no dispute that, whatever the 

measure of costs, there has been no challenge to the 

position that Weyerhaeuser's prices were above those 

costs.

 Let me just turn back to, to the other two 

reasons why we think Brooke Group applies because I 

think they're important. The third is it's much more 

likely that the high bids here were going to, were a 

result of legitimate competition than of anticompetitive 

effort. As this Court has observed both in Brooke Group 

and Matsushita, predatory conduct is self-deterring. To 

engage in it, the defendant has to be willing to incur a 

near-term loss against the hope of higher returns later. 

And as the Court explained in those cases, the loss is 

definite but the gain depends on a number of 

imponderables. So there is some self-deterring.

 And finally, a test that provides no 

guidance threatens false positives that will deter the 

very competition that our economy requires and that

helps our economy reach its most efficient state. As 

Justice Breyer put it for the First Circuit in Town of 

Comfort, antitrust rules must be clear enough for 

lawyers to explain them to their clients, especially in 

a sensitive area like pricing.  And certainly the rule 

that the Ninth Circuit adopted here has none of that 

clarity and we think that the Court's Brooke Group 

decision and that test does.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the 

company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and 

there were minutes of the board of directors says that 

in order to do this we've got to drive company X out of 

business and so you, we want you to compete in every 

transaction with company X that you can and buy the logs 

at a higher price. Would that be an anticompetitive act 

even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?

 MR. PINCUS: And the only anticompetitive 

conduct alleged was pricing conduct, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. The 

anticompetitive -- the plan is to drive the company out 

of business. And the only anticompetitive conduct other 

than proving the whole objective is that you pick on 

this one competitor and outbid him every time you can. 

Could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the whole purpose 

was to drive it out of business?

 MR. PINCUS: Even if that was the whole 

purpose.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Pursuant to a plan to 

acquire a monopoly.

 MR. PINCUS: And the reason for that, 

Justice Stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish, 

especially for the judicial system to distinguish, 

between hard-fought competition and anticompetitive 

intent if all we're looking at is what's in people's 

mind set. As judge Easterbrook wrote in his AA Poultry 

decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it so hard if you 

take Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement 

and we take that as a given, as a given premise?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, because there won't be a 

given premise in every case, Your Honor, and the problem 

is the Court has to write rules that will, that will 

govern conduct, primary conduct of business people in 

the market, and a rule that says if you can prove intent 

then you don't have to worry about prices and costs is a 

rule that opens the door to second-guess, judicial 

second-guessing of prices --

monopoly power. You have to be able to prove monopoly 

power, too.

 MR. PINCUS: You do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There aren't too many 

cases that fit this.

 MR. PINCUS: As the Court has recognized in 

the section 2 context, the problem of deterring 

procompetitive conduct is even more serious because you 

don't have the threshold environment of proof of 

conspiracy, as one does in section 1. We're dealing 

with unilateral conduct, and so --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but unilateral conduct 

where you have monopoly power. There aren't too many of 

these cases, as you know.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, market 

definition is a complicated issue and it may be hard for 

businesses --

resolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand 

you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.

correlative situation where there is an allegation of 

predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you 

had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens? Namely

evidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out 

of business, wouldn't that establish a violation?

 MR. PINCUS: It would not establish a 

violation, Your Honor. In fact, the Brooke Group Court 

dealt with that very case because the dissent in Brooke 

Group pointed out that the district court in that case 

had held that the intent evidence was amongst the most 

powerful that had ever been, been presented in any case, 

and it still said, even though there was a clear 

evidence of intent --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that did not involve a 

monopoly. That did not involve monopoly power.

 MR. PINCUS: But it involved the test for 

predatory pricing, Your Honor, under Robinson-Patman. 

But the Court said its test was perfectly applicable to 

section 2. And the lower courts have certainly applied 

that test in just that way in section 2 cases. And if 

the rule would be that even in the predatory selling 

situation intent can override the price-cost and the 

recoupment requirements, then you're in a situation 

where there's no ability for business people to know in 

advance when low prices are justified. All we think is 

that there should be symmetry.

 If the Court has no further questions I'll 

reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court.

 Aggressive bidding by the buyer of an input, 

no less than aggressive pricecutting by the seller of a 

finished product, is usually procompetitive. Because a 

claim of predatory bidding is simply the flip side of a 

claim of predatory pricing, the Brooke Group standard 

for predatory pricing claims should apply to predatory 

bidding claims as well. And in our view the court of 

appeals erred in this case by sanctioning a broader and 

more subjective standard of liability. In Brooke Group, 

this Court adopted its now familiar two-pronged standard 

for predatory pricing claims despite recognizing that 

each prong of that standard might permit some 

anticompetitive pricecutting. The court was willing to 

tolerate that modest degree of underinclusion because, 

in the Court's own words, "The mechanism by which a firm 

engages in predatory pricing is the same mechanism by 

which a firm stimulates competition, namely by lowering

its prices. And the Court explained that a broader or a 

less precise standard of liability would run the risk of 

prohibiting or chilling some procompetitive price 

cutting. In our view the same analysis can apply to a 

claim of predatory bidding. Because aggressive bidding 

is usually procompetitive, application of the Brooke 

Group standard is warranted in order to avoid 

prohibiting or chilling procompetitive conduct with 

regard to price in that context as well.

 The court of appeals in this case held that 

Brooke Group was inapplicable to respondent's claim of 

predatory bidding by --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe 

the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your 

brother, would you describe that as just aggressive 

bidding? Aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good 

term when you're talking about competition. But what if 

it's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival 

can afford?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

understood Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and he can 

correct me if I'm wrong, to posit a case in which there 

was dynamite evidence that the defendant had a 

monopolistic or exclusionary intent. But in our view 

that is insufficient to state a section 2 claim. One

has to have exclusionary conduct as well.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, you have to have the 

monopoly power as well.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is also true, and 

with regard to a claim of attempted --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In your view, if as the 

jury was instructed in this case there was proof of 

monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that 

power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the 

anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a 

violation of the Sherman Act?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think you need to 

have all three of those elements in order to state a 

claim of attempted monopolization --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you do have all 

three, is that enough to prove a violation?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That would be enough to 

state a claim for attempted monopolization under this 

Court's decision in Separate Forks.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that how the 

jury was instructed in this case?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: In our view the jury was 

instructed that it would be sufficient to establish an 

anticompetitive act to find that petitioner priced its 

logs --

section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not 

correct?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct, Justice 

Stevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our 

view the jury was properly instructed with regard to the 

other two elements, namely a dangerous probability of 

monopolization and a specific intent to monopolize. The 

sole question before this Court is what constitutes 

exclusionary conduct for purposes of section 2, what 

constitutes it regardless of whether it's a claim of 

attempted monopolization or actual monopolization.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Go back to my 

hypothetical. Supposing you have the first two elements 

and you say in order to drive this company out of 

business we want you to compete with them and get the 

logs at whatever cost it takes. Would that be an 

anticompetitive act?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: No, Justice Stevens. That 

would solely be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was for the 

sole purpose of driving the company out of business in 

order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?

it may be powerful evidence, of a monopolistic intent, 

though courts have noted that even with regard to that 

requirement it's famously difficult to distinguish 

between a legitimate competitive attempt on the one hand 

and an illegitimate monopolistic intent.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, no. I'm assuming this 

is not evidence of intent. There's independent evidence 

of both intent and monopoly power. With those two 

elements established, would this, the kind of evidence I 

described, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff 

that could be actual in damages?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: No, Justice Stevens. You 

would need to have objective evidence that the defendant 

met both of the prongs of the Brooke Group requirement.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Will you need to meet the 

prongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a 

violation of section 2?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I'm not quite sure 

what it means to say that you otherwise prove a 

violation in that example.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You prove monopoly power 

plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That is insufficient. You 

have to have some action --

prove a violation of Section 2?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is insufficient to prove 

a violation of section 2 because you have to have some 

conduct that is classed as exclusionary, and in our view 

that is the content that the Brooke Group standard 

supplies. It specifies the conduct that you need to 

have and that conduct is the defendant suffering a loss 

in the short term and having a dangerous probability of 

recouping that loss in the long term.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you could have a 

company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to 

monopolize and the means that they choose is just 

idiotic. For example, they say, we're going to try to 

get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as, 

at as low a price as possible. You would have the two 

elements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you 

wouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive 

conduct.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what you're 

asserting is the case here.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: You could have an 

incompetent monopolist more generally or an incompetent 

predator in this specific context. And I think that the

colloquy is that the Court really did confront this 

issue in Brooke Group. There was fairly strong evidence 

of monopolistic intent and the majority opinion --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no evidence 

of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in 

that case.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's right, and it wasn't 

an issue simply because it was a Robinson-Patman Act 

case and all that is required under the Robinson-Patman 

Act is the possibility of harm to competition and there 

was some disagreement about whether a showing had been 

made of that requisite possibility between the majority 

opinion and your dissenting opinion. But I don't think 

that there was any disagreement in Brooke Group with 

regard to the relevant standard for exclusionary 

conduct. Even the dissenting opinion recognized that 

recoupment would be necessary in order to state the 

predatory pricing claim in the Robinson-Patman Act 

context.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would your answer be the 

same if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very 

high barriers of entry that would prevent other 

competitors from entering the market after the target 

was driven out?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: High barriers to entry,

Justice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry 

under the second prong of the Brooke Group standard, 

namely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability 

of recoupment in the long term. And indeed in many 

predation cases, many predatory pricing cases in the 13 

years since Brooke Group, barriers to entry have been 

absolutely vital in resolving predatory pricing claims 

at the summary judgment stage, because typically 

defendants will make the argument that the absence of 

barriers to entry make the possibility of recoupment 

unlikely. But that is a consideration that is built 

into the Brooke Group standard and it certainly would be 

part of the Brooke Group analysis in the predatory 

bidding context as well.

 I want to say just one thing in response to 

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy's questions to my 

friend Mr. Pincus about the question of the appropriate 

measure of cost if Brooke Group were to apply to 

predatory bidding claims. As in Brooke Group itself, we 

believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to specify 

the exact method of calculating costs in this case. But 

the position of the United States more generally both in 

the predatory pricing context and in the predatory 

bidding context is that a Court should look to a 

defendant's incremental costs, and in this context that

would mean looking to the amount of the input that was 

the subject of the alleged predation. So in this case 

the amount of logs that petitioner allegedly predatorily 

purchased on the open market. And such an incremental 

approach to be sure is not within its difficulties in 

application and for that reason a number of lower courts 

in the predatory pricing context have instead looked to 

average variable costs or other measures as a proxy for 

incremental costs. But we believe that in a case such 

as this one, looking to incremental costs may be useful 

because it effectively excludes from the analysis any 

potential cross-subsidization, whether by virtue of the 

fact that in this case, for example, petitioner may have 

harvested logs from its own lands. There are claims in 

this case that petitioner entered into various exclusive 

dealing arrangements as well, obtained logs at a lower 

price on that basis. And an incremental approach has 

the virtue of focusing only on that portion of the 

market that is the subject of the alleged predation 

claims.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You also, I take it, have 

to have an equally limited approach on the recoupment 

analysis, then. I mean, your recoupment analysis would 

have to be symmetrical with your cost analysis.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. That's absolutely

true, Justice Souter, and again this is an issue that 

the lower courts have been grappling with in the 

predatory pricing context, and I by no means want to 

suggest that it is always an easy analysis in the 

predatory pricing context. Professor Arita's treatise 

has hundreds of pages on the appropriate calculation of 

cost, but I think that the important thing to remember 

with regard to the below cost pricing prong of the 

Brooke Group analysis is that it does provide an 

objective yardstick by which a defendant's loss can be 

measured.

 Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. HAGLUND

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. HAGLUND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please The Court.

 In this Court's antitrust jurisprudence over 

the last 25 years, market realities have consistently 

trumped per se rules. The same approach should apply 

here. Brooke Group's per se rule which carved out a 

special exception to the standard rule of reason 

balancing test in Section 2 cases should not be extended

to the buy side. No safe harbor per se rule is 

justified here because raising input prices, unlike 

cutting output prices, is moving prices in the wrong 

direction for consumers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But even it does hurt the 

suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't 

know just as, but they are just as concerned about a 

group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a 

group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as 

they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a 

monopoly seller.

 MR. HAGLUND: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean that's pretty well 

established, isn't it?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well I'd like to point out 

that the Mandeville Farms case that Mr. Pincus cited 

does not stand for the same --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, Congress has 

actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville 

Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so 

-- you want me to write the proposition that the 

antitrust laws are not concerned --

farmers?

 MR. HAGLUND: Absolutely not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. HAGLUND: But in this particular context 

which the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an 

inelastic market like this one raising input prices is 

not going to increase supply and --

JUSTICE BREYER: That can't possibly be 

right, can it? I mean if in fact the object here is to 

strike, is -- suppose their object is what you say. 

Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the 

buying side over a group of small woodsmen. And they 

might do that if they drove out all the buying 

competitors, and now what are they going to try to do? 

What they will try to do if they get that terrible 

monopoly, which would be bad --

MR. HAGLUND: Drive prices down.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Drive prices way 

down, below what the woodsmen could get for them. And 

if that's going to have any effect aside from an income 

effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread 

line or go to other places where they have other jobs at 

lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the 

woods business and selling at a reasonable price. That 

would be an antitrust concern.

MR. HAGLUND: Absolutely, and that is 

exactly what Weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by 

their own materials, that their plan was and in fact 

they did foresee and project that log prices would go 

down in 2001 --

JUSTICE BREYER: So where we are is at the 

problem. The problem is the same as at the buying side. 

What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad 

effects. On the other hand, low prices are good for the 

consumer.

 MR. HAGLUND: But you're not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Here we have bad effects, 

bad possibilities. On the other hand, higher prices are 

good for the woodsmen. So we need rules to separate the 

sheep from the goats. And the other side is proposing a 

rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad 

conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the 

goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when 

he tries to sell them he will incur a loss.

 Now I would have thought for 40 years that 

was a traditional idea. If you're trying to decide 

whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad 

purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good 

purposes, then a very good key to that is do these 

people expect in the long run to make money out of this

without driving those victims out? If the answer is 

yes; they can make money on the market, they are storing 

up nuts for winter. It's good. And if the answer is no 

it's bad. That's called the recoupment test. I don't 

think that's new. I think it's old. And I'm not sure 

what your view of it is.

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, as to Brooke Group and 

what the Court's being asked to do here, Justice Breyer, 

is to go down the same path that it did in Albrecht 

versus Harold Company in '68 when it agreed to treat 

completely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical 

resale price restraints.

 Later on, in State Oil Company vs. Kahn the 

Court abandoned and accepted Justice Harlan's dissent 

that it was wrong to equate those two.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I agree with you. But I 

don't still think you can defend this retail versus 

maximum price restraint. That's a whole another kettle 

of fish. And what I'm interested -- I guess my 

question particularly is, I propose one test not two, 

but it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test 

and incremental costs and so forth. What do you think 

of my one test?

going to make money legitimately out of this in the long 

run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away. But if 

they are, it's okay.

 MR. HAGLUND: The problem with granting a 

safe harbor for above cost input purchases is that it 

does not work well in this context, especially in an 

inelastic market. The suggestion that you can simply 

use incremental cost is not a workable approach here if 

you look at the facts in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the fact 

that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational 

actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to 

realize that they are in a better shape having two 

buyers rather than just one. So maybe they forego the 

extra 50 cents a log, or whatever -- tree, it is in the 

short term and sell enough to keep the other company in 

business? I mean they can make that decision 

themselves. Or they can make the decision as rational 

actors that they are better off having more money that 

they can then use to buy more alder saplings that they 

can plant for the future. And either way it benefits 

the consumers.

 MR. HAGLUND: Well not, that's not quite 

correct, because the signals that the higher input 

prices show, yes, they do generally incent more

production in a, in a typical market. Here, however, 

where you have a product that takes 30 to 50 years time 

and production, the price, higher price signals when 

they are sent by a monopsonist, like Weyerhaeuser in 

this case, actually send a very powerful message to tree 

farmers not to replant alder, despite those high prices. 

And there was evidence in the follow-on cases that 

reference that.

 It was alleged in our complaint in this case 

but not actually backed up by any testimony at trial, 

that tree farmers in Oregon and Washington were actually 

electing not to replant alder and as Professor Noel 

notes in his law review article in the issue of the 

Antitrust Law Journal, which by the way is the only area 

-- half of this issue is devoted to this subject. It's 

the sum total of literature devoted to predatory 

overbidding in this area. And what Professor Noel notes 

is that where you have localized monopsony, the result 

is when the monopsony is in full flower a misallocation 

of resources between regions. The highly productive 

forest lands of the Pacific Northwest won't have as much 

alder in the future because of the significant signals 

sent by a monopsonist, even when they are engaged in 

that scheme.

 The seller is happy if he has mature alder

to sell at that time to get the good price, but he is 

not going to replant, because he sees that 30 years down 

the road he will not have a competitive marketplace 

within which to sell his timber, and that was the 

reality in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if he is, if he 

is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational 

and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be 

selling some to the other, the other processor even if 

that processor is not bidding as much?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well we did actually have some 

record evidence in this case that at least a few people 

were doing that. One of the major suppliers of the 

respondent here, Ross-Simmons, was a company called 

Longview Fiber which made it -- a very sophisticated 

publicly held company -- made it a practice to sell most 

of its volume to Ross-Simmons on a market basis because 

it did not want the eventuality of not having 

Ross-Simmons in that competitive circle with 

Weyerhaeuser.

 Most small woodland owners, however, who may 

only be in the market once every five years because 

that's the nature of their rotation, of the age classes 

of the timber that they have got, are not in that kind 

of sophisticated position because they are in the market

 MR. HAGLUND: No, it's not.

 JUSTICE ALITO: To decide whether 

Weyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed in order to 

prevent its rivals from obtaining the logs that they 

needed at a fair price? How is a jury to, a lay jury, 

to decide whether a company like Weyerhaeuser bought 

more logs than it needed, or what is the fair price?

 MR. HAGLUND: We don't contend that the 

instruction was perfect here, but if one looks at the 

instruction as a whole and --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you think it was 

sufficient.

 MR. HAGLUND: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE ALITO: You think it was sufficient 

enough.

 MR. HAGLUND: In this case it was legally 

sufficient and I point out that this Court very recently 

has issued a decision in the first case of the term, 

Ayers vs. Belmontes, where you looked at the question of 

the catch-all mitigation factor in California in the

penalty phase of a capital murder case. And you looked 

at the instruction and interpreted it in terms of the 

closing arguments, the evidence and the other 

instructions as a whole.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who proposed the 

instruction in this case?

 MR. HAGLUND: The instruction, the paragraph 

that is subject to the great criticism on the other 

side, was a paragraph that was drafted by the district 

judge and handed out near the end of the trial and then 

commented on by the lawyers in, prior to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no requested 

charge on this point by the plaintiff?

 MR. HAGLUND: That's -- as to the issue of 

predatory pricing, plaintiffs, as we make clear in our 

brief, actually submitted a predatory pricing 

instruction three weeks before the trial. You tend to 

be overinclusive pretrial. Defendant on the other hand 

surprisingly submitted no such instruction on predatory 

pricing. The judge submitted a paragraph that had 

something more than what the current, or the ultimate 

paragraph contained. There was a debate over whether it 

needed to be, whether it was consistent with Brooke 

Group. I agreed with the other side that it did not 

have both components of the Brooke Group test. Judge

Panner and I had a colloquy where ultimately he was 

going to turn one paragraph into two, include a Brooke 

Group test. We then withdrew our request for that 

instruction, Weyerhaeuser objected to the, the thinned 

down version of the ultimate paragraph.

 But the interesting thing about 

Weyerhaeuser's relationship to this instruction is that 

they really invited the linguistic framework of this, 

"bought more than they needed" or --

JUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean? What 

does a fair price in this, in this context mean? Does 

it mean the price that's necessary in order to keep an 

inefficient competitor in business?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, what it meant in this 

case, Justice Alito, is that it meant what, how much did 

Weyerhaeuser artificially increase the log market above 

where it otherwise would have been? We had several 

experts and a number of both industry and forest 

economists testify that for 20-plus years log prices had 

been following lumber. There was an equilibrium in the 

market. Then you get to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that the standard of 

fairness? I mean that, you know, that may be fine. But 

how does, how does a jury, A, what's the authority for 

saying that is the standard of fairness and B, how does

a jury know that?

 MR. HAGLUND: The -- if you look at the 

Ninth Circuit opinion, the Ninth Circuit made it clear 

that the instructions as a whole provided sufficient 

guidance. Nowhere in the case as we tried it did we 

attempt to exploit the instruction in the way that 

Weyerhaeuser suggests happened.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe you didn't, but that 

basically left the jury on a, on a free float, didn't 

it?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, I don't think so if you 

look at the evidence. The evidence that we presented 

included a forest economist who presented three 

different scenarios where he identified how much 

Weyerhaeuser had artificially increased log prices above 

where they would have been but for their anticompetitive 

behavior. We in no way went to the jury in closing, 

saying award what you think is fair. We relied 

completely on that evidence, and in fact the jury, which 

included a Ph.D. in physics in a high-tech industry, an 

accountant, the head of a chain store, and a banker and 

a retired farmer, they looked at the evidence and they 

actually to the dollar picked one of those market -based 

scenarios for how much was the market elevated.

accept your sort of Delmonte's analysis here. If we 

were to approve of that instruction in effect, as you 

want us to do, and we also believe that on its face 

something more has got to be said than merely the word 

fair, what proposition would we say must be included in 

that instruction to make the so-called fairness 

instruction a sensible one that can be consistently 

applied?

 MR. HAGLUND: And we don't contend that it 

was a perfect instruction. We think it would be 

perfectly appropriate if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that.

 MR. HAGLUND: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I'm saying if we follow 

your lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a 

closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say 

must be added to it?

 MR. HAGLUND: It's quite simple. If you 

look at that paragraph, there are two pieces of it. One 

of them, one portion says that you can regard it as an 

anticompetitive act if defendant purchased more logs 

than it needed. We don't think that needs to be 

improved because that's easy to figure out, and here we 

had evidence that they continued --

figure out? As Justice Breyer brought up the 

stockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing 

it, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just 

letting it go to rack and moon in order to put this 

company out of business?

 MR. HAGLUND: Justice Ginsburg, you will 

know because of the evidence in the case. If the 

plaintiff, the defendant is able to show that they were 

storing up this extra input against a prospect of a 

price hike in the future or because they were out trying 

to get enough volume for some promotion for a customer 

that was going to significantly increase their 

purchases, then you'd have a different kind of case. We 

have a situation where they warehoused large, 

unprecedentedly high volumes of lumber because they --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why did they say they 

needed it? I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy 

up there? Why don't you just prove what you just said?

 MR. HAGLUND: We did.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then why do you need 

all these other instructions about pricing? I suppose 

the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute 

as to whether it was in their economic interest in the 

absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy 

all these logs or not. And so it would be very

interesting if you have a way of proving that they did 

not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter 

which is likely to be disputed. So, I think the hard 

thing in these cases is to prove that. And if you can 

tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an 

instruction something like, look to see whether they can 

sell them reasonably at a profit. Or, look to see even 

if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could 

recoup whatever they are losing later. Or, or, and you 

fill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates 

for testing.

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, as to the paid a higher 

price than necessary, the language we would suggest 

could be used in another case and passed on by this 

Court, is the following: Paid a higher price than 

necessary to move the log market to higher levels than 

otherwise would have prevailed in order to injure 

competition.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. But of course, I want 

to injure competition always when I in fact sell at a 

lower price that I very much hope my competitor can't 

possibly meet, indeed would go out of business. I 

cheer. I would love to get a monopoly. I would love to 

make a better product, lower prices, et cetera. Do you 

see the problem? And so what you've told the jury there

on that instruction --

MR. HAGLUND: But here --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that they can find 

this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so 

second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will 

sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive 

selling market.

 MR. HAGLUND: We don't have a situation 

here, Justice Breyer, where Weyerhaeuser presented 

evidence that they were the most efficient and able to 

pay higher prices. Weyerhaeuser presented no 

quantitative evidence that it was the lowest cost 

producer in terms of costs --

JUSTICE BREYER: What if it were the highest 

cost producer? Suppose still, they think that by buying 

these logs we later can make a profit when we resell 

them on the competitive market. You see, the reason 

they're coming up with this test is they don't think you 

can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think 

that you can produce a better one. So I'm listening.

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, one of the reasons that 

one can't go in this direction here, Brooke Group was a 

pricing only case. As the briefs make clear and the 

decision made clear, if that had been a standard 

monopolization case it would have been out the door on

summary judgment because the defendant was a 12 percent 

player. They had no prospect of, of attempted or 

monopolization, a viable monopolization claim. Here we 

have a situation where Weyerhaeuser's pricing conduct, 

deliberately and artificially pushing the market up 

through a variety of mechanisms, was also interconnected 

and linked to complementary other conduct that we think 

set the table for the effectiveness of their strategy in 

elevating the log market that our client was 

participating in.

 Bear in mind that, that at JA 901 we have a 

Weyerhaeuser document showing that very significant 

foreclosure from their exclusive contracts in the, in 

Oregon for example, this is a document that shows that 

62 percent of the market was covered through either 

exclusive purchase arrangements between Weyerhaeuser and 

large landowners, or non-efficiency-based trades were 

the, were linked to the exchange of the alder sawlogs 

from that landowner. Only 33 percent according to JA 

901 show, in Oregon, was projected to be open market 

bidding. Weyerhaeuser acquired, when it was then at a 

65 percent market share, acquired the dominant seller, a 

built-in monopsony in British Columbia and it's five, 15 

to 20-year exclusive forest licenses. That kind of 

foreclosure, linked with the anticompetitive behavior

they engaged in that was a variety of bidding practices, 

some of it was overbuying, some of it was manipulating 

bidding back and forth, and then putting the last bid in 

terms of that cost on the other side.

 I think it's important, I'd like to shift to 

the instruction again, and make the point that 

Weyerhaeuser never gave either the plaintiff in this 

case or the district judge the opportunity to consider a 

different instruction than was given here. And the fact 

that's demonstratively shown if one looks at page 43 of 

their opening brief in the Ninth Circuit, in the Ninth 

Circuit they only took the position in the bulk of their 

brief that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of 

law on the basis of Brooke Group. As to the ground or 

the contention --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you agree 

that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because 

they were selling these logs at a profit?

 MR. HAGLUND: I didn't quite hear that, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that you 

could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test 

because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these 

sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?

 MR. HAGLUND: We do not agree as to the

evidence in this case. We have evidence in this case 

that we cited to in our brief that when you adjust, as 

against the Longview mill which our client was literally 

right next door to, when you adjust for the fact that 

Weyerhaeuser supplied half of the raw material needs of 

the Longview mill at way below market transfer prices, 

when you adjust those to the average price they paid 

other third parties for logs, the Longview mill ran at a 

loss for a significant part of the, of the predation 

period. We do have the evidence in this case to 

contend --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's ultimately a jury 

question, I assume.

 MR. HAGLUND: If Brooke Group is applied --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that question was not 

put to the jury, right?

 MR. HAGLUND: That's correct. We withdrew 

the request for a Brooke Group instruction.

 But to finish my point about the fact that 

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then, would you 

be entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you 

withdrew that instruction?

 MR. HAGLUND: If the Court concludes the 

Brooke Group applies to this case, then the instruction

was incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be 

entitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what about the 

recoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have 

market power in the selling market and that mills were 

entering, new mills were coming on line during this 

period. How would you satisfy the recoupment?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, the recoupment is not in 

the output end of things. The recoupment is the 

opportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra 

costs you pay during the predatory period. And we had 

evidence in the record that a former executive from 

Weyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy 

multiple times, that when it was questioned by some in 

top management that the head of a division would always 

say once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor, 

we will recoup those costs many fold. That's at JA 260, 

Cliff Chulos. We also had at JA 903 a planning document 

in 2001 where Weyerhaeuser was showing in that 

PowerPoint chart the expectation that log prices would 

be going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent 

change downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to 

the bottom line. There was no plan to pass on the 

benefits of those lower input prices to consumers. 

Obvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation.

Also as to recoupment, if you look at JA 831 

to 95, which are the year-end financials for the 

Weyerhaeuser alder mills in Oregon, Washington and BC 

during a roughly four-year period, you see a monu -- a 

huge price differential between the prices in British 

Columbia and those prevailing in Oregon and Washington. 

We think there was every expectation on management's 

part to drive the prices down to the levels that 

prevailed in British Columbia, which works out to about 

$40 million a year, way way above the amount they were 

spending in this predatory scheme predominantly in 

Oregon and Washington, because there is no competition 

in British Columbia.

 But I would like to point out that they 

never preserved the issue of whether or not the standard 

that the Ninth Circuit in dictum stated was as a whole 

sufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of 

anticompetitive conduct. At page 43 of their brief 

after quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they 

note, although that statement of the law -- this is 43 

of the Ninth Circuit brief, not the blue brief that you 

have -- although that statement of the law may have been 

acceptable when Reed Brothers was decided, it is not in 

the wake of Brooke Group for reasons explained above. 

The point here is that they never made any charge in the

Ninth Circuit that the instruction was flawed 

independent of Brooke Group. Now we concede, if Brooke 

Group applies, the instruction was -- was -- is wrong, 

and the case should be reversed and remanded. But the 

second point that they try to make in their briefing is 

not properly preserved. And in fact, I'd like to point 

out that they contributed to the linguistic framework of 

this instruction in a very significant way. First --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm losing you. What's the 

second point that they're trying to make besides the 

fact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?

 MR. HAGLUND: Well, they have also asserted 

in their briefing that as an independent ground for 

reversal, the instruction was so standardless that the 

verdict cannot stand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Regardless of Brooke Group.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that something 

that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree 

with them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the 

course of making a choice between a Brooke Group 

instruction and something else, and the only something 

else we've got right now is what we have in this case 

and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that 

is good enough.

they may not have made that an independent basis of 

reversal but we've got to consider it.

 MR. HAGLUND: I agree with that, but I would 

like to point out these facts in terms of the way they 

contributed to it. They submitted jury instructions 

just like us based upon the ABA model instructions, 

theirs are at JA 97 to 122, that used the words outside 

of this paragraph that we are talking about, fair, 

reasonable or necessary 18 times. They showed up 19 

times in those instructions. In their opening and 

closing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'll stipulate to that.

 MR. HAGLUND: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Assuming they don't have a 

leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face 

what the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of 

instruction is. And -- and however they may have tried 

their case, we've still got the same problem.

 MR. HAGLUND: That's correct. And I suggest 

that you look to the type of formulation I gave a little 

earlier where you're looking at how much did the 

defendant push the market to levels that are above where 

it otherwise would have been. It's not too far from the 

test that is proposed by the State at page 29 of their

brief where they suggest it's, that the conduct be 

measured by whether it raised the price that the buyer's 

rivals had to pay for the input beyond a level that 

could be justified or explained by other market or 

exogenous factors and substantially affected the ability 

of the buyer's rivals to compete for the input. The 

eight States, all of which have concerns both as sellers 

into these vulnerable resource markets and for citizens 

and companies in their own resource State, laden States, 

whether it's mineral, whether it's agriculture, they 

have that concern and they've offered that test that's 

not too far from what I posited as a way to improve the 

instruction that Weyerhaeuser invited.

 I'd like to make one further point on 

that subject and that is, if you look at the opening 

statement of their counsel, the closing, he used that 

very language. They were going to put on witnesses who 

would all state that they never bought more than they 

needed, they never paid more than necessary. That same 

litany was put to 13 different witnesses.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a couple of points.

 With respect to the story of how this 

instruction came to be, in fact it closely resembles 

some language that was requested by respondent that 

appears on page 93A of the joint appendix which refers 

to a test that paying a price for logs with higher than 

market value unnecessarily to drive out or injure 

competition. So I do think that this is an instruction 

that comes from respondent.

 It's true that we did not request a Brooke 

Group instruction because the district court had ruled 

that Brooke Group didn't apply at the summary judgment 

phase. We did object to the instruction proposed by the 

district judge on the grounds that it did not conform 

with Brooke Group in order to preserve our argument here 

and we believe that that objection gives the Court the 

power to adopt an intermediate rule, but it isn't 

exactly what we requested and there are decisions in the 

court of appeals of to that effect.

 With respect to the question about 

purchasing more logs than they needed, as we say in our 

briefs we think that that claim can't really be 

separated from the predatory pricing claim here because

the argument is that by purchasing more logs the price 

was driven up and it's the increased price, that's the 

impact that respondent complains of. So creating a 

separate overbuying claim that relies on price for 

impact would be the same thing as saying on the sell 

side you can have an overselling claim regardless of 

whether you flunk the Brooke Group standard with respect 

to prices, and that's just going to undercut the 

certainty that this Court has prescribed.

 With respect to the document that 

Mr. Haglund cited, 901A about the inputs, that document 

is described in testimony in the joint appendix at 571A
