 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-694, Judulang v. Holder.

 Mr. Fleming.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General 

confirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to 

deportation, quote, "must have the same opportunity to 

seek discretionary relief as an alien who has 

temporarily left this country and upon reentry been 

subject to exclusion."

 Two months later in its published decision 

in Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an 

immigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek 

relief because his conviction could also form the basis 

for excludability. Immigrants in situations 

indistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and 

received relief under this rule.

 The BIA's decision in Blake changed the law. 

Without explaining or even initially acknowledging that 

it was doing so, the Blake rule was impermissibly

retroactive, and it is arbitrary and capricious on its 

own merits. We would submit the evidence -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you explain -- I 

mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake 

and Brieva changed the law. How do you explain the 

language in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good 

deal those two cases, 1984, which says: "Section 212(c) 

can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the 

ground of deportation charged is also a ground of 

inadmissibility." It seems to me that that's -- that's 

the basic point.

 MR. FLEMING: Two responses to that, 

Justice Scalia: I agree, Matter of Wadud is the 

principal response that the Government has, and it does 

not help them at all. Wadud was deportable for a 

conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1546, and the BIA had held, 

in a case called Matter of R-G- in 1958, that that 

conviction did not render him excludable.

 And that's confirmed later in the case of 

Matter of Jimenez-Santillano, which also involved a 1546 

conviction, where the BIA says that if Mr. Jimenez had 

left the country and returned, it appears that he would 

not have been inadmissible, and compares that situation 

to someone convicted of a firearms offense, which the 

board and the Attorney General had always said were not

waivable.

 To the extent there's any ambiguity in the 

language that Your Honor read, it could not have 

survived the Attorney General's decision in 

Hernandez-Casillas, which I just quoted at the beginning 

of the presentation, which said that what one looks to 

is whether the alien in exclusion proceedings would be 

able to invoke section 212(c) relief. And when the 

board then addressed the case of the aggravated felony 

in Matter of Meza, it did not even address Wadud or view 

it as binding at all. It looked to the conviction and 

whether it formed a basis for excludability.

 And the BIA then followed up with no fewer 

than eight decisions in crime of violence cases, 

indistinguishable from this case, where the -- the BIA 

cited, not Wadud, not any of the other cases that the 

Government is relying on, but cited Meza as articulating 

the doctrine that the focus of analysis is on the 

conviction. And the Court has the briefs of several 

former immigration officials, including two INS general 

counsel and several INS trial attorneys, confirming that 

that was the position and the basis on which the 

government litigated these cases -­

Kagan.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Please finish.

 MR. FLEMING: If I may, I was just going to 

say that a number of these cases, crime of violence 

cases, reached the merits in both the BIA and the courts 

of appeals without the government even suggesting that 

there was a statutory counterpart problem. In fact, 

when it has suited its purposes the government and the 

BIA have admitted that Blake was a change, including in 

a brief filed in the Ninth Circuit less than a year ago.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: You cite some cases. You 

say there was a dramatic change in the law. The 

Government cites some cases, and it says there was no 

change in the law. What if the truth lies someplace in 

the middle? What if, in fact, when you look before 

Blake, what you see is some amount of confusion? That 

the board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but 

that at other times individual judges or maybe the board 

itself were doing something different, because the 

individual circumstances suggested that they should, or 

just because they weren't so clear on the difference 

between these two approaches.

 And then Blake comes along, and what Blake 

does is neither to change something dramatically nor to 

just reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to

create a little bit of order out of chaos. What would 

that do to your argument if that's the way one 

understood Blake?

 MR. FLEMING: Obviously, Justice Kagan, we 

don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake. 

But to answer the question, for purposes of the 

retroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in 

St. Cyr called "considerations of fair notice, 

reasonable reliance, and settled expectations." And we 

would submit that reliance was more than reasonable and 

expectations more than settled as to how the board was 

addressing crime of violence aggravated felony 

convictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence 

that I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the 

government itself was taking in these cases and the way 

that immigrants would have been advised by both criminal 

defense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for 

that matter, INS trial counsel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, reliance on confused 

law is certainly not reasonable reliance. I mean, if 

you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan 

operates from, how can you say that -- that you're 

reasonably relying on confused law?

 MR. FLEMING: I don't accept the premise at 

all, Justice Scalia -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a -­

MR. FLEMING: -- that the law was confused.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different point.

 MR. FLEMING: But even if -- even if there 

was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think 

there was, I think the record in this -- before the 

Court is very clear, that people were advised by 

competent counsel and that the government itself took 

the same position in front of the immigration courts and 

the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of 

violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief 

because that conviction would make him or her 

excludable. And the availability of relief in 

deportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it 

would be in exclusion proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand the 

advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable 

expectation of that's been altered?

 MR. FLEMING: The reasonable expectation 

that once someone pleads guilty, Mr. Chief Justice, to 

an excludable offense, one that would be waivable in 

exclusion proceedings, that a waiver may be sought in 

subsequent deportation proceedings on exactly the same 

basis. And that is -­

MR. FLEMING: -- a published policy of the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the 

expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent 

felony, that he expects, well, if I'm deported because 

of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary 

waiver?

 MR. FLEMING: Yes, that's quite correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. That's the ruling in St. Cyr, that 

when someone is -- when someone pleads guilty to an 

offense that is eligible for relief under section 

212(c), there is reliance on the possibility -- not a 

guarantee of a waiver, obviously -­

waivers granted?

 MR. FLEMING: Quite frequently, I think. 

The Court had pointed out in St. Cyr that they are 

frequent. And now, because the category of people who 

are eligible involves people who have very old

convictions, they necessarily pled before 1996, they are 

usually minor convictions, they involve people who have 

been in this country for a long time. They frequently 

have property. They have families. They're -- they can 

show rehabilitation. Often they only come to the 

attention of the immigration authorities by applying for 

naturalization or by renewing their green cards, and 

they get thrown into deportation on the basis of these 

old convictions that, at the time of the plea, would 

have been eligible for a waiver. And it is simply 

unfair to change the law, as Blake did, and impose that 

change on people who relied on it in pleading guilty.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in terms of the 

expectation interest, we have to visualize someone who 

is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea 

bargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's 

pleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get, 

all that, are dominant considerations. And he's also 

going to say: Well, I've been advised that I will be 

able to apply for a discretionary waiver. So, I'm going 

to plead guilty.

 That's a fairly unlikely scenario, isn't it?

 MR. FLEMING: On the contrary, 

Mr. Chief Justice. The Court in St. Cyr made very clear 

that's a very likely situation. It cited a couple of

cases at that time that specifically involved that 

colloquy. The NIJC amicus brief, which is before the 

Court in this case, identifies a couple of situations, 

including the case of Mr. Ronald Bennett, who was 

advised by his lawyer that when he pled guilty, it would 

not be a problem for him for his immigration status 

because he could seek 212(c) protection.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I'm not 

questioning the fact that he was advised, but presumably 

the lawyer will also advise him: Oh, and you also have 

to pay the $250, you know, restitution, whatever, fee.

 I am just questioning how significant that 

advice will be when someone's determining whether to 

plead guilty or not to a violent felony.

 MR. FLEMING: I -- I understand, 

Mr. Chief Justice. It is quite significant for people 

whose ability to stay in this country is highly 

important to them. They have family here. They've 

lived here for decades. But the risk that they're going 

to be -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the violent felony -­

the violent felony in this case, he had a suspended 

sentence, didn't he?

the waiver; isn't that right?

would not have been waivable in the exclusion 

proceedings, he would not be eligible. That's correct, 

Justice Alito -­

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that strange? 

Suppose you have somebody who's charged with a lesser 

offense that -- that doesn't involve moral turpitude and 

a greater offense that does, and the defense attorney 

comes to the client and says: I've got great news; the 

prosecutor will take a plea to the lesser offense and 

drop the greater one.

 I guess that would be -- that would be bad, 

potentially bad advice, because he ought to plead to the 

more serious offense because then he would be eligible 

for a waiver.

 MR. FLEMING: He would be eligible for a 

waiver under section 212(c), Justice Alito -­

MR. FLEMING: But that is not the only form 

of relief that someone who pleads guilty to a crime 

could potentially seek. And people who plead to 

non-inadmissible offenses, offenses that do not lead to 

their exclusion, had other avenues at the time that they 

could have pursued. For instance, they could have 

pursued adjustment of status. That's the -- the BIA's 

decision in Matter of Gabryelsky. In order to -- to 

adjust status, all that matters is that you not be 

inadmissible to the country. And even if you are 

inadmissible, you can seek a 212(c) waiver during that 

process. Whether you are deportable or not doesn't 

matter.

 So, there are many other ways. Looking at 

section 212(c) on its own, it might appear anomalous. 

But looking at the immigration law as it was before 

1996, there are other options.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- what you say 

even further reduces the significance of the 212(c) 

possibility of waiver to the person pleading guilty. 

You're saying -- you're saying, yes, even though -- even 

though you couldn't get it under 212(c), there are a lot 

of other ways you might have gotten it.

 MR. FLEMING: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 

Maybe I wasn't clear. The people who could get the

other relief are people who pled guilty to crimes that 

do not involve moral turpitude, which was Justice 

Alito's hypothetical. But people who plead to crimes 

involving moral turpitude potentially don't have that -­

that avenue open to them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -­

MR. FLEMING: For them, section 212(c) is 

very important, and they could rely on its availability, 

and did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but there's a large 

category of people who -- who plead guilty to crimes 

that do not involve moral turpitude and yet are not 

otherwise excludable under 212(c), right?

 MR. FLEMING: I don't know which category 

Your Honor is thinking of. But, certainly, you can 

plead guilty to a crime that does not involve moral 

turpitude; then you would not be eligible for section 

212(c) relief; but there might be some other way that 

you can -- that you can get at it.

 But that is not this category of people. 

The category of people at issue here are people who pled 

before 1996 to aggravated felony crimes of violence, 

almost all of which, if not all of which, are going to 

be crimes involving moral turpitude that are excludable 

and therefore eligible for a waiver. It doesn't

necessarily mean they'll get it; but it at least means 

they have the right to ask the Attorney General to 

exercise his discretion.

 And I would submit that, as this Court 

indicated in St. Cyr, the private interest in avoiding 

mandatory deportation is very strong. We have what I 

believe is a sudden and abrupt change in the law in 

Blake. And it could not have been foreseen; in fact, it 

wasn't foreseen by advocates on both sides of the "v" in 

these cases.

 The remaining question for purposes of the 

retroactivity analysis is only the strength of the 

agency's interest in applying the rule retroactively. 

I'd submit that that interest here is no stronger than 

it is in the ordinary mine run of cases, and in fact it 

is weaker, because all that we are talking about is the 

opportunity to submit an application for adjudication on 

the merits, which is subject to the discretion of the 

agency. Mr. Judulang would have the burden of 

convincing an immigration judge and the Board of 

Immigration Appeals that he deserves relief in the 

exercise of discretion. And so, under Chenery -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say a sharp 

change, I think that this is a very confusing set of 

decisions. And the Wadud case that was brought up

before has a footnote that says that -- that the board 

had stated a waiver of inadmissibility may be granted in 

deportation if the alien was excludable as a result of 

the same facts. And then that footnote ends: "We shall 

withdraw from that language in each of these cases."

 MR. FLEMING: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg, and the operative language there is "as a 

result of the same facts."

 What Wadud was arguing was that recognizing 

that his conviction would not make him excludable 

because it was not a crime involving moral turpitude, he 

said: Nonetheless, you should look to the facts of my 

conduct, because what I did was so turpitudinous that 

the government would surely have charged me as 

excludable.

 And the board said: We are not going to do 

that, and to the extent our prior decisions suggested 

that, we're withdrawing from that language.

 It did not say, however, that the board 

would not look to convictions to determine 

excludability. And, in fact, in Meza, which is after 

Wadud, it did just that. And when the Court came to 

crime of violence cases subsequently to that, the 

precedent that it relied on was Meza, which focuses on 

the conviction. I agree it does not focus on the facts,

but I don't think the language that Your Honor read 

undermines our position at all.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That is so bizarre it makes 

me -- that he's pleading to prove that what he did was 

really turpitudinous. It makes me think that maybe the 

en banc Ninth Circuit was right, that this whole line of 

cases has gone off along the wrong track quite a while 

ago.

 MR. FLEMING: So -- I mean, the notion that 

this form of relief is available in deportation 

proceedings is long settled.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, yes.

 MR. FLEMING: It's the premise of this 

Court's decision in St. Cyr. The agency has never 

undermined it or suggested that it was going to retreat 

from it. No party before this Court is suggesting that 

St. Cyr should have been overruled on that basis. So, I 

-- and I think it's very clear that Congress, after the 

relief had been extended to deportation proceedings, 

enacted provisions in 1990 and 1996 that would have no 

operative effect if relief was not available in 

deportation proceedings.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a lot -- a lot of 

the statutory changes in the policies of the INS date 

back -- was it the Second Circuit's case in Francis,

which talked about the equal protection component of the 

two classes comprised of those in exclusion proceedings 

and those in what were then called deportation 

proceedings?

 Do we just accept that? It -- it seems to 

me that that whole equal protection rationale is quite 

doubtful.

 MR. FLEMING: Well, there -- there are two 

responses to that, Justice Kennedy. The first is the 

agency has accepted that in Matter of Silva as a correct 

interpretation of the statute, and that has been on the 

books for 35 years now, approximately, and Congress has 

never suggested any disapproval of it. Rather, on the 

contrary, it has assumed that that is the law. And 

that's after the Solicitor General refused to seek 

certiorari of that decision. The comparison also was 

not between people in exclusion and people in 

deportation. It was between two -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, if we thought that 

they had gone down the wrong path originally, there's 

nothing we can do about it, and we just say we're in 

this wilderness and we can't get out?

Congress at this point has not only acquiesced but 

indicated its understanding of the -- of the way that

the agency has applied the law. And, honestly, I think 

this is a -- a question for the Government, because the 

agency has never suggested that there was any basis for 

retreating from that position at this late date.

 Unless the Court has further questions on 

retroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive 

position, which is that even without regard to 

retroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and 

capricious. And there are two basic reasons for that: 

First, that it rests on improper factors; and, second, 

that it leads to results that the BIA itself has 

disavowed.

 First of all, Congress has never suggested 

that the words that it chooses in deportation provisions 

are somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c) 

relief. And, yet, that is largely everything that the 

board relied on in Blake, was a comparison of the choice 

of words in deportation provisions to the choice of 

words in exclusion provisions. But the -- the 

provisions of the deportation statute are not some 

enigmatic code from which the BIA can discern section 

212(c) eligibility. They determine who's deportable, 

but they have nothing to say about who is eligible for 

section 212(c).

 Section 212(c) eligibility turns on whether

you are inadmissible. That's what 212(c) by its terms 

refers to. And that's driven home, I believe, by the 

addition of the "crime of violence" language in 1990 as 

a basis for deportation.

 Aggravated felonies were added in 1990 at a 

time when it's, I believe, clear that most of them, if 

not all of them, were already bases for exclusion. So, 

there was no need for Congress to say crimes of violence 

are excludable. They already were because they were 

crimes involving moral turpitude. It would have been 

redundant to put the same words in the exclusion 

statute. Congress didn't do it. Congress simply wanted 

to make clear that these people were now going to be 

deportable based on the length of their sentence.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

comparability of the crime involved in St. Cyr? That 

was a drug offense. Does the inadmissibility 

criterion -- does that accord with the one for 

deportation?

 MR. FLEMING: Yes, it does, Justice 

Ginsburg, and -- because Mr. St. Cyr would have been 

both deportable and excludable for his offense. That's 

the logic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- there the 

linguistic comparison works, right?

MR. FLEMING: Well, the board in Blake 

concluded that that was -- that the linguistic 

comparison worked there so that it did not have to find 

itself at odds with this Court's decision in St. Cyr. 

That's true. But when the Court -- when the 

board originally made that decision in Matter of Meza, 

they didn't just look to the linguistic comparison.

 I agree that if there's a perfect linguistic 

match, then you might not need to go to look at the 

conviction, because someone who falls under one will 

necessarily fall under the other. But just because 

Congress uses different words in the deportation 

subsection that's asserted against a particular alien 

doesn't mean that the analysis stops there, because the 

conviction might well make the person excludable such 

that the application that they're able to file in 

deportation proceedings should give them the same relief 

as they would have in exclusion proceedings.

 So, what happened in 1990 when "crime of 

violence" was added, according to the Government, is 

that that was a radical change in section 212(c) 

eligibility stealthily and silently, because of course 

while Congress was amending 212(c) at that time, saying 

it was no longer available to deportable aliens who 

didn't show up for certain hearings and no longer

had served more than 5 years in prison, it had said 

nothing suggesting that people who had committed 

aggravated felony crimes of violence were all of a 

sudden ineligible for section 212(c) relief, even though 

it could have said that. The notion that one can infer 

or decode those provisions as shutting out section 

212(c) relief for this group of people silently, even 

though the overlap is perfect if not near perfect, is, 

we would submit, simply unreasonable. The arbitrariness

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fleming, the Government 

says that it has an interest in treating people in 

deportation proceedings less favorably, if you will, 

than people in exclusion proceedings. Do you dispute 

that broad premise that the government could develop a 

system which treated those two groups differently?

 MR. FLEMING: That is not the way that the 

agency has ever treated permanent resident aliens. In 

fact, if that is the Government's position, that is 

clearly a change in the law. The BIA said going back to 

Silva, but in Matter of A-A-, a 1992 published decision, 

that it is the long -- the, quote, "long established 

view of the Attorney General and the Federal courts that

context of deportation proceedings is equivalent to one 

made at the time an alien physically seeks admission 

into the United States." That's footnote 22 of Matter 

of A-A-.

 So, the agency's longstanding position, at 

least since Silva, has been that there is no difference 

between an application filed in deportation and one 

filed in exclusion. And that I think is consistent with 

what Attorney General Thornburgh said in the Matter of 

Hernandez-Casillas.

 I'd submit one last point, which is the 

arbitrariness of what the BIA is doing shines through in 

that it has led to consequences that the BIA has itself 

repudiated as inconsistent with the statute. And the 

most salient example is the one that the Government 

admits on page 26 of its brief, which is that the -­

there's a possibility that someone could get a waiver of 

inadmissibility one day for a given conviction and then 

be deported the next day for the very same conviction.

 Now, the BIA in 1956 in Matter of G-A- said 

that was clearly repugnant. Now, the agency cannot have 

it both ways. The statute cannot mean X and not X. If 

it does, that is the hallmark of arbitrariness. The 

Government's only answer, as far as I know, is that it 

will exercise its prosecutorial discretion to avoid that

an arbitrary policy by saying that it is going to be 

enforced in a capricious way and that it will all 

balance out in the end.

 This Court should evaluate the Blake rule on 

its own merits, and if it is arbitrary, as it clearly 

is, it should be disapproved. The other indication of 

arbitrariness is that the Blake -- the Blake rule 

revives the distinction between deportable aliens, 

Justice Kennedy, who traveled abroad and returned and 

other deportable aliens who did not travel aboard and 

return.

the nunc pro tunc doctrine is not still good law. But 5

reaffirmed that in cases where the alien has left and 

come back, the Attorney General and the board have 

permitted the alien to raise any claim for discretionary 

relief that the alien could otherwise have raised had he 

been excluded. So, nunc pro tunc clearly is still good 

law, and the Government seemed to agree with that as 

recently as its brief in opposition to certiorari.

 As for the travel distinction itself the 

Government, to its credit, does not try to defend it, 

and with good reason. The agency in Silva has long held 

that there is no distinction or no rational way to 

distinguish under the statute between people who are in 

deportation proceedings who have left and come back and 

people in deportations who have not.

 Unless the Court has further questions, I'd

please the Court:

 Petitioner does not dispute that some 

comparability analysis must be applied to prevent relief 

under former section 212(c) from being extended to 

certain grounds of deportability. But his methodology 

of asking whether his offense could have made him 

excludable is inconsistent with established cases from 

the board that long predated the ones at issue here 

involving firearms offenses and visa fraud.

 Justice Scalia brought up the case in Wadud. 

That was a visa fraud case. It was a prosecution under 

18 U.S.C. 1546. That's a provision that penalizes 

fraudulent and other misuse of visas and other 

immigration documents. It's a very broad criminal 

provision. It's long been a ground of deportability. 

And at the time, the alien argued that this is fraud. 

It's a crime involving moral turpitude, and, therefore, 

I would be subject to exclusion. In Wadud, the board 

rejected that analysis.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but -- but it 

may save a little time at least if -- we're in an arcane 

area of the law, to me. It was created by Robert 

Jackson, Attorney General, and by Thornburgh, Attorney 

General. And if we're starting with that, what that 

says is we have a list over here of excludable things,

and we have a list of deportable things. And if you're 

deported for a reason that shows up on that first list, 

than the AG could waive it. That's basically the 

outline I have. And also I have, which isn't quite 

right, that in that first list there's something called 

-- big letters -- CIMT or something, crime of moral 

turpitude. And all the things on this second list, the 

big issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude?

 And, as I looked through the opinions, this 

is what I got out of them. And This is tentative. I 

got out, just as you say, there are two things in the 

second list which are not crimes of moral turpitude. 

They consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes. 

And there are special reasons for the first, and the 

second is debatable; but they've been consistent with 

that.

 Then there are things that are on both 

lists, they are a crime of moral turpitude. I counted 

at least eight cases saying, for example, rape, 

burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency 

with a child, and probably some others are all crimes of 

moral turpitude. So, it clicks in, okay?

 Then I find Blake, and Blake says sexual 

abuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude. 

That's a little surprising. But it gives us a reason:

Because -- and this was the problem here. It talks 

about there has to be substantial -- there has to be 

similar language in the two lists. I don't know where 

that one came from. It had certainly not been in the 

earlier cases.

 And now we have this case, which is 

voluntary manslaughter. I would have thought that 

voluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the 

lists that they said the things are crimes of moral 

turpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I 

had read the cases.

 So, where do I end up? Well, what I end up 

with this, and this is what I would like you to reply 

to. Justice Brandies once said something like we have 

to know before we can say whether an agency opinion is 

right or wrong, what they're talking about. I felt 

perplexity after I had read through these decisions. In 

other words, I don't understand it.

 So, I would like you to explain to me why 

this all fits together and how, if you can do that. 

couldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and 

I suspect it is not your fault.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I agree that the history 

and the law here is relatively complicated, and it has 

had a lot of moving pieces over the years. But I think

showed that residential burglary isn't a crime involving 

moral turpitude, and a crime of violence, in the

fall within "crime of moral turpitude."

concluded that as a categorical matter, firearms 

offenses aren't on the list of exclusion crimes; we

 The board applied that same reasoning again 

in a 1995 opinion, in Espinoza. We quote all of these 

opinions on page 41 of our brief.

 And so, in these two categories, firearms 

offenses and visa fraud offenses, both of which could 

often involve moral turpitude on an -- in any individual 

case -- that such offenses could involve moral 

turpitude, just like a crime of violence may well 

involve moral turpitude. And yet, the board concluded

turpitude. But we have cases that have said, 

generically, manslaughter, which involves violence, is a 

crime of moral turpitude. Others have qualified sexual 

abuse of a minor. I don't know of anyone who would

about. What we're talking about is crimes of violence. 

That's the category. And so -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Gannon, suppose 

this: Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this 

category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose on 

the deportation side, which I think is right, you have a 

category called crimes of violence, and you also have a 

category called crimes of moral turpitude. There's a 

time limit on that.

 MR. GANNON: We do have that category here. 

Right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: That's right. Suppose that 

you -- the government could have slotted manslaughter 

into either of those categories on the deportation side. 

And I understand that there's a dispute about whether it 

could have, but let's suppose it could have. So, if 

manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a 

crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the 

category on the exclusion side.

 But if the same crime is categorized in a 

different way by the government, then it does match on 

the exclusion side. So, what sense does that make? The 

government's decision about how to categorize a given 

offense on the deportation side is going to determine 

whether a person gets relief.

doctrine developed, Justice Kagan, is that it developed 

in the context where the board recognized that the

excludability, and it extended that to deportation cases

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what your position 

means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who 

makes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could 

have been categorized as deportable because he committed 

a crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been 

categorized as somebody who committed an aggravated 

felony. It is then totally in the hands of the person 

who is making the charge whether there will be a match 

or not.

 MR. GANNON: The reason why that's so is 

because the thing that is going to be waived at the end 

of the proceeding is the -- is the ground of 

deportation. And so, if the ground of deportation is 

for an aggravated felony crime of violence, then it 

needs to be one for which there's 212(c) eligibility. 

The same would be true if it were a firearms offense.

the firearms offense cases and the visa fraud offense 

cases, because those are all instances in which, 

depending on the circumstance of the offense and

is no comparable ground. And if -- if I could just make 

one point about this claim of Petitioner's in his reply 

brief, that he could have been subject to a charge of 

deportability on the basis of a crime involving moral 

turpitude, I would caution the Court against relying on 

that for two reasons, one factual and one legal.

 One is that there's no factual basis in the 

administrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip 

to the Philippines. We do have evidence from outside 

the record that makes us believe that it occurred, but 

the statute that provides for judicial review here of 

the order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A) 

specifically says that the determination needs to be 

made on the basis of the administrative record. And the 

only evidence in the record about that trip is actually 

a statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it 

occurred in 1989, the year after the crime.

 But even assuming that -- that the trip 

happened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the 

basis of evidence outside the record that it did occur 

-- there's a legal reason why I would caution the Court 

against assuming that that means the Petitioner could 

have been deportable for a crime involving moral 

turpitude, and that's the so-called Fleuti doctrine. 

Under this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti,

which is actually relevant to a case on which you 

granted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court 

concluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and 

innocent trip outside the country and returns to the 

United States, that will not trigger an entry upon his 

return to the United States.

 And so, I think it's very likely that under 

Ninth Circuit precedent, in 1989 when Petitioner was 

pleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he 

wouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing 

so within 5 years of when he committed -- when he 

entered the country for purposes of the statute.

JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back to second 

on this very interesting -- suppose I say, okay, I 

concede. I'd only do it for the sake of this question. 

You're absolutely right in your categorization. The 

right category is crime of violence. And then I look at 

the statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1101(43), which you 

probably know by heart, and I look at the definition of 

gun crimes, and I look at crime of violence.

 My non-schooled reaction is, well, gun 

crimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a 

crime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of 

registration requirements, there are all kinds of

different things that drug -- gun dealers have to do, 

and you could commit that crime in various ways that 

don't involve moral turpitude. I can understand that, 

sort of. At least, I could see how somebody else might 

have understood it that way.

 Now, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey, 

I am having trouble here. Why don't you try to list a 

few crimes of violence that when they come into the 

country you're going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of 

moral turpitude? And by the way, I am not asking you to

categories. List categories of crimes of violence that 

when the person comes in, you're going to say, hmm, no 

moral turpitude there.

JUSTICE BREYER: I overstate slightly, but

 MR. GANNON: I see your point, 

Justice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that 

predate the era that we're talking about here, they all 

-- almost all involve two categories of offenses, drug 

trafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes 

involving moral turpitude, things that were actually 

charged under the ground of deportation for crimes 

involving moral turpitude.

 And here, Congress added aggravated felonies 

to the deportation side of the ledger but didn't add it 

to the exclusion side of the ledger. And then it 

repeatedly expanded the definition of "aggravated 

felony" between 1988 and 1996 in ways that made these 

offenses treatable in different ways for purposes of 

deportation than they were for exclusion.

you're looking at. It doesn't matter, in your judgment. 

That -- that is your test.

 MR. GANNON: That's -- I disagree, Justice 

Sotomayor. If -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it qualifies as an 

aggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral 

turpitude.

 MR. GANNON: I disagree with that -- the 

fact that that's the category we're looking at.

 We're looking inside the definition of 

aggravated felony, to the particular ground which is 

crimes of violence. And then what we are saying is that 

the analysis needs to be done at a categorical level. 

And the board has said that you cannot get a 212(c) 

waiver from a ground of deportability unless that ground 

of deportability is substantially equivalent to a 

waivable ground of exclusion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go back to a 

concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.

manslaughter. And would an officer at the airport say

have protected somebody against a subsequent proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gannon, in your 

brief, I thought you'd conceded that.

 MR. GANNON: We -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- just the example 

that Justice Sotomayor gave. Somebody is declared 

inadmissible because it's a crime. This manslaughter or 

aggravated felony crime of violence is on the 

admissibility side a crime involving moral turpitude. 

So, he's allowed in. And then he's in and he's declared 

deportable, and he can't get a waiver because there's no 

analogue. I thought your brief said, yes, that's the 

consequence of our argument; however, prosecutors would 

not seek deportation if inadmissibility had been waived.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we -- the brief did say 

that this is hypothetically possible. I'm aware of -­

happened, and we don't have a board decision about what 

the effect of the earlier waiver would be on a

across and would prevent this alien from being

purpose would still be served by encouraging the alien 

to get himself into exclusion proceedings at the 

beginning, because that is what several courts have 

concluded would be a rational basis for differential 

treatment in encouraging aliens to seek 212(c) waivers

 Congress -- when it adopted the aggravated 

felony definition and repeatedly expanded it, it was 

concerned about criminal aliens in this country and ways 

to get them out of the country. And so, to the extent 

that 212(c) relief still is available for certain LPRs 

who meet certain threshold criteria and are being 

deported on the basis of crimes that would have made 

them inadmissible, if an alien then wants to seek 212(c)

previous state of the law. We believe that there were

categorical level. And my friend keeps quoting Attorney 

General Thornburgh's opinion in Hernandez-Casillas for

was comparable to section 1546." And so -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know potentially how 

many people may be affected by the decision in this 

case?

 MR. GANNON: I don't have a good estimate of 

that because we don't know how many offenders with 

pre-1996 guilty pleas will end up being picked up by 

immigration authorities and -- and charged under these 

circumstances. You know, Petitioner is somebody who, at 

-- at the time he committed his offense, wasn't even an 

aggravated felon. It's only by virtue of the 

retroactive applicability of the definition that he 

became an aggravated felon. And so, that makes the sort 

of St. Cyr question about his reliance a -- a bit 

perplexing here.

 At the time when he was pleading guilty to 

voluntary manslaughter, because it wasn't within 5 years 

of -- of entry, it wouldn't have been a crime involving 

moral turpitude, and, therefore, it wouldn't have been a 

ground for deportability. And it also was not yet an 

aggravated felony. So, he had no reason to think he was 

pleading guilty to a deportable offense at the time.

 MR. GANNON: I don't know how many times 

that -- all of the cases that are cited in Petitioner's 

brief and -- and the amicus brief, there's a gap between 

1996 and about 2003, because of the repeal of 212(c) and 

St. Cyr and the regulations. There was about a 7-month 

period after the regulations before the board decided 

Blake and Brieva-Perez.

 There are on the order of several hundred 

212(c) applications that are being granted by the board 

each year right now, but that's with a backlog of cases, 

some of which have been pending for -- for an incredibly 

long time.

proceeding, the statutory counterpart rule then would

country, come back, evaded an exclusion proceeding, and 

been put in a subsequent deportation proceeding, that 

the statutory counterpart rule wouldn't apply.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I would begin simply by following up on the 

questions that Justices Ginsburg and Kagan asked to my 

brother about whether my client could have been charged 

as deportable with his conviction treated as a crime 

involving moral turpitude. In fact, he was. If one 

looks at the decisions in the appendix to the petition 

for certiorari, specifically at page 11a, it's clear 

that his conviction is asserted not only as an 

aggravated felony crime of violence, but also as a crime 

involving moral turpitude, and the immigration judge 

found that he was in fact deportable with that 

conviction forming a crime involving moral turpitude.

 So, there's no dispute here that Mr. 

Judulang's conviction falls into both categories. On 

the issue of the factual basis of my client's

deportability at the time of the plea, Mr. Gannon is 

correct; there's nothing in the administrative record 

that says that, and that is why this Court typically 

does not countenance arguments based on the facts by the 

respondents that are raised only in the brief on the 

merits. If anyone had suggested that this was an issue 

on which a factual record needed to be developed, we 

could have done it; it would not have been hard.

 I also want to comment on one point that Mr. 

Gannon made, which is that the thing that -- that is 

waived under 212(c) is a ground of deportation. That's 

not correct. Section 212(c) provides relief from 

inadmissibility. It says that clearly in its text; that 

is how the regulations and the decisions have always 

treated it. The form that immigrants are instructed to 

fill out, Form I-191, which is appended to our blue 

brief, specifically says: State the reasons you may be 

inadmissible to the United States.

 If a waiver of inadmissibility is granted, 

that waiver protects the immigrant from subsequent 

deportation based on the same conviction. That is the 

language of Matter of G-A-, which the Government itself 

excerpts in its brief; and Justice Ginsburg is correct, 

that is -- they admit that a waiver is durable in that 

sense. If it is granted to waive inadmissibility, it

protects the alien from deportation on any deportation 

subsection based on that same conviction.

 I thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in 

reaction to your question which -- which was seeking an 

explanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer 

that counsel for the Government gave was that the BIA 

has been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases, 

but there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as 

it is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application 

of the law. I would submit for the reasons that Your 

Honor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -­

whether one calls them convictions or whether one calls 

them categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter, 

aggravated burglary -- recall that we're talking about 

aggravated felony crimes of violence.

 I recognize that if we talk about 

third-degree burglary, which could be charged on the 

basis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking 

across the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving 

moral turpitude, but it is probably not an aggravated 

felony crime of violence either, certainly not in this 

Court's decision in Leocal.

 So, I would submit that the Government has 

not identified a crime that would be both an aggravated 

felony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving

moral turpitude. The overlap is, I would submit, total. 

And even if it's not total, that is not the end of our 

argument because the board itself has said you, don't 

need a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap. 

And the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not 

complete.

 The crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez 

itself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law, 

has subsequently been held by the Fifth Circuit not to 

be an aggravated felony at all. So, Brieva-Perez on its 

own terms is no longer good law, as we point out in our 

reply brief.

 The interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one 

point about getting immigrants to put themselves into 

exclusion proceedings -- this is a very important point. 

The agency has never suggested that that is the way that 

it runs the railroad. On the contrary, it has expressly 

said the opposite.

 It does not matter whether the 212(c) 

application is filed in exclusion proceedings, in 

deportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings 

entirely by sending a letter to the district director 

saying: Please give me an advance waiver before I 

travel abroad.

 The regulations make very clear and the

decisions make very clear -- I quoted Matter of A-A- in 

my opening argument -- that an application is identical 

and the relief that is given is identical, regardless of 

the proceedings.

 For Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the 

agency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that 

applications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and 

applications filed in deportation proceedings are 

meaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is 

unfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang 

and others who relied on the availability of section 

212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or 

deportation in the future, when they pled guilty.

 Justice Sotomayor, your question about how 

many people are involved here, it is difficult to 

identify specific numbers because very often these cases 

are decided at the immigration judge level that are not 

reported. In the appendix to our petition for 

certiorari, we identified over 160 people who have been 

subject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since 

Blake was decided in 2005.

 And part of the problem is that we are 

talking about a group of people who have been in the 

country for a long time, whose convictions are dated, 

who are law-abiding, who are reformed, and may only come

perfectly law-abiding conduct such as applying for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If they weren't 

law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that 

would render them inadmissible and -­

MR. FLEMING: That would potentially -­

potentially subject them to removal, exactly. Now -­

and there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon 

mentioned. But -- that's certainly right. But a good 

number of the people here who have been harmed by the 

Blake rule are people who are the most deserving 

candidates for relief. And the NIJC brief, I think, 

sets that out I think quite convincingly.

 We would submit that the only reasonable 

approach here is the one that the agency took for years 

under Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice 

Breyer referenced, where the immigration judges knew the 

rule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction, 

they figured out whether the conviction would trigger 

excludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to 

apply on the same basis and with the same effect as if 

he had found himself in exclusion proceedings.

 The judgment should be reversed, and Mr. 

Judulang should be entitled to file his application for
