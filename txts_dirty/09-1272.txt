 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-1272, Kentucky v. King.

 Mr. Farley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FARLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The issue before you today, of whether or 

not police can impermissibly create exigent 

circumstances, arises from the improper suppression of 

reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable 

warrantless entry. The test set forth by the Kentucky 

Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first 

of which is that this Court has routinely held that the 

subjective intent of police officers when effecting a 

warrantless entry is irrelevant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where 

did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky 

Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective 

state of mind on the part of the police?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, the Kentucky Supreme 

Court's first prong of their test -- and I believe it's 

in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry.

Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries 

over to 46a. The first question of their test is 

whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an 

attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That didn't -- that 

didn't apply in this case?

 MR. FARLEY: That is correct.

 The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme 

Court's test is whether or not the actions of the 

Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home 

would have been foreseeable by the police officers 

before they knocked and announced their presence.

 Now, the problem with the foreseeability 

test -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is -- why is that 

subjective? Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable 

to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -­

it isn't directly a subjective inquiry. However, police 

officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal 

activity so that they may carry out the duties of their 

job in protecting the citizens. So under a 

foreseeability test, a reasonable officer will always 

foresee illegal activity in response to his actions, be 

it walking down the street or knocking on your door. A

reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity, 

and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test 

is completely unworkable.

 Several of the other circuits and the lower 

courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an 

extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent 

circumstances exception that narrows the use of that 

exception by police officers. The test that the 

Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.

 Now, under this test, as long as an officer 

behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of 

evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you have an 

apartment building where the police know from experience 

there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug 

transactions. Every 2 weeks, they walk through and 

knock on every door and wait for evidence of the 

destruction of -- of drugs. Is that all right?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, there's -- I would say 

"yes," if there's probable cause as well as exigent 

circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the probable 

cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know, 

flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind 

the door.

MR. FARLEY: Well, I would assert that there 

are -- there are two separate issues here. You must 

have probable cause separate from the existence of 

exigent circumstances. In this case, there was probable 

cause due to the smell of marijuana.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They go to the apartment 

building, and they sniff at every door, and when they 

sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from 

the door, then they go through this routine, but they do 

it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a 

routine matter. They don't just knock on every door, 

but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, 

and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings 

where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being 

stashed.

 MR. FARLEY: Justice Ginsburg, under a 

simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not 

violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency 

arising, there would be no need to suppress any 

evidence. That would be perfectly fine for the officers 

to do that. It may not be the most -­

when he said -- and I think this was the Solicitor 

General's position -- that the police can routinely

exists, because -­

have -­

coupled with exigent circumstances.

causing me some confusion. I understand their 

requirement of probable cause, and that they hear sound 

of evidence being destroyed and therefore enter. Is 

that -- or are you talking about the probable cause to

MR. FARLEY: Well, the smell of marijuana 

would give probable cause to obtain a search warrant. 

Once he knocks on the door and hears noises consistent 

with the destruction of physical evidence, then an 

exigency has arised. Now the officer has both probable 

cause and an exigent circumstance. And under the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But I don't understand why 

the smell of marijuana is necessary. This goes back to 

what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need 

probable cause to knock on a door. Knocking on a door 

is perfectly lawful. So, if there's just a lawfulness 

test, the knock is fine. And then when you hear 

whatever it is that you hear that you think creates 

exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or 

whether it's just noise, that, too, gives you the 

ability to go right in.

 So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't 

need the marijuana smell even, do you?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, I think -- I think we're 

confused. In order to enter with exigent circumstances, 

you must also have separate probable cause, and it's 

that you could have gotten -­

could very well be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you have to suspect 

that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is 

trying to get rid of evidence. And in order for that to 

be the case, you have to have smelled the marijuana?

 MR. FARLEY: Yes, Justice Scalia, you're 

absolutely correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's only one 

probable cause, right?

 MR. FARLEY: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. FARLEY: Yes. The exigent circumstances 

is a reasonable belief based upon the totality of the 

surrounding circumstances. Here, given that the 

officers had a reasonable belief that they were chasing 

a fleeing felon, they had a reasonable belief that this 

was the doorway he had entered, then you couple that

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May we just go back 

over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far 

as I understand from this record, it was never shown 

that the dealer that the police were following was aware 

that he was following and that he was fleeing from them. 

This is the -- it's not part of the question you 

presented, because we granted only on the exigent 

circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the 

dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even 

know that the police were following you?

 MR. FARLEY: That -- that's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. However -- and we cannot divorce the 

officers' chase of this suspect, regardless of whether 

he knew of their hot pursuit or not, we cannot divorce 

those facts from what the officers knew when they 

knocked on the door.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, you can. 

There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and 

knocking on somebody's door. And if as a police officer 

you say I smell marijuana, and then you hear the 

flushing, then there's probable cause. You don't need

any business about the dealer and the breezeway and all 

that at all.

 MR. FARLEY: Certainly. Certainly, Mr. 

Chief Justice. You're absolutely correct. I was -- I 

was just speaking in terms of this case, saying that 

there were -- there was ample evidence that exigent 

circumstances existed here, coupled with the probable 

cause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in your view -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a question that 

goes back to what you said? You have clarified very 

nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that 

there's something wrong going on in the -- the 

apartment. And you said that is, at that point when 

they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the 

door, at that point the police could go and get a 

warrant. Then they don't have to, because then they 

knock on the door.

 We start out with a strong presumption that 

the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong 

preference for getting the warrant. So why in this 

situation wouldn't the first response of the police 

be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they 

alert the people in there: Let's get a warrant; we'll

 MR. FARLEY: Well, the officers testified 

under these circumstances that they believed that they 

were in hot pursuit of this felon. So at the time they 

were at the door, they believed he had entered this 

apartment and was aware of their presence and was 

destroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so 

this is a fluid, evolving -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how does this 

-- how does this holding by us not become a simple 

warrantless entry in any drug case? Meaning: Police 

knock on the door, suspect doesn't answer it, gets up 

and moves to their bedroom. Because there's no noise 

that was described by this police officer. It was 

simply not answering the door and moving. So if that's 

all it takes, any police officer will come in and say: 

In my experience, most drug dealers destroy the evidence 

when we knock.

 MR. FARLEY: Well -­

you. I think that when determining whether an exigent 

circumstance exists, you look at the totality of the 

circumstances. So -- and there would be a myriad of 

cases in which a court would determine that, simply 

based upon the testimony or the noises that were heard, 

with no surrounding circumstances, that exigent 

circumstances may not have existed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the 

defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but 

had answered the door and said "Yes?"?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the policemen have 

been able to do anything just because they had smelled 

marijuana?

 MR. FARLEY: They could have sought a 

consensual encounter with the occupant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but they'd say: 

Oh, heck, no, you can't come in -­

MR. FARLEY: Well, then -­

to inform an occupant of a right to denial. However, 

the officers could not have forced their way into the 

home. That would have made this a case like Johnson.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the officers had 

simply knocked, said "We're going to kick the door in if 

you don't open it"?

under a lawfulness test, unless the occupant of the home 

submits to that show of authority and comes to the door 

and allows entry. Now, if that -­

However, I know this Court in Johnson stated that the 

smell of burning opium was not the destruction of 

evidence, and the only thing they could have obtained 

would have been the fumes or the vapors. I tend to

occurred here. What occurred in Johnson was the

yourself under arrest.

marijuana or opium or something?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe they heard 

sounds when they knocked on the door. But she actually 

came to the door, and then the officers forced entry. 

Here we don't have that. We have no forced entry.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- does a 

ruling in this case that any lawful conduct by the 

police mean that the police knock, somebody gets up on 

the other side and walks through a closed door, and 

closes a door in the back, and police say, "In my 

experience it's -- it's consistent with the destruction 

of property that drug dealers will go into a closed room 

to get rid of it" -- is that enough?

Sotomayor. I think that in any case -­

door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the

behavior, isn't it?

might also ignore whoever is at the door. Both of those 

options are fine.

experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is 

somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?

 MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I -- I guess that a 

person is entitled to do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't recall it ever 

happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow 

and people open the door.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. O'CONNELL: I mean, I think that that -­

that's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when 

the police officers knock at their door. And, 

certainly, in this case -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: They could say "Go away." 

They could do a lot of stuff. But walk in the other 

room and shut the door?

 MS. O'CONNELL: That's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Strange.

 MS. O'CONNELL: I guess some people might do 

that if they don't want to give consent to police entry. 

I think that in order to go in, based on an exigent 

circumstance, the police would have to be able to 

articulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably 

believed that there was destruction of evidence 

occurring inside.

Because it was kind of vague. They heard movement. 

What kind -- what kind of movement? It didn't -- it 

said nothing about a toilet flushing -­

MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, it's our 

position that the Court should assume that there was an 

exigency in this case.

 In the Respondent's brief in opposition, he 

argued that there was insufficient evidence of exigency. 

The Court nonetheless granted cert on the question of 

whether a police-created exigency would be okay under 

the Fourth Amendment. The Solicitor General believes 

that the Court should assume there was an exigency, and 

if it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and 

then reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme 

Court for a determination of whether an exigency 

existed.

 The trial court in this case certainly found 

that the movement inside of the apartment was enough for 

the officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside 

was destroying evidence. The Kentucky Supreme Court 

assumed that that was so in order to reach the question 

presented in this case that the Court granted cert on.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, if I could

lawful, that's sufficient. And each step would -- the 

way the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're 

asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.

 What some courts have done, in addition to 

that -- and this was not the approach of the court 

below -- but what some courts have done is to say we 

also ask a more holistic reasonableness question. We 

say: Is the whole process by which the police operated 

with respect to this person reasonable? So, for 

example, we might say, you know, was there time to get a 

warrant, or did it look like the police were just -­

they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?

 So what's wrong with that sort of standard? 

In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable, 

to say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the 

police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?

 MS. O'CONNELL: I think the problem with 

that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have 

options of how they can conduct searches and seizures. 

Getting a warrant is one way that they could do that. 

Getting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is 

another way. There's no justification in this Court's 

precedents for requiring police officers to choose one 

of those options over another if both options are 

lawful.

 In this case, the police officers knocked on 

the door, not sure which apartment the person that they 

were pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether 

that was the correct apartment. There's no reason why 

they needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door 

and seeking cooperation of the people inside.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your position that 

the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the 

purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?

 MS. O'CONNELL: Yes, I think that under this 

Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth 

Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no 

violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay. The 

police officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the question 

presented in the blue brief used the word 

"impermissible," and we're talking about "unlawful." I 

take it that there is a difference in those -- or no 

difference?

 MS. O'CONNELL: Well, yes, there is a 

difference. I think that that comes up in Respondent's 

argument that if there was an impermissible demand for 

entry -- for example, if the police officer said "I have 

a warrant, let me in," even though he didn't, as in 

Bumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be

JUSTICE BREYER: What are the objections to

searches that are conducted without any individualized 

suspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of 

a Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the

determined bad faith?

JUSTICE BREYER: My point is a solely 

unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are circuits

Circuit uses only the word "unlawful," and I thought we

going to have to leave and get a warrant. I think 

that's enough of a deterrent.

 The odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with 

Officer Cobb's cursory and equivocal testimony about the 

sounds of movement he couldn't discern exactly and that 

his training and experience led him only possibly to 

conclude was consistent with the destruction of 

evidence, is insufficient to establish exigent 

circumstances.

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're describing 

what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and 

the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that 

that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, 

according to the other side, correct the State court's 

error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create 

exigent circumstances.

 So I -- I don't know that it's terribly 

relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard 

was. That will be relevant depending, or not -­

depending on what our opinion says.

 MS. DRAKE: It's relevant because it goes to 

whether exigent circumstances existed. And as to the 

question of whether a remand would be appropriate in

this case, the question of whether exigent circumstances 

existed is logically antecedent in any created exigency 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's -- it's not 

at all. The court said: I don't care whether exigent 

circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent 

circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.

 The legal standard is antecedent to the 

application of the facts.

 MS. DRAKE: There's no point in delving into 

whether an exigency was created by the police if there 

is no exigency to begin with.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think the 

Court is interested in taking the case on the question 

whether or not the police may create exigent 

circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to 

enter. Now, whether or not there were exigent 

circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it 

seems to me, a subsidiary question.

 MS. DRAKE: The other problem with remanding 

this case for further determination on this issue is, as 

this Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case 

is troubling. The case has already been dismissed. 

There is no potential for further proceedings here.

It was dismissed because the State supreme court held 

you can't bring this evidence in. If we say, oh, yes, 

you can, then the issue becomes live again.

 MS. DRAKE: That conclusion is dependent on 

the notion that an indictment is merged with the 

judgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's 

favor in this case would vacate the decision of the 

Kentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the 

underlying suppression order. But there is no authority

not involve a simple knock at the door, and -- and the 

distinction is important. In this case, at 9:50 p.m., 

the officers banged on the door as loudly as they could.

those findings? I know that you said it in your brief,

they knocked loudly.

appendix to the petition in the bottom of page 3a 

carrying on to 4a. The trial court found: Detective 

Maynard, who was accompanying Officer Cobb in the 

breezeway attempting to locate and arrest the suspect in 

question, banged on the door of the apartment on the 

back left of the breezeway, identifying themselves as 

police officers and demanding that the door be opened by 

persons inside.

 Officer Cobb testified at the suppression 

hearing -- and this is at page 22 of the joint appendix: 

Detective Maynard made contact with the door, announced 

our presence, banged on the door as loud as we could, 

announced "Police, police, police."

unlawful in the sense that it violates any provision of 

the penal code. But this is a Fourth Amendment case, so 

the question is whether it's reasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Drake, the problem I 

have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law 

enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going 

for it is that criminals are stupid.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we had a case some 

years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington 

police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south 

and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we 

look in your luggage? And the -- the -- the mules who 

were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh, 

of course. Just to show that they had nothing to fear. 

And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected 

in that fashion.

 We didn't say that's not fair because you're 

taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -­

these poor criminals. We said that's perfectly okay. 

And it seems to me the same thing is going on here.

 They didn't do that. But everything done 

was perfectly lawful. It's unfair to the criminal? Is 

that -- is that the problem? I really don't understand 

the problem.

 MS. DRAKE: I have two responses to Your 

Honor's question. The first is that -- and along with 

this notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why 

we get all these criminal cases, there is no difference 

between what happened in this case and how an innocent 

person would respond.

that, after banging, he heard movement. Any innocent 

person at 10:00 at night would have to move in order -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this? It 

might -- it might make a difference to me whether the 

police demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged 

exigent circumstances arose. And the only testimony on 

this point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of 

the appendix, when police banged on the door as loud as 

they could and announced "Police, police, police," and 

then Detective Maynard banged on the door and said "This 

is the police."

 MS. DRAKE: The portion of the Joint 

Appendix that I quoted to the Court -- we explained to 

them we were going to make entry -- appears on page 24.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Right.

JUSTICE ALITO: It starts -- it says: We 

knew that there was possibly something that was going to 

be destroyed inside the apartment. At that point 

Detective Maynard -- this is after they heard the 

sounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.

 MS. DRAKE: Yes. Officer Cobb's testimony 

suggests that the demand came after they heard the sound 

of movement. The finding by the trial court, however, 

is that this was all happening simultaneously and in 

very quick fashion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any -- is there any 

evidence of that? Did anybody else testify to what 

happened?

not dispositive. The demand removes any doubt that the 

officers were not seeking a consensual encounter, but 

you still have the behavior of banging on the door.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does it -- does it 

turn on how loudly they knocked? If they just knock on 

the door and say "This is the police," is -- is that -­

is there anything wrong with that?

 MS. DRAKE: It -- it depends entirely on 

whether a reasonable person would interpret that 

behavior as the officer conveying the impression that 

entry was imminent and inevitable. And this feeds back 

to Justice Scalia's question, which is, well, what -­

what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?

 JUSTICE ALITO: What was there here to make 

a reasonable person believe that -- that entry was 

imminent and inevitable, if -- if all that's done is a 

knock on the door and they say "Police, police, police, 

this is the police"? Maybe it turns on how loudly they 

spoke or how loudly they -- they knocked; is that the 

point?

 MS. DRAKE: That is the point. Those are 

all relevant criteria because, in every Fourth Amendment 

case, we're considering the totality of the 

circumstances.

you're trying to change the case. I mean, this is not a 

case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry. 

My understanding is that the issue in the case is 

whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then 

base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based 

on what they hear from behind the door.

 Now, I know you think that they -- whatever 

they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is 

whenever they knock on the door, "Police" or "Can we 

come in" or whatever, and then they hear that, the 

activity behind the door, they have reason and can -­

can enter.

 Now, what you're -- it seems to me what 

you're arguing is, well, they did something else. They 

banged on the door, they yelled "Police"; it wasn't 

simply knocking on the door and seeking entry. And you 

may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me 

that's for -- for later on.

 I want to know what your position is on 

whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and 

say "Can we come in" or knock and say "Police" -- no 

demand to get in.

question, the officers are engaging in what we would 

call a true "knock and talk." They're seeking --

they're on -- the scenario is such that no one would 

doubt they're attempting a consensual encounter.

 Our position is because that behavior is 

reasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that 

evidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not 

be the remedy. Well, then, here -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you agree 

that -- that the court below is wrong because what they 

say, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the 

police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that 

their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I 

would think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock 

on the door very politely and say "The police," that 

somebody might shout out "Hide the pot"; all right?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: That if that's reasonable 

foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the 

Fourth Amendment. But we have the Second Circuit that 

says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it -­

lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth 

Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some 

kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper 

test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that 

yet have some different kind of test.

Chief Justice said, that assuming from your point of 

view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would 

like your view on which of those tests or some other 

test is the appropriate test and why. That was the 

question he started with and Justice Kennedy started 

with, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.

 MS. DRAKE: The appropriate test is the test 

that we propose. Under our test, the police act 

unreasonably when they convey the impression to an -- to 

a reasonable person that entry is imminent and 

inevitable. Our test follows directly from the Fourth 

Amendment requirement that people in their homes deserve 

precision.

 By conveying the impression that entry is 

imminent and inevitable, the police are -- and they 

don't have judicial authority for doing that -- there -­

there's no warrant -- they are engaging in behavior that 

would confuse an ordinary citizen and make him or her 

uncertain about whether the assertion of right to

 MS. DRAKE: And to the extent that "lawful" 

is defined as a synonym for "unreasonable" and to the 

extent that there does not need to be a completed 

antecedent Fourth Amendment violation, we would agree. 

There is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and 

I, and it is on the issue of this "knock and talk." Of 

course, police officers need to have the investigative 

tool of a knock and talk. There's nothing wrong with an 

officer attempting to gain consensual entry. And our 

position is that that's not made unreasonable by factors 

outside the officer's control, no matter how 

foreseeable.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So what took this outside of 

the category of the ordinary knock and talk?

 MS. DRAKE: This is not a knock and a -­

knock and talk case; this is a knock and announce case 

or a knock and demand case, which is how the trial court 

characterized it. And the staff -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't know about the 

labels, but what did they -- what did the police do that 

went beyond what would be permitted under your 

understanding of a pure knock and talk? It's -- it's

have considerable support on the Court for the 

proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created 

by unlawful activity by the police, which would include

but I thought the case we had before us is what if the 

police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and 

they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they 

smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion 

inside, does that justify their going in?

 And that's what I thought we took the case 

for, and that's a different question. You're trying to 

-- you're trying to make the police officers' actions 

unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions 

were unlawful you have a different case, and probably 

the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't

too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door. 

The opinion below says if they created the exigent 

circumstances, whether they did so lawfully or 

unlawfully, they cannot go in. And that's, that's the 

issue.

 MS. DRAKE: What the officers did in this 

case is the functional equivalent of saying "We're going 

to kick in the door." Now, I wouldn't go that -- that 

far, but it -- it's the functional equivalent of a knock 

and announce, which is exactly the behavior the police 

engage in when they are executing a warrant. And it is 

that behavior that conveys the impression that an 

occupant has no authority to keep the officers at arm's 

length.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't the basis for 

the decision below, though. The court below didn't say 

these police officers were behaving as though they had a 

warrant and were about to kick in the door. The opinion 

below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances, 

but they were the result of the police knocking on the 

door and saying "We're the police."

court did not analyze the problem in this fashion, did 

not analyze the question in this fashion, but it's a 

legal question that calls for an examination of how a

or not.

"Police," that that would be coercive? That's how I'm

bust it"?

possible. This is -- this not the normal knock that an

quietly on the door and says "We're the police. Can we

then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable 

police officer that evidence is being destroyed. At

you're using there, the key word is "unreasonable."

 MS. DRAKE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the reason you 

choose the word "unreasonable" rather than the Second 

Circuit's test of "unlawful" is?

 MS. DRAKE: Because, frankly, I'm not sure 

what that means, and I think that's become clear in the 

context of this briefing. Does "unlawful" mean the 

police have had to violate a portion of the penal code?

it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst 

into a home?

 MS. DRAKE: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why do you need 

unreasonable? If, indeed, there -- there was a threat 

of imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if 

that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.

 MS. DRAKE: Yes, and that's why my answer to 

Justice Kagan's question was to the extent that 

"unlawful" and "unreasonable" are synonyms, we would 

agree.

 Now, if the Court is not terribly -- does 

not find our test convincing, the next-best test, we 

believe, is a foreseeability test.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your test is something 

novel? I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are 

some five tests in the different circuits, and the 

foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme 

Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with 

the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?

other circuits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But your test is -- I mean, 

it's not wild. It just says it says "unreasonable" in 

the Fourth Amendment. Probably when they act lawfully, 

they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it 

could be sometimes they're not. That's your view?

 MS. DRAKE: That's correct, and by the 

way -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No test. All right.

 MS. DRAKE: -- we're not saying that -­

we're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as 

though they have a warrant when they don't have one, 

which is exactly what they did in this case. And that 

proposition is not new. In Bumper, this Court made 

clear that if the police act as though they have a 

warrant when they don't have one, any consent would be 

coerced.

 So reviewing courts are already making these 

determinations about how loud was the knock and how 

aggressive was the demand, simply in another context. 

And by the other -- on the other hand, police officers 

are already receiving the same instruction that they 

would need in order to apply our rule, which is, don't 

act as though you have a warrant. Don't engage in the 

functional equivalent of a knock and announce if you do

not have prior judicial authority.

 And what is appealing about our test, unlike 

the foreseeability test, which we believe it's a 

refinement of, is it allows for conduct by the police 

that's reasonable at its inception to remain reasonable 

regardless of the suspect's response, no matter how 

foreseeable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is 

an example of conduct that you would consider 

unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence 

that would not be unlawful?

very hard to conceive of where the daylight would be -­

 MS. DRAKE: -- between those terms, 

"reasonable" and "unlawful," so long as "unlawful" 

doesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so 

long as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is 

suggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant 

would have to first demonstrate that the police were 

seized in order to be able to convincingly argue that 

the search was unreasonable.

decision below, which simply said if the exigent 

circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police 

action, whatever the police action was -- lawful,

case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person 

would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law 

and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision 

of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo 

anyway. In that regard, it's no different than any 

other case that makes its way to this Court where this 

Court is asked to review the record, make a 

determination of how an ordinary person would interpret

and then that movement is used as evidence that exigent

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FARLEY: My time is short, so I would 

just like to make a few quick points.

 I believe Mr. Chief Justice and Justice 

Kennedy were absolutely, absolutely correct. The 

question before this Court is: Can lawful police action 

impermissibly create exigent circumstances? And the 

answer to that question is no.

 There is never a circumstance in which 

lawful police behavior under a Fourth Amendment analysis 

can impermissibly create an exigency. I would point the 

Court to Hodari D., which I believe Justice Scalia wrote 

for the Court, that we should not punish police officers 

for attempted Fourth Amendment violations or Fourth

Amendment violations that do not reach fruition, because 

it does not serve the point of the exclusionary rule.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farley, one of the 

points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when 

people search your home, they have a warrant. And, of 

course, there are exceptions to that. But if there is 

one place where the warrant requirement has real force, 

it's in the home.

 And I think that the concern here -- and you 

have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern 

here is that your test is going to enable the police to 

penetrate the home, to search the home, without a 

warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very 

wide variety of cases, that all the police really have 

to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise. Or: We think 

there was some criminal activity going on for whatever 

reason, and we heard noise.

 How do you prevent that from happening? How 

do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating 

the warrant requirement in the context of the one place 

that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, Justice Kagan, I would 

disagree with you. I don't think that it would. 

believe that what the Commonwealth is asking for is no 

more or no less than reviewing courts have done for

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's perfectly okay for 

officers to do that? To pretend that they have a 

warrant and "Open the door or we'll kick it in" -­

that's perfectly okay?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, I believe that there are 

-- there are large restrictions and prohibitions to 

that, that officers are well aware of, because if the 

person does answer the door, the officers know, well, 

everything is going to be suppressed. Or if the 

officers do -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But why? You say that what 

they've done is not unlawful. Why would it be 

suppressed?

 MR. FARLEY: Well, if they demand entry and 

entry is given, that is then a Fourth Amendment 

violation, because they've demanded entry without a 

warrant. And in that case, suppression -- once they 

have entry, the evidence would be suppressed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they can't gain 

entry by deception. They can't knock on the door and 

say "Pizza"; right?

 (Laughter.)

MR. FARLEY: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no? Okay.

 MR. FARLEY: We would just assert that under 

the lawfulness test, we aren't asking for anything more 

or less than this Court has done or other reviewing 

courts have done for generations, and this is a simple 

Fourth Amendment analysis.

 There was no demand in this case. This was 

a simple knock-and-announce case, regardless of the time 

of day. There was no coercion. There was no seizure. 

There was no consent given. Officers should not be held 

accountable for unlawful reactions by suspects.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 You will have noticed that Justice Kennedy 

left the bench a few minutes early. He is going to 

Tucson to represent the Court as the Circuit Justice for 

the Ninth Circuit at the memorial service there. He 

will review the tapes and transcripts of the rest of the 

argument and fully participate in the decision.

 This case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
