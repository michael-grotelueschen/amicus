 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Philip Morris v. Williams. 

Mr. Frey.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FREY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: This case is here following this 

Court's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their 

decision in light of State Farm, a task at which we 

submit the Oregon courts completely failed. It presents 

two independent but thematically interrelated issues, 

both of which implicate what the Court said in State 

Farm, which is that, and I quote, "courts must ensure 

that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and 

proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and 

to the general damages recovered."

 Now significantly, Respondent defends 

neither -- oh, I should stop for a minute and describe 

the issues. So the first issue is whether the Oregon 

Supreme Court properly held that Philip Morris was 

correctly denied an instruction which would have told 

the jury that it was not to punish for harm to 

nonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court held that that

instruction was legally incorrect, it was proper for the 

jury to punish for harm to nonparties, and therefore the 

instruction was correctly denied.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frey, are you talking 

about what is numbered, is it number 34?

 MR. FREY: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the --

MR. FREY: Yes. The key paragraph from 

number 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as 

well as numerous other places in the materials. It 

says, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable 

relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the 

defendant's punishable misconduct. Although you may 

consider the extent of harm suffered by others in 

determining what that reasonable relationship is, you're 

not to punish the defendant for the impact of its 

alleged misconduct of other persons who may bring 

lawsuits of their own, etc.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't think that 

would confuse the jury if they are first told that they 

may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and 

then the next instruction seems to say they can't?

 MR. FREY: I don't. First of all, I don't 

think that's what it says, and I don't think it would 

confuse the jury, and I'm confident that with that

instruction, counsel could explain it. But let me stop 

here, because I know this was something that Justice 

Scalia expressed some uncertainty about in the State 

Farm argument, and that the Oregon Supreme Court said 

they didn't clearly understand.

 To consider the conduct means to evaluate it 

in connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the 

conduct being punished.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the problem? If 

the instruction had said that, you would have a very 

different instruction, and I'm bothered by the 

instruction too for just that reason. It says you may 

consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, 

I would say, "why? You've just told me I'm not supposed 

to punish them."

 MR. FREY: Well, the second part of it is, 

what punishment means is what would be done in a class 

action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the 

harm suffered by Oregon smokers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. This is an argument

 you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror 

is supposed to figure this out.

 MR. FREY: Well, let me say a couple of 

things about that. First of all, the Oregon Supreme 

Court did not rely on this aspect. It held that it was

proper to punish for harm to nonparties. Now this, in 

our view, this instruction, and there's always a danger 

when you add words to an instruction that you will add 

something that a court will find was incorrect and 

therefore deny the instruction, even though the essence 

of it was correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the Oregon 

Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to 

nonparties? Your brief quotes something to that effect, 

but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to 

the petition. It says, what the Oregon court said is, 

Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State 

acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages 

to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties. The 

Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it 

in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to 

exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly 

disease.

 MR. FREY: Well, I would refer the Court to 

pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court 

discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point. And 

it says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from 

punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged 

conduct on other persons even if those persons were 

Oregonians who were harmed. But on 28(a) it says,

because the proposed jury did not accurately reflect 

the law, this is not a statement about Philip Morris's 

position, the trial court did not commit reversible 

error when it refused to give it. So I think the court 

was quite clear in saying -- let me complete my answer, 

because I think considering it moves the needle along 

the scale of allowable punishment for the harm to Jesse 

Williams, but it does not abandon the principle of 

proportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it 

is what you would do in a class action. You would 

punish for all the harms to all the Oregonians. This is 

a one-way class action in which Philip Morris was 

exposed to global punishment by the jury without any of 

the protections of a class action. So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me -- let me 

focus the problem that I have right now this way. If 

I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and 

particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, 

I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the 

opinion. I read them the same, just what you claimed 

they were saying. The difficulty that I have is because 

I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of 

your client was not a clear instruction, I have great 

difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error 

to refuse to give the instruction.

MR. FREY: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So my problem is, if I 

think they really did have the wrong view of the law but 

the issue was focused at the trial court by a request 

for an instruction which I think was properly denied, 

what do I do? Do I concentrate on what they said in the 

opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the 

deficiency of the instruction?

 MR. FREY: Well, I think what you do is 

decide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they 

were correct in the legal proposition that they 

asserted.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But then they would 

respond, when they made that, when they gave that 

explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were 

responding to a claim of error which was focused and 

raised at the trial level by the request for an 

instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound 

instruction, an unsound request.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess we could 

leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the 

instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they 

disallowed it for the reason that you say.

 MR. FREY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we can say that is

error and remand it to them. That might not make you 

very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not 

MR. FREY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In effect, it would give 

you another chance in Oregon.

 MR. FREY: But I do want to question the 

premise. First of all, the instruction says basically 

what this Court said in BMW, which is where it drew 

precisely that distinction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It was a good thing we 

weren't instructing a jury.

 MR. FREY: Well, I don't think there is --

the concept may be abstract, the difference between 

considering and punishing, but it's quite clear in this 

Court's jurisprudence and I think it can be made quite 

clear to the jury with the benefit of the proper 

instruction, and I don't -- I don't have any --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I do too. I don't have 

any trouble with the distinction.

 MR. FREY: If we had this instruction, if we 

had this instruction which I believe is correct, there 

is nothing incorrect about this instruction. It is 

correct that the jury may consider. We are not 

challenging that the jury may consider the conduct and

may determine that the conduct --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't answer the 

question, if the juror were to speak up. It doesn't 

answer the question. Consider for what? How? Why am I 

supposed to be considering it when you've just told me 

not to punish?

 MR. FREY: Well, I think the instruction 

said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Or not punish for other --

MR. FREY: I think the instruction says that 

you are to consider it in connection with 

determining the reprehensibility of the conduct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. If it had said that, I 

would have no trouble with it. What it says is, you may 

consider it in determining what the reasonable 

relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse 

Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. I 

don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon 

whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable 

relationship to Jesse Williams' harm. That's my problem 

with it.

 MR. FREY: Well, they do, because conduct 

that is more blameworthy, in terms of determining, as 

this Court has said in all its cases, and I know you 

don't agree with the whole inquiry --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't.

 MR. FREY: But as this Court has made quite 

clear, the reprehensibility of the conduct is an 

important factor in determining where along the scale of 

reasonable relationships in a particular case you might, 

the relationship might be reasonable. So, more conduct 

that is calculated to harm large numbers of people can 

be found more blameworthy as to warrant a higher 

proportion, a higher relationship between the punitive 

and compensatory damages.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when you do 

that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for 

the harm to others? You're going to award a higher 

multiple with respect to the damages --

MR. FREY: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based on the 

conduct to others. Why wouldn't a normal juror think --

MR. FREY: I think you are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. Why 

wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the 

defendant for the harm to others?

 MR. FREY: Well, I think that the semantical 

quibbling is not something that the jury would have 

difficulty with, in my opinion. But let me try to 

explain the difference this way. If you're considering

the conduct in relation in determining what is the proper 

punishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, you should come 

up with a number that can be properly replicated in case 

after case if other juries arrived at the same conclusion 

about the conduct. If you are punishing for the 

conduct, you should come up with a number that precludes 

further punishment for the same, punishing for the harm, 

further punishment for the same harm, for the same 

causes of action for punitive damages that various 

Oregonians had. So there's a fundamental difference in 

that respect between considering and punishing for it, 

and the Court has said repeatedly, and I don't think 

we can contest this, that the character of the conduct 

can be considered in determining the proper level or 

allowable level of punitive damages, that included the 

character of the conduct is the intended scope of the 

harm, if it's an isolated incident, if it's a consistent 

pattern of misconduct.

 So, I don't think we could properly have told 

the jury that they may not consider the conduct without 

getting ourselves in serious trouble. So -- and I 

don't, I don't think, and the difference is potentially 

enormous. If you think about a jury that was deciding a 

punitive damages class action and a jury that was told 

that they had to punish for the harm to the particular

plaintiff in the, in the particular case, it's, it's 

obvious that the results would be vastly different in 

those cases. And the problem we were worried about was 

that the jury would think of itself as the punishment 

agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to 

all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Frey, let me 

ask you a question. Suppose this was a criminal case 

and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the 

judge in working out the sentence realizes he also 

committed crimes B, C, D, and E. He could take those 

into account in determining the extent of the sentence 

given for crime A. Why isn't that similar?

 MR. FREY: It is similar, but what he can't 

do is punish for crimes B, C, D, and E. Suppose we had 

a mail fraud prosecution --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if there was a second 

-- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X. 

At that sentencing the judge could again take into 

account the harm to defendants B, C, and D.

 MR. FREY: That's true. That's certainly 

true. That's why our point is that it's one thing to 

produce a punishment that can properly be replicated in 

case after case without producing an excessive total 

punishment. It's another thing to punish in case after

case for the same harms.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not the same harm 

if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff 

in the second case. You're punishing him for the harm 

to be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal 

case, why can't you in both cases take into account 

that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?

 MR. FREY: If this was a mail fraud 

prosecution for defrauding Jesse Williams into buying 

cigarettes and the punishment was five years for that, 

the judge could consider in setting the punishment 

between zero and five the fact that this was part of a 

scheme that was intended to or may have deceived large 

numbers of other people in setting the punishment 

between zero and five. What the judge cannot do and 

what we were worried the jury would do here and what we 

think the size of its verdict may suggest it actually 

did here is to think that they could punish it that time 

not just 5 years, but 10 or 15 or 20 for all of the 

other punishments, for all the other wrongs that they 

find to have been done.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that respect, how does 

the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this. 

Oregon says that if a corporation commits 

manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount

the corporation gained by committing the offense --

MR. FREY: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is my understanding. 

Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits 

five manslaughters. Would they be liable -- and gained 

for $1 million. Would they be liable for twice a million 

dollars in every manslaughter case?

 MR. FREY: No. But I think the disgorgement 

argument that has been made by the other side suffers 

from exactly the same problem as the global punishment 

problem. That is, you can't -- if you disgorged in 

every case all the profits that were earned from selling 

cigarettes to Oregonians and to Oregonians became who 

sick --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Frey, we don't 

know what Oregon law is on that point. They do 

have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they 

must adjust in the next case. And how would you deal --

would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said 

part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, 

but to some State fund?

 MR. FREY: I don't, I don't think that --

our complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the 

money. Our complaint is with how much we're being 

punished and what the procedural regime is that has led

to punishing us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the law in Oregon 

were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive 

damages or you can get only the difference between what 

the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already 

paid out in punitive damages?

 MR. FREY: Well, first of all, that's not 

the law in Oregon.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know what it is. 

We haven't had the second case.

 MR. FREY: Well, we have no -- well, the 

Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this, on this 

statute, for purposes of dealing with the harm to 

others, harm to nonparties problem. The statute does 

not require giving credit, only consideration. Even if 

it, even if it did, it operates as a one-way ratchet. 

That is, you keep making awards until you've reached the 

maximum that would be allowable for all the conduct even 

though juries, properly instructed, might have awarded 

substantially less and even though many juries might 

exonerate the defendant totally, as many juries have in 

tobacco cases. So the Oregon regime is, is a formula 

for having what amounts to excessive punishment or at 

least unfair punishment.

 And finally, the, the 30.925, which was

referred to by the court of appeals, requires submitting 

this evidence to the jury and, as the trial court said 

in this case at page 195a of the joint appendix, there 

is no telling whether submitting the prior awards to the 

jury would produce higher or lower awards in this case. 

So I think it's an entirely illusory protection to rely 

on that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you -- are you 

finished?

 MR. FREY: Yes. I was going to say that 

because our concern is structural with the design of the 

Oregon system as it's been approved by the Oregon 

Supreme Court, I don't think this inadequate remedy can 

save that system.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I wanted to know what you 

think about a suggestion that I got from something that 

Justice Scalia said. I don't know whether he was making 

it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you 

think. Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to 

say, there are many issues in this case, some of them 

very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You 

cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause 

in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from 

the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the 

purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did

to a different person who wasn't there. Now -- so he 

couldn't defend against him. That person didn't present 

a claim.  So we are certain of that.

 Now, we're not certain whether that's what 

happened here. It may have done. There is certainly a 

lot of language to suggest it, and there is some 

language the other way. So we remand it to the court 

with that instruction that they cannot permit this to 

have happened if it happened. Whether it happened and 

what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part 

and things about instructions, etc. Now, what's your 

view of that kind of disposition?

 MR. FREY: Well, I think the first part of 

your premise is clearly correct and totally consistent 

with the position we are taking. Whether it happened 

here or not is an interesting question. It is in the 

nature of a limiting instruction, which was basically 

what this was. You can use the evidence for one 

purpose, legitimate purpose, but don't use it for an 

illegitimate purpose. But we can't tell ordinarily, 

because jury deliberations are secret and we can't probe 

what they have decided, we can't probe whether they have 

imposed global punishment or not.

 But we anticipate the problem. We proposed 

an instruction which would as best we could at the time

address the problem. Maybe it could be edited up to be 

a little sharper.  But I think it contains the essential 

point that we're driving at here today.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe, but it's possible 

the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are 

perfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is 

perfect. But if we look at the jury instructions 

without the suggested one that was rejected and then we 

look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had 

many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, 

confusion, et cetera. We find the instructions weren't 

perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the 

trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.

 MR. FREY: You're raising a question whether 

that would be an adequate --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. That's what 

worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as 

we try to determine what this instruction said, whether 

it was good enough, whether the instructions without it 

are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog 

of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State 

law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the 

context of the trial, et cetera.

 MR. FREY: Well, I think this is a pretty 

fundamental principle. I believe the instruction fairly

captured it. I don't think there would be an adequate 

and independent State ground for refusing the 

instruction. Keep in mind that in State Farm the Court 

said the defendant upon request would have been entitled 

to an instruction on the subject of extraterritorial 

punishment. Now, this is conceptually not really 

different from extraterritorial punishment. We wouldn't 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frey, I suppose 

your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying 

tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses 

that might be available with respect to other, other 

individuals who are harmed.

 MR. FREY: Certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this argument 

wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't 

susceptible to those sorts of defenses.

 MR. FREY: It would still apply because 

different factfinders, different juries, might reach 

different conclusions on the same evidence, assuming 

that a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper. 

What you're doing is preempting, you're allowing a 

potentially aberrational verdict, which there could be 

in many cases, to preempt the work of other juries. The 

whole essence of the idea that we were trying to convey

here and the legal principle that we are arguing today 

is to confine the jury to its proper domain and its 

domain is the case before it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury can't really find 

that other people were harmed. The jury doesn't have 

evidence before it except as to this person. The most 

the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the 

activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming 

other people. I think a jury could find that. And 

therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be 

punished more severely. But I -- you don't --

MR. FREY: Accepting the premise, accepting 

the premise, we don't disagree with your conclusion. 

That is, if the jury could find that they could punish 

this more severely. What they cannot do is punish it 

globally.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I don't think I'm 

quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury 

can decide that other people have been harmed and take 

into account the harm that it found other people 

suffered in deciding the penalty. And I don't think 

this jury has any basis for finding that other people 

were harmed. It could say there was a serious risk of 

it.

have evidence didn't stop the Oregon Court of Appeals 

from finding and the Oregon Supreme Court from endorsing 

the finding that many Oregonians were deceived, even 

though --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a distinction 

between actual harm to others and the risk of harm? 

Supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd 

of people.

 MR. FREY: Right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And he killed one, at 

least one. And that one sued and said: I want extra 

punitive damages because all these other people were 

subjected to the same risk. Wouldn't that be a proper 

consideration?

 MR. FREY: I think it is. I think in TXO 

the Court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be a proper 

consideration even if a second person brought the same 

action?

 MR. FREY: Well, if there were more, if 

there were other people who had causes of action, then 

I think there is a problem. In your hypothesis if only 

one person is injured --

recover for the actual harm to the others. You're 

saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many 

people, which is similar to what we have here. We don't 

know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be 

taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.

 MR. FREY: Well, that's what the Court said 

in BMW in effect, that the jury could consider even out 

of State conduct insofar as it revealed something about 

the blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct, the 

defendant's state of mind, the defendant's intentions. 

We're not saying that these things can't be considered 

for that purpose. What we are saying is that other 

people can bring their own lawsuits and punishment in 

those lawsuits -- If $79.5 million is right for Jesse 

Williams --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the time to 

determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the 

second lawsuit is brought?

 MR. FREY: No, because the problem is a 

problem with the design. If you punish in the beginning 

-- if you have A, B, C, and D who are potentially 

injured and you punish in A's case for the harm to B, C, 

and D and then the defendant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But can't I punish for the 

risk of harm to B, C, and D?

distribution of punitive damages between prevailing

shared?

in its structure because it's a ratchet to get up to the 

highest possible level even though juries who understood

less.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I'll start with the proposed 

instruction because that is where Philip Morris began 

and the Oregon courts properly treated that as an 

enigma. It told the jury, it would have told the jury, 

both that they could consider the extent of harm and not

consider the extent of harm with respect to a reasonable 

relationship. That's the disparity guide post. 

Clearly, that is not what this Court has said. And 

what, it's not what the Oregon Supreme Court did. It's 

also significant if you look at the actual proposed 

instruction, which is, starts on page 240, 279(a) of the 

joint appendix, the, the proposed instruction says you 

may consider whether the imposition of punitive damages 

is necessary to punish and deter similar misconduct by 

defendant and others in the future. Now, that's part of 

a calculation that considers harm to others in the 

future as a potential harm. So that is one of the 

things that the Oregon Supreme Court discussed when it 

said that this does not reflect our law.

 It's also significant that they said that 

you could consider financial condition and you cannot 

consider financial condition which is part of the Oregon 

statute. Now Philip Morris in their reply brief says 

that we have conflated an alternative instruction with 

one that they offered but if you look at page 280(a) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're losing me, 

counsel. What, what specifically is wrong with the 

instruction proposed here?

one, two, three.

 MR. PECK: This instruction basically 

advises the jury to do precisely what Philip Morris 

argues before this Court it cannot do and that is to 

take into account the harm suffered by others in 

determining this disparity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you object to in 

this instruction. I mean, and I thought our cases 

clearly established that you can consider the harm to 

others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the 

conduct. You don't disagree with that?

 MR. PECK: We don't disagree with that and 

that's precisely what the Oregon Supreme Court did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the other hand, 

you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the 

defendant for those harms particularly in a case where 

the defendant might have defenses available with respect 

to those others. So I understood what the instruction 

sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but 

the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior 

cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between 

assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to 

others.

 MR. PECK: We submit that it was 

unsuccessful in conveying properly what this Court has

held and that is sufficient grounds for the Oregon 

Supreme Court to uphold the trial court's decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it have been a proper 

instruction if the second sentence had read, although 

you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in 

determining what the -- what that reasonable 

relationship is, although you may consider the extent of 

harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the 

crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence --

what, what that reasonable relationship is? If you had 

just added in that additional thought.

 MR. PECK: Justice Scalia, if that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that's all 

that's left out of it. Now does leaving that out of it 

make it erroneous?

 MR. PECK: Leaving that out made it 

erroneous because it said, not with respect to 

reprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable 

relationship. That was erroneous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes but reprehensibility 

analysis is part of the reasonable relationship. The 

more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, 

according to our cases as I understand it.

 MR. PECK: Let me take a step back because I 

think there is a confusion here over also the word

punishment. Punitive damages do not punish for harm, 

they punish misconduct. And this is an important 

distinction because harm is a compensatory concept. You 

compensate others for harm and of course you cannot 

compensate others for harm in the course of this case. 

But you can consider the potential risks, the potential 

harm and the future harm if this course of misconduct is 

not deterred.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying this 

instruction was too favorable to you --

MR. PECK: No, I'm saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it allowed them 

to consider harm.

 MR. PECK: --this instruction -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't think they 

should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?

 MR. PECK: This instruction as the Oregon 

Supreme Court said, you know, doesn't provide the 

clarity that Philip Morris hoped to provide to the jury. 

And it says and they can't see how this summarizes 

Philip Morris' interpretation of Campbell. That's in 

footnote 3 of the court's opinion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, why -- why though? 

I'm having the same problem. As I read the sentence 

that we have just been quoted it seems to me

at first blush that it's completely right. You may 

consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others 

in determining what the reasonable relationship is. Now 

you have to be sophisticated in this. Don't ask me how 

the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that 

the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the 

ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered 

by this victim in court. And if it's really bad, you're 

going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation 

instead of only ten times or five times.

 So -- we take it into account, the extent of 

the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that 

ratio should be. That means it goes to the evilness of 

the conduct. But you are not to punish the defendant 

for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other 

persons who aren't here in court. In other words, what 

you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who 

has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in 

court, think about her suffering, which is real and 

serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant 

because of what he did to her. Which would be a natural 

human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, 

the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do.

 So reading it as I just read it naturally, 

it seems to describe what our cases have said is the

answer to the question. I'm posing it in a hostile way

 MR. PECK: Justice Breyer, if the 

instruction had been given the way you have just stated 

it we would have --

JUSTICE BREYER: I --

MR. PECK: -- had no problems. But it's not 

how it reads.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. PECK: And it's not what it does. It 

starts out saying that reasonable relationship is about 

the harm to Jesse Williams and then it says you may 

consider the harm suffered by others in determining that 

reasonable relationship. Well, how does harm to others 

help you figure out what the relationship to Jesse 

Williams is? It doesn't compute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because the 

instructions indicate and juries often do this that 

punitive damages are certain multiple of the 

compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are 

saying. In determining what that multiple should be you 

consider whether they have harmed others. And this 

instruction would make all the difference to the world

in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about. 

If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, 

well, there is however many, a thousand other people in 

the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be 

perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the 

conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible. There 

is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple 

when you get this kind of instruction.

 MR. PECK: But, but juries don't look at 

punitive damages in terms of a multiple. They are not 

asked to multiply anything and they shouldn't be. They 

are looking at the misconduct. They are looking at how 

you deter others from similar misconduct. They are 

looking at profitability here which is a statutory 

requirement to them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, it seems to me the 

point you're making is not the basis on which the 

Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was 

properly disallowed. The Supreme Court of Oregon said 

it was properly disallowed because you can take into 

account directly the harm to other people, isn't that 

the case?

 MR. PECK: That is not the case.

earlier, the citations that they have used in their 

brief are to the characterization of Philip Morris' 

argument. But if you look at 30(a) in the petition --

and that second paragraph there starts out with "using 

harm to others as part of the ratio may have been correct 

under the plurality opinion in TXO" --and then you jump 

down to, "however, it no longer appears to be 

permissible if it ever was."

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what about footnote 3, on 

page 18(a)? On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot 

punish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is 

difficult to see why it may consider it at all.

 MR. PECK: And that's because of the nature 

of this conduct. This is not conduct that was directed 

at Jesse Williams and he was the sole recipient of what 

Philip Morris did here. This was a massive market 

directed fraud driven by their rational and deliberate 

decisions at the highest levels of the company to 

deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health. 

They knew that this would have a special impact on those 

who are highly addicted, as Jesse Williams was. And so 

this is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter. 

And how is a State, given the considerable flexibility 

that this Court has recognized, going to deter that kind 

of misconduct if instead society's interest has to be

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you read it's about 

harm. You say look here is the person doing something 

absolutely awful, I mean really awful. And look at how 

awful it is. It's the kind of thing that would have 

hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.

 MR. PECK: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now I think we all agree 

that that's an appropriate thing to say. And as long as 

you can say that why can't you create serious damages 

for that type of conduct?

 MR. PECK: Well, that is precisely what we 

believe the Oregon Supreme Court did here. When it 

talked about how highly reprehensible this was, 

extraordinary by any measure, it said those concerns 

override ratio by which they meant single digit ratios.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say, I mean 

Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote. 

And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the, 

your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you 

basically the same question about what the Oregon 

Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the

proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the 

jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its 

alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other 

persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same 

conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way. 

As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter 

of Oregon law," and so on.

 That is not a totally unambiguous statement. 

I will concede that, but isn't the most obvious 

reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can 

punish for harm to others, so long as those others are 

Oregonians and not people in other States?

 MR. PECK: I believe, Justice Souter that 

what the court was doing there which is somewhat similar 

to the analysis below in the Oregon Court of Appeals, 

was to talk about the prospective future victims of this 

fraud, that if it were not deterred which is a 

consideration that the Oregon statute makes clear, if it 

was not deterred then this kind of consideration for the 

same acts having the same effect on others then doesn't 

allow you to make sure that on that scale that this is 

at the high end of what we are --

Justice SOUTER: That's a, that's a, I will 

assume that's a legitimate reading in your favor. But

listening to you, I don't know. I don't know whether 

that's what they really had in mind here. And if, if I 

really can't figure out what they had in mind, and if I 

go back to the footnote that Justice Alito mentioned 

before, isn't perhaps the better, the better course to 

send this back to them and say, "We don't know what you 

mean. Were you saying you can punish for these others 

as distinct from considering risk to others for, on 

reprehensibility?" And let them tell us clearly. Isn't 

that the better course?

 MR. PECK: Well, you know, perhaps that's 

one way to determine what the court meant. But I would 

suggest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One way to look at 

what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at 

the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel 

in Oregon to the jury: "How many people do you see 

outside driving home smoking cigarettes?" Now, that 

type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess 

reprehensibility. On the other hand, with the 

instruction that was offered the defense counsel could 

have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for 

those other people. We only have one plaintiff before 

us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with 

respect to that plaintiff. But without the instruction

you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in 

Oregon smoking cigarettes?

 MR. PECK: Let me suggest that both the 

Oregon Supreme Court and the instructions that were 

actually given to the jury helped answer this by looking 

at the statutory criteria. Oregon has taken 

extraordinary steps since this Court's decision in Oberg 

to enact a statute that guides the courts on the, guides 

the juries and the courts in the assessment of punitive 

damages.

 You know, first there is a threshold. 

Before you can even plead punitive damages you must meet 

that threshold and you must demonstrate to the court by 

admissible evidence that there was a reckless and 

outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of 

harm, that they've acted with a conscious indifference 

to the health and safety and welfare of others. Now, 

this is part of what infuses it with public purpose. 

Then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask you what 

is the division? How much of this --

MR. PECK: 60 percent of an award by statute 

goes to a crime victims fund of the State of Oregon and 

as soon as the judgment is rendered then the State 

becomes a judgment creditor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That has no 

relevance to the question of the extent to which the 

defendant is being punished, does it?

 MR. PECK: No, but the statutory criteria 

which requires that the jury find by clear and 

convincing evidence the following factors, which was 

given to this jury in the fashion that I'm about to tell 

you, constrains this award and I think properly makes it 

reasonable.

 First, you have to consider whether there is 

a likelihood that serious harm would arise from the 

defendant's misconduct. Second, the degree of the 

defendant's awareness of that likelihood. Three, 

profitability in the State of Oregon. Four, duration of 

the misconduct and concealment of it. Five, the 

attitude and the conduct of the defendant upon discovery 

of the misconduct. And then finally, financial 

condition of the defendant, which cuts both ways. It 

protects a defendant from being bankrupted by punitive 

damages while at the same time assures that punitive 

damages are enough to have that deterrent effect.

 Now even after that, the defendant could opt 

to have the jury address whether they had been 

previously punished for this misconduct or choose not 

to, which you would expect most defendants to choose,

and instead post verdict, present that to the trial

 JUSTICE BREYER: The trouble with the more 

basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but 

it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors 

like that, or many do. Alabama did. You know, not 

quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you 

know. And there are other cases that would bring up 

products liability. And it's pretty hard to think of a 

products liability case where the jury found negligence, 

where they might not also find these factors. Because 

in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the 

company. Somebody will have been hurt and likely 

seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim 

in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often 

is, at least in this instance. And now you read these 

five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, 

well, you read the jury factors like that and they can 

do almost anything. And it's that, it's that fact that 

anything goes that I found disturbing.

 MR. PECK: But this last factor that I was 

about to get to, which I think provides a constraint 

that's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases, 

and that is the total deterrent effect of other 

punishment imposed in any remedial measures the

defendant has taken. Now this can be presented first to 

the trial judge, saying okay, we have this huge award, 

but, you know, we have been fined by the government, we 

have had punitive damages assessed against us in other 

cases, and as a result we have taken the following 

measures which assure that we will not engage in this 

kind of misconduct again, and as a result also, this 

award should be cut.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you say this after the 

fact? The jury doesn't hear this?

 MR. PECK: The jury does not. You have the 

option of presenting it to the jury but you do not have 

to present it to the jury. You can present it first to 

the trial judge and you can also present it at the 

appellate level.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems very odd that a 

major argument for constraint is something that the jury 

can't hear. It just goes to show, really, the 

irrational nature of the exercise.

 MR. PECK: I would suggest it's not 

irrational because what you do is, you've given the 

defendant the option as a strategic matter either to 

present it to the jury or if they think that will 

guarantee an award of punitive damages against them, 

they can withhold it and present it only to the trial

judge. This is a protection to the defendant rather 

than, you know, an oddity, I think.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Assuming there's a distinction, and the instruction 

does, between taking into account the extent of harm to 

others on the one hand and punishing for the extent of 

harm on the other. As I understand what you recited 

about the five parts of the instructions, none of them 

really authorized punishment for harm to others.

 MR. PECK: That is correct, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that 

the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems 

to me that could be an argument that you should take 

into account the extent of harm to others, but it does 

not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on. 

And the question I want to ask, are there other parts 

of the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel 

argued that you should take into account, that you 

should punish for harm to others?

 MR. PECK: There is not. The only argument 

that was made in closing was that you can think about 

the others, which was clearly intended to go towards 

that reprehensibility analysis. You know, certainly in 

the criminal law context, an attempted crime is punished 

as badly as an actual crime when all the elements that

are required to, to accomplish that crime have occurred. 

And in the context of this very unusual long in duration 

misconduct, what you had to do was you had to look at 

that broad attempt to effect Oregon --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think juries can, 

Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what 

they are told if they are told, you can take into 

account conduct directed at other people for the purpose 

of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you 

can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?

 MR. PECK: I believe they can. This -- this 

jury did a very good job. First of all, if they --

JUSTICE ALITO: They can understand that 

distinction and --

MR. PECK: I believe they can.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And you would have them 

apply that principle in this case?

 MR. PECK: They understood contributory or 

comparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis 

of negligence. They made a distinction in, in the fraud 

claim by only awarding a little bit more than $21,000, 

even though the request was much higher.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they can 

understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense 

counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you

argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing 

reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, 

but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you 

answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that 

distinction?

 MR. PECK: I believe the defense counsel 

would have been entitled to make such an argument. I 

don't think there would have been any need for 

corrective instruction. But what they proposed, which 

was conflicting in two different respects, just did not 

meet the muster.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it 

would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if 

they had proposed an instruction that said, you may 

consider the harm to others in assessing how 

reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish 

Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had 

no objection to that instruction?

 MR. PECK: I would have had no objection.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So your only objection is 

that they left out the reason why it is relevant to 

determining what the ratio should be? They just didn't 

say you can consider it in connection with 

reprehensibility. Why is that crucial?

 MR. PECK: I think it was critical and of

course, you know, Oregon is entitled to run its court 

system as it has for more than 30 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why was it critical?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why was it critical?

 MR. PECK: Why was it corrected?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. Justice Scalia said, 

you know, they left out this one little bit. Why was 

that critical? What's the answer.

 MR. PECK: Well, the answer is because, 

again, it was not directed for the specific purpose for 

which harm to others may be considered, and that's in 

the reprehensibility analysis. There is no disagreement 

between the parties on that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying, I think 

you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out 

without somebody telling them?

 MR. PECK: But what this instruction told 

him --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what you're 

saying?

 MR. PECK: No, I'm not saying that. What 

the instruction told them is to consider it with respect 

to the reasonable relationship. That means the ratio. 

That means proportionality. And that would suggest, as 

Justice Stevens suggested, that they might multiply it

by how many people are out there, because I think this 

instruction was an enigma and was confusing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Too favorable to you. Too 

favorable to you again, right?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PECK: You know, perhaps so. But you 

know, the fact of the matter is that, you know, we did 

not advocate that the jury punish for harm to others. 

We do not believe the Oregon court upheld this judgment 

for that reason.

 If I can go on to the, some of the other 

points that are made by Philip Morris. They talk about 

this Court's decision in State Farm as if it were 

nothing more than a ratio, so they reduce the decision 

to ratio. They transform the most important indicium, 

reprehensibility, into a subsidiary role in the ratio 

analysis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I make, just to 

get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to 

reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive 

damages precedents?

 MR. PECK: No, we are not asking you to do 

that. We think that this, this judgment is valid under 

those precedents. They denigrate the State's interest 

which this Court has said is the first consideration,

the State's interest in deterrence to this 

fractionalized sort of passenger on each individual 

lawsuit, even though the State's interest here when we 

get to the punitive damages phase, it's infused with 

public purpose, that State interest is in deterring 

misconduct, not in figuring out how many dollars might 

be additionally awarded to the plaintiff or even into 

its crime victims fund. It removes the State's 

flexibility and ability to experiment with different 

ways to address the concerns that this Court has stated 

with respect to punitive damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It depends when you say 

something about duplicative recoveries, because that 

seems to be a major concern.

 MR. PECK: This total deterrent effect 

requirement is the key here, that this is a part of a 

State statute that says that to the extent that there 

had been prior punitive damage awards that have operated 

to affect that deterrence that the State is interested 

in, to the effect that there have been other 

punishments, to the effect that there had been remedial 

measures taken to prevent such misconduct again in the 

future, then the judge is to reduce this award. The 

Oregon Supreme Court has said that this fully addresses 

the concern with multiple awards, duplicative awards,

and that authoritative construction by that court 

should, should weigh heavily with this Court. But at 

the same time, the fact of the matter is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what if -- your friend 

says, what if we never get assessed for any other case? 

Where do we make up this money?

 MR. PECK: Well, you know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose they win every 

other case in Oregon.

 MR. PECK: Well, as a practical matter, they 

have been, they have lost both, the only two cases that 

have gone to a trial in Oregon. And as a practical 

matter, the statute of ultimate repose practically 

prevents any future Oregon plaintiff from bringing such 

a lawsuit. They would have to show that they contracted 

cancer or a disease from smoking within the repose 

period, which is eight years, if one were filed 

tomorrow, eight years ago, and that indeed that the 

fraud was a substantial factor in contracting that 

disease. That is what we were put to prove in this 

case, the relevant date being 1988.

 Now imagine, that window is rapidly closing 

on eight years, because it was after this case that 

Philip Morris decided that they were no longer going to 

deny that smoking causes cancer and they were no longer

going to deny that nicotine was addictive. So that 

window is rapidly closing, and it's highly unlikely that 

a smoker can point to eight years ago as the point at 

which their cancer basically became active. So as a 

practical matter, there is going to be no awards, future 

awards in Oregon. And as a legal matter, doctrinal 

matter, I believe that Oregon has taken the step 

necessary to prevent multiple awards.

 You know, six States do not permit punitive 

damages in most instances. Another 20 or so cap 

punitive damages. And then 12, of which Oregon is one, 

has chosen a method like this to address that 

duplicative award approach. I think that kind of 

experimentation which is done in good faith, which has 

been authoritatively construed by the courts to address 

this question, is sufficient to address any concerns 

with due process.

 But let's, let's remember also, that while 

the Constitution contains many places where numbers are 

important, the President must be 35 years of age, it has 

implied in other places numbers, like in one person, one 

vote. But the due process clause in its spaciousness 

and majesty doesn't talk about numbers, and that is 

where the concern is only about reasonableness. It's 

about fairness. And here the Oregon legislature,

supplemented by the Oregon courts, have taken those 

steps to properly constrain awards.

 Since the decision in Oberg, there have been 

only 14 punitive damage decisions in Oregon. Four of 

them have been overturned entirely by the Oregon Supreme 

Court, so no punitive damages awarded. There are only 

two out of all those awards that exceed single digits, 

and this is one of them. So I think that the courts 

have done a good job there of trying to address these 

concerns.

 And one of the areas of agreement between 

our opponents and us is that the statement in their 

brief that, reprehensibility ensures that the greater 

wrong receives the greater punishment. But the regime 

that they are suggesting, one that has a categorical 

ratio limit and atomizes this kind of consideration so 

you don't look at the broader societal and public 

purpose, that one guarantees a regime of 

underdeterrence. And Oregon has, as it is their right, 

opted for optimal deterrent effect. Thank you.

Let me, let me start with, let me start with the 

observation that Mr. Peck has argued as though this was 

a class action, as though total deterrence, 

disgorgement, and all these things were all to be 

achieved in this case, which is the heart of our problem 

here with the denial of the instruction. He referred to 

this other case in Oregon, which is the Schwarz case, as 

finding liability also, but what he didn't mention was 

that on the issue of the fraud relating, involving the 

relationship between cancer, between smoking and health, 

the jury found for the defendant. They found liability 

on a different issue, but not on this issue. So it 

hardly proves that we would lose all cases. It's also 

true that in that case, where the jury did not 

receive -- we asked for but we didn't get an instruction 

like this -- the jury actually came back and said: Does 

our award have to be reasonably related to the injury to 

Mrs. Schwarz? And the judge refused to tell them the 

answer to that. So juries do understand this problem 

and they do think about this problem.

 The suggestion was made that you can 

present prior awards to the trial judge. Now, I, I hope 

during my opening argument I covered the reasons why 

there's a structural deficiency in the system if the 

system even called for getting credit, which the

statutes don't require. But you should know that the 

Oregon plaintiffs' lawyers have argued that under the 

Oregon Constitution it must be presented to the jury or 

is it may not be considered by the court. So while here 

he wants to assure you that it can be presented to the 

court, that's not the position they are taking below.

 On the question by Justice Souter about 

whether you should send it back and what the Oregon 

Supreme Court meant by its discussion, if it didn't 

mean what we say it meant they should have reversed 

and said were entitled to the instruction or identified 

some other reason why we're not entitled to the 

instruction. Now, there may be some independent State 

ground that you're not aware of, but you ought to say 

at a minimum that they were wrong and that a defendant 

in a punitive damages case is entitled to an instruction 

of this general nature, and then we can let the Oregon 

courts on remand address whether there is some other 

problem which we frankly don't see, but that would be 

for them.

 Now, if Mr. Peck is right about the 

nature of the conduct, there should be plenty of 

lawsuits and plenty of liability. If there isn't, the 

Court can't speculate that we ought to punish Philip 

Morris more in this case because other people are not

sufficiently aggrieved to sue. That seems to me totally 

impermissible speculation.

 On the question of harm versus conduct, 

the unit of prosecution is the cause of action, so that 

it's not, it's not, you can repeatedly -- in our, in our 

submission you can repeatedly punish a defendant for the 

same conduct, for the impact of the same conduct causing 

injury to different people. What we are basically 

saying is that there are, there are potentially many 

causes of action out there for this conduct and the 

punishment in this case should be limited to the cause 

of action that is being tried before the jury in this 

case.

 Let's see if I -- if I have anything 

else. Justice Stevens talked about the ambiguity of the 

closing argument and I agree it's not clear what 

plaintiff's counsel was exactly saying. It could be 

interpreted in different ways. But that is a reason to 

have a cautionary instruction, not a reason to forgo 

one, to make sure the jury understands the applicable 

principles.
