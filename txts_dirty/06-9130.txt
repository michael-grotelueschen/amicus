 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 069130 Ali versus Federal Bureau of 

Prisons.

 Mr. Andre.

 MR. ANDRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the court:

 The text of Section 26 (a)(c)Federal court 

claims act establishes -- provision underlying purpose 

confirm that Congress did not intend the provision to 

broadly bar all claims arising out of all the tensions 

of all property by all law enforcement officers. As in 

any statutory construction case we need to of course 

begin with the text, and with respect to the text in 

this case, we believe that the statutory language is 

simply no different than the statutory at issue at 

Circuit City v. Adams. Circuit City v. Adams this court 

applied a ejusdem generis to limit a sweepingly broad 

residual phrase that is meaningfully indistinguishable 

from the "any other law enforcement phrase" at issue 

here. In particular, in Circuit City the court was 

asked what kinds of employment contracts were exempted 

from the mandates of the Federal Arbitration Act. The 

particular provision at issue in that case 9 U.S.C.

Section 1 exempted from the act's coverage any and I 

quote contracts of employment of sea men, railroad 

employees or any other class of workers engaged in 

foreign or interstate commerce. That residual phrase 

read in isolation is broad and sweeping on its face it 

certainly would appear to apply not only to 

transportation workers, but also to retail store clerks 

like the Respondent in Circuit City, none the less under 

a ejusdem generis, this court limited that residual 

phrase to just to transportation workers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there is a 

difference between a sufficient laundry list in a 

residual phrase and example in a residual phrase. In 

Circuit City you have a couple of examples -- seamen, 

railroad workers -- here it's just a customs or excise 

worker. I regard customs and excise as kind of the same 

thing. So why isn't it more like the cases where we've 

said you have an example in a residual phrase; the 

example is not limiting.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

if I could point out that if the Government had made the 

argument that you have to have a list, and I think under 

the Government's interpretation you had to have at least 

three items, two specific and one general. In Norfolk 

-- Norfolk and Western Railway, this Court says that

need not be the case. There the Court said that you 

could have a singular general term preceded by a 

singular specific term. So it's our position that --

that even if you were to read this statute as -- as 

possessing only two items, that you could still apply 

ejusdem generis, but we don't read the statute that way. 

We believe that the statute actually contains a list of 

three items, and that Congress to save itself a couple 

words, decided to say "any officer of customs or excise, 

or any other law enforcement officer," instead of saying 

the more wordy version, "any officer of customs, any 

officer of excise or any other law enforcement officer." 

I don't think we can fault Congress for its pick in that 

scenario.

 To get back to the residual phrase, the "any 

other law enforcement officer phrase" here, ripped from 

its moorings, as we believe the Government is trying to 

do, would certainly seem to apply to all law enforcement 

officers, including Bureau of Prisons officials which by 

statute are law enforcement officers. But Section 

2680(c) contains a number of contextual cues that 

Congress didn't have general law enforcement functions 

in mind when it passed the provision. It had customs 

and tax functions in mind. In particular, the detention 

clause preserves sovereign immunity for the detention of

goods and merchandise by any officer of customs or 

excise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not just goods 

or merchandise. Goods, merchandise or other property. 

And does other property include any type of property?

 MR. ANDRE: We believe it does, and we 

believe that when Congress added that language it was 

simply Congress's sensible recognition that customs and 

tax officers will detain or seize cash and real property 

which wouldn't be covered or wouldn't be subsumed under 

goods and merchandise.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So "goods and 

merchandise or other property" are just examples, and 

then a residual phrase that includes everything; but 

"customs or excise or any other law enforcement 

officer," that's subject to ejusdem generis - all in the 

same sentence.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, we actually don't think --

or I guess I cannot necessarily agree with the first 

part of what you just said, Mr. Chief Justice. We don't 

believe that -- that other property necessarily, or that 

"goods and merchandise and other property," the goods 

and merchandise are examples of "other property." We 

think in that situation, goods and merchandise refer 

specifically to goods and merchandise as -- as explained

historically in the United States Code, which are, you 

know, more movable things other than cash, tangible 

items other than cash, and "other property" then covers 

cash and real property.

 Excuse me. Getting back to the contextual 

cues in this case, in addition to the four contained in 

the detention clause itself, the assessment clause 

contains four additional contextual cues. It preserves 

sovereign immunity for the assessment of any tax or the 

collection of any customs duty, and because we have this 

great quantity of contextual cues in a very short 

statutory provision, we believe that we would also 

prevail under an application of the Noscitur a sociis 

canon, that this Court most recently applied two terms 

ago in Dolan v. Postal Service. In that case what was 

at issue is whether the term "negligent transmission" in 

Section 2680(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act reached 

all negligent transmissions, in particular a parcel left 

on the foot of someone's front door that causes them a 

fall injury, or instead, it was limited by its 

antecedent contextual cues, namely -- I'm sorry --

namely, loss and miscarriage, which would tend to 

indicate that Congress intended really only to preserve 

sovereign immunity for instances in which delivery was 

untimely or went to the wrong location. The Court again

sensibly looked past the superficially broad negligent 

transmission language and instead said no, we have to 

read it in context; and in context Congress did not 

intend us to just pluck those two words out of the 

dictionary and apply a dictionary meaning.

 In fact, in that case, the Government 

implored this Court to apply dictionary definitions to 

negligence and transmission, and that's essentially what 

the Government is trying to ask this Court to do here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what do you do 

about the later -- the later statute that makes an 

exception to the exception?

 MR. ANDRE: We don't believe that that 

changes -- we don't believe that changes the meaning of 

the detention cause at all beyond the small change that 

Congress made.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean it clearly, the 

exception to the exception says that -- that the 

exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or 

loss of goods or merchandise, if among other 

requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of 

forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing 

for the forfeiture of property.

 Now that's more than customs and tax -- any 

provision of Federal law.

MR. ANDRE: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you need that 

exception to the exception if the exception doesn't 

cover anything except customs and tax in the first 

place?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, we believe that the fact 

that Congress decided to not only preserve the detention 

clause, but also mimic its language in the exception to 

the exception, means that Congress intended to kind of 

bring forward the -- of course -- original meaning as of 

1946 of that clause. But I think to get what you're 

asking me, the Government's position, that because the 

exception to the exception references any provision of 

forfeiture -- the Government's suggestion that that 

somehow broadens the scope of the statute is misplaced.

 Customs and tax officers regularly apply 

other forfeiture statutes, and in particular the one 

they use a lot is 21 U.S.C. 881. That's the general 

civil forfeiture statute. And so in many cases they 

will bring a forfeiture action under either their 

agency's specific forfeiture provision, or the general 

21 U.S.C. 881. And so when Congress included that 

language saying any provision of forfeiture, it was 

simply Congress's sensible recognition that they don't

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't -- they didn't 

need that if indeed it covered all seizures by -- by 

customs and tax officers and nobody else. If that's all 

it -- it covered, what -- you know, this doesn't achieve 

anything. The purpose of under any provision of Federal 

law. It seems to me that that envisions seizure under 

laws other than tax and customs. Now you're saying 

there is one, one such law that tax and customs officers 

sometimes use?

 MR. ANDRE: There may be more, I was giving 

you an example, but the one that I gave you, 21 U.S.C. 

881, is the one most frequently used. It is the general 

forfeiture provision. It's kind of the backbone of all 

forfeitures, and so in many cases officers bring 

forfeiture actions not only either -- either under their 

own agency forfeiture provision or the general. 

Sometimes they bring them under both. But the point is 

that's a meaty statute there, and I -- I assume that 

Congress wanted to make clear that if a customs or tax 

officer were to bring a forfeiture proceeding under that 

meaty provision, and maybe some other ones that they 

would use from time to time, that the exception to the 

exception would still work here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What work does it do? What 

work under your interpretation does that later provision

do, if property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture 

under any provision of Federal law providing for the 

forfeiture of property?

 MR. ANDRE: Under our interpretation, if a 

customs or tax officer or another law enforcement 

officer acting in a custom or tax capacity detains 

property and injures it -- and it doesn't matter under 

which forfeiture law they detain the property --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. ANDRE: -- and the plaintiff is 

ultimately successful, I'm sorry, I guess -- yes, the 

plaintiff is ultimately successful in defeating the 

Government's claim for forfeiture, then they can sue 

under the FTCA for the damage to their property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Andre, it may be that 

things would fall into place easier if you would give us 

an example or examples of instances in which any other 

law enforcement officer would be engaged in detaining 

property in -- in the course of enforcing customs or 

excise laws. If we can understand that, then we are 

going to have a better sense of how the exception might 

work. Can you give me an example of the other law 

enforcement officer engaged in customs excise?

 MR. ANDRE: Sure. The best example that 

comes to mind is pre-9/11 before the merger of the INS

and the Border Patrol -- or I'm sorry, the Customs 

Bureau -- under the Department of Homeland Security. 

When you drove across the border before 9/11 more often 

than not you would see a gentleman or a woman in a green 

jump suit. They were INS. But not only were they 

asking you questions about your immigration status and 

checking to see if you had ID; they were also asking 

about what you were bringing in -- for example, oh, do 

you have more than two bottles of liquor? Because 

you're only allowed to bring in two. And if you said 

yes, they would direct you over to secondary inspection, 

and even there in secondary inspection certainly 

sometimes there may have been officers in blue suits, 

the customs enforcement officers. But more often than 

not, they were still officers in green suits, INS 

officers. And there they're taking this extra property 

from you because they believe you are not supposed to 

have it, and then sending you on your way.

 There are many task forces in many other 

instances in which officers can overlap or share 

functions, postal inspectors working with the customs 

enforcement agencies to keep --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say IRS officers, 

because they would be covered? It's tax and customs.

 MR. ANDRE: Right. We believe IRS officers

are expressly covered, but, for example, when the FBI is 

conducting an investigation with the IRS into fraud and 

other tax issues, then we believe that those FBI agents 

would be covered.

 So we don't believe it's hard at all to find 

a number of examples of where other law enforcement 

officers are assisting tax and customs officers, 

standing in the shoes of tax and customs officers, or 

just doing something sufficiently akin to what tax and 

customs officers do. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You gave an example in 

your brief that didn't seem to fit. I mean you spoke of 

a DEA agent who was searching for narcotics, and that 

sounds to me like what DEA agents do. They were not 

auxiliary to a customs officer.

 MR. ANDRE: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. That's the Formula One case out of the Second 

Circuit. And the reason why we relied on that case is 

because the DEA agents were opening up a shipping 

container that had not yet been opened since it came 

from overseas.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were doing it 

for their primary business, which was to detect 

narcotics.

 MR. ANDRE: That's right. And we again

reference that case because we wanted to offer the Court 

a broad construction or make sure the Court was 

comfortable in knowing that we were comfortable with the 

"other law enforcement officer" phrase being read 

broadly to reach any -- you know, any loose tax or 

customs function.

 If the Court wants to construe that phrase 

more narrowly, we still win this case, and we have no 

problem if the Court wants to do that. But we think 

that, given that the residual phrase of the detention 

clause starts out with the word "any," the way to give 

-- to give credence to Congress's use of that word is to 

then construe the phrase as reaching conduct such as the 

conduct in the Formula One case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could we interpret the term 

"law enforcement" -- "any other law enforcement officer" 

to be limited to those law enforcement officers whose 

duties generally include the detention of goods?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, I don't think so, Justice 

Alito, because we weren't really prepared to debate what 

exactly "detention" means. In fact, we didn't petition 

on that issue, and my client didn't press it below. But 

we were just intuitively thinking -- I don't think the 

word "detention" does much work for us here, at least in

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why doesn't it? It's 

not clear to me. Maybe this is not within the question, 

but why were your client's goods detained? "Detention" 

seems to connote holding the goods against the wishes of 

the owner, and that wasn't the situation here. He gave 

those goods -- he gave them to the Bureau of Prisons 

officer for the purpose of having them sent on to his 

new prison.

 MR. ANDRE: I agree. I should have been 

more clear.

 We don't believe that the word "detention" 

necessarily sheds a lot of light on how you construe 

what "other law enforcement officer" means, but 

certainly, yeah, we believe that if the detention issue 

were alive in this case, we have a very strong case, 

because there's a very passive kind of bailment here, as 

you referenced, where our -- my client was, you know, 

told to leave his property with a receiving/discharge 

clerk and go to a new institution, and the property was 

going to follow him along. There was no seizure. There 

was no investigation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you don't think that 

concept sheds light on what Congress had in mind when it 

referred to any other Federal law enforcement officer?

 MR. ANDRE: I -- I don't, but I don't want

to resist you too much either. You know, if the Court 

would like us to reach that issue, we'd be happy to 

brief if the Court wanted to issue an order akin to the 

one it issued last term in U.S. v. Resendiz-Ponce.

 And I think to get more directly to what 

you're saying, whatever Congress intended as far as 

other law enforcement officers, the fact that we have a 

case here where, again, there is this very passive 

bailment by a Bureau of Prisons receiving/discharge 

clerk, I think exemplifies how the government's 

construction of the statute is too broad. And I think 

that might be what you were trying to tease out of me 

there.

 And to get back to the government's 

construction, we believe that their construction would 

render a number of words in this statute superfluous, 

which is sort of our third textual reason for reading 

the statute our way. The detention clause contains a 

total of 22 words. Under the government's construction 

it would simply read: "Any detention of any property by 

any law enforcement officer." Fourteen words would be 

excised right out of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, I mean that's 

always true when you have an example and a more general 

phrase. And yet our cases indicate that we often read

the language that way.

 In other words, it's giving you, perhaps, 

the most common example in which you're going to have a 

detention of goods, but it's not limiting it to those 

officers.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, there certainly are some 

cases that would appear to go both ways, although I 

think if you take a look at the cases cited by the 

government, those cases involve pretty -- I realize we 

have an unclear, bizarre statute here as well, but those 

are pretty bizarre statutes the government is relying on 

where the Court has, and more often than not, it has 

also been as an alternative statement, you could even 

say possibly dicta, where the Court has said, oh, 

Congress can give examples.

 But more often than not, the Court applies 

the ejustem generis canon and the noscitur a sociis 

canon to confine or limit a superficially broad residual 

phrase. And if that weren't the case, then Gutierrez v. 

Ada would have come out the other way, Dolan v. Postal 

Service, of course, Circuit City.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but S.D. Marine 

wouldn't have come out the other way.

statute in S.D. Marine?

 MR. ANDRE: I'm sorry. I'm not that 

familiar with the statute that we have in that case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't the word, as 

your brother argues, doesn't "any" cut against you? If 

they intended the other law enforcement officer to be 

limited to similar to customs or excise, it seems to me 

they wouldn't have thrown in "any other law enforcement 

officer."

 MR. ANDRE: Well, as kind of a practical 

matter, we don't think that when you have a statute like 

this, the word "any" really does a lot of work. I mean 

if you had taken out the word "any" and instead 

pluralized the word "officer," I don't think the statute 

really would work any differently.

 But even taking -- taking as true this 

Court's oft-repeated statement that "any" is evidence of 

expansive meaning by Congress, we believe our 

construction is faithful to that, because we are willing 

to bring in to our construction of the statute some of 

these other law enforcement officers who may be 

performing their ordinary functions, such as DEA 

officers, enforcement of drug laws, but they are doing 

it akin to customs laws.

 And again, the Court need not adopt that

construction for us to prevail in this case. But that's 

how we believe that our construction is faithful to the 

word "any" to the extent that in this statute it's 

relevant at all.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, following up on 

Justice Alito's question, has there ever been a debate 

in earlier stages in this litigation as to whether this 

was a detention?

 MR. ANDRE: No, there was not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because if it were not a 

detention, then you'd win.

 MR. ANDRE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering why you 

didn't make the argument somewhere along the line.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, my client was pro se in 

the Court of Appeals, and he didn't raise it there. And 

to be -- again, we didn't think that the issue of 

whether a detention had to be a seizure, something more 

forceful, or whether it was so broad as to include more 

of a passive bailment like we have here, we didn't 

believe that that issue had percolated enough in the 

courts of appeals to warrant petitioning on. So we 

figured we'd fight this fight here today.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it is clear -- there 

are so many exceptions from exceptions from exceptions,

that you get a little mixed up, but I am clear, am I 

not, that if it were not a detention, you would win?

 MR. ANDRE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Everybody agrees.

 MR. ANDRE: If there was not a detention or 

if the BOP guard was not an any other law enforcement, 

we would win under either two of those independent 

analyses.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also not clear 

that under the government's -- I guess I should ask 

them, but I got it right in front of me now -- if you 

deleted the words "officer of customs or exercise or any 

other," if you just took those words out of the statute, 

it would then mean exactly what the government contends 

it means?

 MR. ANDRE: That's exactly right. And 

that's why we believe that the rule against superfluity 

is another reason why our construction is more faithful 

to Congress's intent in this case.

 As I mentioned at the outset, we also 

believe that the legislative history underlying purposes 

for this particular provision support our reading. In 

particular, I realize the legislative history is pretty 

sparse, but in particular, there were six congressional 

committee reports issued by Congress after the detention

clause was expanded to essentially its current form.

 And in all six of those reports, Congress 

conspicuously omitted to make any reference to the fact 

that this phrase could possibly reach the detentions of 

all property by all law enforcement officers.

 Now, we're not suggesting that this case is 

at all like Arlington v. Murphy, for example, where we 

are going to have legislative history try to overrule a 

clear statutory text. I think it's pretty clear that 

this text is ambiguous, and so legislative history is 

relevant to give that text meaning.

 And so the reason why we focus here on those 

particular committee reports is, as the Court of Appeals 

has stated, the committee reports are the most helpful 

form of legislative history because when many members of 

Congress go up to vote, they haven't parsed particular 

provisions in the text; they rely on the committee 

reports, the reports prepared by the committee that 

marked up and presented the language to the floor. And 

so, if when all those members --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the President 

doesn't rely on those when he signs the statute into 

law.

 MR. ANDRE: No. That's true, Your Honor. 

But when those members typically go up to the floor and

vote, they oftentimes don't parse the language. They 

rely on the committee reports.

 And so if the government's construction were 

correct here, essentially what you would have is all of 

those members' votes being overridden because they 

couldn't possibly have known -- unless they took the 

time to parse the text and we all know that a lot of 

times they don't -- they wouldn't possibly know that 

there'd be any chance whatsoever that this phrase could 

broadly reach the detention of property by all law 

enforcement officers. Even putting that kind of 

legislative history argument aside, I think we're -- our 

strongest footing, when we talk about how our 

construction is faithful to Congress's underlying 

purpose for this particular provision, on three 

occasions, this Court has either suggested or expressly 

stated that the purpose for this particular provision 

was to avoid the creation of a redundant federally 

funded remedy. As we explain in our opening brief, 

there was a pre-existing federally funded remedy only 

for the negligent conduct of tax and customs officers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that still exist 

after the Westfall Act?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, we believe it would if --

well, actually that's a very good question. I'm not

sure.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because now, the -- there 

wouldn't be -- the United States would be substituted --

MR. ANDRE: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for the agent's 

abuses.

 MR. ANDRE: Right, but then in that 

situation, once the United States substituted, they 

could seek dismissal because the Westfall Act doesn't 

override any exceptions to the FTCA. So, yes, Justice 

Ginsburg, in that particular case, if you're dealing 

with an officer of customs or tax or another law 

enforcement acting in that capacity, and they were sued 

personally for the negligent handling of property, the 

government could certify they're acting within the scope 

of their employment, step into the case, and then move 

to dismiss under this provision, under 2680(c).

 But, historically, there was -- before the 

Westfall Act, there was a pre-existing federally funded 

remedy for only officers acting in a tax or customs 

capacity or customs or tax officers by name. And so it 

would be inconsistent with Congress's underlying purpose 

to avoid creating a duplicative remedy to apply its 

provisions so broadly because Congress wanted to provide 

a cause of action for claims against law enforcement

officers other than those against whom a cause of action 

was already available.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do we know -- how do we 

know that that's the only purpose of this exception?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, as I mentioned, this Court 

suggested in Kosak that that was the only only purpose, 

but then in Hatzlachh and in Gutierrez v. Martinez, this 

Court twice stated that that was the only purpose, and 

the Court did so for good reason. Again, although the 

legislative history is sparse, the only statements 

whatsoever in the legislative record about the purpose 

for this particular provision was that Congress was 

intending to avoid creating a duplicative remedy.

 JUSTICE ALITO: This is all based on Judge 

Holtzoff's testimony? That's the basis for the 

conclusion that this is the only purpose for this 

exception?

 MR. ANDRE: And it's also based on the 

testimony of Colonel O.R. McGuire, who is general 

counsel for the Comptroller General. And it wasn't just 

Judge -- well, Judge Holtzoff was probably the architect 

of the detention clause and maybe this entire provision. 

It was the Comptroller General's Office, and Judge 

Holtzoff who jointly were responsible for preparing tort 

claims legislation. So, essentially, of the two people

who were most relevant to the preparation of the FTCA, 

and granted we're talking 15 years before its actual 

enactment, but two people who were most important for 

preparing this tort claims legislation, they both agreed 

that the only purpose for this particular provision was 

to avoid creating a redundant remedy.

rebuttal.

Mr. Andre. Mr. Shanmugam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Section 2680(c) preserves the government's 

immunity against tort claims concerning the detention of 

property by any law enforcement officer. That reading 

is consistent not only with the plain language of the 

statute but also with Congress's underlying policy 

objectives in creating the FTCA's exception. 

Petitioner effectively asks this Court to engraft 

language on to the statute by adding the amorphous 

limitation "acting in a customs or tax capacity" to the 

unambiguous statutory phrase "any other law enforcement 

officer."

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, may I ask 

you -- this goes to your ambiguity point. May I ask you 

this question? If Congress wanted to cover all law 

officers, the only reason for mentioning the customs and 

excise people would be to make it very clear that they 

were within that category of all law enforcement 

officers, and I take it that's basically what you're 

saying.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, I think that's correct 

with one caveat, Justice Souter, and I don't mean to 

quibble, but I think that this is important. I think 

when one looks at the evolution of the statute, it may 

very well have that when Judge Holtzoff drafted the 

relevant statutory language, he started with customs or 

excise officers because the British bill that was 

apparently the model for the detention of property 

clause --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- used that phrase, and he 

may then have decided to expand it to other law 

enforcement officers simply because he concluded that 

there was no basis for treating other law enforcement 

officers differently.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But wouldn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But wouldn't the way to do 

that would have made it at least clearer that that's 

what Congress or what he had in mind and what Congress 

was getting at would have been to provide that the --

that the exception referred to law enforcement officers 

including an officer or customs of excise? In other 

words, they would have made it clear that at that point, 

the old historical customs and excise rule was sort of 

the tail on the dog, and the dog was law enforcement 

officers. Instead, however, the order is exactly 

different. On what your reading is -- on your reading, 

what is now the tail of the dog comes first, and the 

general clause "law enforcement officer" comes second.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, number one, it is less 

clear and it really raises the question: Weren't they 

trying to get simply at law enforcement officers who 

were doing the customs and excise function? So my 

question is, why doesn't the order of the words cut 

against you by putting, on your theory, the tail of the 

dog before the dog?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Souter, it is 

certainly true that Congress could have written that 

statute that way and indeed could have omitted the 

customs or excise officers entirely, and that certainly

would be a clearer statute in the sense that I don't 

think that Mr. Andre would be here if we had a statute 

that simply referred to any law enforcement officer.

 But the United States Code is replete with 

provisions that fit this model, that start with specific 

examples and then contain a general residual clause. 

And, indeed, even the Constitution has similar 

provisions. To take one concrete example that we cite 

among the many examples in footnote 11 of our brief, the 

Extradition Clause in Article IV of the Constitution 

refers to extradition for treason, felonies, and other 

crimes, and there is no doubt that the framers could 

have simply referred to crimes, but they cited those 

examples. As this Court held in a case way back when, 

Kentucky v. Denyson, the reason that Congress used those 

examples was for emphasis to make clear that political 

crimes such as treason and other felonies that would 

qualify as political crimes were covered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's also --

MR. SHANMUGAM: So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's also not entirely 

clear what -- whether it's a tail or not. It depends on 

what the dog is. If you can -- if you were trying to 

identify the most common instances, especially at the 

time this provision was enacted, the most common

instances in which property was detained by the 

government, I mean you know, later -- later forfeiture 

provisions are numerous, but at that time I think they 

were relatively few. I think the dog would have been --

would have been customs and excise officers. And the 

"or other officers" would have picked up probably very 

little real -- real instances of property detention.

 MR.SHANMUGAM: Assuming for present 

purposes, Justice Scalia, that the dog here is any 

officer of customs or excise, I think that the critical 

point is that the tail was indeed smaller than it would 

be today because customs and excise officers were among 

the most important federal law enforcement officers.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you --

MR. SHANMUGAM: You know --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but -- but a short 

time ago you said there was no basis for distinguishing 

between excise officers and all other law enforcement 

officers. But there was indeed a basis for it, namely 

that there was an alternative remedy for people 

specifically named in the statute, which is not true of 

all other officers. It's true now, but it wasn't then.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe, first of 

all, that if one looks at this Court's decision in 

Kosak, the Court did not in any way suggest that the

availability of alternative remedies was the sole 

purpose --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not suggesting that, 

but that is a reason for drawing a distinction between 

all others and this particular claim.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Stevens, it 

certainly was one of Congress's primary purposes in 

creating the exceptions generally, but we do believe 

that our interpretation of the statute serves that 

purpose, albeit to a lesser extent perhaps than it 

serves the other congressional purposes, but that was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It didn't serve that 

purpose before 2000.

 MR.SHANMUGAM: It did serve that purpose, 

Justice Stevens, because there was an alternative 

remedy, albeit one that was not federally funded and 

that was a common-law action against a law enforcement 

officer in his personal capacity for negligence.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't it federally 

funded? I thought there was a provision for 

indemnification.

 MR.SHANMUGAM: There was a provision for 

indemnification for revenue officers and other officers 

essentially acting in a revenue capacity, I believe that 

the exact statutory language was "collectors and other

revenue officers" -- and that indemnification provision, 

to be sure, would not have applied to garden variety law 

enforcement officers.

 But in looking at the availability of 

alternative remedies, this Court has never suggested 

that whether that congressional purpose is served 

somehow turns on whether the money came directly from an 

officer or whether it came from the Federal fisc. And 

Petitioner in his reply brief cites Dolan for that 

proposition but whether the alternative remedy was 

federally funded was simply not at issue in Dolan. At 

most the Court concluded that the alternative remedy 

available there was insufficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you actually have any 

information about the early 1940s, about who was a 

Federal law enforcement officer? I think the FBI, the 

Bureau of Prisons -- there were a lot of people being 

detained. There were goods that were having to do with 

contraband, foreign goods, maybe domestic, things you 

weren't supposed to have, food stamps. Illegal 

rations -- OPA -- I mean, you know, there were, you were 

only supposed to have so much food.

 Have we any notion who other law enforcement 

officers might have applied to at that time?

quantify, Justice Breyer, but I do think we have some 

sense historically of the state of play at various law 

enforcement agencies; and the FBI was in a relatively 

nascent stage in 1946. I think the FBI dates from 

approximately the turn of the 20th century. Certainly 

the Bureau of Prisons, while it existed, was detaining 

far fewer people than it does now.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think the FBI had quite a 

big job in World War II.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It did. To be sure, but 

there were not --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there were 

thousands and thousands and thousands of FBI people.

right?

fewer Federal criminal provisions then than there are 

now, and I think that that is one of the reasons why 

we've really seen an explosion in the number of these 

cases as time has gone on, while the FTCA --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, well that might be. 

But I'm sitting in Congress, I read this statute, I 

think maybe they were talking about customs people and 

the like. Now, there is this other word in there, 

that's true. So we look up, where does the other word 

come from? The other word comes from Judge Holtzoff. 

He explained it, we don't have to guess. We can read 

his explanation. His explanation comes in a paragraph 

having to do with customs and excise, and beginning 

with, I'm talking about customs and excise, and the 

additional proviso as special reference, where they use 

this phrase, and then he says it's all supposed to be 

like the Crown Proceedings Committee in England in 1927, 

which in fact had nothing to do with anybody but customs 

and excise.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do the members of Congress 

who voted on this language, when it was presented to 

them, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, they may very well --

effect before one of the committees?

MR. SHANMUGAM: He did testify before one of

but as this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: 15 years before it was 

passed, right?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 15 years before it was 

passed, Judge Holtzoff wrote this report, and as both 

the majority and Justice Stevens in his dissenting 

opinion in Kosak observed, there was no evidence that 

this report was even introduced into the legislative 

record.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if it was not -- I 

mean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a 

pretty well known person in the legal community and I 

would suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that 

quite a few did know who he was. And I suspect that 

when Congress passes a technical bill, they are 

interested in the views of the Department of Justice and 

these were those views.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. I want to --

legislative history sources for those members of the 

Court who are interested in legislative history, we 

recognized that the Holtzoff report should not be 

afforded great weight. But that having been said, I 

want to address directly the language you cite from the 

Holtzoff report, because I believe that that language if 

anything supports our position, and not Petitioners, 

because in the relevant sentence of the Holtzoff report, 

Judge Holtzoff wrote that the additional proviso, 

meaning the detention of property clause, has special 

reference to the detention of imported goods in 

appraisers' warehouses or customs houses as well as 

seizures by law enforcement officials, Internal Revenue 

officers and the like. Now Petitioner --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any 

legislative history about what Judge Holtzoff meant by 

that?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, one could make the 

argument that that legislative history is itself 

ambiguous; and indeed the D.C. Circuit in adopting 

Petitioner's construction itself acknowledged that at 

best, the legislative history was as unclear as the 

statute.

 All I mean to suggest is that Petitioner 

does not have available to him any sort of ejusdem

generis argument in construing that sentence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I think in reading 

that, I think that's a good point. My actual reading of 

it, of that paragraph 2, is that it's not free of 

ambiguity. I completely agree with you. And if I read 

through it, then I'm making up my mind as a judge, well, 

how do I feel about what these words likely show and how 

people in Congress would have interpreted that kind of 

reference or statement in testimony by a person who 

thought this? Free of ambiguity, I agree with you, it 

isn't. But it might cut somewhat more in favor of the 

Petitioners than the Respondents.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think, Justice 

Breyer, with all respect, that this is not a case in 

which very much of a conclusion can be drawn from the 

legislative history one way or another. We have this 

language from the Holtzoff report which I admit, you 

know, could be susceptible to the same sorts of 

arguments that Petitioner is making with regard to what 

we feel is the unambiguous language of the statute. But 

other than that the only thing that my friend has Mr. 

Andre has cited are these summaries in various 

congressional reports which essentially summarize in 

shorthand, often in a single sentence, all of the 

proposed exceptions in the FTCA; and none of those

summaries so much as refers to the "and any other law 

enforcement officer" language at all. In fact, some of 

the summaries on which Petitioner relies do not even 

cite the detention of property exception at all.

 So this is, in our view, a case in which at 

most, the legislative history is simply silent. And we 

are left, I think, and indeed we should start with the 

text of the statute, and we have the unambiguous phrase 

"or any other law enforcement officer" in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have a difference 

with Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law 

enforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents. 

In your brief you say that's a rare occurrence. And 

Mr. Andre says oh no, it's quite common. So which is 

it?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we do believe that it 

is a rare occurrence, but in some sense, Justice 

Ginsburg, I think that the answer to that question 

depends on exactly what it is that Petitioner means when 

he says that an officer is acting in a customs or tax 

capacity. And with the Court's leave, I'd like to offer 

at least three possible explanations for what that means 

and then explain why each of them would be an erroneous 

interpretation for this Court to adopt, and each of 

these three explanations I should add, appear at various

points in Petitioner's brief.

 The first is that an officer is acting in a 

customs or tax capacity when the officer is actually 

acting in a revenue collecting capacity. And we believe 

that if the Court were to adopt that limitation, there 

really are no actual cases of which we are aware that 

would fall within that language. And indeed, it would 

cast some doubt on the meaning of the preceding phrase 

"any officer of customs or excise" because one might 

very well wonder whether under Petitioner's construction 

that phrase should also be limited to a revenue 

collecting capacity.

 The second possible explanation is that an 

officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity when the 

officer is more generally acting to enforce the customs 

or tax laws, that is to say, the provisions of Title 19 

or 26 of the United States Code. But we believe that 

that interpretation, too, would suffer from the same two 

deficiencies that I've already identified and would also 

suffer from a third, namely, to the extent that 

Petitioner relies for his noscitur a sociis argument on 

the assessment of taxes clause, that limitation would 

actually sweep more broadly than the mere assessment of 

taxes.

 So the third possible interpretation and the

one that we're left with, I think, is that an officer is 

acting in a customs or tax capacity whenever the officer 

is actually performing a function that is performed by 

customs or excise Internal Revenue officers. But if 

anything, that limitation would exclude only a very 

small number of cases apart from cases in the prison 

context such as this one, because as Petitioner himself 

recognizes, customs officers have virtually plenary 

authority to enforce the criminal provisions of the 

United States Code.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are all customs and excise 

officers law enforcement officers?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: All customs officers, by 

statute, have law- enforcement authority, and that is 

under, I believe, 19 U.S.C. 1589(a).

 Now, to be sure, there are people employed 

by the Customs Service, now ICE and CBP components of 

the Department of Homeland Security, who wouldn't 

qualify as customs officers.

 There are secretaries and other people 

employed there that don't that statutory definition.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are there other 

circumstances in which, let's say, goods are being 

shipped into the country, and the -- the shipment is 

detained by someone who is not a law-enforcement

officer, at least under the definition in subsection 

(h), someone who has the power to execute searches, 

seize evidence, and make arrests?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think they typically would 

be, and I'm not aware of any examples in which they 

would not be, because customs officers are the vast 

majority of people who are employed by the various 

customs-related agencies.

 And the same is true, I would note, with 

regard to Internal Revenue officers. One of the 

oddities of this statute is that Judge Holtzoff, rather 

than using the known term "Internal Revenue Officer," 

actually used this phrase "officer of excise," seemingly 

borrowing from the British bill.

 And we believe that, at most, that phrase 

would have to refer to an Internal Revenue officer 

acting in an excise- collecting capacity. But, to the 

extent that "excise officer" has a narrower meaning than 

"Internal Revenue officer," we believe that that 

actually supports our construction, because it would 

have been quite peculiar for Judge Holtzoff and Congress 

to have referred only to an excise officer and not to an 

Internal Revenue officer if they had meant to limit the 

residual phrase "any other law-enforcement officer" to 

officers acting in a customs or tax capacity.

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you -- have you found 

any -- any research on that? I mean I think that's a 

very interesting point that -- that -- have you found 

any book I could look at or report that -- that would 

cast some light on whether at that time, 1946, the 

phrase "other law enforcement officers" referred to a 

large number of people who had a lot of different tasks 

that had not much to do with customs or excise?

 If so, this would be an odd way of sneaking 

them into the bill. That's who it would look like.

 On the other hand, if there were just a few 

of them, well, then, the bill, at worst, is a little bit 

more than somebody might have thought; and it would 

appear perfectly normal to a legislator. So is -- is 

there anything to look at?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I wish that I could point to 

such a book, Justice Breyer. I know that, in doing my 

own research, what I did was simply to go on the 

Internet and go to the website's of various Federal 

law-enforcement agencies and try to get a sense of when 

they were established.

 But, unfortunately, as I said earlier, I was 

just unable to obtain any numbers as to how much 

officers these various agencies had, and the like.

 But I think that, more broadly, certainly

Congress knew what the phrase "any other law enforcement 

officer" meant. And Judge Holtzoff proposed this 

language in what would become the bill that was 

introduced in December of 1931.

 The FTCA was, of course, ultimately enacted 

in 1946, and I think that one of the difficulties in 

attempting to look to this legislative history, which, 

as I say, we believe is silent, is that you're talking 

about, you know, a number of Congresses over many years.

 And, to be sure, this Court has looked to 

these same legislative history sources in prior 

decisions construing the FTCA. But, you know, I do 

think that we are left with the plain language here. 

And we are also left with Congress's underlying policy 

objectives, and I do want to say a word about the other 

two policy objectives on which this court relied in 

Kosak which --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, before you 

get into policy, may I just suggest that there is a 

possible fourth category, really. You had mentioned 

three, and one -- a fourth possibility might be 

"law-enforcement officer," in a very broad sense of the 

term, but one who is simply providing, let's say, 

protective service in aid ultimately of the revenue 

laws.

And the reason I have thought of this is 

that this sort of situation went on in my -- my native 

State in this past month, in which the United States 

Marshal Service, which at the time all of these statutes 

were enacted was a fairly large agency, took control of 

some real estate in -- in New Hampshire which had been 

the property, or was the property, of tax protesters.

 And they -- they held custody of that. They 

took control of that real estate for about a week to 

make sure that there were no booby traps and bombs that 

-- that would -- that would blow up the IRS people when 

they went in there to enforce their tax liens.

 That would be an example of "law-enforcement 

officer" in a very broad sense. It could cover the 

Marshal service, the FBI, and whatnot; and, yet, the --

and No. 2, they would be exercising, you know, typical 

law-enforcement functions, protective functions. And, 

yet, they would be doing so in -- in aid of -- of the 

tax or the revenue laws.

 That would be a plausible reason for -- for 

sticking in the general phrase, and it would be a 

plausible reading of the phrase, wouldn't it?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Justice Souter, I 

think, with no disrespect to the good law-enforcement 

officers of New Hampshire, that these cases come up far

more rarely in the Federal context, because both customs 

officers and Internal Revenue officers are 

law-enforcement officers who have, I think, quite a 

refined capability. They carry weapons, and they are, I 

think, usually very well prepared to kill if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do IRS agents have -- have 

expertise in -- bomb detection and dismantling?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: There certainly might very 

well be cases in which they would feel the need to call 

in the FBI or other law- enforcement agencies. But I do 

think that it is telling that in the 60-year history of 

the FTCA there don't appear to be any cases that fall 

into that category.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there don't seem to 

be many cases because -- I mean that's why we've got 

this one at this point.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are quite a few 

cases more generally. I think that there are something 

in the neighborhood of 17 prior decisions in the courts 

of appeals alone involving these fact patterns or 

similar ones.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Over what period of time?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Over the 60-year period of 

the enactment of the FTCA.

that's not a deluge of litigation. I mean it seems to 

me there is reason to assume that no matter what reading 

we give it, there is a plausible reading that can come 

up that -- that confines the actual application of the 

"other law-enforcement officer" fairly narrowly.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: But our fundamental 

submission, Justice Souter, is that there is no good 

textual reason for confining the phrase "any other 

law-enforcement officer," because that phrase, in our 

view, is unambiguous.

 And, notably, Petitioner in his brief and at 

oral argument does not directly contend that there is 

any ambiguity in that phrase, itself. And this Court 

has noted, in applying both the noscitur a sociis and 

the ejusdem generis canons of construction, that where 

the relevant phrase to which a limiting construction is 

being applied is itself unambiguous, that that is the 

end of the inquiry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the question of 

what is -- what is ambiguous or not is -- is a question 

of context. And if you take the phrase "law-enforcement 

officer," and you say is that ambiguous, and you say 

well, gee, no.

 But if you stick it in this particular 

statute and it happens to follow these specific

references to tax gatherers and tax and excise laws, 

then it seems to me it's fair to say it does become 

ambiguous, because it gives rise to a reasonable 

question.

 Were they just getting at law-enforcement 

officers who were performing these kinds of functions, 

or did they really mean it as broadly as the phrase in 

real isolation would have meant? That's ambiguity, and 

that's what we've got here.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I don't believe that that's 

correct, Justice Souter, and the reason that I don't 

believe that that is correct is because this Court has 

suggested that the starting point is the relevant phrase 

that is being interpreted.

 And here we have the phrase "any other law 

enforcement- officer."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But then you are saying, 

don't read the statute as a whole. That argument, in 

effect, is saying isolate the phrase -- and we don't do 

that.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, Justice Souter. I 

think that where the phrase is unambiguous, this Court 

has suggested that the inquiry is at an end, and, to 

take an example --

make the assumption that it's unambiguous, your argument 

is unassailable. But if I don't make that assumption, 

then your argument risks circularity.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And my suggestion is that 

it is the context that makes your argument a tough sell.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Let me try to explain to you 

why you should make that assumption, and it is because 

Congress here used the word "any."

 And this Court has repeatedly noted that 

where Congress uses the word "any," it is substantial 

evidence that Congress intends a phrase to be construed 

broadly. And this Court has specifically refused to 

apply the ejusdem generis canon to phrases introduced by 

the word "any" on precisely the ground I cite, namely, 

because they conclude that that phrase is unambiguous.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you are talking about 

the use of the word "any" all by itself. Here it says 

"any officer or customs or excise or other" -- "or 

other," and you would just take those words out of the 

statute.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we wouldn't be taking 

the words out of the statute, because we do believe --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you believe they add 

nothing to the text of the statute.

MR. SHANMUGAM: They add nothing to the text 

of the statute in the sense that Congress could have 

written the statute to refer to any law-enforcement 

officer. That is certainly true. That is also true 

with regard to all of the statutes and constitutional 

provisions that we cite in footnote 11 of our brief. 

And, indeed, in some sense, it would be true with regard 

to Petitioner's proposed construction insofar as 

Congress could easily have written a statute that simply 

referred to any law-enforcement officer acting in a 

customs or tax capacity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There are two "anys" here. 

I'm not sure that --

MR. SHANMUGAM: I'm certainly referring to 

the "any" that modifies "any other law enforcement 

officer."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any other. So it says any 

goods by any officer of customs or excise, or if it just 

had said "other law enforcement officer," you might --

you might disregard the force of any because it was way 

back there.

MR. SHANMUGAM: That's right. And contrary 

to Mr. Andre's submission, this Court has made precisely 

that point in Harrison v. PPG Industries, in which the 

Court was construing a similar phrase that referred to 

"any other final action by an EPA administrator." And 

that came after a series of specific final actions to 

which the statute referred. And the Court actually 

said, in so many words, it might be different if the 

word "any" were omitted, but we believe that the 

inclusion of "any" renders that phrase unambiguous.

 And I would note as well, Justice Souter, 

that in your dissenting opinion to be sure in Circuit 

City in footnote 2, you cited all of these very cases on 

which I'm relying now in support of your proffered 

construction of the statute.

saying he had his prayer rug and Koran, and the 

government lost them and he didn't get any compensation? 

Does he have any remedy?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure, Justice Ginsburg. And 

the answer is, yes, that he does. He does have an 

administrative remedy.

 And I'd like to say just a couple of things 

about the available administrative remedies.

 First of all, any claimant who claims that a 

Federal agency, including a Federal law enforcement 

agency negligently damaged his or her property, would 

have a claim under 31 U.S.C. 3723 for up to $1,000. 

That statute, which we cite in a footnote, I believe in 

our brief, would cover the vast majority of claims 

involving the Bureau of Prisons.

 There's actually another Federal statute, 31 

U.S.C. 3724, which provides a further remedy against the 

Department of Justice for up to $50,000 for personal 

injury or property damage caused by a law enforcement 

officer. And critically, that statute expressly makes 

clear that it applies where the FTCA does not. And so 

that administrative remedy would be fully available.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no court --

there's no court role in that process.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: There is no court role in

that process, but the Bureau of Prisons routinely 

processes these administrative claims. As we note in 

our brief, there were 12,000 such claims over the last 

three years. The Bureau of Prisons has procedures for 

processing those claims. It paid out something in the 

neighborhood of 1,100 of those claims.

 And there's no reason to think that the 

Bureau of Prisons would alter those procedures if the 

Court were to hold in this case that there is no 

judicial remedy. Indeed, the Bureau of Prisons has paid 

out on such claims even in circuits that have adopted 

our interpretation.

 I do want to say just a word about the 

underlying policy considerations, because to the extent 

that members of the Court feel that the statute is 

ambiguous, we believe that they strongly support our 

construction.

 In Kosak, this Court analyzed two other 

policy considerations in addition to the avoidance of 

duplicative remedies: First, protecting important 

government functions from the threat of suit; and 

second, avoiding exposure to fraudulent claims. And we 

believe that those concerns are particularly implicated 

in the prison context which constitutes the mine run of 

cases in this area. Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Shanmugam.

 Mr. Andre, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. ANDRE: I'd like to first address the 

government's resistance to making any concession that 

the statute is ambiguous. First of all, if the 

statutory language in this case was so clear, then so 

must the statutory language in Circuit City. The 

language had started out with the words "any other," and 

clearly then were followed by words that have a very 

plain meaning out of context, "any worker engaged in 

interstate or foreign commerce."

 We just don't believe that the government's 

position that the statute is unambiguous can be squared 

with that case. Nor do we think as a factual matter 

that the statute is unambiguous.

 In particular, we think it would have been 

strange for this Court in Kosak to go out of its way in 

a footnote and expressly decline to resolve today's 

question presented if the detention of property clause, 

in particular the "law enforcement officer" phrase, had 

only one clear meaning.

 And then on top of that, as we noted in our

reply brief, five courts of appeals have adopted our 

construction; two other circuit judges have written 

separately. The total is 16 circuit judges that have 

found our position to be credible, found the statute to 

be ambiguous, applied the canons of construction that we 

are urging the Court to apply today, and then resolved 

the case in our favor

 So if, if the statute is truly unambiguous, 

then those 16 circuit judges not only got this issue 

wrong, they got it very wrong.

 Justice Breyer, I unfortunately don't have an 

example either of what other types of law enforcement 

officers were out there at the time of the FTCA's 

enactment, but I do have one example, and that would be 

the Elliott Ness and the Al Capone investigation.

 Elliott Ness was in charge of running a group 

of -- in charge of supervising a group of government 

agents who were part of the Department of Justice, even 

though Elliott Ness himself was a treasury agent. And 

they were all trying enforce the Volstead Act, but -- to 

get Al Capone on charges of income tax evasion. And so 

we believe that that's a nice example from the early 

1930s when Judge Holtzoff drafted this language that 

shows that you could have a revenue officer working 

with -- in fact, supervising other law enforcement

officers, and they are all really doing the same thing.

 As far as the policy considerations are 

concerned, we believe that the government's reliance on 

the two other general purposes for the FTCA exceptions 

just prove too much. Pretty much any governmental 

function is important. And so the government in every 

brief they filed on this issue below and in pretty much 

every FTCA exception case that we've seen has come in 

and said, oh, but our interests are served by these two 

other purposes, and therefore, this statutory exemption 

has to be construed narrowly.

 Again, as a factual matter, we don't think that 

their concerns are really all that well founded, in any 

event. True, there were 12,000 administrative claims filed 

by Federal prisoners over the last three years. But as we 

pointed out in footnote 12 of our cert petition, there 

were only 16 cases filed in all of 2006 by Federal 

prisoners under this statute. 

settlement process is working, and that also Federal 

prisoners are just not bringing suit and there is a very 

good reason for. That it's the Federal filing fee. 

That's $455. My client's claim in this case is $177.

 Prisoners don't evaluate whether to sue based 

on some sophisticated reading of sovereign immunity 

doctrines and ambiguous statutory text. They, you know,

they think about their wallet. They make $2.50 a day, 

and it's just not worth it for them to risk --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't they have IFP 

status?

 MR. ANDRE: Even if a prisoner gets IFP 

status, they still have to pay the full filing fee. The 

IFP status only allows them to pay in installments. So 

it's debited off their account. So they still make a 

very real calculation when they decide whether to sue 

based on how much is at stake and how much is it going 

to cost me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there wasn't that 

much at stake.

 MR. ANDRE: That's correct. There was $177 

at stake and so perhaps my client shouldn't have sued 

because it didn't make a lot of sense, although he also 

did file the suit a couple years earlier when the filing 

fee was lower. But in our experience, prisoners they 

are not going to typically sue for these kinds of 

claims. This is nothing like the Prison Litigation 

Reform Act problem we had in Jones V. Bock, where there 

are 24,000 cases coming before the Federal courts every 

year. That's just not something we envisioned.

 So we don't think that adopting any one of 

the four constructions discussed are debated between my

friend and Justice Souter would somehow open up the 

floodgates here and lead to a lot of prisoners suing 

under this particular provision. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Andre. The case is submitted.
