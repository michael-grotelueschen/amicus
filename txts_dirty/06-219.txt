 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

 General Garre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Respondent asks this Court to recognize a 

new constitutional tort under Bivens and the Just 

Compensation Clause --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, could you crank 

up the thing? The sound isn't working, I don't think, 

Mr. Garre.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it needs a 

little upcranking.

 Good.

 MR. GARRE: Hopefully that's better.

 -- recognize a new constitutional tort under 

Bivens and the Just Compensation Clause that would 

subject public officials to personal liability for 

conduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking. 

Recognizing that constitutional tort would require this 

Court to extend Bivens to an entirely new context, it

would disregard limits that have existed for centuries 

on Just Compensation Clause claims, and it would skew 

the enforcement of important public land use objectives 

and thereby threaten public resources and public lands.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, there's a 

record here that the district court said there was 

substantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a 

pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on 

this man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray, 

videotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the 

grazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the 

Bureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle? This 

man says, this has been done to me by officers of my 

government. Is there a remedy?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, there are a 

number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent 

this alleged conduct and that he did invoke. We don't 

think that there is a remedy under Bivens or an inferred 

action under the Just Compensation Clause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is, what is 

there that will really be effective, because if you tell 

me challenging each citation for violating the grazing 

permit --

MR. GARRE: He can challenge the citations 

for challenging the -- canceling the grazing permits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the behavior 

will continue and he'll get one more and one more and 

one more.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I don't think that that's 

a reasonable inference, Justice Ginsburg.  In fact, the 

IBLA considered and rejected each of the alleged 

administrative actions on which his claim is now based.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask a quick 

question. I had the same list of alleged acts, and I 

think many of them are uncontested, that Justice 

Ginsburg mentioned. Just as a matter of policy, can you 

inform me, when the Solicitor General's Office takes 

this case do you look into whether any of these things 

happen and the Justice Department issues a warning, 

don't do this any more? If these things are as Justice 

Ginsburg explained you don't defend all of those 

actions?

 MR. GARRE: Well, our position is that he 

hasn't established a constitutional tort or an 

actionable claim under RICO.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that. I know that.

 MR. GARRE: To answer your question, the 

Government takes these types of allegations seriously. 

It's taken seriously at the line level at the Bureau of 

Land Management. It's taken seriously within the

Department of Interior and it's taken seriously at the 

Department of Justice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if this, if this 

continues, your argument -- and I understand your 

argument that there's no essential free-standing cause 

of action for damages -- basically means he has a right 

to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each 

individual incursion, each individual wrong.

 Well, again that assumes that he wouldn't 

get any relief out of the IBLA. That assumes that if he 

had gone to the IBLA and said, you canceled my grazing 

permits for grounds that weren't valid, that the BLM 

would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct. In 

fact, the IBLA --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that's exactly what 

he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a 

five-year period.

 MR. GARRE: But we know from the decisions 

of the IBLA that he did challenge that they rejected the 

grounds that he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They may be wrong, too. 

They may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as 

the officers who conducted it. And there are indeed 

those in the West who think that the BLM does, does act 

quite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld

by, by the, the administrative courts. Now, if that's a 

problem, what's the solution to that problem?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Scalia, to bring 

an APA action to Federal court challenging the final 

decisions of the IBLA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's one by one. Every 

time there is another trespass he has to go all the way 

through the administrative procedure and then when the, 

when the administrative court says, well, it was okay, 

then he has to go through the regular Federal courts. 

That doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for 

somebody who claims he's being systematically harassed 

for five years as, as is the claim here.

 MR. GARRE: Again, I think you have to 

assume that his claims would not succeed either at the 

administrative level or at the APA level, and if he 

got --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't assume that at all. 

Even if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes, 

you're right, they trespassed, good for you. I mean, 

what is the remedy if they did trespass? What 

administrative remedy does he obtain.

 MR. GARRE: Well, if there's a trespass he 

can go, he can obtain an action under the Federal Tort 

Claims Act. A trespass is an unauthorized taking.

That's the way that this Court has treated it 1952 in 

the Hasselly case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- the photographing 

of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and 

they pay him for that. And then he claims that the BLM 

follows them just to harass them, just taking 

photographs. What relief could he get for that?

 MR. GARRE: Well, he claimed that they were 

trespassing on his lands.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume they wasn't 

trespassing.

 MR. GARRE: Well, he'd raised that objection 

before the IBLA and the IBLA concluded, and we think 

reasonably, that, given the history of the disputes with 

this individual, given his litigious nature, that it was 

reasonable for the BLM officials who were out there to 

be documenting his trespasses on public lands, and 

that's an important dimension of this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was one 

aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the 

Government was doing it on its own land, on public land. 

They had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they 

weren't trespassing, they were just making the guests 

feel uncomfortable.

 MR. GARRE: To document, to document his

trespasses on other lands, and that's -- the citation to 

the IBLA decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief 

and it discusses that allegation in depth.

 In any event --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would really like to 

have your answer to my opening question, and I said: If 

your only answer is each time something, he is charged 

by the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a 

lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the 

briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths. He doesn't 

want that. He wants to say: Stop, stop this whole 

pattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern. How 

does he get that remedy?

 MR. GARRE: He does not have a remedy under 

the Just Compensation Clause or Bivens, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does, what does he 

have?

 MR. GARRE: He can challenge, he can 

challenge these actions under the administrative process 

available to him under the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Piecemeal.

 MR. GARRE: -- APA --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Piecemeal.

contexts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have any action 

that is other than piecemeal?

 MR. GARRE: He has to challenge each 

administrative action --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it the answer is 

no.

 MR. GARRE: -- that he claims is unlawful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were any of these 

administrative actions found to be unfounded? In other 

words, did he win any of the trespass citations?

 MR. GARRE: He did not. In fact, the IBLA 

found that the BLM had a right of administrative access 

to cross his lands to get to public lands which it was 

administering. And again, this case would have been 

quite different if the IBLA had found that the BLM 

officers were acting without legitimate authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm surprised you say 

piecemeal. I would have thought most agencies in the 

government have like an inspector general or someone 

that you can complain.

 MR. GARRE: And they do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You can write them a letter 

and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been 

trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I

want you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to 

do something about it. And if they don't do anything 

about it, you go to your senator. Maybe you can go to 

the newspapers. I mean, has any of that happened here?

 MR. GARRE: It has, Justice Breyer. It has.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And what's been the result 

of that?

 MR. GARRE: The result of that is it was 

determined that these actions by these line officers of 

the Bureau of Land Management were perfectly 

appropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has 

systematically violated the permits and conditions that 

are found --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who made that, who made 

that determination, including the selective citations?

 MR. STARR: I believe there was an inspector 

general investigation, investigation within the 

Department of Interior that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Department 

of Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they 

told the line people at BLM to stop.

 MR. GARRE: There was a settlement 

agreement, Justice Ginsburg. But the Department of 

Interior stands behind the actions that are issued, at 

issue in this case, and I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nonetheless, they did 

enter a settlement which included that this behavior was 

going to stop.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I'm not sure that that's a 

fair characterization. I mean, like any party to 

litigation, any party to multiple lawsuits and claims, 

there are many reasons why it might be deemed in the 

interest of a person to agree to a settlement. And I 

don't think it's fair to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree at least 

to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this 

proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the 

district court said on summary judgment, there was 

sufficient evidence to go to a trial. That that's true. 

So we have to accept his allegations that there were 

selective citations for violations of grazing -- grazing 

laws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the 

place up?

 MR. GARRE: This Court has to accept those 

factual allegations, to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So that's --

MR. GARRE: -- to be sure. But the court 

of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's the case we 

have. And you're telling me that the only remedy a

citizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to 

fight these actions one by one?

 MR. GARRE: That's a fulsome remedy, Justice 

Ginsburg, when you think of the claims that could be 

brought administratively under the Administrative 

Procedures Act, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, to 

receive damages, to receive injunctions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What damages would you get 

for the trespass of a -- one, one BLM agent on your 

land? A lot of money you're going to get for that?

 Would it, would it come anywhere close to 

reimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to 

go, to go all the way through the litigation?

 MR. GARRE: If the allegation is that these 

trespasses have in effect deprived me of my property 

which is my business, then conceivably he could make a 

request for a large amount of damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't say it deprived 

him of his property which is his business.

 MR. GARRE: No, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He is saying it's a 

trespass; get off my land.

 MR. GARRE: He, he has made both claims, 

Justice Scalia. And I think -- he has, he has 

complained about BLM officials exercising the right of

administrative access, which has been confirmed at the 

administrative level and which is well settled. And he 

has made the more general complaint that these 

trespasses have -- and interfered with his businesses 

and interfered with his property. He filed a, a bond in 

this Court seeking, claiming the damages were in several 

million dollars related to the business. So that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can he get injunctive 

relief? Can he get injunctive relief? You said 

something about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin 

conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated 

taking.

 Can he have this litany of things that have 

happened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those 

MR. GARRE: Certainly he could under the 

APA. He could challenge the administrative actions he 

complained about, and if court concludes those are 

unauthorized or unconstitutional he could obtain an 

injunction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He can bring, he can 

bring this, he could bring this not one action at a 

time, but he could complain all at once about 

everything?

 MR. GARRE: Well, the other thing to keep in

mind is that many of these discrete administrative 

actions -- for example, take the cancellation of the 

permits. That was based on a course of conduct that 

included 20 formal trespasses, disregarding trespass 

notices by the BLM, 20 violations of his grazing 

permits. All of that would be part of a record before 

the IBLA and before a Federal court in an APA. It would 

have an opportunity to review those allegations and 

determine whether or not the alleged Federal action was 

unlawful. And if a court believed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He could -- he could not 

go into a Federal court with a Federal question? He 

would have to go to the initial decision maker, then the 

I --

MR. GARRE: He would have to exhaust his 

administrative remedies, just like any number of other 

people who believe that they have been wronged by the 

Federal Government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Part of his claim is -- is 

selective enforcement. You know, maybe he did trespass, 

maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land. 

But they are beating on him because of what they say is 

his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the 

Government is entitled to.

 To what extent was any of the administrative

approval of the BLM agents' actions, to what extent was 

that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this 

reciprocal easement from him? Because I don't see that 

it's legitimate at all.

 MR. GARRE: Well, the I -- let me answer 

that in two ways. First the IBLA found that there was 

not an effort to extort or blackmail Mr. -- the 

Respondent for exercising his rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that because the 

Government was entitled to the reciprocal easement? Is 

that why they said that?

 MR. GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't extortion because 

he should have given the easement.

 MR. GARRE: No. I don't think that's what 

the IBLA found and we cite the part of the IBLA record 

at footnote 2 of our reply brief.

 Secondly it's well established that the 

Government can seek reciprocal arrangements with respect 

to property. The Court in the Leo Sheep case forced the 

Government to seek reciprocal arrangements.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not after, not after they 

have already given away -- I mean, yes; they could come 

to him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us 

this easement we'll give you yet another one.

MR. GARRE: That's true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he had one in, from the 

past, which -- which his predecessor had given a 

reciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to 

record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.

 MR. GARRE: That's true. But I think it's 

important to keep in mind the scope of the claim before 

the Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they're mad at him for 

not giving back that easement which they failed to 

record.

 MR. GARRE: The BLM doesn't have to stop 

enforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses 

to enter into reciprocal arrangements. There are 

thousands of reciprocal arrangements.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't be reciprocal. 

What was the Government offering to give him in exchange 

for his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they 

had failed to record? What was the Government giving 

him in exchange?

 MR. GARRE: A valuable right-of-way, Justice 

Scalia, that - that was for 30 years, that covered 14 

miles of public road --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what his 

predecessor had.

JUSTICE SCALIA: He had that already.

 MR. GARRE: Well, but that did not convey 

with the property. It had to be reassigned in order for 

Mr. Robbins to take advantage of that right-of-way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I did not -- I did not 

understand that.

 MR. GARRE: Absolutely. And it's in the 

regulations. The right-of-way has to be reassigned, and 

it wasn't going to be reassigned because Respondent 

refused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because 

he refused to make rental payments.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As originally negotiated, 

with I think Nelson. Was the right-of-way cancellable 

at any time? Or how long would the right-of-way last?

 MR. GARRE: The right-of-way was for 30 

years which was long than the 20-year easement that the 

Government got in exchange. And this something that was 

negotiated at arm's length by parties that didn't have 

the acrimonious relationship that developed between 

Respondent and the BLM.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- I 

think part of what's happening here is there is 

difference between the regulation on the books and how 

they are enforced. Just as a hypothetical, let's say 

they don't -- the Government doesn't get its reciprocal

easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally 

don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but 

we are going to go by the book with this guy until he 

gives us the right-of-way. Every time his cattle cross 

over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass 

citation. They don't do it for anybody else but, 

they're going to do it for him because they want to get 

the reciprocal right-of-way. Is that appropriate or 

inappropriate?

 MR. GARRE: Well, first I don't think it 

gives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just 

Compensation Clause. Second --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that he can't --

but you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one. 

But actually each one, his cattle did trespass, so he 

doesn't have a good case. It's just that out in the 

West they don't actually give citations every time a cow 

crosses the river.

 MR. GARRE: Then I, then I don't think he is 

a very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he 

is entitled to violate BLM rules or regulations. There 

is a certain amount of give and take that we think is 

inherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think 

that the Just Compensation Clause tolerates.

 These are, the Just Compensation Clause or

property rights here are protected fundamentally by 

State law. That's why any unauthorized action by the 

Government is a trespass, which is, which is dealt with 

under State law. The Just Compensation --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it a State law 

matter? Why didn't he know about this possibility? Why 

didn't he know that his predecessor in title had 

granted? Why wasn't there an actual notice, given the 

fact that everybody in this area of the country seems as 

a matter of course to give mutually beneficial 

rights-of-way? I agree it wasn't recorded.

 MR. GARRE: I think he was on notice. The 

BLM made a determination that because it wasn't 

recorded, it wouldn't seek to enforce that against 

Respondent. It may be that it was -- it made a legal 

error on that; I don't know. But it made that 

determination --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a given in the 

record. The record is that he was not on notice. So 

whether one says, gee that's unlikely if he wasn't --

MR. GARRE: But in any event, the point is 

that the BLM recognized that it had to negotiate a new 

reciprocal arrangement with Respondent and it sought to 

do so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's trying to cover

for its own sloppiness or carelessness in not 

recording --

MR. GARRE: Well, it, it's trying to seek, 

establish a new reciprocal arrangement. Regardless of 

why it was back in the position of having to do so, it 

did so in a way that it did in any number of other 

situations that did arise.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I ask you about the 

Bivens theory here before your time runs out? Doesn't 

Davis versus Passman help the Respondent here?

 MR. GARRE: I, I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I think what is distinct about the Bivens claim here is 

first Bivens and Just Compensation Clause claims are 

fundamentally incompatible. And that in Bivens, its 

damages are nothing. Here the constitutional right 

actually explicitly provides a remedy, just 

compensation. Secondly, just compensation claims are 

claims against the Government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well that's because we 

assume it's focused just on his property and that the 

property was ultimately the thing that was in issue. 

But if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and 

wrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to 

this dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly 

read, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to

get a remedy against the Government.

 MR. GARRE: Well -- two points. First, 

Davis versus Passman was decided in a day in which this 

Court was much more likely to infer new causes of action 

from the Constitution or from statutes. The Court in 

its recent cases, most recently Malesko, has said that 

it's sworn off that habit, and it's refused to recognize 

any new Bivens action in 25 years since those cases were 

decided.

 Secondly, the Respondent here has ample 

remedies and avenues that he could seek. If he believes 

that there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek 

damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we think --

suppose we disagree with you on the latter point. We 

think he is really in a bind; there's not really 

anything he can do. Doesn't that invoke the Davis 

versus Passman rationale?

 MR. GARRE: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: To expand -- it would be 

an expansion of Bivens.

 MR. GARRE: It would be closer to it but the 

Court would still have to confront the question of 

whether it would be appropriate to infer a 

constitutional tort under the Just Compensation Clause.

And we would urge the Court not to do so.

 There is an overarching question here of 

qualified immunity. Whatever is true with respect to 

whether this new constitutional tort should be created 

towards other claims before the Court, the Petitioners 

on this case were not on clear notice that their actions 

in responding to someone who had systematically violated 

the rules and regulations, which -- on the books for 

some time -- would subject them to personal damages 

actions and in fact treble damages under the RICO 

statute. For that, for that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If a -- including, you 

know, busting into his lodge and disrupting the 

furniture and all of that, they thought that that was 

probably --

MR. GARRE: Well, if that's true --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- probably allowed?

 MR. GARRE: If that's -- they would be on 

notice, that that conduct if true could subject them to 

a tort action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. There 

is no decision that the court of appeals or 

Respondent has pointed to that would put the Petitioners 

here on notice in the specific situation they 

confronted, that their actions could subject them to a 

constitutional tort which had never been recognized by

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a test for -- for 

-- for qualified immunity? You have to know -- not 

only --

MR. GARRE: You have to have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not enough to know 

that your action was wrongful? You have to know the 

particular statute or constitutional provision under 

which a remedy would be sought?

 MR. GARRE: Yes. The first question is 

whether he has established a violation of the right. 

And the rights that are alleged in this case that are 

before this Court, or a right under the compensation 

clause of the Fifth Amendment to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're suggesting 

they would not be immune from a State law trespass 

action?

 MR. GARRE: No. The -- the -- the Congress 

has waived the sovereign immunity from those types of 

claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

MR. GARRE: It's against the United States 

if they are acting within the scope of their conduct. 

If it's unauthorized actions outside the scope of the 

conduct, then they can go directly against the 

individuals. That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then it wouldn't be a 

Federal Tort Claims Act.

 MR. GARRE: Well, then it would be 

additional suits in State court. They could also --

there are also State, Federal and criminal laws that 

they could seek to invoke or have invoked. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But respect to the RICO 

claim, assuming the RICO claim is upheld, what do you 

say to your brother's argument that there is no history 

of qualified immunity for RICO claims? That the 

qualified immunity doctrine addresses the, the kind of 

development of squishier law under -- under 1983. So 

that you simply have not qualified immunity.

 MR. GARRE: Two things, Justice Souter. 

First the argument was not raised below; we don't think 

it's properly before the Court.

 Second, the question under qualified 

immunity, and this Court made this clear in the Wyatt 

case and again in the Knight case, it doesn't look to

the particular offense. It looks to the nature of the 

responsibility that the Government officials are 

performing. And here the nature of the responsibilities 

are enforcing grazing permits, enforcing access to 

public lands, activities that BLM officials have 

discretion and have had discretion for more than a 

century to enforce. And we think that falls squarely 

within the rubric of qualified immunity.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well that may be a very --

it seems to me that those may be good arguments, or at 

least relevant arguments against the applicability of 

RICO in the first place. But if RICO is found to have 

been violated, I take it it would be an extension of 

qualified immunity jurisprudence --

MR. GARRE: I don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to, to apply it to a 

RICO defendant.

 MR. GARRE: With respect, I don't think it 

would be. First, the large portion of the courts of 

appeals that have addressed this have concluded that 

qualified immunity principles do extend to RICO. And 

second, again, the focus of the inquiry is on the nature 

of the responsibilities. It's not on the particular 

offense alleged. It's not on whether there's a 

violation of that offense. It's the nature of the

enforcing permits enforcing access and use of public 

land, and protecting against abuse of those lands, are 

things that BLM officials and other government officers 

have exercised their discretion to do for more than --

JUSTICE BREYER: If this case were 

identical, everything's the same, except that the 

officials involved are state officials, would there be a

that there's a violation of the Just Compensation Clause 

when someone doesn't take property, when someone doesn't 

act through allegedly --

that's a different reason. That's a merits defense. I 

just wondered if --

respect to qualified immunity?

is no Bivens action, period.

 MR. GARRE: Well, we think that qualified 

immunity now --

of it. I just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would

would be no problem.

 MR. GARRE: No, because there has been no 

violation of the substantive Fifth Amendment right and 

there has been no violation of Bivens.

 It's important to recognize the overarching 

context of how the Federal Government manages the public 

lands. There are -- there are numerous reciprocal 

arrangements that could be affected by this. Any time a 

landowner refuses to enter into a reciprocal 

arrangement, he can then turn around in any government 

action that is taken against that landowner, all he has 

to do is add on an element of wrongful subjective 

intent, and he can bring a constitutional tort claim, or 

even a RICO claim like the respondent here, and subject 

officers to the threat of personal liability. And we 

think that this would have a significant skewing effect 

on legitimate government decision making.

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

instantaneous judgments a school principal might have to

Management that the greater retaliate against someone

interest of your client.

part of what he brought. If it had expired --

the roadway.

 MR. TRIBE: The right-of-way over the 

government's roads.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As opposed to the grazing 

easement.

 MR. TRIBE: As -- that's right. The 

right-of-way over the road of access, which they not 

only canceled in July of 1985 but refused to maintain 

themselves, so that he couldn't really access the ranch.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they finally 

canceled it, how did it -- I mean, if it runs with the 

land, they don't have the authority to cancel.

 MR. TRIBE: They didn't have the authority 

to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land. 

They allege that he had made various technical 

violations on account of which they canceled it. But 

the key point is, that was supposed to be the quid pro 

quo, that is, they have maintained all along that this 

case is about that right-of-way and what an ingrate the 

respondent is that he wants to continue enjoying it and

July of 1995 when it was canceled. They wouldn't have 

had to cancel it for alleged violations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it was 

canceled, but I must say, if they were just seeking a 

fair exchange of reciprocal easements, which landowners 

do all the time --

MR. TRIBE: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the system of lands out 

there can't work without it.

MR. TRIBE: To cough up that easement. And 

in fact when he said, he offered to negotiate, and the 

immediate response from Mr. Vessels, who is since 

diseased, was, the United States does not negotiate. 

That wasn't just kind of starting of a bargaining 

position. They dug in and for a series of years the 

district court found, fully substantiated on the 

petition appellate via -- appendix to the petition at 

page 37a, not only playing hardball and being 

selectively tough on him, but a number of clearly 

illegal acts, breaking into his lodge. One of them 

particularly striking to me at joint appendix 49 to 57, 

inciting a neighbor to ram a truck into the respondent 

while he was on horseback. Firemen --

JUSTICE BREYER: Who would have thought --

wait. When you say that, I mean, there's a lot of these 

acts, it seems, they are plainly illegal.

suite like Hartman v. Moore. One of the acts that is 

clearly actionable under Bivens, if one has to dissect 

the various predicate acts, is the fact that without 

probable cause, at page 71 of the joint appendix, they 

deliberately fabricated a felony charge.

that there is an action for private people to bring 

against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth 

Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations, 

the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of 

that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim

that what's going on with this regulation is there are 

individuals in the government who have gone too far, and 

they are just trying to get my property and the use of 

it, without paying a fair price. Now by the way, 

sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of 

those claims might have some justification. But 

suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action 

becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used 

unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this 

kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally 

legitimate government regulatory action.

 MR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer, that -- that 

floodgates concern was addressed by this Court not long 

enough in Hartman v. Moore when the remedy in that case 

for a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against 

someone for the exercise of her First Amendment right 

was a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who 

made this all up. Now the Court there addressed the 

possibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits, 

and it said that over the past quarter century, there 

had been only 12 Bivens or 1983 actions against this 

kind of retaliation. I suppose that is because not that 

many postal inspectors or BLM guys think they can get 

away with deliberately retaliating against people for 

exercising their rights.

JUSTICE BREYER: You see, part of what's 

worrying me is that once you get into the Fifth 

Amendment, which is -- prevents the government from 

taking property for a public use without just 

compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination 

becomes endless. Because every time a person walks 

across the doorstep, every time a person wants to 

install a pipe in the basement, read the meter -- I 

mean, I can see possibilities of actions of this kind 

arising, and particularly when the government wants to 

buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should 

be sold. Is there a threat lurking in that 

conversation? You see what I'm worried about here, 

which wasn't present in the other case?

 MR. TRIBE: I see, but it was present in 

Davis, Davis v. Passman, to which Justice Kennedy 

referred, already recognized a Bivens action for 

violating something even more capacious, due process, 

equal protection. When this Court said in Village of 

Willowbrook against Oleck that there is a cause of 

action even for the naked assertion that you're treating 

me differently, did that open huge floodgates? Have we 

been flooded? It seems to me that the Court has 

developed its own filters against the floodgate of 

retaliation claims. It's been --

for damages.

 MR. TRIBE: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in the brief you say 

that the government says that this is limited First 

Amendment, and then you say, "These remarkable claims 

are unsurprisingly false." I thought that was a rather 

severe charge against the government, that it's 

misrepresenting its cases.

 MR. TRIBE: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then in page 22 and 23, 

you go ahead and you talk about Wisconsin versus Yoder, 

Lefkowitz versus Turley, Bordenkircher, which I think 

was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges. All of 

those are in the -- every one of these cases are in the 

context of a criminal proceeding. Griffin, a murder 

case. It's just alleging a constitutional --

MR. TRIBE: But many of them are not, 

Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- alleging a 

constitutional claim. Well, which one?

 MR. TRIBE: Well, for example, Shapiro v.

Thompson. The Court has said that the right to travel 

cannot be penalized. The broad point that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no. That was, there 

was an existing case or controversy there. That wasn't 

a freestanding cause of action.  None of these cases are 

freestanding. Davis versus Passman, different.

 MR. TRIBE: And Hartman v. Moore, different. 

What we were answering there was not the point about a 

freestanding cause of action.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 

those cases do not support your position, and I don't 

think it's correct to say that this is unsurprising, 

that the government makes a false representation about 

cases.

 MR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Kennedy, that was 

a response to their claim, that only with respect to the 

Fifth Amendment is there a right. This was not the 

Bivens question. Only with respect to the Fifth --

First Amendment is there a right not to be retaliated 

against for the exercise of your rights.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it was in the 

context of a freestanding right, but let's leave that 

aside.

 MR. TRIBE: We can look at it.

seem to me that you are asking us to extend Bivens, this 

is an extension. Would you accept that?

 MR. TRIBE: In the sense that there has 

never been a case just like it under Hope v. Pelzer, 

there doesn't have to have been one like it. But we do 

think that there is a compelling case, because there's 

no other way to enforce the just compensation right 

against a group of government agents who are determined 

to pile punishment upon punishment until someone caves 

in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say -- you 

call it punishment, but in fact the government's 

position on each of these particulars has generally been 

vindicated. When your client has appealed, they've 

upheld the trespass citations. When you've sued for 

malicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected. Which 

of the government actions do you not have an existing 

remedy for, apart from the Racketeer and Corrupt -- RICO 

Act or the, this new Bivens claim?

 MR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, it is the 

retaliatory pattern that there is no remedy for. When 

going --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you point to any 

one governmental action for which you do not have an 

existing remedy?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a malicious 

prosecution claim for that. You brought that, you lost.

 MR. TRIBE: No, we did not bring a malicious 

prosecution claim for that felony charge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could have 

brought one.

 MR. TRIBE: It would have been against 

Federal officials and that would have been then 

transformed unless we brought it under Bivens, which is 

what we are trying to do, transformed into an action 

against the United States by the Westfall Act. That is

succeeded, you would have been compensated.

United States, but the BLM agents would not have been 

deterred.

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the theory of the 

Tort Claims Act is that if the government is paying out 

of the treasury, it's going to see to it that its 

employees don't continue to commit the tort. So I don't

would have had no effect on the improper behavior.

 MR. TRIBE: I think the most important point 

that I'm trying to make, Justice Souter and Mr. Chief 

Justice, that when someone says, I do not want to give 

you my property, you have to take it from me and give me 

just compensation, the position of the Government here 

is that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of 

retaliation they can engage in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the 

position of the Government were more fairly represented 

they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to 

claim that everything we're doing under color of law is 

retaliation, because then we'll hear that against IRS 

agents, we'll hear it against OSHA agents. So long as 

you -- and their position is you have a remedy for 

everything you're complaining about, and you invoked 

some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and 

so you didn't prevail. But don't create a whole new 

remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to 

pursue each one individually.

 MR. TRIBE: Well, Bivens as a constitutional 

tort is not a new remedy. The question really is 

whether there is any conceivable basis when they trash 

his lodge, when they do all of the other things, for 

treating this differently from another kind of

constitutional violation. I mean, they argue that it's 

very important, even though we could have lots of people 

bringing unjustified suits, to have a Bivens remedy for 

retaliation against free speech. The reason that they 

give is that free speech is easily chilled. But with 

property rights the Just Compensation Clause is kind of 

its own antifreeze.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The reason would be 

probably that the, if you can make a comparison. The 

number of Government actions that affect criminal 

charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of 

governmental actions that affect people's property. 

Virtually, I mean the number of Government actions 

affecting how people use their property, it's the whole 

series of law books. It fills the room. And suddenly 

to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's 

frightening me, which is what I said already. So you 

don't have to answer.

 MR. TRIBE: But Justice Breyer, the Court 

has established in the area of retaliation against 

people for the exercise of their rights, Title VII 

rights in Burlington, First Amendment rights --

JUSTICE BREYER: Retaliation, what is 

retaliation? Isn't retaliation statutory?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's statutory.

MR. TRIBE: Hartman is not statutory. Some 

of the -- Hartman is the First Amendment, and it's the 

Bivens case. The point I was trying to make about that 

is that the Court has a body of law trying to filter out 

through requiring proof of causation, requiring proof of 

substantial injury, filter out these trivial cases where 

someone is simply making a nuisance.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Tribe, could I ask a 

question about the RICO claims?

 MR. TRIBE: Certainly.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Until I read this case, I 

had never come across the concept that a Government 

employee can be guilty of extortion by demanding money 

for the Government and your brief didn't cite very much 

authority for this anywhere in the history of extortion.

 MR. TRIBE: In the common law history, 

Justice Alito, we cited two cases from New York, the 

Whaley case in 1827 and Willett in 1915. And it was 

that body of New York law from which the Hobbs Act 

largely drew. Those were cases in which the courts said 

that the fact that the government agent is extorting 

property for his own employer the government doesn't 

make any difference; it is still extortion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's not a lot of, that's 

not a lot of authority, considering the long history of

extortion, just two old New York cases.

 MR. TRIBE: There are plenty of cases, 

Justice Alito, that involve extortion for one's employer 

where the employer might be a union or a corporation or 

a charitable body.  But it's true the Hobbs Act has not 

been applied, in my research anyway I have not seen it 

applied, to this kind of extortion. But the language 

clearly covers it and the language of RICO clearly 

covers it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you have a librarian 

in a courthouse and the librarian is charging lawyers 25 

cents a page for photocopies, but there's some library 

rule that says the fee is supposed to be 10 cents a 

page. Now is that, is that a RICO?

 MR. TRIBE: If the librarian thinks that, 

the legislature is not giving us enough money, so I'm 

going to deliberately use my authority to get an extra 

five cents from everybody, I suppose if you could prove 

willfulness, which is an important element of Hobbs, and 

if there were several librarians and there was a pattern 

and you could establish the other prerequisites of RICO, 

it could be a RICO violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the two cases you 

cite, the first one is the person who was charged with 

extortion is a judge --

MR. TRIBE: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And he was extorted on the 

ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, 

so the money wasn't given to the government. So I don't 

see that that's a difference. And then the second case 

MR. TRIBE: The second case --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- it may have been, but 

you say "See Also," which is a sign to me there's 

something wrong with that case.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. TRIBE: I don't, I don't think there is, 

Justice Breyer, and it's very short.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm surprised that you 

didn't put it first if there wasn't.

 Page 49.

 MR. TRIBE: Well, Willett versus Devoy, it 

involved a clerk demanding more money than the law 

allowed, and the court said: "No distinction is made on 

the ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it 

over to the government. Such a judge-made restriction 

on the general statute requiring that the money be kept 

by the individual might itself bring about uncertainty, 

confuse and possibly great injustice."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why did you say "See Also"?

establishing their liability for what you call 

extortion? I'm sure what they would call trying to save 

the taxpayers money and getting the type of reciprocal 

agreement with this landowner that they have got with 

thousands of others.

 MR. TRIBE: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first 

of all, when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement 

it does trouble me. They weren't giving him anything 

for this easement which they had already extracted from 

his predecessor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree if the 

case were otherwise -- and I gather we have a factual 

dispute on that -- that it would have been all right? I 

mean, if he didn't have this other easement already, but 

they were trying to negotiate it, that this type of 

playing hardball, I guess is one way to put it, would be 

all right?

 MR. TRIBE: It makes all the difference in 

the world. They were trying to get the easement for

nothing. I mean, it's very much --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what 

I'm trying to get, to see if you agree with that. In 

other words, everything about this case would otherwise 

be, I'm sure not breaking the laws, but otherwise it 

would be all right if they were trying to get a 

reciprocal easement?

 MR. TRIBE: Well, most of what they did 

would not have been an okay method of getting a 

reciprocal easement, anyway. But the attempt to get it 

would be fine. It's not that they are not entitled to a 

reciprocal easement. That might have been a problem 

under Nollan and Dolan to figure out whether there was 

enough connection, but I think there would have been 

enough.

 The problem was that they were using the 

right-of-way, which was long gone, as an excuse to get 

an invaluable piece of property that they had no right 

to get. They were then trying to -- they were basically 

saying, and they made it explicit, give us this easement 

for nothing or we'll bury you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Tribe, I'll tell what 

you troubles me about this case. There are overzealous 

government agents. There always have been and I am sure 

that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is

correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has 

happened. Government agents sometimes get overzealous. 

But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when 

the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire 

to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked 

on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed 

his hair or for any other reason and had done the same 

things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?

 MR. TRIBE: Nor would Nollan have come out 

the same way if they weren't trying to get an easement 

in return for something which wasn't -- which you called 

extortion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. If they were 

trying to get some other property for it or, or, or 

money for it, it didn't turn --

MR. TRIBE: I guess the straightforward 

answer that I would give to your question I think is 

that the Constitution does guarantee that the Government 

cannot take your property for public use without just 

compensation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The whole spectrum of 

possible Government misbehavior, selective enforcement, 

the whole spectrum, the only, the only times we're going 

to allow a cause of action under Bivens or under, under 

not 1983 -- yes -- the only times we're going to do that

is when there is a demand for property?

 MR. TRIBE: You've certainly done it with 

respect to the Eighth Amendment. You've done it with 

respect to speech. You've done it with respect to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Professor Tribe, all 

these cases are cases in which there is -- Nollan, you 

have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this 

is just a, this is just a constitutional defense. 

That's different from a freestanding cause of action. 

And I share Justice Scalia's concern. It seems to me in 

thinking about this case there is -- there could be 

something very wrong here, going after a person because 

of what he's done. Suppose the Government wants 

somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, 

and they go around hurting his business, they go around 

invading his property and so forth. That to me is 

outrageous and you might have an argument that there 

should be a Bivens cause of action for that.

 And Justice Scalia's question -- I had the 

same question -- is why do we think it to the property? 

The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is 

that they're being vindictive against this person. Now 

again, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which 

is a free speech case which is different, really don't 

support you. I think this is an extension of Bivens.

MR. TRIBE: Justice Kennedy, if it's an 

extension, it's I think implicit in Bivens' logic. 

Bivens deals with the cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Fair enough, but it's an 

extension of Bivens.

 MR. TRIBE: The Fifth Amendment is different 

from the First, but is it different in a relevant way? 

The Just Compensation Clause does give the government an 

incentive, if they can avoid having to use eminent 

domain and tax the public, gives them an incentive to 

try to squeeze property out of somebody. If it has any 

incentive effect, it's one that points to the need for a 

Bivens remedy. Why is a Bivens remedy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But are they 

disabled from negotiating? If they go up to somebody 

and say, you know, we'd really like a right-of-way 

because we have some interest in lands that we need to 

maintain on the other side, and the person says, no and, 

you know, get off my property, do they have to shrug 

their shoulders and say all right? Or can they say, 

well, you know, we're neighbors, we have a lot of 

interests in common and we should work together? Is 

that all of a sudden extortion?

 MR. TRIBE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. Working 

together is what this guy tried to do at the beginning.

He said, I'm happy to negotiate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many trespass 

MR. TRIBE: They said: We don't negotiate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- citations for his 

cattle does it take before it's all of a sudden 

extortion?

 MR. TRIBE: The record in the case shows 

that on those very instances where he was cited with 

trespass others who were doing the identical thing were 

not. And the IBLA has said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he challenged 

the citations and they were rejected.

 MR. TRIBE: The IBLA rejected them because 

it said it has no jurisdiction. This was at -- in its 

decision at 170 IBLA in 2006. No jurisdiction to 

consider whether the motive was retaliatory, whether it 

was unconstitutional, whether it was part of a pattern. 

And this Court has said that one can't use the APA in 

that way either. Nor could an injunction be used to get 

a pattern like this because of Rule 65D and 

International Longshoremen, try to frame an injunction 

saying: Don't keep trashing this guy and ruining his 

business and harassing and surveilling his guests and

his property out of him. No other remedy will work.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So are you saying that 

there was therefore no way short of Bivens even to 

challenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective 

prosecution.

 MR. TRIBE: He could have taken that one 

item and under a decision like Hartman vindicated it. 

But as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these 

individual things and then concluded, as we explained in 

our brief, that it was taking years and costing hundreds 

of thousands of dollars more than was involved in each 

individual one, that was hopeless.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I appreciate that, but I 

thought you made the further claim -- maybe I 

misunderstood it -- that if he had gone from the 

administrative tribunal, or attempted to, to get into 

the district court, he could not have gotten into 

district court under the act.

 MR. TRIBE: Well, he wouldn't have had --

because he would have had no record. That is, the 

review under the APA by the district court would have 

been based on the evidentiary record he made. And the 

IBLA specifically ruled that it would not entertain 

evidence about the reasons that the BLM officials had 

for going after him. There would be no evidence to

they wouldn't let me; let me make a record now? Could 

he have done that?

jurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is 

limited to the agency record.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. You can go to an 

agency and say, agency I want to do such and such, dah 

dah dah, here are my reasons. Agency says no. I want 

review.

assertion --

have written to the Secretary of the Interior: 

Secretary, I want to you do such and such, please. No. 

Okay, review.

have a case, the district court said, as hard as it is 

to prove these things, he has substantial evidence that 

they were picking on him solely to get the property, not 

because they didn't like him, not for some other reason; 

they were trying to get property for which they were 

unwilling to pay.

 It's doubtful that they could have taken 

it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the 

ability of the BLM require proving necessity and there 

is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed 

this easement. There is plenty in the record suggesting 

that he couldn't access his own property as long as the 

roadway wasn't maintained in a passable condition, and 

one of the ways they retaliated against him was to 

refuse to maintain the roadway.

 The record is also clear that his 

business suffered greatly. So that if the result is 

that someone who is trying to insist that if you want my 

property, you have to take it by eminent domain and give 

me just compensation, can't get help in those other 

ways, this is crucial.

 What would have happened in Kaiser

are going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram 

their motor boats into your sailboat? We are going to 

ruin your business in the Kuapa pond until you give the 

public an easement. Only a Bivens cause of action which 

the Court has recognized in other areas, in other 

constitutional claims -- due process, free speech, 

Eighth Amendment -- only a Bivens cause of action is 

directly responsive to that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. A, an action 

against the Government for ramming your sailboat is 

directly responsive to that. You get -- you get full 

recovery.

 MR. TRIBE: The Westfall Act makes an 

exception when you are making a constitutional claim. 

That is, in 1988 when the Court passed the Westfall Act, 

there were two exceptions 2679B(2)(a) and (b) were 

constitutional claims and statutory claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need the 

Constitution to the sue the Government for ramming your 

sailboat. Basic state tort law.

 MR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer.

 (A little laughter.)

 MR. TRIBE: It seems to me that state tort 

law does not get at the harm that he has suffered. It

gets at each individual piece. But the main harm he 

suffered is that they are circumventing the Just 

Compensation Clause as the one way that the Fifth 

Amendment was designed to permit the Government to get 

property for public use. Thank you.

 MR. TRIBE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY C. GARRE,

 FOR PETITIONERS

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First I want to clarify, the question of the 

assignment. And our position, it's always been our 

position that a new right-of-way had to be issued after 

the property was sold. And I'll point the Court to JA 

84, which is where the BLM officials made clear at the 

outset that an assignment was required. Point the Court 

to JA 100 which is the right-of-way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They might have been lying 

about that --

MR. GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just as they lied about 

a lot of other stuff, according to --

MR. GARRE: Pointing to JA 100 which is the

right-of-way, which says that in accordance with Federal 

regulations, and I point the Court to 43 CFR 2803, which 

discusses assignments and makes clear that assignments 

have to be approved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was 

something about Nelson having assigned his, the 

right-of-way that he had to the Government.

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, assignments 

have to be approved by the BLM. That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But it wasn't that 

it was a new assignment; it was the former owner 

assigned it and the BLA -- BLM approved.

 MR. GARRE: It was never approved. And 

that's clear, there was never any valid assignment. 

That's why the reciprocal arrangement had to be 

negotiated anew and again, I point to 43 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why did 

you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?

 MR. GARRE: It -- it was revoked as part of 

the decision not to assign it. And that's clear from 

the decision canceling the right-of-way. There was no 

assignment that could be approved, and rents had not 

been paid on it. So it was combined with the 

assignment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't there be an

assignment? Why, why would the prior owner have any --

any interest in not assigning it?

 MR. GARRE: In order for the right-of-way, 

because these are rights-of-way to public lands. They 

have to approved by new -- once new property owners seek 

to assert them. And again the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The prior owner did 

assign it. The stopper was the BLM.

 MR. GARRE: But, but again it's clear -- and 

it was not approved, and one of the reasons it wasn't 

approved was because rents weren't paid and he wasn't 

agreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations 

which are part of the right-of-way. And that's at JA 

100.

 The next point I wanted to make, Justice 

Kennedy, is we agreed this would be a dramatic new 

extension of Bivens, and we agree with Justice Breyer, 

the problems or types of litigations that this new 

constitutional tort would create are really just -- the 

-- capable of the imagination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Davis versus Passman is a 

different context. But in theory is it consistent with 

what the Respondent asks?

 MR. GARRE: No, it's not. Because the 

Respondent here has more statutory and administrative

remedies available to him than the plaintiff in Passman 

did, including claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act 

for trespasses, for any of the other alleged wrongs that 

you've heard about here today. These were -- these were 

wrongs that were addressed by the IBLA and the APA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But their argument 

is broader. It says you can't look at each little 

piece. You've got to look at the overall structure, and 

overall they are doing it to extort a property right 

they don't want to pay for, and they are not doing --

other people's cattle cross over and they don't 

prosecute them.

 Now, let's assume that's correct on the 

facts. Are you saying that they have no remedy for that 

type of extortionate activity?

 MR. GARRE: They don't have a Bivens remedy 

and they don't have a RICO remedy. I'd point the Court 

to Lujan versus National Wildlife Federation, where the 

Court said that in that situation what a plaintiff must 

do is challenge each administrative action individually, 

and the types of programmatic pattern challenges are for 

Congress, they're for executive branches; they are for 

inspector generals.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you -- what do 

you say to the argument that -- that you simply cannot

follow that logic ultimately, because when you get to 

the point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a 

thousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you 

can stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a 

thousand, you're dead. I mean, they're making an 

argument that this is quantitatively so different that 

it is qualitatively different.

 MR. GARRE: I think the law and this Court 

reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies 

available to them through challenging individual --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that a reasonable 

assumption in response to their argument?

 MR. GARRE: It's reasonable to assume that 

if there are actions against United States under the 

Federal Tort Claims Act, or actions finding Government 

conduct unauthorized under the APA, that the Government 

will take action to prevent that.

 Here every action that was challenged was 

found to be appropriate and lawful under the existing 

regime. We would urge the Court to reverse.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
