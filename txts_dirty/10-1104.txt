3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 10-1104, Minneci v. Pollard.

 Mr. Franklin. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8  MR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 Over the last three decades, the Court has 

11 made clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will 

12 only be authorized in narrow situations where there are 

13 no adequate alternative means for redressing a 

14 plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels 

hesitation. Respondent has satisfied neither criterion. 

16 He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort 

17 remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and 

18 Petitioners' status as employees of a private 

19 contractor, rather than the government, at a minimum 

gives rise to factors counseling hesitation. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: We go back to what you 

22 said initially; that is, if there's no alternative 

23 remedy, Bivens fills the gap. 

24  Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, 

only the State law allows survivor actions. In Carlson, 

3

Official 

1 I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison 

2 personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens 

3 liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether 

4 there could have been a State tort.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, the rule --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? 

7  MR. FRANKLIN: In -- the rule -- the Carlson 

8 rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved 

9 actual Federal Government employees. And since Carlson, 

Congress has pre-empted all tort claims against them. 

11 So, whether Indiana law now -- which has been amended, 

12 but whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is 

13 immaterial, because Congress has pre-empted all tort 

14 claims against actual employees of the government.

 But these -- this case involves -- the 

16 Petitioners are not employees of the government. They 

17 are employees of a private contractor. And under the 

18 Westfall Act, what Congress did was pre-empt all claims 

19 against actual government officials while preserving 

Bivens remedies. 

21  But it did the opposite for employees of 

22 private contractors. For them, there are adequate 

23 alternative tort remedies. And it's virtually 

24 undisputed in this case that there was such a remedy 

here. And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 excluded them from the category of employees against 

2 whom it preserved Bivens remedies. 

3  So, yes, in the Carlson situation, there is 

4 still a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly 

preserved that. But here we have a different 

6 congressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the 

7 Court to embrace here. 

8  What Congress did in the Westfall Act is it 

9 said what in effect we are asking this Court to 

recognize and what we believe the Court has recognized 

11 in cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are 

12 adequate alternative tort -- excuse me -- where there 

13 are no adequate --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose, Mr. Franklin, 

that there weren't. I mean, I think you have a good 

16 case about California law here. But suppose we were in 

17 a State where the law was very different from what 

18 California's law appears to be, where there was no 

19 special duty recognized for jailors and, indeed, where 

the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates 

21 because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State 

22 supreme court that there was no duty on the part of 

23 jailors to inmates. What would happen then? 

24  MR. FRANKLIN: In that hypothetical instance 

-- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 would be a different case, and the Court could in that 

2 circumstance say there are no adequate alternative 

3 remedies. But the reason we think it's entirely 

4 hypothetical is there has nothing been shown in the 

briefing of this Court, and as the Ninth Circuit 

6 dissenters made clear, that any State doesn't afford the 

7 bedrock cause of negligence. And that cause, as the 

8 Court held in Malesko quite expressly, is not only 

9 adequate to redress any actions that would violate the 

Eighth Amendment, but it's actually superior. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But is your answer --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Franklin, there were 

13 some references to Mississippi law that seem to be 

14 inconsistent with the notion that all States would 

provide an adequate remedy. 

16  MR. FRANKLIN: I believe that reference, if 

17 I'm correct, comes from an amicus brief, and that law 

18 does not -- would not on its face prohibit an action 

19 against a private managed prison holding Federal 

prisoners. These laws -- and the Mississippi law is an 

21 example; there's a New York law. Those apply to State 

22 government officials. They're similar to the Westfall 

23 Act, but on a State level. They immunize State 

24 government officials from claims, but those claims would 

be subject to 1983 actions. Here we have a privately

1 managed prison holding Federal prisoners.
 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- and it might
 

3 hold State prisoners as well.
 

4  MR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It might hold -- some 

6 private facilities will take State prisoners as well as 

7 Federal prisoners. 

8  MR. FRANKLIN: There has been some 

9 representation, that we don't disagree with, that there 

might be some facilities that have State prisoners 

11 and --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if they do have State 

13 prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, 

14 not Bivens, but 1983.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Most likely, Your Honor, yes, 

16 if it's under --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you have two 

18 prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a 

19 Federal remedy and the other doesn't.

 MR. FRANKLIN: The other actually gets what 

21 the Court in Malesko described as a superior remedy. 

22 The prisoner -- the Federal prisoner has, in that sense, 

23 a remedy that's beyond the Eighth Amendment, that 

24 goes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me why it is 

7

25

Official 

1 that you care in this suit? If you're telling us, oh, 

2 don't worry, there's going to be liability and probably 

3 perhaps even more extensive liability than in Bivens, 

4 what difference does it make? Bivens doesn't give you 

attorneys' fees. Now, it's true that the Federal 

6 question may get you into Federal court. 

7  MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I have several answers 

8 to that. First, Your Honor, my clients care very deeply 

9 in this case because, as the district court held, if 

there's no Bivens remedy, this case is dismissed. This 

11 case was dismissed on the lack of a Bivens remedy --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because of the 

13 statute of limitations? 

14  MR. FRANKLIN: It's way too late now, 10 

years after the incident, for them to now assert State 

16 law claims. So, we do care. And, in fact, that was the 

17 same situation that was in Malesko. In Malesko, you had 

18 a virtually identical situation, where the --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we're looking -- if 

we're looking forward beyond this case --

21  MR. FRANKLIN: Right. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and there's no statute 

23 of limitation problem, does it really make any 

24 difference that he have this second cause of action 

that's just --

Official 

1  MR. FRANKLIN: It makes a --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- (a) duplicative or (b) 

3 arguably narrow, more narrow? 

4  MR. FRANKLIN: Well, two points. I'd like 

to first say that the Court in Malesko adopted the 

6 principle that if there is an alternative remedy, that's 

7 not a reason for piling on a Federal remedy; that's a 

8 reason not to. But in a practical sense --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why? What --

MR. FRANKLIN: I understand --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What difference does it 

12 make? 

13  MR. FRANKLIN: Let me give you --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Who cares?

 MR. FRANKLIN: -- a practical difference that 

16 does matter for individuals in my clients' situation. 

17 If a State tort claim is brought, there is respondeat 

18 superior liability under a State court claim. And in 

19 many if not most cases, the plaintiff will choose, 

voluntarily choose, to sue the corporation and leave the 

21 individual out of the case. 

22  Now, the deterrent effect that Bivens is 

23 concerned with still exists because the case can be 

24 brought against the individual. However, if there's a 

Bivens claim, that has to be brought against the 

9

Official 

1 individual; it cannot be brought under respondeat 

2 superior. So, if there is a Bivens claim, as a 

3 practical matter you're going to see more and more 

4 individuals being dragged through these cases without, 

by the way, the recognized qualified immunity defense --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Franklin --

7  MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you have a theory 

9 about why these are brought as Bivens claims? It seems 

mysterious to me. If you bring it as a negligence 

11 claim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence 

12 versus deliberate indifference. 

13  MR. FRANKLIN: Right. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: You get vicarious liability. 

So, I've been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these 

16 brought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens 

17 claims? 

18  MR. FRANKLIN: I can't answer that question. 

19 What I can say -- well, I can try to answer it, but I 

can say that if the Court rules as we ask it to in this 

21 case, we think that there will not be Bivens claims, 

22 that people will bring them under the tort law. 

23  It could be that there are forms in some of 

24 these prisons that are given out that have section 1983 

written on them, that Bivens is there. It could be that

1 prisoners are not quite aware that the Westfall Act 

2 doesn't cover private contractors. 

3  But we would think that if the Court rules 

4 as we -- as we suggest it should, that there -- that the 

prisoners who are relatively savvy, even on a pro se 

6 basis, about their rights would then understand that 

7 they have these rights and will exercise them and that 

8 the Bivens remedy would not have to be employed 

9 willy-nilly as it was in this case. But I --

JUSTICE KAGAN: To go back to what I asked 

11 before when I hypothesized a State that didn't have 

12 adequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin 

13 down what you said, if there were no adequate remedies, 

14 there would be a Bivens action available?

 MR. FRANKLIN: There might be, Your Honor. 

16 There still is the factors counseling hesitation, which 

17 is the second step of the Bivens analysis. And I 

18 wouldn't want to give up that there might be factors in 

19 those cases counseling hesitation. But certainly our 

position is not that in a circumstance, if that arose --

21 and, again, we think it's hypothetical because there's 

22 no indication either that it has arisen or that it will 

23 arise -- but if it were to, our position wouldn't rule 

24 out the possibility of a Bivens claim in those 

circumstances.

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: To get back to the question 

2 that Justice Ginsburg asked, is it -- is that consistent 

3 with Carlson? Because the Court in Carlson didn't say 

4 that there's a Bivens action because in this particular 

State there isn't a viable State action, but it might be 

6 different in another State where there is a viable State 

7 claim. It did it on basically a categorical ground. 

8  MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it -- as the case came 

9 to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there 

was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had 

11 held. So, that was sort of the basic premise that the 

12 Court then went ahead and decided the case on. 

13  Since Carlson, we've had cases, notably 

14 Malesko, also Wilkie, which have made clear that the 

adequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a 

16 factor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the 

17 dispositive factor in Malesko, and as in this case as 

18 well. 

19  We don't think that there is really any 

serious dispute in this case that there were adequate 

21 alternative remedies. Again, the deliberate 

22 indifference standard is much, much more hard -- much 

23 harder to meet than a traditional negligence standard. 

24 California law is, further, more protective of 

prisoners.

Official 

1  As we understand the Respondents' position, 

2 the Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding 

3 the availability of alternative remedies in this case 

4 and as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to 

create what they refer to as a categorical cause of 

6 action, one that would apply regardless of whether the 

7 remedies are adequate or not. 

8  And in our view, that would turn the Bivens 

9 jurisprudence effectively on its head. The Court has 

said Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at 

11 least paraphrased our argument as saying it's a 

12 gap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is, 

13 that would apply only in those circumstances when it's 

14 necessary. Other than that, the Court has consistently 

deferred the matter to Congress. And that's where we 

16 think it ought to lie in this case. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Does a prisoner in a State 

18 that requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a 

19 medical malpractice case have a -- have an 

alternative -- a viable alternative State claim --

21  MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, again, that's --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: -- for malpractice? 

23  MR. FRANKLIN: We say yes. That issue is 

24 not in this case. The Eleventh Circuit in Alba 

expressly addressed that issue under that State's law, 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 and said, yes, that is adequate. It's simply a 

2 procedural requirement that applies to all plaintiffs. 

3  And I would add, by the way, that --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is a prisoner 

supposed to satisfy that requirement? 

6  MR. FRANKLIN: The same way any other 

7 plaintiff is supposed to -- but what I was going to add 

8 is that when you're alleging an Eighth Amendment 

9 violation, you're talking about a claim that's by its 

nature very severe. You're talking about deliberate 

11 indifference to serious medical needs that constitutes 

12 the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. 

13  In those circumstances, we would suggest 

14 that it might even be easier to procure that kind of a 

declaration, but that issue was decided in Alba. So, 

16 that -- that was decided. If it comes up in another 

17 case, it can be decided there. We don't think that that 

18 would render the -- if it's -- if it's an adequate 

19 remedy for everyone else in that State and most States 

that have these things, then it's an adequate remedy for 

21 Bivens. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did any of those courts 

23 address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going 

24 to get an affidavit?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, Alba -- the Alba court 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 is the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level 

2 that considered it, and I believe they did address that 

3 issue and simply said that it is -- puts them on an 

4 equal footing with other plaintiffs and that that would 

be an adequate remedy. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't 

7 understand your answer to Justice Kagan. If I heard you 

8 right, you were saying, well, they're going to be able 

9 to get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment 

violation, and everything is very severe. But the point 

11 is they're going to bring a negligence action, not an 

12 Eighth Amendment action. 

13  MR. FRANKLIN: Right. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --

MR. FRANKLIN: I'm talking about if the 

16 conduct -- we're comparing here between conduct that 

17 would violate the Eighth Amendment and conduct that's 

18 negligent. And I'm saying if the conduct rises to the 

19 level of an Eighth Amendment violation, which is what 

we're talking about in terms of the adequacy, then it 

21 would be easier, one would presume. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I think the question, 

23 Mr. Franklin, is really just a practical one --

24  MR. FRANKLIN: Sure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- which is how a pro se 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 person sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a 

2 doctor who will provide this certificate. And, I mean, 

3 maybe there would be means, but I guess I'm asking 

4 whether there would be.

 MR. FRANKLIN: I would think there would, 

6 but I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone 

7 else's case on that. I mean, I do think that that was 

8 an issue that was resolved, at least in the Eleventh 

9 Circuit in Alba. It's not an issue that applies in this 

case because there's no such certificate here in 

11 California. 

12  I do think it would be adequate. I mean, 

13 Bush v. Lucas, which is a Federal remedies case, said 

14 there were what they called "meaningful remedies." As 

long as there's a meaningful remedy, it's sufficient. 

16 And if Congress wants to think that there's a problem, 

17 for example, if Congress thinks there's a problem with 

18 these certificates of merit in the case of privately run 

19 facilities, then it certainly can establish a cause of 

action as it did in section 1983. 

21  But the Bivens doctrine is really a narrow, 

22 as we say, gap-filling doctrine. And the Court has 

23 always used it very sparingly. And the reason the Court 

24 has done that is because there is no authority for it in 

the language of any constitutional or statutory 

16

1 provision.
 

2  So, the Court has always treaded very
 

3 cautiously in this area. And I wouldn't rule out in
 

4 that circumstance that somebody could make that
 

argument. I -- I just don't think in this case there 

6 has been any real dispute that there's an adequate 

7 remedy. There wasn't in Malesko, and that was 

8 sufficient in that case. And we think it is sufficient 

9 in this case as well for the Court to in effect stay its 

Bivens hand and turn the matter if necessary over to 

11 Congress. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Under the PLRA -- under the 

13 PLRA, a district judge has to perform a screening 

14 function for -- for these complaints, and is that -- is 

it going to be an impossible burden for district judges 

16 to ascertain the contours of State prison law, in that 

17 there apparently is not a lot of prisoner litigation 

18 under State law? Most prisoners seem to choose 1983. 

19  MR. FRANKLIN: Well, in this case, the 

magistrate judge did it. It wasn't an impossible burden 

21 for him. This was done on a prescreening. The court 

22 ruled as exactly as we are asking the Court to rule now. 

23 The court did it. The Court in Malesko did it. It 

24 wasn't difficult. If it is deemed that there's an issue 

there, there are various procedural mechanisms that 

17

1 could be employed. There could be a dismissal without 

2 prejudice, a dismissal with repleading, certification to 

3 a State court.  You could stay the Bivens action. 

4  There's various things that district courts 

can do. But in this case, it wasn't an issue. It 

6 wasn't an issue in Malesko. We don't think it's going 

7 to be an issue in other cases either. 

8  If I may reserve the remainder of my time.

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

13  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

14  MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

16  The last three decades of this Court's 

17 precedents make clear that judicial extension of a 

18 Bivens remedy is not the default presumption. It is 

19 permissible only where there is no adequate alternative 

remedy and there are no other factors counseling 

21 hesitation. Neither criterion is satisfied here. 

22  Respondent is suing employees of a private 

23 prison corporation who, unlike their federally employed 

24 counterparts, are subject to well-established theories 

of tort liability but lack a recognized qualified 

18

1 immunity defense. Under the circumstances present here, 

2 which I submit reflect the heartland of cases alleging 

3 Eighth Amendment violations for deliberate indifference 

4 to serious medical needs, recognition of the Bivens 

remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, go back to what 

7 you said about lacking -- these private -- these 

8 employees of the private corporation you said lack 

9 qualified immunity. But they do have -- courts have 

allowed them to have a good faith defense. So, in 

11 practice, how different is that, whether they have 

12 qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith 

13 defense? 

14  MR. SHAH: A couple of responses, Your 

Honor. 

16  First, this Court has never recognized a 

17 good faith defense. So, I wouldn't call it a recognized 

18 defense. It is true that some lower courts have applied 

19 a good faith defense. Reading those cases, it's not 

entirely clear exactly what the content of that good 

21 faith defense is. What is clear is that it's something 

22 less than qualified immunity. It appears in most of the 

23 cases that they're grafting on some sort of subjective 

24 element, subjective intent element, on top of what you 

must establish to get qualified immunity. 

19
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  So, whatever it is, it's something lesser 

2 than qualified immunity, and I think that in and of 

3 itself creates an asymmetry. But I think the larger 

4 point is, is that these prisoners have alternative 

adequate remedies under State law because they're suing 

6 a private employee rather than a government employee. 

7  The government employee is subject to the 

8 Westfall Act, and, therefore, all civil actions other 

9 than Bivens are pre-empted. And so, I think that's the 

fundamental difference. I think it further counsels 

11 hesitation because of the lack of a recognized immunity 

12 defense, whether that's qualified immunity or good 

13 faith. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you address the 

question posed earlier of what were to happen if there 

16 was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these 

17 private correctional officers, and that was the case 

18 before us. This particular State, it's undisputed, 

19 would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence 

suit against these officers. 

21  MR. SHAH: Sure. Your Honor, in that 

22 hypothetical -- and of course, there is no suggestion in 

23 this case that any State has such a rule -- but if a 

24 State were to adopt that such rule, I think that would 

be a case where there is no adequate alternative remedy,

1 because in your -- in your hypothetical, there is 

2 absolute immunity. There wouldn't be a way for the 

3 prisoner to redress -- seek redress for the gravamen of 

4 his injuries. And I think in that case, we have a very 

different situation, and a Bivens remedy may well be
 

6 justified. But --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Interesting, because
 

8 what you're proposing is a sort of State-by-State,
 

9 circuit-by-circuit, presumably, existence of a Bivens
 

claim or not. That's really the outcome of your 

11 position. 

12  MR. SHAH: Well, yes, Your Honor, except the 

13 fact that there has been no suggestion that any State 

14 has such a draconian rule or has ever passed one. We're 

simply arguing for a rule that would limit Bivens to 

16 when there is no adequate State law remedy. That's 

17 clearly the case here. It's clearly going to be the 

18 case in the vast majority of Eighth Amendment prisoners. 

19 What this Court should not do is craft a default rule 

allowing Bivens remedies against employees of private 

21 prison corporations just to account for the hypothetical 

22 possibility that there may be a case which may or may 

23 not ever arise in which an adequate alternative is not. 

24 That turns Bivens jurisprudence on its head.

1 question is -- yes, when you talk about an overlap of 

2 remedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a 

3 matching one-to-one remedy, but you do need some degree 

4 of meaningful overlap, don't you?

 MR. SHAH: I would agree with that, Your 

6 Honor. I think -- I think --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how -- define how 

8 much or how do we describe the adequacy of that overlap? 

9  MR. SHAH: I think it would be difficult to 

come up with a precise formulation. I think the 

11 formulation that we use in our brief is that as long as 

12 it redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries. 

13 So, I think as long as it provides some meaningful 

14 relief for the injuries and in turn that would provide 

some deterrence to the individual employees' actions --

16 I think as long as those two elements are present, I 

17 think we would think that there is an adequate 

18 alternative remedy. 

19  Or, alternatively, if you wanted to use the 

words -- the word that this Court used in Bivens, you 

21 could approach it from the flip side and say there would 

22 not be an adequate alternative remedy where the State 

23 law is either inconsistent with or hostile to the 

24 corresponding constitutional interest. We submit in 

this case there's no question that there are remedies

1 available under California State law and, as far as we 

2 know, the State law of every other State in this country 

3 that would allow --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is -- a Bivens 

action is unusual in the first place, but it's also 

6 unusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of 

7 action because of something a State gives you. 

8  Do you have any other example of something 

9 like that, where the availability of Federal relief 

turns on the availability of alternative relief under 

11 State law? 

12  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it may not be an 

13 exact analogue, but I think Federal due process cases 

14 often will look at if someone's claims of deprivation of 

property, an unlawful deprivation of property, in 

16 violation of process -- the Federal court may often look 

17 at what are the available State law procedures to 

18 provide redress for that claim before it would impose or 

19 find a violation of Federal due process.

 So, I think there are analogues where 

21 Federal courts do look at the availability of State law 

22 remedies and look at their adequacy before determining 

23 whether a Federal law remedy is necessary. And this 

24 Court has done that. And the Court did it in Malesko, I 

think is the best example in the Bivens context of where

1 the Court looked at alternative State remedies and said 

2 that, hey, look, the availability of these other 

3 remedies counsel against the imposition of a Bivens 

4 remedy.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: What is the theory behind 

6 that, Mr. Shah? I mean it's an obvious theory when 

7 Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, 

8 which is a separation of powers theory. But what's the 

9 theory about looking to State law for these kinds of 

alternative remedies? 

11  MR. SHAH: Two responses, Your Honor. While 

12 I agree the separation of powers problem is much more 

13 heightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a 

14 separation of powers issue even when Congress has not 

acted. That is, the Court should be hesitant before --

16 before implying a judicial -- a cause of action for 

17 damages under the Constitution, given that it's 

18 typically been Congress's province to do so. 

19  But, beyond that, the rationales -- there 

have been two rationales that have been given by this 

21 Court in its -- in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying 

22 such a remedy. One is the need to provide some 

23 meaningful relief. We submit when there is an 

24 alternative State remedy, that rationale has been 

satisfied. 

24

1  The other rationale this Court has offered 

2 is provide some deterrence to the actions of an 

3 individual employee or officer. We also submit that 

4 when there is a State tort damages remedy available, 

that rationale too will be accomplished. 

6  The three cases in which this Court has 

7 recognized a Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis, and 

8 Carlson, those two factors were not present. There was 

9 either no alternative remedy at all or, at least as in 

Carlson, no alternative remedy against the individual 

11 officer. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: What would you propose that 

13 the Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy 

14 that is necessary? Just -- what we have here in 

California is enough and not go any further or --

16  MR. SHAH: I think the Court should start 

17 with that. Certainly, here there hasn't been any 

18 dispute that there would be -- any real serious dispute 

19 that there would be an adequate alternative remedy. I 

think the Court could also say that, as long as the 

21 adequate alternative remedy addresses the gravamen of 

22 the prisoner's injuries, that should be sufficient. And 

23 I think it could give content to that by looking at the 

24 two rationales this Court has offered for Bivens.

1 claims against private prisons and private prison guards 

2 what I understand New York has done with respect to 

3 State-run prisons; in other words, that you eliminate 

4 any claim against individual prison employees or guards 

and give the prisoner just a tort claim against the 

6 State. Would that be adequate? 

7  MR. SHAH: I think that would be a tougher 

8 case. And, of course, I assume in your hypothetical 

9 that that's -- that that would also apply to Federal 

prisoners and federally contracted prisons, and it's 

11 difficult to figure out what the State's interests --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Not a claim against the 

13 State. I misspoke. A claim -- only a claim against the 

14 company that runs the prison.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, again I think that 

16 would be a more difficult hypothetical because the 

17 rational about individual deterrence of the individual 

18 officer may not be as strong in that hypothetical. But, 

19 once again, no State has such a rule, and it's difficult 

to imagine a State's incentive to adopt such a rule 

21 because it's not coming out of the State's pockets. 

22 These are federally contracted prisons, contracted by 

23 BOP and run by private prison corporations. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the character 

of the claim? If it's a Bivens claim, it's a

4  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it is true, the 

labels are different and there's going to be different 

6 meaning to those remedies. But from the prisoner's 

7 standpoint, the rationale behind Bivens was to provide 

8 some damages relief. From the prisoner's standpoint, 

9 it's not going to matter, I would submit, whether that 

-- those damages are procured under State law or under a

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. PREIS 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

17  MR. PREIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

18 please the Court: 

19  The question before the Court today is 

whether a Federal prisoner's access to constitutional 

21 remedies should turn on the mere happenstance of where 

22 the prisoner is detained. The Petitioners' chief 

23 argument is that privately held Federal prisoners should 

24 not have an Eighth Amendment damages remedy because they 

have remedies under State law. This argument suffers

1 from two flaws. First, it misconceives this Court's 

2 Bivens jurisprudence; second, it misconceives the nature 

3 of State remedies available to prisoners. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why are State 

remedies -- what of your clients' claims could not be 

6 vindicated under State law? And why is a Bivens action 

7 superior to a negligence action in California? 

8  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, with regard to the 

9 claims that can't be vindicated under State law, we 

think it's likely that his medical malpractice claims, 

11 the claims against the doctors, could be vindicated. We 

12 don't think the law is clear in -- excuse me -- in 

13 California that his other claims, the deprivation of 

14 nutrition and hygiene, forced labor at some point before 

he was -- his injuries were healed, that those would 

16 necessarily be covered. 

17  We admit there's a chance, as we did in our 

18 brief, that it's possible the California Supreme Court 

19 could say, well, there has been an intermediate 

appellate court who has decided this. We take on 

21 guidance that and believe these remedies would be 

22 covered. But there's nothing here that could -- that 

23 could assure this Court that that's the way it will work 

24 out.

1 Bivens are superior when there's no State cause of 

2 action. So, there will be some cases, as we concede, 

3 where a State cause of action is available. The reason 

4 Mr. Pollard brings a Federal cause of action in this 

case is because it's not clear that State remedies are 

6 certainly available. 

7  And I think the certainty is an important 

8 thing for this Court to remember. The issue before 

9 Bivens itself was whether or not this Court should adopt 

a system of State remedies. And the --

21 have a State law --

death, for example, or deliberately gives him something

tort law? 

6  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think at the 

7 starkest example, if it was the case that somebody 

8 actually starved someone --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: No, give me -- don't answer 

my -- forget my hypothetical. Tell me your specific

24 available; the other three, we do not find sufficient 

evidence in California law that there will certainly be

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, I don't mean to 

sound irritated, but I just have trouble getting my

16 give him adequate food for what? So he could live, or 

17 for what?

JUSTICE BREYER: They gave him -- and if a 

21 person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or 

22 someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you're

4  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think I would 

put -- I think the best way to approach that question is 

6 to look at the shoes of an attorney. When if someone 

7 comes in and says I was deprived of these benefits that 

8 I was entitled to and I was suffered a harm, the 

9 question would be for the lawyer as well, I'll go read 

the case --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The lawyer would say, I 

13 can't find a starving case in California; so, you must 

14 not have a cause of action.

 Is that what the lawyer would say? 

16  MR. PREIS: No, I think the lawyer would 

17 say, I can't be certain. I haven't found a case --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd to me because 

19 the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment. 

So, you have to have a cruel treatment. And where a 

21 person deliberately or negligently subjects someone else 

22 to cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of 

23 many years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort 

24 action.

4 elaboration of that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you have besides 

6 starving? What -- what else? 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. PREIS: The other claims were, after he 

9 suffered his injuries, he was put back on his work 

detail before his injuries were healed. He was also, 

11 immediately after being injured, forced to sort of 

12 endure excessive security measures, forced to wear 

13 particular handcuffs that pushed his arms in a -- in a 

14 way that was -- caused extraordinary pain and was 

unnecessary. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you the same 

17 question that I asked Mr. Franklin? Because it just 

18 doesn't make any sense to me. The gravamen of this 

19 claim is a medical malpractice claim. Why aren't your 

State law remedies better? You have vicarious 

21 liability, and all you have to prove is negligence. Why 

22 wasn't this brought as a State law claim? 

23  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think there's two 

24 parts to that, two answers I would give. First, Mr. 

Pollard was put in a Federal prison by the Federal 

33

25

Official 

1 Government. He often has access -- actually only has
 

2 access to Federal law books. When he sees himself
 

3 injured, he thinks this is presumably a Federal case.
 

4 So, I think there is a certain ethic or, at least,
 

practice, is how that works. 

6  Now, why wouldn't medical malpractice work 

7 here? 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that would be false 

9 consciousness that we can correct, right?

 MR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed 

11 the beginning. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, if the -- if the 

13 true appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your 

14 client's point of view, is a State law action, we should 

just say bring a State law action. 

16  MR. PREIS: Well, we think that prisoners 

17 should have access to the State law action, and when 

18 there's cause of action available, it might indeed be a 

19 better remedy. But I think in terms of whether or not 

medical malpractice works here, it will work in terms of 

21 deterring the medical professionals, but we have 

22 multiple defendants in this case, not all of them -- of 

23 which would be culpable under -- or liable under a 

24 medical malpractice regime. How do we handle the other 

prisoners -- excuse me -- the other defendants?

2 remedies available, and I would concede, of course, 

3 that's important to the -- to the prisoner. But, of 

4 course, the Court is concerned with deterrence in these 

cases. 

6  So, I want to return to Justice Breyer's 

7 question, if I might. The gravamen of this case is that 

8 in ordinary cases, most of the time -- and the Court is 

9 required in this case to figure how big is that "most of 

the time"? Is it 99 percent of time? Is it 80 percent 

11 of the time? And that's what we simply don't have 

12 evidence on in this case. And I want to point --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: When I went to law school, 

14 which was many years ago, instead of talking about, 

like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they 

16 talked about a general thing called negligence. 

17  MR. PREIS: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And it seemed to apply to 

19 doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it 

applied to others, and -- and is there something here 

21 that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric or the 

22 general terms of California tort law?

6 and which in a sense the Court will be required to do in 

7 this case, is predict what State supreme courts will do 

8 on a regular basis. And I would suggest -- suggest 

9 that's sort of an extraordinary measure to take in a 

case where you have Federal prisoners, Federal 

11 constitutional rights, and Federal actors.

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're saying don't 

19 look at what other courts will do; just look at the 

State you're in, the place you're going to make your 

21 claim, and figure out whether your claims are covered or 

22 not covered essentially in those -- in that State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so, if there is one 

6 State that would not have an adequate remedy for any --

1 no problem because you go back and show to the court 

2 that there is no remedy in California for shackling a

you're going to have your Bivens action in respect to 

6 that. 

7  MR. PREIS: Well --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: That -- what they're saying 

9 is that you're not going to be able to show that; so, it 

doesn't worry them. 

11  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think that the --

12 the view that there's an ordinary duty of care, a duty 

13 to be reasonable, is quite a bit more complex than the 

14 Petitioners would make it out to be. Let me offer an 

example. In this case, in 2007 the district court 

16 dismissed Mr. Pollard's complaint. The district court 

17 said you have State remedies. 

18  Well, what was the proof for that? What was 

19 the State law remedies that existed? The only thing the 

district court cited in a footnote was section 1714 of 

21 California's civil code. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Who says that the burden is 

23 on the other side? Why isn't the burden on you, if you

there is not an adequate State remedy?

1  MR. PREIS: Your Honor --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're the plaintiff here. 

3 You're trying to bring the Federal cause of action. Our 

4 law is clear; if there's an adequate remedy we don't 

invent one. Why isn't it your burden to show that there 

6 is not an adequate State remedy? 

7  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, two answers to that. 

8 First of all, this Court's most recent case where it 

9 dealt with whether or not a burden should exist was 

Wilkie, and there, the majority of the Court said, when 

11 we look at alternative remedies, we try to figure out, 

12 quote, "whether they amount to a" -- "amount to a 

13 convincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain 

14 from providing a new and free-standing remedy." 

Inasmuch as there has been burden discussion in this 

16 Court's case law, it would seem to fall -- fall on the

18  Now, I think there's an important point here 

19 when we think of burdens. This case is so close to 

Carlson that really the burden should be on them to take 

21 it out of Carlson. I want to address Carlson for a 

22 second, if I may. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you do, 

24 on page 5 of your brief you say, in the private prison 

setting, quote, "'a Bivens claim against the offending

1 individual offending officer,'" end quote, is an
 

2 appropriate remedy. And the quote is from Malesko.
 

3  MR. PREIS: Yes.
 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What we said in
 

Malesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner 

6 in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, 

7 he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending 

8 individual officer. Now, your friend describes that as 

9 a distortion of what we said in Malesko, and I just 

wanted to give you a chance to reply to what I think is 

11 a fairly serious assertion. 

12  MR. PREIS: Yes, Your Honor, and I would 

13 seriously disagree with the suggestion it's a 

14 distortion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to be 

16 clear, you quote that language -- you say "in the 

17 private prison setting"; and the language specifically 

18 says in a BOP facility. 

19  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, what the Court was 

speaking of in that section of its opinion was that the 

21 remedies between a BOP facility and individuals in a 

22 private facility should be similar, that it made no 

23 sense to give extra remedies to people in a private 

24 facility. And so, the Court, Justice -- Chief Justice 

Rehnquist at the time, was making a comparison saying

1 there should be a general symmetry. And all we are 

2 pointing out in that quote is that inasmuch as symmetry 

3 matters, well, the Court there in Malesko had said, 

4 well, we would likely expect there to be an individual 

remedy. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would expect the 

7 same rule. That's your argument --

8  MR. PREIS: Yes. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to apply in the 

private prison setting. What you say is that there we 

11 explained that, in the private prison setting, a Bivens 

12 claim against the offending individual officer was the 

13 appropriate remedy. 

14  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I guess I certainly 

took part of the quote and didn't use all of the quote, 

16 but I did not in any means say -- mean to --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's known as misquoting. 

18  MR. PREIS: Well, Your Honor, I guess I 

19 would respectfully differ.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you be taking the 

21 position that even if there is an alternative State 

22 remedy, tort remedy, even so there ought to be a 

23 parallel Bivens action? Or would you say no Bivens 

24 action if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?

 MR. PREIS: I think, Your Honor, if this

1 Court would -- could tell with confidence that States, 

2 in all States, provided sufficient remedies for the 

3 entire variety of Eighth Amendment violations, this 

4 Court would be certainly wise in allowing State remedies 

to work. But I think we're far from that situation. 

6  I want to turn, if I may --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could you give me your best 

8 example of a State tort rule that would prevent a 

9 prisoner from bringing an Eighth Amendment claim?

 MR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor. Could 

11 you repeat that question? 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Your best example of a tort 

13 rule from any State that would preclude a -- a valid 

14 Eighth Amendment claim.

 MR. PREIS: In other words, the prisoner 

16 would have an Eighth Amendment claim but not a tort --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: You have 50 States' worth of 

18 tort law to -- as your playground, and I want to know 

19 what tort rule would keep a prisoner with a valid Eighth 

Amendment claim -- would prevent him from recovering? 

21  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I would note 

22 Maryland, for example. In Maryland, attacks by a 

23 prisoner on another prisoner are evaluated in terms of 

24 the liability of the warden; a lot evaluate it on a 

maliciousness standard. Now, the standard this Court

1 uses in attacks by one prisoner against another is a 

2 deliberate indifference standard. The deliberate 

3 indifference standard is different. 

4  We're not arguing in this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 

6 you're talking about. Is this a suit against a prisoner 

7 who was attacked? 

8  MR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: He's not liable unless he's 

malicious, or what? 

11  MR. PREIS: No, it's a suit against the 

12 warden --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: The warden. 

14  MR. PREIS: -- for a failure to protect 

someone against attack by another prisoner. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. And -- and the 

17 warden is liable in Maryland, you say, only if he is 

18 malicious? 

19  MR. PREIS: The test in Maryland is 

maliciousness, yes. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about medical 

22 malpractice caps? Is that an issue? In other words, 

23 State law -- and I don't know how many there are; I know 

24 it's been proposed -- I think it's true in some 

cases will cap your recovery for medical malpractice at

2  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I don't think it's a 

3 significant difference in this case. For instance,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was -- that was a 

6 helpful question, in the sense that --

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. PREIS: Oh, I understand. I --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Bivens action --

presumably the cap would not apply. But it applies 

11 under State law. 

12  MR. PREIS: I think there will be some cases 

13 in which the remedies will be curtailed under State law. 

14 And one could expect that the deterrent value of a State 

law remedy would not be available. 

16  I have a couple of minutes remaining, and I 

17 want to turn to Carlson. I think the suggestion is in 

18 this that we've -- the discussion that we have had so 

19 far is that we're asking the Court to reach out and 

create an extraordinary cause of action. I simply don't 

21 think that's true. This case is very similar if not the 

22 same as Carlson. 

23  In Carlson, the Court said that a Federal 

24 prisoner has a cause of action against Federal actors 

for a Federal constitutional right. That's what this 

44

Official 

1 case is. And the only distinction the Petitioners can 

2 point to is the fact that they are privately employed 

3 Federal actors as opposed to publicly employed Federal 

4 actors.

 So, the question becomes, is "privately 

6 employed" Federal actor a meaningful distinction from 

7 "publicly employed"? We would -- if that distinction is 

8 meaningful, we would have expected to find some 

9 discussion of it in Malesko, but the Court there paid 

absolutely no attention to the private status. The 

11 Court in Malesko said that Malesko, that case, was in 

12 every meaningful sense the same as FDIC v. Meyer. 

13 FDIC v. Meyer was a suit against a public agency. 

14  If the case is in every meaningful sense the 

same as Meyer, then it must have been what mattered to 

16 the Court in Malesko was that it was a suit against an 

17 entity, not public versus private. So, we think there's 

18 no evidence in this case that -- or, excuse me -- no --

19 nothing in the law that suggests this Court cares and 

ever has cared the distinction between public and 

21 private remedies. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Carlson, it was 

23 Bivens or no damage remedy. Here, that's not the case. 

24  MR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed 

the first part of the question.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Carlson, the Court was 

2 operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal 

3 employee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no 

4 remedy at all.

 MR. PREIS: No individual remedy. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. 

7  MR. PREIS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And here, it is different 

9 from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an 

individual. So, we have the parallel remedies here 

11 which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two 

12 cases different. 

13  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think it's fair to 

14 say that, in Carlson, the Court expressed a preference 

for an individual remedy over an entity remedy. But I 

16 don't think it's fair to say that the Court addressed in 

17 Carlson how it would compare to individual remedies. 

18  That issue actually came up in Bivens. 

19 There was an individual remedy proposed that would be 

available under State law, and the alternative was a 

21 remedy under the Constitution itself. So, when the 

22 Court was faced with two alternative individual actions, 

23 the Court said that we prefer the constitutional cause 

24 of action. And the reason in Bivens was we can't be 

certain really how State law works.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you disagree 

2 that the -- I know you have your argument on 

3 compensation --

4  MR. PREIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but with respect 

6 to deterrence, is there any significant difference 

7 between the two causes of action? In other words, if 

8 you think the most significant aspect of Bivens is 

9 to deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work 

equally as well or perhaps more effectively under the 

11 State law than under Bivens? 

12  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think in the end 

13 the question asks me to make a 50-State assessment of 

14 how State law works, and in that sense, one can only 

speak in generalizations. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your answer --

17 your answer is the same as under compensation, that the 

18 State law might be different or not? 

19  MR. PREIS: We think, inasmuch as a cause of 

action is available, with the exception, as the Court 

21 noted, of damages caps, there -- we would expect to have 

22 a similar level of deterrence, provided that damages are 

23 available. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who -- who actually 

ends up paying in these Bivens actions? Is it the -- I

2  MR. PREIS: What we don't know for --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the Federal 

4 Government or an individual or --

MR. PREIS: We would expect -- first of all, 

6 obviously, the liability is imposed on the individual. 

7 We would expect, as a general matter, that there would 

8 be indemnification by the corporation. The question 

9 then is, of course, whether that gets passed on to the 

Federal Government. And I don't think it's fair -- if 

11 the Court allows a Bivens action here, I think there's 

12 the suggestion that all of a sudden, there'll be a whole 

13 new realm of liability and costs. And that's simply not 

14 the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just looking in 

16 terms of the practical deterrence. The problem I've had 

17 with it in general, I don't know how much practical 

18 deterrence there is as if you sue the individual and 

19 the -- the individual doesn't actually pay; the 

government does. It seems to me perhaps more likely in 

21 the private context that the individual may get stuck 

22 with some amount of the liability if the employer just 

23 says, look, you were off doing something you weren't 

24 supposed to do; we're not going to pay for it.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that the 

6 warden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he 

7 allows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is 

8 only liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate 

9 indifference, if indeed there is a difference between 

the two? Do you think that -- that he's threading the 

11 needle that finely, as far as -- as far as deterrence is 

12 concerned? 

13  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think it's always 

14 been this Court's presumption that actors, legal actors, 

respond to the standards of law that are imposed. I 

16 can't say --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not at that level of -- of 

18 refinement. I mean, it seems to me that any warden 

19 knows he's subject to State tort law and that State tort 

law renders him liable for negligence and, indeed, for 

21 physical assaults. Some of your causes of action are 

22 intentional torts, not even negligence. I find it hard 

23 to believe that, as far as deterrence is concerned, 

24 there's a dime's worth of difference between State law 

and -- and the Bivens action you're asking for.

1  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, if it's the case 

2 that there's not a dime's worth of difference, that 

3 would only be at this point. And one can expect State 

4 law to change over time. I think one of the questions 

propounded to Mr. Franklin or Mr. Shah was, what if a 

6 State imposed a -- or created absolute immunity? I 

7 think -- I take Your Honor's point to be that there 

8 could be a similarity at one point. And we agree that 

9 that could exist for any -- for a particular 

circumstance. But we don't think this Court should take 

11 the enforcement of Federal rights in Federal prisons 

12 with regard to Federal actors and set up a scheme where 

13 that's handled through State law. There's simply not a 

14 justification there.

 Your Honor, I'd like to address the Westfall 

16 Act. They argue strenuously that Congress has already 

17 spoken in this case. And that's simply not the case. 

18 In the -- put it this way: The FTCA and the Westfall 

19 Act deal only with Federal employees, the liability of 

the Federal Government for actions of Federal employees. 

21 Their argument is essentially that Congress attempted to 

22 deal with whether or not private contractors should be 

23 liable in these situations by -- by amending a statute 

24 that has nothing to do with private contractors. And 

that simply doesn't work. It's not -- there's no

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what was the 

4 purpose of making the reference to private contractors 

in the Westfall Act? 

6  MR. PREIS: Your Honor, the Court -- excuse 

7 me -- Congress did not make a reference to private 

8 contractors in the Westfall Act. They simply -- the 

9 Congress simply referred to employees of the United 

States. And the reason the Court -- excuse me --

11 Congress referred to employees of the United States was 

12 because the FTCA only applies, and has always only 

13 applied, to contractors -- excuse me -- employees of the 

14 United States. There would have been no reason to reach 

out because it would be totally beyond the specter of 

16 the FTCA itself. 

17  I think, Your Honor, there's something else 

18 to note here with regard to Congress. At most, what 

19 we're dealing with here is congressional silence. They 

suggest that Congress is fit to take care of this. 

21 Nobody doubts that Congress is fit to step in and take 

22 care of this at some point in time. But -- this Court's 

23 practice with regards to Bivens has been, when Congress 

24 steps in, to stand back. But here we have congressional 

silence. As this -- as the Court said in 2007, its most

1 recent Bivens case was, when you're dealing -- well, 

2 excuse me -- the Wilkie case did not involve any 

3 specific congressional action. The Court viewed it 

4 essentially as congressional silence. The majority of 

this Court at that time said our evaluation in that
 

6 instance is to figure out -- excuse me -- whether the
 

7 Federal courts must make the kind of remedial
 

8 determination that is appropriate for a common law
 

9 tribunal. The Court at that point saw itself as a
 

common law tribunal within the specific circumstance of 

11 whether or not a Bivens remedy should be available. 

12 That's not to say the Court should adopt some sort of 

13 roving common law power. It's simply to say where 

14 there's congressional silence and the case looks almost 

identical to Carlson, if not identical, that there's 

16 sufficient reason for this Court to find a Bivens cause 

17 of action here. 

18  If there's no further questions, I urge this 

19 Court to affirm the holding of the Ninth Circuit.

1 misimpression. There's no allegation here that anyone 

2 was deliberately starved. With the allegation regarding 

3 the food, his allegation in his complaint is that he --

4 because presumably his arms were in casts, he couldn't 

hold his tray in the cafeteria, and, therefore, he says, 

6 I had to buy my own food from the commissary because I 

7 didn't want to be humiliated by going to the cafeteria. 

8  We think that if that claim somehow stated a 

9 claim under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate 

indifference, that it would state a claim under 

11 negligence as well. And all of these claims essentially 

12 are that the prison failed to accommodate his injuries. 

13 Malesko was the same. In Malesko, the argument was: I 

14 didn't get to use an elevator because I had a 

pre-existing condition, and that's what caused my harm. 

16  If there is something that negligently 

17 causes harm, unreasonably causes harm, there is a remedy 

18 in California. I would also note that if it does not 

19 cause harm, there's no Bivens remedy, because Congress 

in the PLRA has said you cannot bring any claim, if 

21 you're a prisoner, in Federal court unless it involves 

22 physical harm. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want us to hold that

3 there are alternative remedies. We think that holding 

4 as in Malesko would apply everywhere. Everybody has --

every State has a negligence cause of action. And I 

6 think one thing that crystallized the argument for me is 

7 the colloquy between Justice Scalia and -- and my 

8 friend, where I think there was an admission that what 

9 they are actually seeking is a blanket cause of action 

to account for any possible instance in which there is 

11 an inadequate remedy. 

12  I think it goes even further. I think 

13 they're asking for a blanket cause of action if somebody 

14 can hypothesize an interest, an issue, and even further 

than that, even if we can't hypothesize it, maybe 

16 somewhere along the line, something might happen. We 

17 think that's a -- flipping, turning Bivens on its head. 

18 Bivens is a narrow remedy that is only allowed when it 

19 is necessary. If those circumstances arise, they can be 

dealt with at that time. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know if any of 

22 these Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative; 

23 that is, a Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law?

be reserved for another day if something happened that 

6 might implicate it. 

7  If there are no further questions --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there diversity in 

9 this case?

 MR. FRANKLIN: There may be. I think -- I 

11 think he alleged that there was. We would agree with 

12 the other side that the domicile of a -- of a prisoner 

13 is, at least in the circuits, determined by where the 

14 prisoner had been before they were in prison, and I 

think this particular prisoner had been somewhere other 

16 than California. So, probably. I can't -- I can't say 

17 about the -- the amount in controversy, but probably. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you said there was a 

19 statute of limitations problem with starting new.
