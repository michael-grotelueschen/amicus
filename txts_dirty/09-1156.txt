 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1156, Matrixx Initiatives 

v. James Siracusano.

 Mr. Hacker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 All drug companies receive, on an almost 

daily basis, anecdotal hearsay reports about alleged 

adverse health events following the use of their 

products. Those incident reports do not themselves 

establish any reliable facts about the drug's 

performance or its safety, especially where, as here, 

there are only a handful of reports out of millions of 

products sold over a 4-year period, and -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, do we know 

that from this record? I mean, we know that the 

plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute 

whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there 

were no other complaints made? So that, let's say, 

there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading 

stage. The company would have said: That's it; we

didn't have any more.

 MR. HACKER: All I can speak for is what's 

alleged in the complaint, and the complaint, no matter 

how read, doesn't allege any more than 23 adverse event 

reports.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they might have been 

able through discovery to find that there were many 

more.

 MR. HACKER: That's true, but there's no 

allegation that what they -- what they know about or 

what they could find would have been a statistically 

significant difference between the rate of reported 

events and the background of -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't that 

determination be deferred until there's discovery, and 

then we can know how many reports there really were?

 MR. HACKER: Because it's incumbent on a 

plaintiff to come to court with a case, to plead the 

facts necessary to establish all of the elements of a 

claim, and a securities fraud claim, of course, requires 

both materiality and scienter. And neither of those is 

established unless the company has knowledge of facts 

establishing a reliable basis for inferring that the 

drug itself is the cause of the reported event.

 Absent information like that, there is

neither materiality nor scienter under the securities 

laws, because neither the company nor an investor -­

until there's reliable evidence of a causal link between 

the two products, neither a company -- excuse me, a link 

between the product and the event -- neither the company 

nor an investor would have any reason to think that an 

adverse event report is -- actually indicates a problem 

with the product -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be -­

MR. HACKER: -- as opposed to a coincidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can there be some situations 

in which statistically significant evidence would not be 

necessary?

 For example, suppose some very distinguished 

physicians concluded, based on clinical trials, that 

there was a connection between a drug and a very serious 

side effect. Could that establish materiality?

 MR. HACKER: Well, I think a distinguished 

physician would not conclude that there's a connection 

unless the clinical trials reveal a statistically 

significant difference between what they've seen and 

what they would expect to see were there no association. 

So there's that point, Your Honor.

 But the second point I would make is we 

acknowledge there are a very narrow, limited number of

circumstances under which a claim can be pled absent 

statistically significant evidence, but that's -- that's 

because doctors and researchers will conclude that there 

may be causation under narrow circumstances. For 

example, I think the most common set of criteria are the 

Bradford-Hill criteria. But nothing like that is pled 

here, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, the complaint 

did not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents 

but also referred to a -- a study, a report by 

researchers at the American Rhinologic Society -­

MR. HACKER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which -- which asserted 

that there was a connection.

 MR. HACKER: But that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- is the question 

before us simply whether in isolation the adverse 

incidents would be enough, or is not the question 

whether those adverse incidents placed next to this 

study would be enough?

 MR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor. 

First, the plaintiffs have, throughout this litigation, 

framed their case as one based on the failure to 

disclose adverse event reports. It's the number of 

adverse event reports that they say is the problem, and

they're not saying that there was a study out there and 

that we failed to disclose the study. They say -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't they say that?

 MR. HACKER: -- it's the fact of the adverse 

event reports. Well, I think if you look at the -- now, 

to be clear, the study is not attached to the complaint, 

so there wasn't a basis in the complaint for saying the 

company was aware of a reliable study, and here are the 

details of the study, and they failed to disclose it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the -­

you're saying the complaint did not refer to the study?

 MR. HACKER: It did refer to it. That's 

true. And if you look at the study, there's really 

nothing there. It's based on -- primarily on a case 

study of one -- and, again, this isn't in the complaint; 

it's in the -- it is attached to the red brief, Your 

Honor.

 There's one case study of one man who is 55 

year old -- 55 years old, which is the population most 

likely to experience anosmia. You're more likely to get 

it when you're -- he's suffering from signs of lupus, 

which causes anosmia, and he's taking Flonase, which 

also causes anosmia. And so the idea that you can infer 

from that one incident out of millions over years of 

product sales that -- that Zicam causes anosmia and that

there's a problem out there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 

-- you're talking about who's right or wrong about the 

connection between Matrixx and anosmia. But that's not 

the question. I'm an investor in Matrixx; I worry 

whether my stock price is going to go down. You can 

have some psychic come out and say Zicam is going to 

cause a disease, with no support whatsoever, but if it 

causes the stock to go down 20 percent, it seems to me 

that's material.

 MR. HACKER: But if -- that's precisely the 

point, Your Honor. If a psychic came out or a lunatic 

on the street corner is barking, you know, through a 

megaphone that there's a problem with the product, 

that's not the kind of information a -- a reasonable 

investor would rely on.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But wait a minute. 

These -- these weren't psychics. These were three 

clinical doctors in this area, one of them you knew 

poised to go to a society meeting to make this 

allegation.

 Doesn't it make a difference who the reports 

are coming from and what the substance of those reports 

may do to your product?

 MR. HACKER: It may make a difference, Your

Honor, and I didn't mean to suggest that, you know, 

these are psychics. The point simply is, following up 

on the Chief Justice's question, that it does matter 

what the basis of the allegation, and is the evidence, 

the facts available to the company, reliable? Does it 

create a reliable inference that a reasonable investor 

would be concerned about?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose 

you stipulate, in response to the Chief Justice's 

question, that it's irrational, that it's probably 

baseless, but that the market will react adversely. Is 

there a duty then to address the claim?

 MR. HACKER: Under the case law, it's not 

clear that that's true. In this case, looking at this 

case specifically, Your Honor, when the market reacted, 

what the market was reacting to was a Good Morning 

America report. It's very important to be clear about 

what that report said.

 On Good Morning America, a leading morning 

news program, the allegation was made by Dr. Jafek that 

Zicam causes anosmia. That's a very different 

allegation that what the company was -- than what it was 

the company was aware of, which was simply the adverse 

event reports.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if there's a baseless 

report -- and we stipulate that, although it's baseless, 

it's going to affect the market -- could that be the 

basis for an allegation, assuming the requisite 

scienter, that there's liability?

 MR. HACKER: Two answers, I would say, Your 

Honor. First of all, we have to be very careful about 

creating a rule through our interpretation of 

materiality that would require companies in advance to 

disclose the fact that a baseless, false allegation 

about the company is going to come out because it 

requires the company to ring the bell -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's not the 

allegation. It's the fact that the market may be 

affected.

 MR. HACKER: Well, I understand, but the 

problem is if the-- what the rule would say is, because 

the company is aware the market may be affected, the 

company in advance has to say: A false report about us 

is about to come out. It requires the company to first 

ring the bell and then un-ring it in the same statement, 

and that's not a good rule for companies.

 Shareholders wouldn't want that rule, to 

require companies to denigrate their product and then do

their best to explain why the allegation is untrue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hacker, you just 

said, if I understood you correctly, that when the -­

when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate 

or not, there was an obligation to do something about 

it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that 

there was these reports, but it's the way the company 

responded to them: two press releases that said 

allegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are 

completely unfounded. That statement was made even 

after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?

 MR. HACKER: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- had this presentation, 

and he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the 

company said you don't have any permission to do that. 

So the company prevented Good Morning America from 

happening earlier, and it made these affirmative 

statements that there's no linkage.

 MR. HACKER: Well, what they said was -- and 

this was true -- that it was completely unfounded and 

misleading. The very scientific panel that plaintiffs 

themselves rely on, which convened and issued its report 

2 weeks later, confirmed that. There was no -- it's

absolutely unfounded at the time to -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 

scientific report that came out later said we can't say 

one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying 

that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded.

 MR. HACKER: And that's correct, there 

isn't, when -- when the scientific panel said you can't 

make that claim, it's unfounded, there's no basis in the 

available science.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't say 

"unfounded." They said the evidence is not -- we can't 

say yes and we can't say no. That's different from 

completely unfounded.

 MR. HACKER: Well, I'm -- with respect, Your 

Honor, I'm not entirely sure it is. When you're talking 

about science, you make a claim that's either supported 

in the science or it's without support. And the point 

the scientific panel was making is there was no support 

in the available science, and what Jafek was relying on 

was unreliable. As I just described, the one -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, you're 

saying that the question of whether there is support is 

reducible to the question of whether there are 

statistically significant findings. Now, as I 

understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to

drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the 

market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis 

of findings that are not statistically significant. 

Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to 

know the very things that are going to make the FDA take 

action against a product and that are going to severely 

affect the product's value to the company. Not 

statistical significance there.

 MR. HACKER: That's true, but the problem 

with that sort of standard -- well, first of all, to 

emphasize -- to look at the facts of this case, the FDA 

didn't take any action until 5 years later, but -- and 

which shows that the -­

eventually it did.

 MR. HACKER: But that's what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: And you are suggesting a 

test for what -- what counts as material, which is 

statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself 

doesn't use when it thinks about what it should -- what 

it should regulate.

 MR. HACKER: The problem is ex ante. You 

have to -- you can't look at this through hindsight. 

You have to look at this ex ante. When a company has a 

handful of reports -- it's absolutely true, nobody would

dispute, that some day in the distant future, with the 

accumulation of more data, the FDA may take action based 

on its own prophylactic public health regulatory 

discretion. But at the time, ex ante, no company, when 

it gets an adverse event report, can possibly know 

whether that's enough information for the FDA to act. 

So the prospect that the FDA may some day act on the 

basis of additionally accumulated information would 

require disclosure of all reports all the time, and 

that, we submit, cannot be the standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hacker, suppose Good 

Morning America made the same claim, categorically 

saying that this drug caused this condition, but did so 

simply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they 

didn't have Dr. Janner's, or whatever his name is, 

reports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out, 

and on the basis of those incidents, saying Zicam causes 

whatever the condition is. Would that have to be 

reported?

 MR. HACKER: Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: And if not, why not?

 MR. HACKER: I think what you would have to 

be hypothesizing is evidence that the company, say a 

week in advance, knew that Good Morning America was 

going to come out and say that, because once Good

Morning America says it, it's said it and the effect is 

what it is.

 But even in the hypothetical -- you're -­

you'd have to sort of unpack what you said. If Good 

Morning America came out and said just what Matrixx knew 

at the time -- there are a handful of adverse event 

reports, there's -- it's over millions of product uses 

over a 4-year period, and no indication that that's at 

all in any way different from the incident rate in the 

general population, especially among cold users, who, of 

course, are most likely to experience anosmia -- you 

know, we don't know what would have happened. But then 

you add the element that Good Morning America then 

declares that Zicam causes anosmia -- again, the 

hypothetical would have to be in advance Matrixx is 

aware -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. That's -­

MR. HACKER: -- that the false claim is 

going to be made.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine.

 MR. HACKER: Right, and I would say, first 

of all, we have to be very careful, as I said before, 

about a rule that requires a company to disclose false 

facts. I would say, second, that a reasonable investor 

doesn't want false information; a reasonable investor

MR. HACKER: And that's why it's a 

meaningfully different case. If the plaintiffs have -­

plead in their complaint that there's a memo inside the 

company, for example, so this false fact is going to 

come out, and we know it's going to cause a stock drop, 

that would be a case involving the materiality of a 

media splash, a big media event.

 It can't be that there's a false claim out 

there somewhere and the company becomes aware of the 

false claim and then, purely hypothetically, it's 

possible that somebody will make the false claim. It 

becomes also possible that the media will pick up and 

not be persuaded to ignore the false claim.

whether the claim is false or not. So let me give you a 

hypothetical: There's a pharmaceutical company and it 

comes out with its first and only product. It's 100 

percent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens 

solution. And it sells this product to many, many, many

hundreds of thousands of people. And most of them use 

this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but 

there are 10 cases where somebody uses this product and 

they go blind. Three of those 10 cases -- the person 

had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it 

in the one eye; they go blind only in that one eye.

 This is not statistically significant. 

There is no way that anybody would tell that you these 

10 cases are statistically significant. Would you stop 

using that product, and would a reasonable investor want 

to know about those 10 cases?

 MR. HACKER: I -- I would want to know more 

about the number of uses and all that, but, no, there 

wouldn't be a basis. A reasonable investor would want 

to know all the facts and details that would establish a 

reason to draw a -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: There are a lot of contact 

lens solutions in the world. So if I heard that, 10 

people went blind, 3 used it in one eye, 3 went blind in 

that eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were 

holding stock in that company, I'd sell the stock.

 MR. HACKER: The problem is -- I mean, there 

has to be some reliable basis. You may be describing 

facts that would satisfy the Bradford-Hill criteria, for 

example, where you can draw a -- a reliable inference

that the product is the cause. That's the key here. 

There has to be -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -­

MR. HACKER: -- a reliable basis for 

inferring causation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This is the same kind of 

question, but suppose I don't really know how drug 

companies operate. I suspect, but I don't know, that 

where you have a serious drug, people are hurt all the 

time and they blame the drug. So probably drug 

companies operate in an environment where they get all 

kinds of complaints and some are valid, some are not; 

who knows? People are frightened.

 MR. HACKER: Very much so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, I don't know 

that. But you say at the beginning your client says: 

Look, we get complaints all the time; you know, just put 

up with it if you buy our stock. Now, I don't know to 

what extent that's true. I don't know how that fits in. 

I don't know whether their complaint is unusual or not 

unusual or general.

 Who is supposed to decide that? The judge 

at the complaint stage? Or the judge after you get some 

evidence on it? Or the jury? And the same is true of 

scienter, after all, because the scienter, you see -­

and you have to plead that with particularity. Okay. 

What's my -- what's your answer? What's the -- what's 

-- I mean, Justice Kagan has an interesting view of 

this, and could be, that she's putting forward and 

others might have a different view. Who is to decide 

this?

 MR. HACKER: Well, ultimately it's a 

question -- it would go all the way to the jury if the 

plaintiffs were able to plead facts in the complaint 

that entitled them to relief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we don't know. You 

see, what they're saying is we have one respectable 

doctor, studier, at -- you know, in Colorado. He, by 

the way, has an abstract which isn't in the complaint, 

which says that they do allege that it's zinc that's the 

problem, a free zinc ion. And they say we also have 25 

people who were hurt and some burning sensations in 

people where it didn't rise to that level.

 You know, I don't know. I don't know if 

that's within the range of expectation of drug companies 

as part of the normal course of business which investors 

should know about, and I suspect a district judge 

doesn't know, either. So how does it work where we in 

fact just don't know whether this does or not arise 

above the background noise of a drug company?

statistical significance, just like the Second Circuit

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, it can't be. I

 JUSTICE BREYER: But, look -- I mean, Albert 

Einstein had the theory of relativity without any 

empirical evidence, okay? So we could get the greatest 

doctor in the world, and he has dozens of theories, and 

the theories are very sound, and all that fits in here 

is an allegation he now has learned that it's the free 

zinc ion that counts.

devastating to a drug even though there isn't one person 

yet who has been hurt. So I don't see how we can say -­

significance always works or always doesn't work.

it, is apparently reputable, and was told to a person

be very clear about the zinc studies, the claim made on

said, are you aware of the zinc sulfate studies, which, 

of course, is a fundamentally different compound 

than zinc gluconate.

complaint, that the problem that they saw arising out of 

the zinc sulfate studies was the free zinc ion.

MR. HACKER: Well, in terms of scienter, 

under the securities law there has to be a plausible 

basis, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- you got 

cert granted on a limited question, and the limited 

question was whether, in a complaint that alleges only 

adverse reports, can you prove materiality and scienter 

without proving statistical importance. That's the 

question presented.

 Justice Kagan started with the point that 

the FDA doesn't require that. It requires just 

reasonable evidence of a connection, not statistical. 

Many of the amici here have done a wonderful job of 

explaining why statistical importance can't be a measure 

because it depends on the nature of the study at issue.

 So given all of that -- and even in your 

brief, in a footnote, you answered the question by 

saying no, we can't establish that rule as an absolute, 

because there are additional factors that could prove 

materiality and scienter. So you've already answered 

the question presented.

 Are we down to what Justice Scalia asked 

you, which is: We've got a "no" to the question: Are 

the facts in this case enough? I don't know why we 

would have granted cert on that, but you presented a

different question presented. Given the question 

presented, is the answer no? And if not, why not?

 MR. HACKER: Let me -- let me start with the 

premise of the question presented. It's presented on 

the facts as the case had been litigated today, trying 

to rely on adverse event reports, which is 

understandable. The plaintiffs don't want to have to 

prove all of the other -- you wouldn't think they'd want 

to prove all of the other facts.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I just interrupt a 

second?

 MR. HACKER: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This wasn't an FDA­

approved drug.

 MR. HACKER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there weren't any 

adverse reports in the legal sense of that word.

 MR. HACKER: In the FDA sense, that's true.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the FDA sense. So 

we're using a misnomer here to start with.

 MR. HACKER: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Continue.

 MR. HACKER: I would just say that adverse 

event reports are not limited to what qualifies for the 

FDA, certainly not by the way the case is -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if I may 

interject -­

MR. HACKER: -- litigated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the FDA acts in the 

public interest, doesn't it?

 MR. HACKER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it doesn't make money 

by withdrawing a drug from the market.

 MR. HACKER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As opposed to somebody who 

sues, who makes money on the lawsuit.

 MR. HACKER: That's true. But there's a 

broader point about the FDA, which I think is underlying 

your question and Justice Kagan's question, which is I 

don't even think it's true that the FDA really requires 

reasonable evidence. They have broad discretion and 

should have broad discretion. Nobody is contesting 

that. But the question is, again, ex ante, before you 

know what the FDA might do, before there's sufficient 

evidence to justify the FDA to act. Remember, the FDA 

didn't act for 5 years. The FDA didn't act on the basis 

of what Matrixx was aware of at the time, and so that 

can't be the standard, the idea that the FDA may some 

day act.

statistical significance is presented in this case to 

the extent the courts below were arguing about and the 

plaintiffs were arguing about whether or not the small 

number of raw adverse event reports tell you anything 

meaningful. The real standard -- the -- the case got 

developed in the briefing here when the plaintiffs came 

back and said, well, there's more to it and there can be 

more to it, and that, of course, is true, but the 

standard has to be reliability.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but you -- you have 

said raw adverse event reports. Am I not right that all 

of these reports came from medical doctors, and in 

response to the very first one, the company 

representative said, yes, we've been getting reports 

since 1999?

 MR. HACKER: Well, there's a reference, but 

-- I mean, there's a -- 1999 was the first call from 

Dr. Hirsch, who reported one patient. There's a 

discussion with Dr. Linschoten about one other patient. 

And there were some reports -- nobody is disputing that 

there were some reports out there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, does 

it make a difference if these reports come from medical 

experts in this particular field?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 In TSC and Basic, this Court reaffirmed the 

longstanding rule that materiality is judged based on 

the total mix of information available to investors. 

Matrixx initially sought a major change to this Court's 

contextual approach to materiality by offering a 

bright-line standard of statistical significance.

 In its reply brief, Matrixx offer -- offers 

a rule that would apply only in the hypothetical 

scenario where investors rely solely on numbers of 

adverse event reports in pleading securities fraud.

 This Court should reject both arguments in

this case. The broad theory has numerous legal and 

policy flaws. First, the longstanding totality of the 

circumstances test best comports with the varied reasons 

why investors make investment decisions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the 

allegations of materiality are based solely on adverse 

event reports. Suppose that it's alleged that 10 

million people during -- during -- during 1 year have 

taken a particular drug and 5 people, shortly after 

taking the drug, have developed certain -- have had an 

adverse -- have had -- experienced an adverse event. Is 

that sufficient to go to a jury?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, probably not 

sufficient to go a jury absent a drop in the stock 

price, absent evidence that there was a scientifically 

plausible link, absent evidence that the product was 

highly important to the company's long-term financial 

prospects. All of these things go into the contextual 

mix that investors would regard as important in making 

an investment decision, and they all happen to be 

present here. We -­

they sold, that might be enough -- 5 adverse reports out 

of 10 million? If -- if that's the only product they

be enough?

 MR. FREDERICK: Under the Basic test, Your 

Honor, that very well might if the probability and the 

magnitude of the harm -- if those five incidents were 

deaths from a product that was easily substitutable, 

that might be a relevant decision and information that 

investors might want to take into account.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In response to 

Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a 

scientifically plausible link.

 MR. FREDERICK: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to 

be a rather significant concession. In other words, 

you're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic 

would say something, that that is not sufficient, even 

if that has an impact on the market price, that there 

has to be some scientifically plausible link to the 

report.

 MR. FREDERICK: I think this goes back to 

Justice Kennedy's question as well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

because there could very well be materiality. The 

information might be important for investors, but it 

could very well be that the people making the 

disclosures don't have the requisite scienter because 

there is an absence of any plausible relationship.

The stock price might drop on news that 

would not be regarded as news that the most highly 

scientifically rational people would take into account. 

But that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought this might 

come up. At some point, do we look at scienter and then 

go back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e., 

the argument would be the company knew that this would 

affect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose 

it, and therefore that shows it's material? Or do we do 

this with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two, 

scienter -- and we don't mix the analyses?

 MR. FREDERICK: They're both analytically 

distinct and related, Justice Kennedy, and I don't have 

a simple answer for you because many of the reported 

cases raise issues of both materiality and scienter. 

What the Court has said in Basic is that the test is the 

total mix of information and whether that -- under that 

total mix, the investor would find that information 

important. In Tellabs, the Court said that whether or 

not the inferences of scienter could be deemed -- were 

as plausible as other inferences based on the mental 

state of the people making the information.

 So the Court has announced separate tests. 

In a case like this, there is a natural overlap, and in

fact the other side has litigated this case on the basis 

that no one would have thought within the company, based 

on the adverse event reports, that there was a basis for 

thinking there was information.

 We plead the other way by saying that when 

you have three medical specialists in three distinct 

periods where the last wants to bring findings to the 

leading ear, nose, and throat medical society suggesting 

that, based on studies that go back as far back as the 

1930s, there is a scientifically plausible link based on 

the zinc ions, that's something that the company should 

have taken seriously and disclosed to investors.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Frederick, suppose 

you were the CEO of a pharmaceutical company with a new 

drug, you've just put it out on the market, and you get 

a report back, this drug has caused a death, right? 

This is your first adverse effect report. Do you have 

to disclose it?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I guess the first 

thing I would say is, if the drug has not been FDA 

approved, that would be material information that 

investors might want to know. If the drug had been FDA 

approved and that report was then submitted to the FDA, 

I think that there's a closer call depending on the, you 

know, effect of the report that might be on the stock

price, because that's the only company product and the 

other factors that we've mentioned in our brief.

 I think the question of one event is 

obviously much more difficult than where there are 

multiple events submitted by doctors with a 

scientifically plausible basis on a product that's 70 

percent of the company's revenues.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, we're told that there 

are hundreds of thousands of these, where for a -- for a 

typical drug there may be thousands of these adverse 

event reports in -- in a year, and you're -- basically, 

you're saying all of those have to be disclosed?

are all disclosed.

the reports here were not the classic FDA-regulated 

adverse event reports. This was a homeopathic drug that 

was put on the market without FDA approval, and there 

were no requirements of reports until 2006, which was 

after the period at issue here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How would you write -­

look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what -­

where I think where the other side has a point is if -­

with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of 

things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like 

that, and if we say that they have to disclose too much, 

what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, 

you know.

 And if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages 

of small print saying everything that was ever reported, 

what really happens in -- in such instances is the 

public pays no attention, and they think -- and it will 

hide the things that are actually important.

 So how would you write some words -­

assuming that you're right, that their test is wrong -­

but how would you write some words that will put a 

disclosure obligation such that it's not going to be 

overkill and it is going to get incidents that rise 

above the background noise, and those are the incidents

that are -- that would be significant for a reasonable

 MR. FREDERICK: I would start with the 

language in Basic, which says the total mix of 

information is what has, long standing, been the test 

for materiality under this Court's cases. I would say 

that where there is credible medical professional 

describing the harms based on credible scientific 

theories to back up the link, a very serious health 

effect risk for product with many substitutes, and the 

effect is on a predominant product line, then the 

company ought to disclose that information. I would

All right? So they've alleged in this complaint 

everything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and 

during the class period. And what it doesn't say is 

that very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in 

the pocket. It doesn't say they ever showed that to the 

company. All it says is there was a phone call and this

individual from -- from Colorado said something, which 

it doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number 

of deaths.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, in 1999, though, 

Justice Breyer, Dr. Hirsch -- and this is outlined at 

paragraph 25 of the complaint -- also said that 

intranasal application of zinc could be problematic, and 

he specifically asked about how much zinc is put in 

Zicam precisely because of his awareness of prior 

studies going all the way back to the polio period in 

which zinc had created a problem of persistent anosmia.

companies don't have to respond to irrational securities 

holders? Are you accepting your adversary's proposition 

that on some level -- you said credible evidence -- that 

they don't have to respond to things they judge are not 

credible?

Sotomayor, and I don't mean to be evasive, but if there

influences, and there is some reason to think that a 

large body of followers in an irrational way might 

regard there to be satanic influences on the basis of a 

particular product, a cautious, reasonably prudent 

investor might want to know that on the basis of that 

information that most of us would regard as irrational, 

might affect the stock price.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what protection 

is there at the summary judgment stage in response to 

allegations? Because it doesn't have to be 

scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational. 

All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had 

told this, the price would have gone down. If you had 

told -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have 

gone down. And the response from the company is, well, 

but this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his 

garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a 

piece of paper in -- in handwriting. And the response 

is going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out.

 MR. FREDERICK: There are two answers, Mr. 

Chief Justice. One is, in Basic itself, the Court 

talked about the actions of a reasonable investor, and 

this Court and many courts have always looked at a 

reasonable person standard in making all sorts of these 

fine judgments about the importance of particular

information. But the second answer is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told 

me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's 

a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a 

reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy 

people out there that this is going to affect the price.

 MR. FREDERICK: What I said was if the 

product was one that might be, you know, attractive in 

some way to people who had that particular following. 

think you have to link up the product with the nature of 

the complaint and the effect of the importance of the 

information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it matters 

whether -- I don't know what kind of product has 

particular satanic susceptibility -­

you saying it matters if it's something that -- that 

Satan's not going to be interested in? I don't

product is that it depends on whether people who follow 

satanic cults are going to be interested or not. I 

mean -­

MR. FREDERICK: Well, Your Honor, there are 

people who follow those things, and they spend money and 

they buy stocks, but my second point is that scienter -­

scienter is the other way around this problem, because 

even though information -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that -- if 

scienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold 

companies to -- to irrational standards. And we did -­

whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor. 

And -- and you are saying, well, the reasonable investor 

takes account of the irrationality. I don't think 

that's what we meant in -- in Basic.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, you 

can certainly write as a prophylactic here that that 

isn't part of this test. We certainly have here all of 

the indicia of credible medical professionals on a 

credible scientific theory on a product that was 

important to the company's finances and a very serious 

side effect for a drug that had ready substitutes.

talked again about credible scientists and all that, and 

you're putting those other things to one side.

 So even if you have your satanic problem, 

that is not enough. And you can sit there and allege it 

would cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and 

you should have let this know -- your answer is no, they 

don't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this 

because there is no scientific credible basis for the 

link that's alleged?

 MR. FREDERICK: Now, I'm saying two things. 

One is that there's a difference between scienter and 

materiality. There is importance of information and an 

intent to deceive, and the questions are analytically 

distinct. In your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think you merged them, and I'd like to keep them 

separate because as we -- as this case comes to the 

Court, the issue is what is the standard for materiality 

and whether or not statistical significance is the only 

way to -­

JUSTICE ALITO: On materiality -­

I'm having a little difficulty understanding the 

boundaries of the argument that you're making.

involve companies that have one product, and this is 

their one product. The first one was what I mentioned 

before, and I wasn't -- I wasn't clear about your 

answer. All that's alleged is that a very large number 

of people took the drug and that three people, after 

taking the drug, within a week developed a certain 

syndrome. That's the first one. Is that enough for 

materiality?

 The second one is that a company receives a 

telephone call: Hello, I'm a general practitioner from 

wherever, and I treated a patient, and the patient took 

your medication and shortly after that developed this 

syndrome, and I think there might be a connection. Is 

that enough for materiality?

 MR. FREDERICK: On the second one, I would 

say probably not. And I would say, on the first one, 

there's not enough information about the side effect and 

what the drug is intended to solve.

 I mean, the probability/magnitude test as 

articulated by this Court goes to the probability of the 

effect versus the magnitude that would be perceived by 

investors, and those are important factors they go into. 

So your hypothetical is very difficult to answer as you 

have framed it.

say it's a drug to relieve the common cold, and the 

effect is loss of the sense of smell. Five million 

people take it. Three people, after taking it, lose 

their sense of smell. Is that enough for materiality by 

itself?

 MR. FREDERICK: It -- by itself, that could 

be enough, and the reason we know that could be enough, 

Justice Alito, is that when, you know, some score 

additional were released and this information was 

disclosed, the stock price went down by 23.8 percent. 

So reasonable -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, your time 

is running out, and there's one thing that you emphasize 

in your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about 

it here -- and that is you're saying it's -- this is not 

a case of a company that remains silent. The company, 

in response to this, issued press releases in which it 

said any suggestion of a linkage is completely 

unfounded. Now, that's something different from there 

are X number of reports. To what extent are you relying 

on the affirmative statements that the company made?

 MR. FREDERICK: We're relying on those to 

establish scienter, both at the beginning of the class 

period when they forced Dr. Jafek, through their legal 

threats, to take Zicam off his poster presentation, and

then later when they said that the reports of anosmia 

were completely unfounded and "misleading," was the word 

that they used. "And misleading." And they repeated 

that after the Good Morning America program came on, 

only to say 3 weeks later, after empaneling a scientific 

expert panel, that the information was insufficient to 

make that determination. Our submission is that that is 

enough.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm 

not clear on why you can draw a distinction between 

materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue 

before us here.

 If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for 

materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for 

scienter. Why? I mean, if the company knows that 

satanic effect is material, then the company has -­

knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect 

is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter, 

if it's material?

 The scienter is withholding something that 

is material, that is known to be material, and once you 

say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the 

company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it 

in its report, no?

 MR. FREDERICK: And it would depend on what

off onto the scienter side of the equation.

 MR. FREDERICK: It depends -- it depends on

argument, Basic, which says you look at the total mix of

standard for scienter that this Court articulated and

there's already a heightened pleading standard, Justice 

Breyer. I was not -- I misunderstood your question to 

say, is there some other heightened pleading standard 

other than the one -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I mean -- I just 

want to know why -- if their inference on materiality is 

enough to survive the background noise reply, is it 

enough to show a strong inference that they did do this 

intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?

 MR. FREDERICK: The key aspects here are 

their treatment of Jafek when Jafek was going to go 

public with his scientifically linked claim of anosmia 

from the Zicam, and then subsequently when they issued 

press releases saying it would be completely unfounded 

and misleading to assert any causal link. That is 

sufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter.

 MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 For 35 years, this Court's precedents have 

instructed that information is material for securities 

fraud purposes if a reasonable investor would have 

viewed it as having meaningfully altered the total mix 

of information. Under the terms of their question 

presented, Petitioners propose to depart from that 

contextual inquiry in favor of a categorical rule that 

deems information about an adverse drug effect 

immaterial absent statistical significance.

company and said, hey, I think you guys are affiliated 

with satanic practices, surely a company would not have 

to go and disclose that to all the investors. But this 

is going to depend on what the actual reality is and

what the company's statements have been.

 Now, if the company has made a statement 

that, look, consumer confidence in our products is at an 

all-time high and we expect sales to double in the next 

quarter, and yet they are aware that there -- a consumer 

boycott is being planned by, let's say, 10 percent of 

their consumer base premised on the irrational notion 

that their company is tied to Satan, then certainly, to 

correct their affirmative representation that consumer 

confidence is at an all-time high and that they expect 

their sales to double, a reasonable investor would want 

to know that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: They haven't said that. 

They haven't said our sales are going to double. 

They're just rocking along at normal sales.

 MR. SHAH: Right.

10 percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to 

buy their stuff because of Satan. Okay?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor -­

the securities laws, there is no baseline duty to 

disclose for a manufacturer or a company. A company 

creates a duty to disclose once they have spoken. So 

it's going to depend on what the company has said.

 Now, in your scenario, if a company has made 

statements projecting their company's success into the 

next quarter, for example, and they have a concrete 

basis to know that, as your hypothetical submits, 

10 percent of their computer -- consumer base is going 

to leave the company's products, that is almost 

certainly going to be material to an investor, and so, 

yes, they would have to disclose that we have reason to 

believe, however ridiculous it is and untrue it is, that 

10 percent of our consumer base has decided to boycott 

our product. That's certainly reasonable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would have -­

you just said they would have a duty to disclose.

 MR. SHAH: Yes, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you 

earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to 

disclose; it only is based on what they say.

 MR. SHAH: It's based on what they said.

MR. SHAH: -- and not said anything about 

its future sales, its prospects, then under the 

securities laws there is no duty to disclose. Basic and 

other cases have long made clear that there has to be 

something to trigger a duty to disclose. That is, under 

Rule 10b-5 it's only statements that are rendered 

misleading by the omission of a material fact that can 

trigger liability. If there is no projection about the 

company's future success, then it wouldn't have to 

disclose in that situation.

strong momentum going into the season, extremely well 

positioned for a successful season?

 MR. SHAH: In certain cases where there are 

very generalized statements -- for example, we think our 

product will do well -- that may close -- come close to 

the line of puffery that is a non-actionable statement 

that no reasonable investor would rely on. Petitioners 

have never pressed that argument before this Court. 

There is no dispute about whether the statements that

Matrixx made in this case are actionable, even though I 

agree with you that some of them probably come close to 

that puffery line.

 Here, though, we don't just have those 

statements about the company being well positioned for 

future growth. There are additional statements, and 

these were made to stock analysts that they expected a 

50 percent increase in annual revenues, and, of course, 

there are the much more affirmative statements that the 

drug's safety had been well established and that the 

rumor -- the reports of anosmia were completely 

unfounded and misleading. Those statements certainly 

crossed the line. And as I said before, there hasn't 

been an argument in this case as to whether those less 

specific and arguably puffery-type statements -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the Government's 

position is that reports of adverse effects that have no 

scientific basis, so long as they would affect 

irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming 

the company has said we're doing well, right?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, yes, I think it 

would depend, again, on the statements the company 

makes. If -- if -­

MR. SHAH: Okay. So -- so, for example, 

if a company had been faced with a potential adverse 

effect and it had assembled a blue-ribbon panel of 

scientists, conclusively determined that there is no 

causal connection between this purported adverse effect 

and their drug, the question is, would they have to 

disclose in that circumstance?

 I think if the company had simply made 

statements relating to the drug safety -- we think our 

drug is safe; there's no reason to believe that it 

causes any adverse effects -- then the answer is no, 

because the reported adverse effect would not call into 

question the accuracy of the company's statements 

relating to the safety of the drug.

 If, however, the company had made specific 

statements relating to consumer demand for its products 

and it knew -- notwithstanding the fact that there was 

no causal connection, it knew or had good reason to 

believe that a significant portion of its consumer base 

would avoid the product, then, yes, a reasonable 

investor would want to know that information, and under

I think that falls squarely within the 

definition of materiality, which is would a reasonable 

investor want to have known that information?

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, what deference do 

you think that the SEC's understanding of materiality is 

entitled to and why?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, this Court in 

both TSC and Basic accorded what it called due deference 

to the SEC's views on the application of the materiality 

standard. I think it's certainly true -- and -- and 

those, by the way, were both -- the -- the Court was 

deferring to the views of the SEC as expressed in amicus 

briefs to the Court just like in this case.

 I think the SEC is due a significant 

deference based upon, one, its longstanding historical 

practice in applying the materiality standard, which is 

part of its own rule, Rule 10b-5, and its special 

expertise in knowing what a reasonable investor would 

want to know based upon its experience in this area. 

So, I do think that, to the extent there is any 

ambiguity remaining in this case, the Court should defer 

to the SEC's views.

 And back to Justice Breyer's questions about 

what should the Court write simply beyond reiterating 

the Basic standard, I think what the Court did in Basic

was it not only articulated the general standard, but it 

laid out some factors. And in laying out those factors, 

that's where the Court deferred to the SEC's brief. And 

it laid out factors that a reasonable investor might 

find relevant. In that case, it was the merger context.

 And here, on page 28 of our brief, we lay 

out several factors that we think bear on the 

materiality question in this particular context; that 

is, involving adverse drug information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any way 

that consideration of those factors would support a -- a 

summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical 

manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely 

poor lawyer drafting a complaint? Anytime you have a 

variety of factors like that -­

MR. SHAH: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I think it's very 

difficult for the judge to say anything other than 

that's for the jury.

 MR. SHAH: If you mean at the motion to 

dismiss stage, Mr. Chief Justice -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. SHAH: I think there would be some 

cases. And, in fact, we know there are dozens of 

12(b)(6) motions granted in securities fraud cases, and

let me lay out a few scenarios for you.

 One would be in the -- in the scenario where 

the company has not made any actionable statements. It 

has either -- statements to predicate a duty to 

disclose. It either has been made -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I'm talking 

about -- I'm talking about materiality. In other 

words -­

MR. SHAH: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based solely on 

-- in other words, you're saying if they say anything 

related, it's going to be enough -­

MR. SHAH: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's a 

scientific basis or not.

 MR. SHAH: Sure. Two responses to that. 

One, the PSLRA does have a safe harbor for companies 

once they make forward-looking statements, that if they 

add in meaningful cautionary language -- and this is in 

the PSLRA itself, section 5(c)(1)(A) -- that if they add 

in meaningful cautionary statements, then they cannot be 

subject to liability. And I think there are a couple 

other scenarios that would -- would trigger, for 

example, if the product at issue is such a small 

percentage of the company's income or expected growth

that no reasonable investor would care if it tanked, 

then that might be a circumstance where a motion to 

dismiss would be appropriate.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Hacker, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN HACKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HACKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'd like to return to Justice Kennedy's 

question about the role of scienter here, which I think 

absolutely is critical, as this Court emphasized 

recently in the Merck v. Reynolds case.

 Mr. Frederick correctly, I think, conceded 

that there has to be a scientifically plausible basis. 

And what you're talking about here is a company's 

knowledge of a scientifically plausible basis. And he 

has to make that concession in this case because of 

what's alleged to be the material omission.

 The material omission is not knowledge of 

dubious scientific -- medical claims. It's not that we 

got one phone call from a doctor. The real material 

omission is that the adverse event reports told Matrixx 

that Zicam causes anosmia. That's ultimately the fact 

that -- that Matrixx supposedly did not disclose. And

so there has to be a basis for believing that -- there 

has to be allegation in the complaint that's sufficient 

to establish that Matrixx actually knew that Zicam 

causes anosmia and yet willfully refused to tell 

investors that fact.

 And there's nothing in the complaint like 

that. There's not -- you're not talking about a case 

where there was a failure to disclose the doctor's 

completely dubious untested claim. It's not a case -­

it's not the Satan case where you're talking about a 

media splash, a known fact that there's going to be a 

major media splash, and the company knows for a fact 

that that splash is going to have the adverse effect on 

the stock. There's not even a claim here -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I was hearing the 

Solicitor General's argument, he wasn't actually even 

talking about causation. He was talking about a 

statement you made about the company poised to double 

its growth. And I think he was saying that on the basis 

of what you had heard up until that time, you had to 

have known that that statement was misleading, as was 

the statement that this drug -- that there was 

absolutely no proof or connection of causation, which 

was your scientific panel said you couldn't make that 

extreme statement.

MR. HACKER: Well, two points, Your Honor. 

First, if the claim was about, you know, the consumer 

sales, you would need an allegation in the case that 

consumer product sales were actually affected. There's 

no allegation like that, and the truth is they weren't. 

And so you're not talking about falsifying any prior 

claim. There's not even an allegation that that 

happened, Your Honor.

 And, second, with respect to the -- the 

statement, as I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg in 

the beginning part of the argument, the statement was -­

what the scientific panel was addressing primarily was 

Jafek's claim that Zicam causes anosmia, and the company 

said accurately that that is completely unfounded and 

misleading because there's no scientific support for it. 

You can't go out and claim that Zicam causes anosmia 

unless you have a scientific basis for that. And the 

scientific panel was saying that isn't true.

 So the question is whether you can draw an 

inference of scienter from the fact that -- from what's 

alleged here, and there's simply no basis for an 

allegation, supportable allegation, that the company 

knew it causes anosmia and nevertheless refused to tell 

investors that. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
