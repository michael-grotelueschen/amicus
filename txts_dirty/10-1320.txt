CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas. 

Mr. Sloan. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SLOAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The question in this case is whether the 

jury foreperson's announcement that the jury had voted 

unanimously that Petitioner was not guilty of capital 

murder and first-degree murder has double jeopardy 

consequences. We respectfully submit that it does, for 

two reasons. 

First, the foreperson's announcement on this 

record establishes an acquittal; and, second, even if it 

is not viewed as an acquittal, under this Court's 

well-established standard, there was not manifest 

necessity for a second trial on the same murder charges. 

Now, with regard to the acquittal, the 

reasons why the foreperson's announcement was an 

acquittal are twofold: First, the foreperson's 

announcement was clear and explicit that the jury had 

voted unanimously against guilt; and, second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that 

altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she 

first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge? 

MR. SLOAN: Yes, Your Honor. And then the 

court specifically asked what is the count on capital 

murder? And she said unanimous against that. What is 

the count on first-degree murder? Unanimous against 

that. And both the Arkansas trial court and the 

Arkansas Supreme Court here observed that the foreperson 

has been explicit that the jury had voted unanimously 

against --. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the count. The 

jury takes lots of votes. Was it utterly clear that the 

jury could not go back and reconsider that? Unless that 

was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not 

been announced. She just said how we voted the last 

time. 

MR. SLOAN: With regard to finality, Your 

Honor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed 

its mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that 

because I think it highlights something very important 

that is conspicuously absent here; and three brief 

points on that, Your Honor. 

First, when the foreperson announced that 

the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on the

murder charges, she was announcing a jury decision. 

There was nothing equivocal or qualified about that. 

Second, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Excuse me. 

When you say she was announcing a decision, then you 

mean they can't go back on it? 

MR. SLOAN: No, that was -- well, that's 

my second --

JUSTICE SCALIA: She was announcing a vote. 

MR. SLOAN: Yes. She was announcing the 

decision that they had made at that point. But the 

reason -- my second point, Your Honor, the reason why I 

say that they could have gone back is the historic 

traditional principle that a jury can correct or revise 

a verdict while it continues to be sitting. 

Now, in this Court's opinion, in Smith v. 

Massachusetts, this Court talked about that traditional 

and historic principle, cited an English case from 1824, 

the Parkin case, where the jury had done that, had gone 

back after announcing a verdict. And how that would 

play out here, if the jury came back and they said, you 

know, we were unanimous before, but now one juror says 

that he doesn't really agree with that, then, of course, 

a court could take that into account.

your case when you say that. The one characteristic of 

a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is 

final. 

The jury can't render a verdict and be 

discharged and then come back the next day and say, you 

know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind 

or her mind. It's the final vote. And so, why isn't 

the critical question here whether what the -- what the 

foreperson said was this is our final vote, we're not 

going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we 

voted now, and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted 

to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right, to 

go back and -- and vote again. 

MR. SLOAN: Because the -- the reason why I 

think the announcement was an acquittal here is twofold: 

First, there was the explicit statement of -- of what 

the vote was at that time; but, second, there is nothing 

on the record in this case that contradicts that 

statement. At the time the jury was discharged and at 

the time the trial ended, the jury had said nothing that 

contradicted that earlier statement. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- suppose the 

court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back 

and think about this whole case again. Could the jurors 

then have revisited the first count?

MR. SLOAN: Your Honor, if -- if the jurors 

had come back and said --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The colloquy is what 

we've got. 

MR. SLOAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the judge said I want 

you to deliberate more about this entire case. (A) was 

he permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is 

one of my real questions. 

MR. SLOAN: Oh. Well, in terms -- in terms 

of Arkansas law and the particular transition 

instructions here, no, we don't think that the 

transition instructions operate that way, Your Honor. 

There's nothing in the instructions that say that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Nothing -- nothing --

Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's 

delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the 

case again and vote on it again? 

MR. SLOAN: No. It -- it does, Your Honor, 

and that's why I'm trying to draw a distinction between 

how the transition instructions here operate, the sort 

of acquittal-first instructions, and the general 

principle that a jury can correct or revise its verdict.

I mean, in a sense, one way to think about -- 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- I think 

this may be what Justice Alito asked. Well, I -- I 

don't think it gave a verdict here. I don't think it's 

revising its verdict. 

MR. SLOAN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's mid-deliberation, as 

Justice -- Justice Scalia said at the outset. 

MR. SLOAN: There -- there's nothing in the 

jury statement at all that suggested that it was 

tentative. It said we have unanimously voted against 

guilt on the murder charges. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, one --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then they went -- then 

they went out again. 

MR. SLOAN: Pardon me? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's the problem. 

They, the jury -- the judge gave them an Allen charge, 

and they went out again. And I think you have 

recognized that the jury could have then said we'll go 

back to square one, we'll consider capital murder, 

first-degree murder. 

So, they -- I think you recognize that after 

the judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can 

begin all over again. And here, when they came in and

said we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to 

have the jury polled. 

MR. SLOAN: The -- the defense counsel asked 

for verdict forms to be sent into the jury room that 

would allow them to record their verdicts on the murder 

charges. And that's a very important point here, Your 

Honor, because it was the State that prevented any 

additional elucidation about what the jury thought on 

the murder charges. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- so long as it's 

still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter. The jury 

could have -- suppose the jury went back after this 

announcement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided 

on a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the 

greater charge for the defendant. Suppose they go back 

and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser 

charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says, 

well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on 

the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to 

acquit on the greater charge. 

Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in 

jury rooms all the time? 

MR. SLOAN: Yes, it does, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, there is no certainty 

whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time

would be the vote when they finally got done. 

MR. SLOAN: Well, but, Your Honor, on the 

record as the case comes to this Court, what you have is 

this very clear and explicit statement against guilt on 

the murder charges and then nothing in what the jury 

says when it comes back that contradicts that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess one --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought that 

part of your argument was that, given the instructions 

in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to 

the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they've 

acquitted on the preceding count. 

MR. SLOAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the judge asks 

them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say we 

were told not to. 

Now, the judge, whether he was right or 

wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the 

instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know. 

But it's very clear in context from the government's 

arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the 

jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about 

it unless you've been acquitted. 

So, given that the jury responds at the end 

we haven't reached a verdict, and the jury said earlier

that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue, 

isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go 

back? 

MR. SLOAN: Yes, I think that's exactly 

right, Your Honor, because the jury instructions very 

explicitly said that you don't go to a lesser offense 

unless you have a reasonable doubt on the greater 

offense. The State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's --

MR. SLOAN: -- over and over --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Go 

ahead. 

MR. SLOAN: I was just going to say the 

State over and over again in its closing argument said 

to the jury you cannot reach a lesser offense unless you 

unanimously find the defendant not guilty on the greater 

offense. And as you point out, the Arkansas Supreme 

Court in the Hughes case has said that the law in 

Arkansas is that you don't get to a lesser offense 

unless -- the jury doesn't get to a lesser offense 

unless it in essence acquits on the greater offense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but that's 

the final say. You don't know what the jury did as a 

preliminary matter. I would think it in a case like 

this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say: Let's

take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we 

all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do. 

Does everybody agree on capital murder? No, 

some don't. Does everybody agree on murder? No. Does 

everybody agree on manslaughter? Yes. Okay, we all 

know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty. Now let's 

go back and talk about the more serious offense, and 

some of us will try to persuade the holdouts. 

And yet, you would say as soon as they 

reached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on 

manslaughter, they can't go back. 

MR. SLOAN: Well, the instructions don't 

provide for them to -- for them to go back. The State, 

which had never made that argument until this Court in 

this litigation, that they can go back, doesn't point to 

any case that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then I'm not 

sure it's just a matter of State law then, we're --

what we're doing here is talking about the 

constitutional minimum. And I -- Justice Scalia gave a 

hypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more 

principled juror than that. He says, you know, now that 

we're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus 

and so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first --

first-degree count. I mean, that's perfectly plausible.

MR. SLOAN: Well, let me say, whatever one 

thinks about finality -- and I do think there was 

sufficient finality here for the reasons we have been 

discussing, but whatever one thinks about finality, 

let's consider this in the context of manifest necessity 

because whatever one thinks of finality, I submit that 

it is clear that when a jury foreperson stands up in 

front of the jury, in front of the defendant, lawyers 

for both sides, and says we have voted unanimously that 

he is not guilty of these murder charges, that is 

something at the very core of the Double Jeopardy 

Clause --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying --

MR. SLOAN: -- at the heartland of it. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that there 

was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to 

any count, in which case there could be no retrial 

whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a 

mistrial on capital murder? And if you're saying the 

latter, then what would you have us do with the decision 

by the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not 

allow a partial verdict? 

MR. SLOAN: Okay. Your Honor, so, first I'm 

saying only that there was no manifest necessity as to 

capital murder and first-degree murder, which were the

two charges on which they were unanimous. We agree he 

can be retried on manslaughter and negligent homicide. 

Now, as to the Arkansas Supreme Court 

decision on that -- and that brings up a very important 

point because the State's position essentially is it 

could never be final enough, as Your Honor suggests, 

because it simply is impermissible under Arkansas law to 

have an acquittal on a greater offense as long as you're 

deadlocked on a lesser offense. 

And as to that, this Court's opinions are 

clear that if you have a State law that prevents giving 

effect to what is in substance an acquittal, it must 

yield to the Federal constitutional command of the 

Double Jeopardy Clause. 

And Hudson v. Louisiana is very instructive 

on this point because, in Hudson, Louisiana had a law 

that after a conviction, a judge could not enter an 

acquittal order; he could only enter a new trial order. 

And after the conviction on murder in Hudson, the judge 

entered a new trial order and explained that it was 

because of insufficient evidence. 

And this Court unanimously said that that 

substantively was an acquittal; it has full double 

jeopardy consequences, notwithstanding the fact that 

Louisiana law does not allow a judge to enter an

acquittal order --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's bothering me is I 

can't figure this out very well. We have an imaginary 

State, and what the State says to the jury: Jury, you 

have three choices. Choice one is you acquit this 

person of everything. Choice two is you convict him of 

something. Choice three is you say you're hung. Okay? 

I don't see anything in the Constitution 

that prevents a State from doing that. So, if that --

if no -- what is it? And, of course, if you follow 

that, there was no acquittal on those early charges. 

That wasn't a permissible verdict. And now you 

structure your argument any way you want, but that 

the State has -- I would think, within the limits of due 

process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it 

wishes. 

But -- so, what's wrong with that? And if 

that -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do 

you win? 

MR. SLOAN: Okay, Your Honor. Two points: 

One that focuses on the jury foreperson's announcement 

here --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you could say, well, 

you could -- well, that's one route. What you say is 

nothing wrong with that. But if the judge is foolish

enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say 

what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then 

the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in. Well, that's an 

argument. 

MR. SLOAN: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, they make a mistake and 

now suddenly it’s jeopardy where it wasn't before, 

or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the 

issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what 

was going on in the room, particularly if it's 

changeable. 

MR. SLOAN: With respect, Your Honor, I 

disagree that it's a minor matter when a foreperson 

stands up, with the jury present, and says we have voted 

not guilty. And as to that, with an announcement -- for 

example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 

decision in the Roth case, which is in the briefs, is 

instructive because in that case the Massachusetts court 

said very emphatically you should not ask a jury that 

kind of question, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, let's -- go 

ahead. 

MR. SLOAN: But -- may I just finish --

JUSTICE BREYER: Please. 

MR. SLOAN: -- the sentence, Your Honor?

But in that case, the trial court had asked 

the jury, and the foreperson had said that they had 

voted against guilt on the greater offenses. And so, 

the Massachusetts court said, if the -- essentially, 

these are my words -- but if the Double Jeopardy Clause 

means anything, it means that when you have an 

announcement like that, it has to matter. 

And the other point, Your Honor, is that 

this Court's opinions such as Fong Foo and Sanabria say 

that it doesn't matter if an acquittal is on an 

erroneous basis. Once it happens, we give full double 

jeopardy consequence to it. So, even if one thinks that 

the judge shouldn't have asked the question and it would 

have been permissible not to ask the question, once he 

did and once that's on the record, that is of 

considerable constitutional --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only if --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only if -- and I think this 

is the premise of your argument. Only if there is a 

constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various 

charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the 

jury come in on one charge without coming in on the 

other. It seems to me that's the premise of your 

argument. And I don't know where that constitutional

necessity comes from. 

MR. SLOAN: Well, Your Honor, first, on the 

manifest necessity point, when there is an 

announcement like this, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your manifest necessity 

depends upon the necessity of severing, yes. If you 

sever, then there is no manifest necessity of 

resubmitting the greater charge. But it assumes -- it 

assumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing 

comes from. 

MR. SLOAN: The -- the manifest necessity 

argument is that when there is an announcement like this 

that goes right to the core of double jeopardy -- and, 

you know, we know that with greater and lesser included 

offenses, if there is a basis for an acquittal, then 

that has to be given effect on the separate charges. 

That's Green and Price. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- but that's 

after a verdict. Why is it that the purposes of the

before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where 

it is mid -- mid-deliberations? The defendant, of 

course, is terribly disappointed if they go back and 

then find him guilty. So, I guess there's a personal 

disappointment interest for the few hours that it takes

doesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't 

have to go to trial again. It's all one trial. 

I don't see why there's a double jeopardy

saying that you can't go back.

Jeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you 

can't go back?

manifest necessity point, I'm not saying you can't get 

back. What I am saying is that when you have an 

announcement of such constitutional moment at the 

heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause, a judge can do 

many things --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking why it's the 

heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Jeopardy --

substance; the person's been acquitted once they've made 

a judgment and announced it. It -- the Constitution 

doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle 

someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to 

force the jury to announce it.

trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts

acquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count 

three, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because 

there has been an announcement of a verdict. Isn't that 

your position? 

MR. SLOAN: That's exactly right. There's 

another body of case law also which I was addressing, 

which talks about when jeopardy attaches even if there's 

not that kind of announcement. But, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, Ball -- our case 

in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is 

entered or not. As far back as 1896, Ball said the 

judgment is irrelevant. It is the verdict of acquittal, 

and it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't 

matter if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled, 

if anything happens. It's as soon as the jury announces 

acquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker. 

Isn't that what you're saying? 

MR. SLOAN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I thought I heard 

you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was 

that the judge had heard they reached that verdict. 

MR. SLOAN: Well --

verdict that they announced? 

MR. SLOAN: Yes. From a manifest necessity 

perspective, this Court's decisions on manifest 

necessity, from United States v. Perez in 1824 through 

Renico v. Lett in 2010, have emphasized the judge has to 

exercise sound discretion. And to exercise sound 

discretion here, the judge could have done many things, 

but the one thing he could not do, consistent with sound 

discretion, is to do nothing and to proceed as though 

that announcement hadn't happened, and --

JUSTICE ALITO: You suggested that the --

deference due a district court. But Renico --

which the jury is deadlocked. And here there's an 

insufficient basis to conclude that the jury was 

deadlocked on the murder charges. There was nothing 

like the foreperson's announcement at issue in Renico. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to --

I'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says 

you did not object when the judge announced that he was 

going to declare a mistrial; is that correct? 

MR. SLOAN: Your Honor, there's not an --

an objection at that time, but that is not a waiver for 

a couple of reasons. First, the Arkansas Supreme Court 

reached the merits. It's a Federal constitutional 

issue. 

Second, before that point, defense counsel 

had been very explicit that it only wanted a mistrial on 

the -- on the remaining counts and not on the other 

ones. 

And, third, this Court has emphasized that 

the distinction in manifest necessity is when the 

defendant affirmatively consents or moves for a 

mistrial, as opposed to either if the judge does it 

sua sponte, and the defendant doesn't have to object, or 

the prosecutor moves for it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUSTIN MCDANIEL 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. MCDANIEL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

There are three key reasons why jeopardy has 

not terminated in this case. First, the jury was free 

to revisit capital and first-degree murder when it 

resumed its deliberations. Thus --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Where does it say that in 

the jury charge? 

MR. MCDANIEL: I think that there's a 

critical misunderstanding by Petitioner of Arkansas's 

jury instructions, and there's a lot of use of -- of 

titles, such as "acquittal first" or "hard transition" 

or "soft transition." 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, as I understand what 

the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in 

this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have 

a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down 

to the next offense. So, that's to say that the jury 

unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an 

acquittal. So, the jury had to unanimously acquit on 

the greater offense before it could go down to the next. 

And the -- the instructions don't say 

anything about moving back up. And this jury seems to

take its responsibility under these instructions 

extraordinarily seriously. This jury was instructing 

the judge on the instructions --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and about how they had to 

go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one 

before they could get to the next lowest down. So, I 

guess I'm asking why do you think, under these 

instructions, that the jury felt itself able to go back 

up? 

MR. MCDANIEL: Well, there are three primary 

reasons. One, in States that are acquittal-first 

States, States that truly require a resolution of each 

charge before the transition to subsequent charges, they 

use words like "unanimous." In fact, they all use the 

word "unanimous" in their instruction. Arkansas doesn't 

do that. We use a rather ambiguous, or unambiguous, 

depending on how you look at it --

JUSTICE KAGAN: The chief prosecutor kept 

saying: You all have to agree on this. 

MR. MCDANIEL: And he was accurate, and he 

was echoed by the defense counsel in her closing 

argument as well. But there is no requirement of a 

resolution. The jury verdict forms reflect that 

perfectly.

In fact, Justice Breyer's example of a given 

State is exactly what Arkansas does, as compared to a --

a true acquittal-first State, where there are multiple 

jury verdict forms, where you truly resolve one charge 

attaching final resolution and, in fact, attaching 

jeopardy or terminating jeopardy at that point. 

In this case, there is one verdict form. 

You can decide something --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm so 

totally confused by you ignoring Hughes. 

MR. MCDANIEL: I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Arkansas charge 

says: If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's 

guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider 

the charge of murder in the first degree. 

And I thought the Arkansas cases said no one 

juror is going to think they can go to the next count. 

They have to understand from this charge that it has to 

be unanimous. And that's what the prosecutor argued. 

It's what the defense argued. It's what your supreme 

court has said has to happen. I'm a little confused, 

given your case law, your supreme court case law, that 

says you can't move on to the next one unless it's 

unanimous, how you can answer Justice Kagan's question 

the way you have. I mean, there's nothing in your case

law that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You didn't finish your 

answer, did you? I thought you were going on to some 

other points. 

MR. MCDANIEL: I did. And, in fact, I think 

that Hughes is extraordinarily important. And, 

respectfully, I believe that the Petitioner has 

mischaracterized Hughes. There is a line of dicta in 

Hughes that is particularly useful in the Petitioner's 

brief, but it is Justice Corbin of the Arkansas Supreme 

Court who authored Hughes, who was rejecting a double 

jeopardy claim in Hughes and, in fact, invoked this line 

which says -- what has been quoted in the briefs. It is 

Justice Corbin who was presented with this exact same 

argument to interpret the instructions in Blueford and 

authored Blueford and rejected what allegedly was his 

position on the instructions. Hughes was not about the 

instructions. No part of Hughes was asked to interpret 

what our instructions are. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I think if you -- if you 

look at what the -- what the judge said, what the 

prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said, and then 

what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought 

that they had to unanimously agree on something before 

they could go to the next crime. And, again, there's no

suggestion in what anybody said that they could go back 

up. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any suggestion 

that they couldn't go back up? 

MR. MCDANIEL: That is extraordinarily 

important, Justice Scalia. There's not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it usually assumed 

that a jury is not finished until it's finished? 

MR. MCDANIEL: The State would assert that 

that is precisely the case here. You have exactly the 

type of jury verdict form that Justice Breyer suggested 

in his example. They have to decide on something. You 

have one charge, capital murder and its lesser -- lesser 

and includeds. 

This person, Mr. Blueford, does not deny 

that he is guilty of a homicide offense. That was 

included in their closing argument. Does not deny that 

he's subject to retrial because there was manifest 

necessity on at least two of the charges. They simply 

would like to say that there was not manifest necessity 

for the greater of the two. 

And the only way that that happens is 

either -- to answer, I believe it was Justice Kennedy's 

hypothetical earlier -- are you required to go in and 

engage in partial verdicts even if a State does not

choose to do so, even if a State is, in fact, a general 

verdict State? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even if, General --

MR. MCDANIEL: Or --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Even if you're not 

required -- and maybe you are required -- but even if 

you're not, here the jury comes back. The jury tells 

the judge we've unanimously reached acquittal on these 

two counts. At that point, why doesn't the judge have 

an obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for 

a half hour. There's no reason to think that in that 

half hour they moved back up the scale. There's every 

reason to think they just remained stuck where they 

were. 

But even assuming that there is some 

conceivable possibility that they went back up, why 

doesn't the judge, working with the manifest necessity 

standard, have an obligation to say, well, what about 

it? Did you? Did you reach acquittal? Did you reach a 

judgment on these two counts? 

MR. MCDANIEL: Well, there are a couple of 

reasons. One, I think it's fair to say that the State 

recognizes it was improper for the judge to inquire in 

the way that he did. I think that it's fair to say that 

he recognized that it was improper, as he didn't do it

on their first announcement of deadlock and he didn't do 

it on their final announcement of deadlock. 

It's important to note that, although 

defense counsel at trial did ask for revised verdict 

forms, that was not her initial reaction. Her initial 

reaction was to say, judge, I think that the jury needs 

to go back and keep deliberating, and I would ask that 

you give them another Allen charge. That's not the 

reaction that anyone would have if they had just heard 

an acquittal of their client. This was, in fact, a 

mid-deliberation report, probably wrongfully elicited by 

the trial judge, but it was just that, a snapshot in 

time with no intent by the jury to make an announcement. 

So, when they returned, the real question, I 

think, hinges -- as this Court analyzed in Smith v. 

Massachusetts, is, is it possible for there to be 

revision? And it doesn't, in fact, Justice Kagan, have 

to be the entirety of the jury completely pivoting in 

their decisions. All it would have to be is one. And 

we recognize that, even after they have announced 

unanimously, signed a verdict form, offered their 

assent, if they're polled in the box and one person 

changes their vote, then that bears the effect of 

changing the verdict. 

So, is it possible? Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would this be different 

if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and 

said, are you deadlocked on the third count? And -- my 

hypothetical to your adversary. And they said: Well, 

we have acquitted on capital murder. We've acquitted on 

the second count. We are still, Judge, deadlocked. 

If this had been announced at the very end, 

what would be your position today? 

MR. MCDANIEL: Certainly, there would be --

it would be a tougher case if everything ended at that 

moment because, at that point, counsel would have to ask 

the trial court, if you're declaring a mistrial at this 

moment on this report, what are you going to do? Are 

you going to accept this or are you not going to accept 

it? Will there be an opportunity for polling? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't sound like the 

judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's 

positions on mistrial. He announced that whether the 

jury told him they were deadlocked or not, he was going 

to call them back. 

So, I don't know that the judge would have 

done what you suggested.

MR. MCDANIEL: And, Justice Sotomayor, they

verdicts are not contemplated in Arkansas law. It would 

have been error for him to engage in partial verdicts at 

that time. And there's nothing in the Fifth Amendment 

that would require this Court to intrude upon the 

liberty of the States to determine whether they're 

general --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if the State rule 

says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had 

entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial 

or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts, 

would jeopardy have attached? 

MR. MCDANIEL: If there's a hung jury as to 

all counts, then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. If the jury had 

announced what it did, but following Arkansas law as you 

read it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only 

be one hung jury. 

MR. MCDANIEL: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would jeopardy have 

attached? 

MR. MCDANIEL: No. If there's manifest 

necessity for a mistrial, and in this case there's one

charge, one homicide offense, and as this Court has long 

recognized, Brown v. Ohio being a key -- a key 

analysis --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, really the only 

issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a 

jury that had been told acquit first comes back and says 

we're only hung on this, and the jury says listen to 

each other on what your hung on, that that jury 

reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated 

verdict and enter a trial -- a mistrial on everything 

else. 

MR. MCDANIEL: Respectfully, Justice 

Sotomayor, they were not told acquit first. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree --

MR. MCDANIEL: That is a -- a subtle but key 

distinction. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree -- I don't 

think you agree that it was their stated verdict, do 

you? 

MR. MCDANIEL: I absolutely do not. It was 

not a verdict. And bears none of the hallmarks. 

JUSTICE BREYER: There is no room in Arkansas 

law for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as 

to two. But Arkansas law says you come in with a 

verdict of guilty of something, a verdict of acquittal

of everything, or the words "hung jury." Is that right? 

MR. MCDANIEL: Well, it's not up to the jury 

to determine whether they're hung. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. They say to the judge, 

Judge, we are hung. Judge says "hung jury." 

MR. MCDANIEL: That is correct, Justice 

Breyer. That is correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, General McDaniel, 

one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems 

a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an 

acquittal for a State without the bitter. So, the sweet 

is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to 

reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next 

thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and 

that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first 

system. 

The bitter that most States take with that 

is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree 

on these things and they agree on a verdict of not 

guilty, we're stuck with that. 

Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system 

in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater 

charges before going to the less, but won't take the 

consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree 

that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.

MR. MCDANIEL: No, Justice Kagan. The --

the majority of the States and circuits recognize there 

is a difference between a hard-transition instruction 

and an acquittal-first instruction. They recognize the 

difference between a partial verdict and a general 

verdict on charges that include lesser and includeds. 

And what we require is one verdict on a charge: guilty 

or not guilty. 

And they are at liberty to consider -- they 

can be at the very end -- again, it's very important to 

know -- it's wholly speculative in this case to know 

where they were when they ultimately were hung. And so, 

we are -- we are operating in the world of bright-line 

rules, which are very important for jeopardy. 

We know when jeopardy attaches. When the 

jury is in the box. We know when jury -- or when 

jeopardy terminates, and it's when there's some 

conclusion with finality. Every case that this Court 

has analyzed, even Price and Green and Selvester, where 

the jury remained silent, there was some finality that 

led to termination of jeopardy. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General McDaniel, in this 

case, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point 

where the judge asked them where do you stand on this 

count; where do you stand on that? And so, they were up

to the manslaughter, and they were stuck on that. And 

the jury foreman said we can't go to negligent 

homicide because we haven't reached agreement on -- on 

the manslaughter charge. Then they go back for just a 

half hour. 

How realistic is it to think that they began 

over at that point, rather than trying to resolve the 

manslaughter charge so they could do exactly what the 

judge told them, and then get to the negligent homicide 

charge? 

MR. MCDANIEL: The State wouldn't venture to 

speculate as to what they did, although I would 

respectfully say that that is probably what happened. 

They went back and they tried to follow the instructions 

of the court. That's certainly viewing things in a 

light most favorable to the Petitioner, and there's no 

evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: General McDaniel, how --

how probable is it that when the jury is polled, and 

having voted unanimously when they were back in the jury 

room, one of the members of the jury changes his mind 

and votes the other way? That's not at all probable, is 

it? But it happens sometimes, doesn't it?

the result? 

MR. MCDANIEL: It -- it bears all of the 

difference in the finality of the verdict. And, again, 

as this Court noted in Smith, it's the availability; 

it's the incorporation within a State's procedure for 

that finality to be undone. My Lord, how likely is it 

truly for a trial court to completely reverse his or her 

granting of a motion of dismissal? But this Court said, 

if there's a procedure in place for it to be revisited, 

then jeopardy doesn't terminate until the point at which 

there's no return. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Is this a fair explanation 

of Arkansas law, which doesn't seem to me to be 

perfectly clear? What the jury is supposed to do is to 

vote on the greatest offense first and reach a 

reasonably firm vote. And if they reach a reasonably 

firm vote that is unanimous not guilty, then they can 

move on to the next -- to the lower offenses, but that 

reasonably firm vote is not an absolutely final vote, 

and there is still the possibility for the jury to go 

back. 

MR. MCDANIEL: Yes, Justice --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is that a correct 

understanding?

precisely correct. And, just as Justice Scalia noted 

earlier, we recognize that there are compromises that 

are incorporated into transitions. One may be willing 

to say: I'm willing to move on from first-degree 

murder. I'm the only one here that believes that we 

should find guilty of first-degree murder, but that's 

not going to happen. I'm not going to change your 

votes. But I'm willing to move on and go to 

manslaughter. 

JUSTICE ALITO: For double --

MR. MCDANIEL: But would that vote equate to 

an acquittal if asked in -- with finality? 

JUSTICE ALITO: For double jeopardy 

purposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually 

says, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be? 

MR. MCDANIEL: I think what Arkansas law 

actually says is how we should be judged, but at the 

same time, the evidence here was that the jury came in 

to answer questions about the status of their 

deliberation. I think that Justice Kagan properly noted 

that they were in fact giving the judge some 

instructions on how the instructions should work. 

And they were answering that question, and 

the foreperson -- one person was asked, well, where are 

you? And she announces -- and we have no reason to

believe that she was not being truthful. At the same 

time, we have no way to verify it. And the defense 

counsel said, Judge, I think they ought to be given 

another Allen charge, and they need to go keep 

deliberating. 

And at that point, if they had returned, no 

matter how unlikely -- if they'd come back in 10 minutes 

later and said we find unanimously guilty of capital 

murder, no matter how unlikely, if that was possible, 

then jeopardy could not have terminated upon that 

report. It could not have been an acquittal because 

they couldn't have continued deliberating on those 

charges for another instant. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, how do you deal 

with our cases, Ball and Martin Linen and the whole line 

that says State -- the form of State law judgments 

doesn't control? 

MR. MCDANIEL: I think that Ball is 

particularly helpful to us, and I think that the Hudson 

case cited by Petitioner is also important. 

If -- if a State puts a procedural bar to 

considering a final judgment of acquittal, then that 

procedural bar is trumped by the Fifth Amendment of the 

Constitution. Mr. Ball was --

means. 

MR. MCDANIEL: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's the problem 

with all of this area, which is States vary on how they 

enter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict. So, 

where do we draw the line as to when a State law 

trumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy 

Clause, trumps a State system? 

MR. MCDANIEL: Justice Sotomayor, I think 

that your answer is contained within the question. A 

verdict is the true answer. If there is a verdict, then 

the -- the force and impact of that verdict is what 

matters. Did this jury announce a verdict? If so, 

jeopardy attached. But this was not a verdict. It bore 

none of the hallmarks of a verdict. It wasn't 

published. It wasn't verified. It wasn't accepted by 

the court. It wasn't even accepted by the defendant's 

attorney. It wasn't a verdict. 

In Ball, there was a clear verdict. The 

jury announced acquittal. The judge entered acquittal. 

And later, the indictment was dismissed as being faulty. 

And under the law of England up until that time, even in 

the United States, a faulty indictment dismisses 

everything, and you start de novo. So, even the 

acquittal gets thrown out because you can't acquit of

something that was void ab initio. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sloan told us that it 

was the State that prevented the elucidation because 

defense counsel said: Judge, we can try to do what 

Double Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for 

the same offense. So, Judge, please ask the jury to 

rule on those two -- give them a sheet that gives them a 

choice of guilty or not guilty. 

But they went -- that originally was just a 

series of guilty on the four counts, and then their 

other choice was acquittal. 

Now, defense counsel says, ask them, is it 

guilty or not guilty, instead of asking just is it 

guilty. And the judge declines to do that. Isn't that 

why we don't have definitive answers? Because defense 

counsel says -- said, Judge, give the jury the chance to 

tell us whether they --

MR. MCDANIEL: Some States do, in fact, give 

the opportunity to inquire into the jury's 

deliberations. Partial verdict forms and inquiries are 

permitted, but they're not required. And in Arkansas, 

the State properly objected to changing the agreed-upon 

verdict forms, as the judge said, midstream. They had 

been agreed to; they had been submitted; and they 

properly reflected the law in Arkansas. So that to

change them would have either been by agreement or 

because they were constitutionally required. And that's 

ultimately the case -- the question in front of this 

Court: Are they -- are they constitutionally required? 

And that leads into the manifest necessity 

analysis because anytime there is a charge with lesser 

and included offenses and a general verdict State, and 

the jury simply announces we cannot reach a 

determination, is -- is the constitutional trigger truly 

resting on the fortuity of the announcement of a 

snapshot vote in open court, or is a constitutional 

trigger how they voted back in the jury room? And if 

that is the constitutional trigger, then wouldn't 

verdicts -- partial verdicts be required? 

In fact, this Court does not require partial 

verdicts. A -- an announcement of unable to render a 

verdict warrants a mistrial. This Court has said 

clearly in Renico that we defer to a -- a trial court's 

decision that manifest necessity exists. In fact, this 

Court has never overturned a trial court's decision that 

manifest necessity existed for the -- on a hung jury. 

Here a jury was hung. They simply could not 

render a decision on the verdict forms they were 

submitted: guilty or not guilty of a homicide? They 

couldn't answer the question. And, therefore, jeopardy

JUSTICE KAGAN: General, you mentioned Green 

and Price before, and those are the cases, of course, 

where there is a conviction on a lesser charge. We 

don't know anything about the greater charge. And then 

the conviction is overturned. 

And what the Court says there is, well, we 

don't know anything, but we're going to make a 

reasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think 

it said a "legitimate" assumption. The legitimate 

assumption that they acquitted on the greater charges 

before they went down to the lesser charge. 

Now, it seems to me as though there are a 

hundred reasons why that might not be true. The jury 

could have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as 

a compromise position without voting on the greater 

charge, but the Court said we'll make a legitimate 

assumption. 

So, why isn't the same true here? We're 

making a legitimate assumption, I think honestly, on the 

basis of much more than Green and Price had to work 

with, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of 

those greater offenses.

JUSTICE KAGAN: There was a verdict --

MR. MCDANIEL: -- in this case there's no 

verdict. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that eventually got 

overturned. There was no verdict on the greater 

offenses. 

MR. MCDANIEL: You have to look at Green and 

Price in conjunction with this Court's holding in Brown 

and the analysis of lesser included offenses within a 

general offense. They are one for jeopardy purposes. 

In this case, Mr. Blueford was facing one 

charge for jeopardy purposes. The information, the 

indictment, only included one charge. So, he could not 

have been convicted of both manslaughter and murder in 

the first degree. This Court's very clear about that. 

So, in Green and in Price, where there was a 

conviction on a lesser charge and silence -- in other 

words, they didn't expressly say not guilty of this 

higher charge and not guilty of this higher charge, and 

guilty of this lesser charge -- it stands only to 

reason, and certainly to constitutional scrutiny, you 

can only be convicted of one of them. And if a jury 

finds -- and, again, it still requires publication, 

verification, and acceptance by a court of an actual 

verdict of one of those charges -- it only stands to

reason and logic that the upper charges were dismissed. 

That's -- that is entirely different, respectfully --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: In Green --

MR. MCDANIEL: -- from this case. 

JUSTICE ALITO: In Green and Price, the 

defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and 

jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest 

necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy. To me 

that is the sound basis for those decisions. But I have 

to agree with what Justice Kagan said. The -- Justice 

Black's reasoning in Green, that the jury impliedly 

acquitted the defendant of the greater offense by 

convicting the defendant of the -- of the lesser offense 

doesn't really make any sense because they could have 

simply been in disagreement about the greater offense. 

MR. MCDANIEL: Well, and I think that's 

correct, and I think that there has to be some question 

here as to, is it an implied acquittal or was it an 

express verdict? I think the Petitioner can't really 

decide, or at least hasn't articulated, where the 

jeopardy terminating event occurred. Was it when they 

made their announcement? In which case, why did they go 

and subsequently deliberate even on the request of 

counsel? Was it at the conclusion when there was the

possibility that nothing really had changed after the 

report and a declaration of manifest necessity? Which 

did not come, by the way, at the request of the State. 

It was sui sponte by the court. 

And then there was, in fact, a waiver, and I 

think a legitimate waiver, of an objection by defense 

counsel. There was -- at no time at that point before 

releasing this jury did defense counsel renew a motion 

to submit partial verdict forms, to inquire into the 

jury, to poll where they were. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- she had asked; 

so, why was it necessary for her to repeat it? And she 

said, Judge, please let them vote yes or no on the --

the two most serious charges. And the judge said no. 

She might have figured if she was going to repeat that, 

she would just annoy the judge. She had made the -- she 

had made the request. 

MR. MCDANIEL: The primary difference would 

be, in fact, the possibility that polling may be 

different after another half hour of deliberations. All 

it takes is one juror to change their mind. And, in 

fact, it may have benefitted the defendant. What if they 

had already decided they'd changed their mind again and 

acquitted on -- on manslaughter and had moved down to 

negligent homicide? And that's what they were talking

Where they were at the end of the final 30 

minutes of deliberation is purely speculative. And 

because it's purely speculative, regardless of whether 

it could benefit the State or the defendant, it means 

that no report was a verdict. No report could have been 

a verdict. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, other than 

trenching on State rules that don't create the 

constitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple 

rule that says, once a jury announces that it is 

unanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back 

unless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some 

way? What's wrong with that rule? 

MR. MCDANIEL: It would be difficult to 

apply in practicality, and it certainly would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? The jury comes out 

and says we're unanimous. There's a poll. One juror 

says I'm really not unanimous. They go back. But once 

a jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a 

mistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself 

that -- that jeopardy hasn't attached. 

MR. MCDANIEL: The primary reason why the 

majority of jurisdictions have rejected that analysis, 

whether it's announced or not, is the coercive effect on

Court has repeatedly focused on. For example, acquittal 

avoidance, emphasized in the Arizona v. Washington. A 

court doesn't want to accept the acquittal consequences; 

so, it just says we're not going to accept that. 

And something that's a very real and 

practical danger here, which this Court has emphasized 

over and over again in opinions, is giving the State the 

opportunity to refine and hone its case based on what it 

learned at the first trial about what went badly. 

And that is exactly what happened here. So, 

it was vigorously contested. The State's capital murder 

and murder -- first-degree murder case fell apart. 

Their lead expert on it was destroyed. The jury heard 

both sides, voted unanimously not guilty. And as this 

Court said in Ashe v. Swenson, a core evil of the Double 

Jeopardy Clause is that we don't let the prosecutor have 

a dry run at a first trial, and then get to go before a 

second trial with a new jury and plug the holes in it. 

And the State's position here, that this is of no moment 

at all, would raise that danger very prominently. 

In conclusion, Your Honor, the jury in this 

case heard the evidence on both sides, unanimously voted 

against guilt on the murder charges, announced that in 

open court, and never said a word that contradicted it.

the murder charges would run counter to what this Court 

has repeatedly emphasized as the core purposes, policy, 

and language of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 

If there -- if there are no further 

questions, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Sloan, General.
