 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 105 on our original docket, 

Kansas v. Colorado.

 General Six.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. SIX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Article III makes a clear distinction 

between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction, 

and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions 

and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress 

is not granted the same power over original 

jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an extremely 

sensitive clause in Article III. We can decide this 

case without relying on the distinction you just 

discussed, can't we?

 MR. SIX: Well, I think can you, and the 

Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even 

reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and 

avoid that constitutional conflict. And I think the 

stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very

result.

 The statute at issue, the cost provision, 28 

U.S.C. section 1920, states: "A judge or clerk of any 

court of the United States may tax as costs the 

following." And it lists six subparagraphs, including 

subparagraph 3 at issue here, Fees and Disbursements for 

Printing and Witnesses.

 The statute has two terms in it that are 

defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and, 

importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is 

defined but does not appear in the cost provision, and 

that is "Justice of the United States." "Justice of the 

United States" is defined as "the Chief Justice and the 

Associate Justices of the Supreme Court." The cost 

provision says "a judge." "Judge of the United States" 

is defined as including judges on the court of appeals, 

the district court, the Court of International Trade, 

essentially the listed courts and the Article III 

judges.

 JUSTICE: But, on the other hand, "court of 

the United States" is defined specifically to include 

the Supreme Court. So you have a contradiction no 

matter which way you flip it. On the one hand, it says 

"judge," which does not include the Justices of the 

Supreme Court. On the other hand, it says "court of the

United States," which does include the Supreme Court. 

So why should we pick one -- one answer to the 

contradiction rather than the other?

 MR. SIX: You don't have to pick. And 

you're correct, "the court of the United States" is 

defined to include the Supreme Court. But the strongest 

reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words 

in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who 

appears in the court of the United States. And if you 

think about it, there's a circle of judges that are 

defined here and a circle of courts that are defined 

here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a 

judge and in the court of the United States, the statute 

should apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about --

MR. SIX: And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It also says 

"clerk." We may not be judges, but we certainly have a 

clerk.

 MR. SIX: You do, and 28 U.S.C. section 

1911, another provision in Title 28, specifically deals 

with the Supreme Court Clerk. And throughout title 28, 

the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower 

courts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is 1911 a stand-alone

provision that would justify relief for you, or do we 

have to also refer to the general cost statute?

 MR. SIX: I don't think the Court would 

refer to the general cost statute in its original 

jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from 

Congress. 28 U.S.C. 19 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's assume 

that we think Congress can control this, this issue, 

this question. Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a 

stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without 

reference to 1920.

 MR. SIX: I mean, I would -- if your 

assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has 

done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant 

of the discretion the Court already has. They are 

turning over to the Supreme Court the power to have the 

clerk set costs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I think this case is 

controlled by 1911, do I have to refer to 1920?

 MR. SIX: No. I don't believe you have to 

refer to 1920.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you rest your 

case just on 1911?

 MR. SIX: Because in the original 

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given

power to make exceptions or regulations over original 

jurisdiction. And in the 219 years of the Court's 

original practice, they have never referred to a 

congressional cost provision, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that 1911 

doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not 

included within the term "other necessary 

disbursements"?

 MR. SIX: I believe the expert witness fees 

in this case were vital to the resolution. They were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were they within 1911?

 MR. SIX: I don't believe they were other 

incidental disbursements. That's not our position.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other necessary 

disbursements.

 MR. SIX: Other necessary disbursements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidental to the case. 

You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?

 MR. SIX: If -- if this Court determines 

that Congress has the power, and it's done so through --

since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I 

certainly would accept that position as the result. 

However, I would point out to the Court that I think the 

expert witness costs and the work was vital to the 

resolution of the case here.

JUSTICE ALITO: If you're reading of the 

statute is correct, then I take it we would have the 

discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert 

fees. Is that correct?

 MR. SIX: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's so, why shouldn't 

we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert 

fees that are available in case of the original 

jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the 

expert fees that would be available in a district court? 

Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why 

should there be -- why should we as a discretionary 

matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically 

different fees depending on the court in which the case 

originates?

 MR. SIX: Clearly the Court has the power to 

make that rule for original cases. However, the 

original jurisdiction was developed when the States 

agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit 

their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original 

jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the 

sovereign States. And as the Court said in Florida v. 

Georgia in 1854, "The analogies and rules and 

foundations of law that apply to private parties are not 

necessarily a good fit for sovereign States.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Justice Alito is 

saying we have discretion, we look for guidance, we have 

guidance from Congress. They have adhered to the $40 a 

day limit in very important cases; why don't we just 

say, Justice Alito is suggesting, that this is -- that 

this is a good guidepost for us and we will follow it?

 MR. SIX: Because what Colorado's position 

is that they are telling you that the Special Master's 

hands were tied; that the Special Master couldn't even 

exercise that discretion in a bright line rule that 

would save $40 a day.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are saying it's our 

discretion and our discretion is guided by what Congress 

has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and 

so forth.

 MR. SIX: Clearly, the Court would have the 

power to do that. However, there has only been 

approximately 200 original jurisdiction cases in the 219 

years of the Court. To suggest that the rules --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all those -- in all 

those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's 

witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's 

expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a 

witness? I mean, courts of the United States, district 

courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses

as distinguished from party's witnesses. Do you know if 

that's happened in Special Master situations?

 MR. SIX: I can tell you it didn't happen in 

this case. I certainly can't speak to whether it's 

happened in other cases involving special masters, so I 

don't know the answer to that. Certainly 1920 makes a 

distinction for court- appointed experts rather than the 

expert witnesses appearing under subsection 3 of 1920.

 I think the important point to consider, 

though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its 

219 years of developing essentially an interstate common 

law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of 

cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford 

Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position: You 

have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have 

the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920, 

which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only 

after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you 

you're limited to $40 a day.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do Special Master fees 

work? The Special Master always has fees and the 

parties I think usually divide them. How does that --

how is their authority to order them --

MR. SIX: Sure. Rule 53 of the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure deals with special masters in

the lower courts. It has no application here and wasn't 

used. The Special Master's fees, which total 

approximately a million dollars, just shy of that, were 

resolved by the parties after the Special Master was 

allowed to exercise discretion on that area of cost.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what if they hadn't 

-- what if the parties hadn't resolved it?

 MR. SIX: If they hasn't resolved the 

Special Master's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. How would the -- how 

would the Special -- what would be the authority of this 

Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X 

dollars?

 MR. SIX: Well, I think the authority of the 

Court comes from the order appointing the Special Master 

to handle the case and to do the specific things that 

were --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We just, we just 

regressed one step. Where does the authority come from?

 MR. SIX: To appoint a Special Master?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. SIX: It's an inherent authority the 

Court has in original jurisdiction cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that the authority to 

compensate is inherent?

MR. SIX: The authority to compensate is 

inherent. In the Judiciary --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you making -- would you 

make an inherent authority argument here?

 MR. SIX: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of original 

jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, would you say 

that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to 

in effect to decree these sorts of claims.

 MR. SIX: Well, again there is a distinction 

between appellate and original and, focusing on 

original, I think the Court has entirely the authority. 

The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court 

exclusive jurisdiction over these disputes, didn't set 

forth any procedures to govern the disputes. That's 

always been carefully preserved to the discretion of the 

Court to apply each unique case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Six, under your 

reading of the statute, 1934 particularly, would the 

Court have authority to charge your fees to your 

adversary, shift attorney's fees?

 MR. SIX: Yes. In the original jurisdiction 

the Court would have the inherent authority to do 

fee-shifting if the --

request in this case? Why should -- why should 

attorney's fees be treated differently from expert 

witness fees? Let me put it that way. Or should it be 

treated differently?

 MR. SIX: The Special Master should have the 

discretion to consider all the costs and unique 

circumstances of the case. In this case we chose expert 

witness fees --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We should have the 

discretion. Why do you keep talking about the Special 

Master? He's just -- he's just our amanuensis. 

Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?

 MR. SIX: It is, and the benefit of having 

the Special Master make a recommendation is we could 

have gone through these different categories of costs 

and come up with a recommendation. The Court certainly 

could have learned --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it the usual 

practice is for the parties to settle this matter and 

submit an agreed amount to the Special Master; is that 

correct?

 MR. SIX: The way it's worked in this case 

is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the 

Special Master's fees. The Special Master suggested it 

wouldn't be unfair to award them two-thirds Colorado,

one-third Kansas. After that the parties resolved it, 

just like we resolved every other issue of cost where 

the Special Master was allowed to apply that discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why didn't -- -

then are we here? We are talking about limited amounts. 

So much more is at stake on the merits and why wouldn't 

the parties just say, well, when it comes to Special 

Master fees this is what we are going to agree to. It 

doesn't have to be limited to $40. You can agree as 

part of a global settlement to whatever you want.

 MR. SIX: Well, the Special Master's fees 

we resolved. The experts fees at issue here, of course 

that bright-line rule was drawn by the Special Master 

and he never was allowed to make a recommendation to the 

Court to consider that. In balancing -- the remedies in 

these cases are highly equitable remedies.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just answer my 

question of a moment ago. Why should expert witness 

fees be treated differently from attorney's fees?

 MR. SIX: Well, in this case they should be 

treated differently because the model at issue that the 

experts for Kansas developed, the HI model, was used to 

prove our claims at trial, which would have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove 

your case, too.

MR. SIX: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You used lawyers to prove 

your case, too. Why should they not be compensated?

 MR. SIX: Because we considered the special 

circumstances of the model. It proved the claims at 

trial. It was adopted by the Court in 2004 in Kansas v. 

Colorado to monitor compliance in the Arkansas River 

Basin. It's the water use -- it's applied by the 

Colorado State water use rule. So it was special 

features like that that we wanted to present to the 

Special Master to explain why the fees should be fairly 

balanced and divided in a way other than he did.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand that to 

be an answer to why he didn't also ask for attorney's 

fees.

 MR. SIX: Well, in a particular case where 

perhaps a order of the Supreme Court wasn't followed or 

some other situation developed, fee shifting may be 

appropriate. In this case we felt the expert model we 

developed was so vital that it would be persuasive to 

the Special Master and fair and equitable to award it to 

us.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know whether any 

other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, 

what the practice had been, but with respect to expert

fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court 

ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?

 MR. SIX: In original cases the Court has 

never referred to any of that trilogy of cost statutes 

discussed in Crawford Fitting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But have they ever 

approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for 

the expert witness that deviates from the $40?

 MR. SIX: I think the answer to that is yes 

and I would direct the Court to New Jersey v. New York 

in 1931, which was a division of the waters of the 

Delaware River. And the Court pointed out in that 

opinion that a mass of evidence was presented to the 

Special Master, and on costs the Court said: "The cost 

of the cause shall be divided 35 percent to New Jersey, 

35 to City of New York," and so on. The "cost of the 

cause" I would argue is the cost to get the case to the 

point where it was resolved. In the boundary dispute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know -- do you 

know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?

 MR. SIX: It does not say in the published 

opinion exactly what the cost of the cause is. However, 

from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution 

issues, I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to do 

that without experts. But I would point the Court to

the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed 

the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers, 

historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes 

equally between the States -- not each State to bear 

their own cost, but divided them equally.

 And the -- the experts that are involved in 

resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different 

than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of 

experts that we used in this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're right. They are all 

different. They did a lot of work on that. I -- I know 

they did a lot of work on this. Congress has a statute, 

and the statute is: We don't care if the witness is 

Albert Einstein, Steven Spielberg, or the local 

zookeeper. Okay. We don't care. We don't care if they 

did a lot of work or a little work. We want them to be 

paid $40 a day, period. It's too much trouble to figure 

out how much work they did. That's what we want. 

That's the law.

 Now, Justice Alito said: I agree with you 

for argument's sake; we are not bound by that rule. But 

I take it his question, which I heard no answer to, is: 

Assume you are right; we are not bound by the law; 

still, why shouldn't we follow it?

Court has always tried to reach an equitable balance --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have do you any example 

where Congress had a statute which says every court in 

the United States must pay da-da-da, whatever that 

number is; it's $382.50, okay. Now, despite that clear 

statute, this court for exactly the same thing paid a 

different amount. Is there any such case?

 MR. SIX: I'm not aware of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And is there 

anything in the -- in the nature of litigation? And 

there might be. I'm not asking it as a rhetorical 

question. Is there anything in the nature of original 

jurisdiction lawsuits that, as a general matter, would 

call for higher fees to be paid for witnesses, or to 

make a distinction between expert witnesses and others, 

or to do other things that would complicate it?

 I'm not speaking of your case. You have a 

wonderfully strong case in your case. I want to know 

about in general, in original actions.

 MR. SIX: I would suggest the only 

difference is the parties. And the Court in its 219 

years --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume -- I assume 

your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and 

we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may 

think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert 

Einstein is ridiculous. And, therefore, if it's up to 

us, we would adopt a different rule. Isn't that your 

answer?

 MR. SIX: That's exactly my answer. And if 

you think -- if Congress can adopt a congressional --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure that 

answer is -- is at all adequate. Number one, what is 

there, as Justice Breyer pointed out, that's so 

different about this case?

 Let's say one landowner secretly and 

intentionally is stealing another landowner's water, and 

-- and he has no legal right to do that. And the only 

way the injured landowner can recover is to hire a very, 

very expensive expert, a hydrologist. And by the time 

he goes to court, he is really going to lose the benefit 

of the damages. Congress has said too bad. That's the 

way it is.

 Why isn't it that way with States, 

especially, as Justice Breyer said, when States can 

really afford the -- afford it better than the 

landowner. What's the difference?

MR. SIX: The difference is the Court has 

indicated for original cases: These are such disputes 

of a serious magnitude that can affect whole populations 

that the model case for even taking a case is where the 

acts between the States would be a causus belli, a type 

of thing that would lead to war.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I haven't seen -- I 

mean the $40 limitation makes absolutely no sense, does 

it? I mean I never saw an expert who would agree to 

spend the day appearing in court worth being called an 

"expert" for $40.

 I mean the fact that -- I guess I'm just 

repeating Justice Scalia's question. The fact that 

Congress has picked an arbitrary number with no basis in 

reality doesn't mean that we should do the same.

 MR. SIX: I would agree. The special 

master 's fees, for example, for one person -- and he 

was an excellent special|master -- were almost a million 

dollars. The appearance fees for the 22 experts Kansas 

had amounted to approximately $30,000. So that 

different there, I think, demonstrates the very 

unfairness --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not unfair to have a 

rule which says each party pays his own experts, win or 

lose. That's the rule, isn't it?

MR. SIX: I don't think that's the rule in 

original jurisdiction cases. At least the Court has 

never said that. The Court has --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you lose this case, if 

we were to follow Congress, we would have adopted a rule 

where, because the $40 is trivial, each party pays his 

own experts. Is that right or wrong?

 MR. SIX: I think that's correct, but we 

didn't lose. And the Court found that Kansas proved 

that Colorado violated a compact for over -- for over 50 

years by clear and convincing evidence. But one point 

I'd like to make --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, can we do this then? 

I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature 

it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to 

pay the winning side's lawyers.

 MR. SIX: The Court would have that ability 

to do that in original jurisdiction --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, should we do that, 

too? If we are going to have them pay the experts, why 

don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers' 

fees? That would be quite a revolution.

 MR. SIX: Because in the original 

jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or 

litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and

historically awarded the prevailing party costs. And if 

Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost, 

Congress could pass a statute that says: You have to 

take all original jurisdiction cases, or you can't use 

special masters, or you can't use certain special 

masters in cases involving Colorado and Kansas.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you save that for the 

lower courts? I mean, you are -- you are trying to 

distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when 

the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it 

can say, and has said, for the lower courts.

 MR. SIX: Yes, It could say that for the 

lower courts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. SIX: Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that, so long as 

Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once 

it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any 

sort of absurd rules?

 MR. SIX: I think they could pass a rule 

like they did, Rule 54 -- 53, which allows for special 

masters, and they could through the Rules Enabling Act 

pass a rule that says you can't use special masters. I 

think you get into whether that's --

with your assumption that just because Congress need not 

have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal 

court required by the Constitution is this Court, 

therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever 

it wants with them. I -- I don't agree with that.

 MR. SIX: Well, I would certainly focus more 

on the original jurisdiction issue here and haven't 

focused as much on that issue, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When we award the --

the special master's fees in original cases, do we 

specify who will bear those fees?

 MR. SIX: Yes, you do. In -- you do in the 

cases that have discussed costs. For instance, in 

boundary dispute cases you have suggested that the cost 

-- the costs will be divided equally; in litigious 

cases, that they will be awarded to the prevailing 

party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we include the 

special master's fees as part of the costs that are 

allocated?

 MR. SIX: Yes, and in this case the parties 

have agreed to that and never made an issue about that. 

And there is no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- why did 

the parties agree to it if we do it? In other words, if

we say in our orders who bears the special master's 

fees, why -- why would the parties agree to it?

 MR. SIX: Well, in this case -- maybe I 

misheard your question. The order appointing the 

special master did not resolve the issue of fees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. SIX: And the parties did not agree to 

that ahead of time. It was an issue to be determined 

and decided at the end of the litigation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it 

customary for it to be divided 50/50? I mean, we 

periodically will approve the fees that the special 

master charges and then they are divided between the 

parties. And I thought that they were divided 50/50. 

Is that not so?

 MR. SIX: Well, as the case progressed, the 

special master submitted bills that were divided 50/50. 

At the conclusion of the case the parties suggested 

reasons and special circumstances that should allow the 

special master to apply discretion.

 He then suggested it wouldn't be unfair to 

award the special master fee costs two-thirds Colorado, 

one-third Kansas because of the unique features of the 

case. And the parties then settled the special master 

fees with that guidance.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, I think you 

gave the answer earlier. Rule 53 allows for the -- an 

order to say that one or both parties shall pay the 

special master fee. So if we are going to follow other 

analogies, we don't have much problem here with expert 

witness fees -- pardon me -- with special master fees. 

It's under Rule 53.

 Of course, you say we don't have to follow 

that as a model, but it is a model if we -- if we were 

to look to congressional and -- and to other rules.

 MR. SIX: It is a model; however, the Court 

has always carefully preserved its discretion to treat 

each dispute between the sovereign states as a unique 

dispute. And the Court never even enacted an original 

action rule until 1939, so after 150 years. And in 1939 

the Court enacted Rule 5, which just set up the bare 

minimums of commencing the action. And Rule 17 today 

has essentially the same framework that tells the 

parties how to start the action but reserves all the 

other rules to the discretion of the special master.

 It does point to the Federal Rules of Civil 

Procedure and the Rules of Evidence as guides but not 

binding, mandatory rules that tie the Court's hand.

original actions? I mean, what -- what is magical is

that we are the only court that is required by the 

Constitution. But we are -- we are not just the only 

court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. 

Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in 

the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal 

courts?

 MR. SIX: Well, the Court has, in 1913, 

determined that -- excuse me, in 1912, that when a case 

is affirmed, the Supreme Court can adjudge costs for 

damages and delay. So they have directed, I think, a --

a regulation at the appellate jurisdiction, but never at 

the original jurisdiction.

has done that?

 I would like to reserve the remainder of my

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS

 ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

 MR. SUTHERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The special master in this case found clear 

direction from the statutes and rightly so. Section

1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous. It provides that a 

witness in attendance at any court of the United States 

shall be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day in 

addition to travel and accommodation allowances.

 Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of 

the United States" to include this Court, the Supreme 

Court of the United States, and that definition has been 

part of the statute since 1948. Because witness fees 

are only at issue in the Supreme Court in cases of 

original jurisdiction, it's apparent that Congress 

intended the limits set forth in 1821 to apply in such 

cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if they said 

in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any 

special master appointed by the Supreme Court?

 MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, it would then 

be up to the Court to decide whether that's somehow an 

intrusion into your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we allow -- if we 

allow Congress to regulate fees in our original 

jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've 

given up the principle and we are just negotiating over 

price.

that you've allowed Congress to legislate some aspects

of your original jurisdiction. Congress has told you in 

what is now Section 1251 that your original jurisdiction 

is not entirely exclusive. Only State versus State is 

exclusive, and all the rest of your jurisdiction is 

nonexclusive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't this an area, 

though, where we should be particularly sensitive? In 

other words, one reason that we were given original 

jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were 

afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the 

courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution.

 I think it would be surprising if you told 

the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate 

this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can 

sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would 

be surprising. It would not be regarded by them as a 

significant safeguard.

 MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, if it was such 

a sensitive issue, why is it we are now in 2008 and this 

Court has never decided to enact any kind of rules --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know -- -

General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past 

original jurisdiction cases? Maybe it hasn't come up 

because other special masters have said, we'll give the 

expert witness a reasonable fee for services

commensurate with the qualifications and the work that 

the expert has done. We don't know if that has or 

hasn't happened in the past, do we?

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we 

looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to 

research -- but we could not find an original 

jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness 

fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you find any cases 

where the special master had appointed his own witness 

as distinguished from the parties?

 MR. SUTHERS: No. We did not. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you 

recognize that if a special master appointed a witness, 

or the court, that that witness would be paid a 

compensatory fee?

 MR. SUTHERS: Whatever the special master 

determined was appropriate. That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, in a -- in a case 

like this one, where the nature of the work that the 

expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, 

isn't it odd that the special master chose the court 

expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if 

you have one party calls an expert who renders great 

service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get

compensated? Isn't that an anomaly?

 MR. SUTHERS: The special master, Justice 

Ginsburg, found clear direction from the statute and did 

not believe that he had an option in the matter, if 

you're talking about the unfairness of it. Number one, 

this situation here is no more unfair to Kansas than any 

litigant in Federal court. And number two, it's 

appropriate matter to take to Congress.

 The last time they changed it was 1990 from 

$30 to $40. I think it's time to revisit it. But it 

is, in fact, what Congress has dictated should be the 

compensation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of 

unfairness to Einstein anyway. I mean, you know, the 

expert witness is going to get his money.

 MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice. They 

certainly did in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is --

MR. SUTHERS: Both sides can vouch for that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is whether one 

side can get some money from the other to help pay for 

it.

 Do you happen to know whether at the time 

the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, 

there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness

fees?

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Scalia, I do not. We 

do know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't either.

 MR. SUTHERS: -- that it's 1853 when for the 

first time Congress, desiring to have uniform fees, 

began the structure of expert witness fees. It started 

at $1.50 a day, in 1853.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- may I ask you a 

statutory question just about the application of the 

statute. As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40 

applies it's because I -- it is, in effect, a 

determination of a particular item under section 1920: 

Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may 

tax its cost. My question is this. One of the items 

covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk 

may tax, is fees of the clerk.

 Under section 1911, which relates entirely 

to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the 

Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its 

clerk. That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the 

Supreme Court of the United States.

 Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section 

1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the 

United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was

not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't 

it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's 

authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be 

charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there 

is no statute on it at all?

 But the main point is unless 1911 is totally 

redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be 

charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the 

Supreme Court.

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Ginsburg, 1920 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm greatly flattered.

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, Justice 

Souter, sorry. Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're not the first to 

have done that.

 MR. SUTHERS: 1920 there may be some 

redundancies in it, but it's much more expansive than is 

1911. It talks about court reporter fees, printing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, we didn't -- no 

question about that. I recognize 1920 goes a lot 

further. But there is no -- there is no need in 1911 to 

say to that the Supreme Court may -- may fix the fees to 

be charged by its clerk if the Supreme Court is already

covered by 1920.

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, I think if you 

look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the 

same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that 

applies to the court of appeals and to the district 

courts. I think it's like 1913 and 1914. So I -- I --

I don't think that you can --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if it's 

redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?

 MR. SUTHERS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. SUTHERS: I think the important thing 

about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question, 

it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court 

clerk, cost of serving process and incidental 

disbursements. It does not address witness fees in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it includes 

printing fees?

 MR. SUTHERS: 1911 does not, unless --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't 

think that --

MR. SUTHERS: Incidental disbursements?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what number here? You 

don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge 

for printing fees?

MR. SUTHERS: As an incidental disbursement, 

it may. But it clearly does not address witness fees.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the reason I ask is 

because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are 

in -- in the same sentence.

 MR. SUTHERS: And I -- I don't know whether 

printing would be considered incidental disbursements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you allowed 

printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under 

1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear 

that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing 

witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to 

witness fees.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is -- I mean, if you 

want to really get a little complicated, the -- you 

have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme 

Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all 

the other fees, right? Okay. So the thing is, you 

can't pay money in the United States unless have you 

some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court 

some authorization to fix fees.

 Now we look back at 1821. And 1821 tells 

you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. 

It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per 

day. Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more. Just says

that's what he is entitled to. Now of course, in the 

lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no 

authority to pay him more. But in the Supreme Court, 

there is authority to pay him more. That comes out of 

1911.

 I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm 

actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem 

of whether Congress can start legislating the details of 

original jurisdiction rules and so forth. Just -- there 

is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent 

ourselves from going down that road. That's -- I'm 

deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of 

this gimmick?

 MR. SUTHERS: Well, not much.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's fair.

 MR. SUTHERS: This Court -- this Court 

decided three cases regarding the application of 1821.

Kansas, were trying to get around, in Federal court,

own expert, is limited by the statute unless we're 

talking about a contract or express statutory --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which part did they think 

limited it? Was it 1821 they thought limited it?

 MR. SUTHERS: Yes. And by the way, there is 

a contract here.  It's the compact between, the 1949 

compact between Kansas and Colorado, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: In an ordinary case, if a 

witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just 

goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to 

a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars? He goes 

to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a 

court. But Do they count that as being in attendance at 

a court?

 MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe so, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then where is his --

MR. SUTHERS: It's liberally construed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. SUTHERS: It's liberally construed. You 

don't have to --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that isn't attendance at 

a court, where did these witnesses show up?

 MR. SUTHERS: These witnesses show up for 

trial.

 MR. SUTHERS: Pasadena, California, for 272 

days.

 MR. SUTHERS: Yes. Tenth Circuit Court of 

Appeals. They show up; they are in attendance; it's not 

just on the stand; all they time they're there, all the

construed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask. Just to put 

one thing on the table if I could. How do you deal with 

the problem that Justice Ginsburg raises: If a court 

wants to appoint an independent expert and pay him more 

than $40 a day? Do you say that's flatly prohibited? 

And if it's not flatly prohibited, what is the authority 

for doing so, other than 1911?

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Stevens, nothing 

prevents higher compensation for a court-appointed 

expert. We are talking about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But what authorizes it? 

Doesn't 1911 authorize it?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then what does?

 MR. SUTHERS: The inherent authority of the 

Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then why don't you have 

the inherent authority to pay expert witness fees a 

little more money, then?

 MR. SUTHERS: Because the statute addresses 

that. It does not address --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution says that 

no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the 

Treasury except by appropriations made by law. I think 

-- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the 

government's money.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not spending the 

government's money; you're spending the litigant's 

money.

 MR. SUTHERS: Well, in the case of the -- of 

the Court appointing an expert, it is typical at the 

conclusion of the case as part of the cost for the judge 

to determine what was an appropriate award the losing 

party -- what they should pay as part of that expert's 

expense. But that's not what we are dealing with in 

1821.

now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outer 

space, why not -- could we say, look, they were very 

impressive models these people did; on both sides they 

had terrific experts, very expensive; and would we have 

the authority to say to the master, although you didn't 

treat them as your experts, you should have done, for 

purposes of paying them.

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Breyer, you are the 

Supreme Court and if you found that this statute --

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to be

 MR. SUTHERS: Yes. If you found that this 

statute was an intrusion which somehow violated your, 

you know, authority as a Court, you could do that. But 

why would you want to get into the business -- going to 

Justice Alito's point -- you have so far refrained from 

enacting your own rules on this highly procedural matter 

of expert witness fees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we would want 

to get into the business because it's our business; and 

it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like 

this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?

you have done it before in -- in highly procedural 

matters where you do not -- no one here is doing 

anything that prevents your exercise of original 

jurisdiction, that expands your exercise of original 

jurisdiction. The cases also say that your original 

jurisdiction is self-executing, doesn't need any 

statutory implementation; but this is a -- a totally 

procedural matter, much as -- in fact, I think less of 

an intrusion, when the -- when the Congress said to you 

these cases will not be exclusive jurisdiction. Even 

though they are part of your original jurisdiction.

 This is a very procedural matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you what --

what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred 

to in 1911. "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be 

charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says 

the fees of the clerk. Is that what the first paragraph 

refers to, the fees of the clerk? Or does it mean other 

fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? 

Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the 

clerk?

 MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe so, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not? Fees of the 

clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but

that could be taxed as costs. Right? A judge or clerk 

can tax as costs the following.

 1911 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees to 

be charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't 

include costs. Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of 

statutes, don't you think?

 MR. SUTHERS: Not -- not a whole lot more so 

than others I've seen.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. SUTHERS: By the way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's some comfort.

 MR. SUTHERS: -- it has been pointed out to 

me in this compensation of court-appointed experts that 

that is specifically addressed in section 1920, 

paragraph 6, compensation of court-appointed experts is 

covered there. So there is that statute authority which 

you indicated there should be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that taxes costs, 

and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs. May 

fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say 

don't include costs.

 MR. SUTHERS: I don't believe they do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that wouldn't allow to 

us fix that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Except 1911 may do two 

things. Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court 

to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk. And then in 

the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the 

cost of serving process and other necessary 

disbursements; so it does two things.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it tells you how they 

are to be taxed. It doesn't say what their level is to 

be. May be taxed against the litigants as the court 

directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them --

fix the amounts. It's not a very good statute, really.

 MR. SUTHERS: If I may, once again going to 

the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in 

original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the 

cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in 

fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this 

Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I 

think is very significant.

 If in fact you had set an appropriate fee 

for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction, 

and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't 

be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might 

have some kind of a constitutional issue here; but 

absent that, I simply don't --

Congress had done nothing? In other words, let's say 

they haven't addressed costs at all. Would we be able 

to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?

 MR. SUTHERS: I would concede that you --

you probably could. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Pursuant to what 

authority?

 MR. SUTHERS: Your inherent authority over 

original jurisdiction cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we have 

inherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, how 

does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress 

decides to legislate in the area?

 MR. SUTHERS: Because Congress is 

entitled -- you've recognized their right to deal with 

certain types of issues. I find it very interesting 

that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says 

Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the 

process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction 

cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the 

omission to legislate such process does not deprive the 

Court of its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction. 

If this is something you have historically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is a substantive 

level of fees a mode of proceeding?

MR. SUTHERS: Chief Justice, I would argue 

that the setting of fees is a procedural matter; and it 

is -- and has to do with the mode of proceeding in a 

case. That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any -- do 

you think $40 a day for an expert is a realistic 

assessment of what experts charge?

 MR. SUTHERS: Absolutely not, Chief Justice. 

And in fact, of course, as I think Justice Breyer 

pointed out, Einstein does not only get $40 a day. We 

pay them a lot of money; but Congress has decided $40 is 

what they -- what they get. Congress ought to revisit 

it. There is no question about it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Parties pay a lot -- a 

lot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not be 

reimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailing 

party in our system certainly doesn't get anything like 

the full cost of the litigation.

 MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. They certainly do not. Experts in this case 

were paid lots and lots of money, and they don't even 

get that when the court has -- it's not -- at least the 

trial courts --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe lawyers get even 

more.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just get clear on 

your view of inherent power? As I understand it, you're 

-- when you answered it, in a situation in which the 

slate is completely clean, we would have inherent power, 

you're using "inherent power" in effect to be a kind of 

default power. If Congress hasn't acted, somebody has 

got to do something. That's got to be us, so -- so we 

would have the authority. But you are not using the 

term "inherent power" in the sense of being a power 

which is sort of essential and indefeasible by Congress 

in any respect. Is that correct?

 MR. SUTHERS: That's correct, Justice 

Souter, to the extent that there was nothing applicable 

to this and it came before you, should expert witnesses 

get compensated some -- some amount, Congress hasn't 

spoken on it, I would think, as a matter of default, you 

could say yes. And -- but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think there is --

there is any inherent power in, let's say, this Court --

just keep to it simple -- that Congress in effect could 

not eliminate? For example, if Congress passed a

statute saying the Supreme Court of the United States 

shall not have authority to punish direct contempt, 

would that statute be constitutional in your view?

 MR. SUTHERS: No, Justice Souter, it would 

not be because then it's interfering with your ability 

to do what courts do as a central matter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that a pretty 

slippery slope then that you're on? Because if in fact 

parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind 

of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at 

the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an 

equitable disposition of the expense, at that point that 

starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of 

business that the Court ought to be engaged in.

 MR. SUTHERS: Justice Souter, it's not 

telling you how to decide cases. And there is another 

case before the Court in which Congress reinstated 

time-barred cases. That's the kind of thing that 

intrudes on your judicial function. Setting witness 

fees doesn't come close to doing that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress -- really 

you think Congress could set any -- there's not some 

point at which it is so destructive of the process here? 

What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the 

winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party?

something wholly irrational like that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be a matter 

of due process, not a matter of inherent power, I take 

it.

 MR. SUTHERS: I believe that's correct. 

That's correct.

 Members of the Court, Special Master 

Littleworth spent a lot of time on this case. He has 

been fair, competent, and conscientious in resolving all 

the issues before this Court, including this issue of 

expert witness fees. It was the plain language of the 

statute and the clear direction of the case law that led 

him to his conclusion that the expert witnesses' fees 

were limited by statute in this case. We would ask you 

to deny Kansas's exception to the final report, and that 

the Court should enter the proposed judgment and decree.

 Mr. Chief Justice. If there are no other 

questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. SIX: 1920 didn't appear in 1948 

magically. It came from the 1853 Fee Act. And the 

language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs." 

"A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge 

or clerk of the court." I'm sorry. And 1920 says, "A 

judge or clerk of any court of the United States." In 

1853, as the Court has discussed in Alyeska Pipeline, 

the Fee Act applied to the circuit courts. It says that 

in its title. And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court 

judge. In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a 

judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition 

that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.

 Under Colorado's reading "court of the 

United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of 

the statute, and it would make the statute apply to 

"magistrate judge," for example, which is not included 

in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe 

and presides over a court of the United States, and it 

would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28 

defines "Justices" as a separate group. So that's not 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Constitution uses

the word "judge." A "judge of the United States" is a 

Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.

 MR. SIX: And certainly Congress isn't tied 

to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more 

than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to 

refer to any of you as "judges."

 The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was 

carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the 

same. The only thing they have added is a definition of 

"court of the United States." And if after 168 years, 

Congress is going to tread on the Court's original 

jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express 

language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the 

Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement 

rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going 

to do this now. We've never done it in our history, but 

now after 168 years we are."

 Not only that, Colorado's position relies on 

the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone 

unnoticed by the Court, any major treatise, or 

commentary --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I got mixed up 

on my dates. The words "in any court of the United" --

what the words are now is "in any court." It says 

"court of the United States includes" in 451 courts.

When did that language come in?

 JUSTICE BREYER: In '48?

 MR. SIX: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So the inclusion wasn't 

there till then. Now, normally, in the '48 revision, 

the rule is they intended to make no substantive change. 

When they did intend to make a substantive change, they 

said as much. So is there anything in the history of 

that that suggests they intended to make a substantive 

change here?

 MR. SIX: No, there isn't. And they changed 

JUSTICE BREYER: No?

 MR. SIX: They changed --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, the 

language "in addition to the courts listed in section 

451 of this title," that -- those words I just said have 

no appearance in the statutes before 1948? Yes or no.

 MR. SIX: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They do appear before?

 MR. SIX: No.
