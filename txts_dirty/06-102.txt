 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in case 06-102, Sinochem International 

versus Malaysia International Shipping Corporation.

 Mr. Castanias.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This Court in Ruhrgas against Marathon 

encapsulated the relevant line of this Court's 

precedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this 

case. What it said, it is hardly novel for a Federal 

court to choose among threshold grounds denying audience 

to a case on the merits. Now this Court's cases 

extending through Steel Company and Ruhrgas and 

afterward, hold true to this statement. Threshold 

non-merits issues may be decided by a Federal court 

before it determines its jurisdiction, in that term 

meant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction.

 This Court in this case should hold the 

forum non conveniens is another one of those threshold 

non-merits grounds for denying audience to a case that 

can be considered first before jurisdiction.

Adopting that rule in this case will do 

three things. First, it will result in a rule that is 

most faithful to the Court's precedents in the area.

 Second, it will respect the rule of Steel 

Company and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits. 

There is no chance that a dismissal in forum non 

conveniens will exercise more power than is granted to 

the Federal courts by Article III or by Congress in 

statutes.

 And finally, it will give the Federal courts 

the appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to 

serve important interests such as economy, 

constitutional avoidance, and particularly relevant in 

this case, international comity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the second point.

 I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal 

district court in forum non conveniens where it 

dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it 

have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? I 

know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal 

court determination forum non conveniens is not binding 

in a state court, but supposing in this case that the 

parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want 

to sue there. Would the San Francisco court, the United 

States District Court feel bound by the determination

that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that 

the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?

 MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two 

components to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me 

see if I can answer both of them. The first is whether 

the determination that the Federal court in 

Philadelphia, for example, in this case, was an 

inconvenient forum. Would that determination be binding 

on the court in San Francisco? Our view would be 

probably not. It would be persuasive in that case, but 

the forum non conveniens --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the ruling that 

this would be governed by Chinese law and that the 

Chinese court is the best forum to consider that? That 

too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in 

Philadelphia?

 MR. CASTANIAS: Let me -- that was the 

second part of your question that I was going to try to 

answer. And with regard to that, I think that it would 

not have preclusive effect in the main -- in the mine 

run of cases. And the reason I think it wouldn't have 

preclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what 

this Court has described as a multifarious analysis 

under the forum non conveniens analysis at American 

Dredging, and so it would be hard to say that for issue

preclusion, for example, that the choice of law 

determination in that case was necessary to the ruling 

dismissing the case.

 Now one might imagine a case at the margins 

where that was the case and there might be a case for 

preclusive effect, but that's, I think, not likely to be 

presented by this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know any case, 

Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non 

conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where 

the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different 

U.S. court to get a different resolution?

 MR. CASTANIAS: And by U.S. court you mean 

Federal court like Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, or 

perhaps a state court as well?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Either one.

 MR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think I have seen 

cases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here 

right now, where litigants have tried to go to a state 

court. Another Federal Court, I can't think of a single 

one. I'm hard pressed to.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you were urging 

that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do 

with the merits; but there is an argument that the 

existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have

some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.

 MR. CASTANIAS: In some cases, I suppose 

that could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of 

our rule is that the only issue presented by this case 

is that of Federal court power. There may be a case 

where it is appropriate in the district court's 

discretion. In fact in Ruhrgas, you writing for the 

Court pointed out that the normal court order business 

is to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and 

then personal jurisdiction.

 But the point of our application of that 

rule in this case is there may be some cases where it's 

appropriate, and this is a paradigmatic example of the 

sort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the 

forum non conveniens issue first, before personal 

jurisdiction. I hope that satisfies -- I hope that's an 

answer to your question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

 MR. CASTANIAS: With regard to the body of 

this Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases 

like Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a 

Federal court can decide venue before deciding personal 

jurisdiction.

 In this case it's hardly different because 

again, as American Dredging pointed out, forum non

conveniens is properly described as a supervening venue 

provision. The Gold Law case which we cite in our reply 

brief, and the solicitor general relies on, says that 

Federal courts have the power to transfer a case before 

determining personal jurisdiction. And grants even more 

analogous here are the extension in the Tenet case. In 

the case of extension, extension documents have very 

similar, though different, moorings as the forum non 

conveniens doctrine. And they're both discretionary 

decisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction.

 This Court pointed out, citing the Ellis 

case, and it pointed this out in the Steel Company, 

Ruhrgas and Tenet cases that extension can be decided 

first. And again, applying that precedent to the case 

of forum non conveniens, it's -- it really does follow 

that forum non conveniens can be decided first.

 With regard to the Tenet case, that case is 

very close to a merits issue, perhaps even one might 

call it a merits issue, but it was so threshold that it 

was appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at 

issue in that case before jurisdiction.

 Again, and with all of these lines of cases, 

deciding forum non conveniens first will have -- will 

provide no chance of the Federal court going beyond its 

constitutionally and statutorily exercised powers.

Now, I'd like to leave the Court with one 

final thought about the way this, and the importance of 

applying this rule in this case.

 The complaint that Malaysia International 

Shipping makes against Sinochem is nothing more than a 

claim that Sinochem defrauded a Chinese court. There is 

a term used in the complaint, a fraudulent 

misrepresentation. The term negligent misrepresentation 

is also used. But make no mistake about it. The 

complaint in this case is that Sinochem made a 

misrepresentation to Chinese courts. This is precisely 

the sort of interference with the Chinese court system 

which has proceeded to judgment, and judgment by the way 

on these issues in favor of Sinochem and against 

Malaysia International, that really cries out for the 

flexibility inherent in our rule.

 Unless the Court has further questions, I'll 

reserve the balance of my time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One question that doesn't 

even have to do with the issue before us. I'm curious 

about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there 

was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. What 

happened to that?

 MR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the 

last part of your question.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an agreement to 

arbitrate. And we're talking about a suit brought by 

one party in the United States, by the other party in 

China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although 

I thought the contract called for it.

 MR. CASTANIAS: My understanding, 

Justice Ginsburg, and this is a vague recollection from 

one aspect of the record, is that the arbitration clause 

was held not to apply in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not an 

exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?

 MR. CASTANIAS: Oh, I'm sorry. To be clear, 

Mr. Chief Justice, it was not held by the district court 

in this case to not apply. That issue was not in front 

of it. But at the time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 

district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?

 MR. CASTANIAS: Yes, correct. I think, I 

think that, I think it was agreed by the parties or 

understood by the Chinese court. My memory on this with 

regard to the record, maybe background facts that are 

not in the record but I, on summing it up, are a little 

be fuzzy. But I think to answer your question, 

Mr. Chief Justice, there, in abstention, an -- an

arbitration clause I think provides a closer question 

than this case does for an issue of whether it's law 

declaring authority, I think as your question put it.

 It's arguable that an arbitration clause is 

little more than a, in essence, a forum selection clause 

of the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non 

conveniens ruling might provide.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the 

allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the 

arbitration clause did not apply?

 MR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry. The first part 

of your question I had trouble --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the 

allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the 

arbitration clause did not apply.

 MR. CASTANIAS: That -- it may be. I just, 

I don't have that ruling in front of me.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how that court 

would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.

 MR. CASTANIAS: Again, we'll reserve the 

remainder of our time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In Steel Company the Court held that it is 

impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over 

which the Court may lack jurisdiction. But it is 

another thing entirely for the Court to decline to 

exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess. In 

Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already 

quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds 

for denying audience to a case on the merits.

 Now, the dividing line between a threshold 

non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases 

be difficult. And the Court has -- members of the Court 

have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set 

of cases and that is where the Court is declining to 

exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it 

is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive 

dispute in another forum.

 And this Court has -- has decided already 

that it is permissible, for example, for a court to 

decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before 

deciding a difficult question of whether it would 

possess subject matter jurisdiction over the 

supplemental claims at all.

Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an 

abstention extension doctrine. In Gulf Oil, one of the 

first cases of this Court to describe the forum non 

conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum 

non conveniens to a Burford abstention. The Court even 

in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds 

of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide 

before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Gulf Oil case 

does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal 

presupposes that the forum is one in which there's 

personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. It's 

just another forum is more appropriate.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's, that's 

right, Your Honor. And the Court said so in the course 

of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded 

that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern 

District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non 

conveniens could not apply.

 The Court said that couldn't be so, because 

the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the 

availability of two fora. But the Court did not address 

the entirely separate question of whether the Court 

could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would 

not exercise it. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was not, not 

felicitously put. I think all the Court was saying was 

that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non 

conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction.

 The only point of the doctrine is to get rid 

of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction.

 And so you do not have to -- but that 

doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before 

you can exercise the doctrine. It is a doctrine that 

overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. In 

that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That -- that's 

right, Your Honor. And in the court already determined 

it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was 

improper, then forum non conveniens would have no work 

to do. But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this 

question of the ordering of these restful matters. And 

of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its 

entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more 

convenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine 

severely the purposes of the doctrine --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand 

your argument to be that, that in this case it happened 

to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than 

subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same

argument if it were a doubt about subject matter 

jurisdiction?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, we 

would. And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted 

and relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in --

Papandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction 

under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And there 

the Court quite rightly said that it would be improper 

to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive 

jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear 

that at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day 

in favor of a foreign forum in any event. So it would 

apply to, to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as 

well as personal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can a district court 

do both? Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction, 

I conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this 

case? And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non 

conveniens grounds if it turns out we do?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think they could 

do both. The second would be really superfluous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not if there's, 

I presume, if there's an appeal.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If -- if -- an 

appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could

affirm on either ground.

 Again, to emphasize the point that counsel 

has made, the argument here is not that forum non 

conveniens must necessarily be decided before 

jurisdictional questions. In fact, the natural order 

would be to decide jurisdictional issues first.

 But as the Court held in the analogous 

circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are 

circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that 

order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue 

or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden 

of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or 

foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the 

end in any event.

 If the Court has no further questions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Martin, in the 

hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non 

conveniens and then they go to another Federal district 

court, could the second Federal district court say this 

has already been heard by the first district court; I'm 

not getting into it? Or, or does that district court 

have, have to go through the motion again?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think the 

second court would have to at the very least ascertain 

that circumstances had not changed or that there weren't

relevant difference of facts. Your, your hypothetical 

earlier was of filing, refiling this suit in California.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is that? Now --

to some extent this is a call for the district judge. 

There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's 

entirely conceivable that one district judge would 

correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens 

whereas another district judge faced with the same 

question would not do so. And both of them would be 

acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is in the nature 

of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says, 

that -- that different judges could reach different 

decisions. In the Parsons case, Parsons versus 

Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there 

the question was whether a state court's forum non 

conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a 

Federal court's analysis of the factors. And this Court 

held that did it not. In large part because it's 

impossible to know that every factor would be the same 

or would be weighed the same by the second court.

 And so I think it would be open to the 

second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it 

weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I 

don't think that that undermines our position, because

it is, of course, equally true of other threshold 

determinations such as personal and subject matter 

jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects 

in subsequent litigations.

 For example, a trial court could decide that 

it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount 

in controversy is insufficient because under state law, 

the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive 

damage. That determination would be given 

issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by 

the same plaintiff in another district court. In fact 

Justice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the 

D.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, 

because your time is running out, there is a question 

about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing 

on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's 

common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens 

dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the 

defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and 

other conditions. If the Court has no personal 

jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to

the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of 

the world, and that -- and facts as they bear upon its 

analysis, such as is the defendant subject to 

jurisdiction in a foreign forum. Oftentimes, the 

plaintiff -- if I could answer -- oftentime the 

plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue 

the defendant in the foreign forum. The defendant 

agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction. That 

understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal. 

If it later proves to be untrue because the defendant 

objects to jurisdiction of the foreign court, it would 

be open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first 

suit on that ground.

 Thank you very much.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN-MICHELE G. HIGGINS,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. HIGGINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 We believe that this Court should affirm the 

judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 

based on three reasons.

 We believe that personal jurisdiction is a 

requirement articulated in Gulf Oil versus Gilbert which

remains before this judicially created doctrine may be 

evaluated.

 Second, we believe that adopting the Third 

Circuit holding establishes a clear, bright line 

discrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to 

evaluate at any other appellate level.

 And third, we argue that the nature of the 

doctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes 

jurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some 

other convenient forum.

 The analysis that has brought the case to 

this Court has included a divergence of opinions between 

various circuit courts. In the briefing, all parties 

tend to agree that forum non conveniens is a 

non-merits-based ground for evaluating a ruling. The 

Fifth Circuit has decided otherwise. We, we express 

some issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non 

conveniens analysis, the Court necessarily, as the 

Government has conceded in its brief, takes a peek at 

the merits of the dispute.

 The other issue that arises is that if a 

court dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens, 

and then an appeal is sought, the appellate court always 

has the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter 

jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction.

The Seventh Circuit in the Intek versus 

Engle case, came up with such a ruling recently. They 

expressed support for the Second Circuit and the D.C. 

Circuit, saying that it is appropriate to be able to 

deal with non-threshold matters such as forum non 

conveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction. In fact, 

the court acknowledged that they thought the dicta 

expressed in the Ruhrgas opinion would become the 

holding of this Court.

 However, for judicial efficiency, it decided 

to go through the analysis to determine whether or not 

there was personal jurisdiction in the case. It went 

through subject matter of the case and personal 

jurisdiction, and it determined that there was no 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that only proved that 

an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the 

ground relied upon by the district court, even if the 

ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid 

ground. It's up to an appellate court -- - it's 

available to an appellate court, especially where the 

ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into 

jurisdiction and say there isn't any. I don't know, I 

don't know how that adds to your case.

 MS. HIGGINS: Justice Scalia, I think it's

appropriate. Both parties cite the vast waste of 

judicial resources that would occur if forum non 

conveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first. 

And frankly, we see that as the other way. The Insight 

case in our opinion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you found one 

appellate court that chose to do it that way. Frankly, 

if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it 

that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground 

was valid.

 MS. HIGGINS: Well, I tend to agree with you 

on that point as well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MS. HIGGINS: -- with it. But I think what 

the Third Circuit was stressing in its opinion is that 

you cannot subject the parties to litigate in another 

forum if there is some chance that your own forum does 

not have the personal jurisdiction. It is a 

prerequisite of the doctrine itself.

 And we believe that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question. 

We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the 

litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more 

fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third 

Circuit followed here. That is, is there really a case

or controversy down there? Does the defendant have any 

motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about 

jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be 

transferred anyway? Is this a real live controversy on 

the issue that's left open?

 MS. HIGGINS: I think it is, 

Justice Stevens, and I think the Court would address 

that by saying certainly on the negligent 

misrepresentation claim at this stage the record 

indicates that there was a ruling in China, but the 

appellate window is still open. And certainly the 

evidence has long gone into the Chinese case. Those are 

completely separate issues.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There couldn't be any 

question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction 

here, because it, in fact, had. A proceeding was 

ongoing in China. So you brought up the question about 

the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum 

non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient 

forum doesn't take the case. But that can't be a factor 

in this case, where the other forum was in China and was 

indeed litigating the case.

 MS. HIGGINS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg; but as 

practical matter, with the resolution of this case by 

this Court we would certainly have to start the process,

whatever ruling this Court finds, all over again. We 

certainly cannot participate in the action in China 

because that has already gone on. We would have the 

option to participate in the case in the United States 

because those specific issues were not litigated in 

China.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. I'm not 

following you, so please straighten me out. I thought 

that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on 

the Chinese court.

 MS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your claim was that a 

fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in 

connection with the arrest of this vessel and the 

ensuing proceedings?

 MS. HIGGINS: That is correct, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, why in the world 

should a court in the United States get involved in 

determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese 

court?

 MS. HIGGINS: Justice Ginsburg, we believe 

it was appropriate for U.S. review because of the 

balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the 

case because of the bills of ladings. Although the

district court believed that Chinese law would apply to 

the contract for the sale of the steel coils, in fact we 

would make the argument that with the various charter 

parties in the case, including the bill of lading that 

you reference, indeed American law would apply and there 

would be some different issues that would be evaluated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: American law to determine 

whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court? 

It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to 

the Chinese court to have another court determine 

whether it had been defrauded.

 MS. HIGGINS: That would have been a 

concern, Justice Ginsburg, except that issue was brought 

up expressly before the Chinese court; and if I may 

refer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the Chinese 

court ruled that, quote, "Given that the People's 

Republic of China and the U.S. are different 

sovereignties with different jurisdictions, whether the 

appellant has taken actions at any U.S. court in respect 

of this case will have no effect on the exercise by a 

Chinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said 

case."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that was a very 

polite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care 

what the United States court is doing; we've got this

case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate 

it; and it doesn't matter. We don't have to say 

anything to the United States to chastise it for even 

thinking it could become involved in this matter. It 

was polite.

 MS. HIGGINS: And I agree with you, Your 

Honor, except it is the only indication in the record 

that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an 

opinion on this. If you read the brief by the Solicitor 

General, the Government would have us think that every 

single case is going to involve foreign nations and 

delicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors.

 Very clearly, there is no such evidence in 

the record and the only evidence we do have is from 

another sovereign, China, that says if you have a U.S. 

cause of action we have no problem if a U.S. court 

adjudicates it on the merits.

 Having said that, the issue here was whether 

or not personal jurisdiction should have been decided 

before the forum non conveniens. And again, we would 

just go back to our second point, where the court 

believes that it can't evaluate a doctrine without 

having -- if it's a required factor of the doctrine that 

a sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to 

presuppose personal jurisdiction.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- I mean, I 

assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that 

there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that 

judgment would assume that there was personal 

jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that 

into the mix. Assuming we have personal jurisdiction, 

is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum? And if the 

court can say yes, that's the end of the game.

 I don't see what you have to gain here. 

Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction 

and dismisses for forum non conveniens? What, what --

what are you gambling for here? I don't understand 

what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to 

achieve?

 MS. HIGGINS: Well, for Malaysia 

International the desirable outcome would be upholding 

the Third Circuit opinion. It then gets remanded to the 

district court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and the district 

court at best for you, at best, finds personal 

jurisdiction. If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you 

know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum 

non conveniens. If it finds personal jurisdiction, it 

would say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I 

assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed

it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same 

call that I made before. Dismissed for forum non 

conveniens.

 MS. HIGGINS: And Justice Scalia, I concede 

that, but you would also have the ability of the 

defendant to waive personal jurisdiction. Again, you 

get into the judicial resources. The defendant could 

choose to waive it at that point in time and then I am 

right back again --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would a defendant 

that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive 

jurisdiction? It seems to me that there is something in 

this picture that is to your advantage and that is if 

you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do 

personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on 

that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens 

without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not 

going to get that discovery.

 MS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor, 

and then I would have to look for an evaluation of forum 

non conveniens that was favorable to the client. That 

was one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the 

Third Circuit; and the court did not make a ruling on 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but discovery for its

own sake is no fun. What does discovery for its own 

sake achieve?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there's something at 

the end of the discovery. Now, maybe what you hoped is 

that the Republic of China would not accede to the 

discovery and therefore, you would get a default 

judgment or something. You know, I just -- I just don't 

see what's at the end of this game for you.

 MS. HIGGINS: That's one possibility. But 

again, we talked about the policy issues of why the 

Government came in with the position they did. They 

suggested that the United States had a very distinct 

interest in avoiding delay, burdensome discovery, and 

difficult legal issues; and frankly, my thought is the 

same as yours. Any party has those desires to avoid 

those issues and come to a ruling in their favor.

 In this case we would hope that with an 

adoption of personal jurisdiction first, then the court 

would be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate 

forum non conveniens and we might be able to convince 

the court to be able to pursuit the case here. In this 

particular case, that is the goal that we seek because 

that is, as you say, all we have to do at the end of the 

game with it.

I also wanted to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we should ask the 

other side, but I think I know what their answer will 

be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of 

forum non conveniens without first addressing personal 

jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal 

jurisdiction? And what do you think?

 MS. HIGGINS: I think it has to, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I agree.

 MS. HIGGINS: The Seventh Circuit case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree. So how are you 

going to get a different result then when it goes back 

and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal 

jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the 

district court says, oh, yeah, same result.

 MS. HIGGINS: But there is the possibility 

of a case happening, as it happened in the In Re 

Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case. In 

that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens 

and the -- I believe it dealt with the country of 

Mexico. The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico 

saying that the Mexican courts were not to take 

jurisdiction of the case. Under those circumstances the 

court was required to take back the case because it no 

longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate

the dispute. So I think that's the one example of the 

case that you raise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we know that that's 

not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has 

adjudicated the case.

 MS. HIGGINS: Not on this issue, Your Honor, 

and actually not on the bills of lading issue. You did 

raise that point and there is still the potential of 

arbitration taking place under the various charter 

parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the 

remaining parties in the action. So that matter is 

still open as well.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're dealing with, 

because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum 

non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. And you are 

treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is 

forum non conveniens. But 1406 is wrong venue and, as 

you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court 

can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction 

and is a place of improper venue.

 Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens 

doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 

1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't 

need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, 

you just transfer it to a place where those conditions

exist?

 MS. HIGGINS: I think, Your Honor, in that 

case, it's -- as the doctrine developed, the difference 

lies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the 

judicially created version of the forum non conveniens.

 I think you're correct that as forum non 

conveniens exists today, side by side with 1404, you 

certainly have the limited application that it will 

apply to only foreign nations or to a State court. And 

that's what I thought was the benefit of creating a rule 

that's rather limited in scope, that will not touch many 

other factors. It can be discrete. It can be applied 

easily. And that comports with Federal Rules of Civil 

Procedure 1. We thought that was one of the reasons why 

a finding by this Court would be able to ease the 

administration of cases along those lines.

 If the Court has no other questions, I 

certainly would urge that, based on precedent and logic 

and the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens 

itself, that the ruling of the Third Circuit be upheld. 

Thank you.
