 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-11328, Davis v. 

United States.

 Mr. Kerr.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KERR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 This case raises the intersection of two 

similar doctrines of the same vintage that point in 

exactly opposite directions: The first, retroactivity; 

and the second, the good faith exception. This Court 

should reverse and hold that the good faith exception 

does not apply to reliance on precedent, and instead, 

that should be governed by the retroactivity principles 

of Griffith v. Kentucky.

 I think it's helpful to start with 

Linkletter v. Walker, the 1965 decision that introduced 

the concept of retroactivity. Linkletter held that 

Mapp v. Ohio, which had held that the exclusionary rule 

applied to State violations of the Fourth Amendment, is 

not retroactive. The Linkletter decision was premised 

on a simple syllogism: The exclusionary rule is about

deterrence; a decision that postdates a search cannot 

deter the police; and therefore, the exclusionary rule 

should not be available in cases before Mapp.

 Linkletter's syllogism is the same syllogism 

that the Court is attempting -- that, sorry, the 

government is attempting to rely on in this case. 

History has shown that that syllogism is powerful in the 

context of collateral review and habeas corpus 

proceedings, but it should not apply on direct review.

 It should not apply on direct review for two 

basic reasons. First, because on direct review the 

first case must be treated like other cases on direct 

review, the exclusionary rule must be available in order 

to protect the adversary process and avoid advisory 

opinions, which -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You lose me in 

the argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if 

we did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying 

retroactive effect to the altered judgment. It 

continues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a 

totally different question whether, assuming it is 

retroactive, the good faith exception to the 

exclusionary rule applies. It's a -- it's a separate 

question from retroactivity, it seems to me.

 MR. KERR: I disagree, Justice Scalia.

During the Linkletter period, the scope of the 

exclusionary rule for the Fourth Amendment was an 

essential concern in a series of retroactivity cases, 

Linkletter being the first, Desist v. United States 

being the second. There were -- many of the Linkletter 

era retroactivity cases were concerned with the Fourth 

Amendment exclusionary rule.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but just to pursue 

Justice Scalia's point: The good faith rule is itself a 

rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the 

books, and the good faith rule qualifies the 

exclusionary rule. So why aren't we just following the 

good faith rule here?

 MR. KERR: The -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, there's nothing 

retroactive or prospective about it. It's just -- it's 

just applying the existing law.

 MR. KERR: I disagree, Justice Kennedy. 

It's not applying existing law, because the effect of 

what is labeled the good faith exception in this setting 

is actually to apply the prior decision; that is, to 

have all of the substance and effect of a retroactivity 

decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's an 

application of -- that's a subset, it's one application,

of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle. 

But we're being faithful, under the government's view, 

it seems to me, to the overall principle.

 MR. KERR: I think the Court needs to take 

away the labels here. The government is using a label 

of good faith for what is essentially a retroactivity 

argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a label at all. 

You're -- we're not denying the application of the 

altered rule to your client's conduct. It applies. But 

the question of whether, when it does apply, the good 

faith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless 

allows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally 

different -- we're giving full retroactive effect to 

the -- to the change in the law.

 MR. KERR: At the same time, Justice Scalia, 

whatever rule is applied in this case would have to be 

the same rule that applies in Gant itself, and without 

the incentive of counsel to argue in favor of the change 

in the law, that would block claims by defense attorneys 

to overturn the precedents of this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Kerr, our 

cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police 

conduct. It seems to me you're trying to expand that 

notion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I

read -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the 

argument that defendants will lose their incentive to 

litigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result 

of a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.

 MR. KERR: Leon, I think, raised a different 

setting. It raised the question of reliance on errors 

by a magistrate judge, which simply does not implicate 

the concerns of retroactivity, which is this Court 

changing its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. 

think that raises a distinct set of principles, as 

Justice Harlan recognized in his dissent in Desist and 

his separate opinion -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think our -­

our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board, 

without regard to the underlying substantive violation, 

is that you look to deterrence of police conduct. And 

here, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing 

wrong in this case, don't you?

 MR. KERR: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what impact -­

why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?

 MR. KERR: Because it takes two branches of 

government for the exclusionary rule to deter 

constitutional violations. The Court has to properly 

construe the Fourth Amendment and the police need to

then properly follow the Court's precedents. The Court 

can't turn away from the role of this Court's precedents 

in the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand your 

argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I 

think that's your strongest argument, but would you 

concede that that argument does not apply when the 

precedent on which the police are relying is a decision 

of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court 

Fourth Amendment decision?

 In that situation, there will be plenty of 

avenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those 

decisions; isn't that right?

 MR. KERR: Justice Alito, I think it depends 

on what the good faith exception is. The government's 

brief I think does not exactly articulate what the 

standard is that -- to which it would like to apply.

 Even so, most Circuit Court decisions 

interpreting the Fourth Amendment are derivative of this 

Court's decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment. 

And this case is a good example. The facts of this case 

are quite similar to the facts of Belton. The Eleventh 

Circuit had not actually expanded upon Belton; it had 

merely had relatively routine applications of Belton.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it applied its

understanding of Belton, which turned out to be 

different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme 

Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four 

members of this Court when Gant got here.

 MR. KERR: At the same time, the Eleventh 

Circuit's development of the law was -- went no further 

than Belton itself, and this Court needs adversaries to 

make forthright arguments to this Court which may 

involve distinguishing precedent and may involve 

overturning precedent.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just come back to 

my question: Suppose you have a decision in one of the 

courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted 

under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that 

circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that 

circuit, follow that precedent.

 Now, is -- will there not be plenty of 

opportunities to review the correctness of that decision 

because the issue may arise in other circuits where the 

matter isn't settled?

 MR. KERR: If this Court adopts a good faith 

exception that is quite narrow and would not allow an 

officer in one circuit to reasonably rely on the clear 

circuit court decisions of another circuit, that's 

certainly a possibility. However, it's not clear as to

why the Court would adopt such a narrow version of the 

exception. The language that the government proposes, 

at least, seems to be the language of qualified 

immunity; the notion of reasonable reliance on a 

decision being believed to be lawful.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kerr, the line that 

has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice 

Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh 

Circuit took; is it not the case?

 I mean, Judge Kravitch said: Yes, the 

Fourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're 

following retroactivity precedent. But the remedy is 

something different. That was exactly the line that she 

took, wasn't it?

 MR. KERR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on your theory, I 

mean, there's another question in this case; that is, 

perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory, 

as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the 

Court decided that question, then -- then the question 

you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would 

have no practical consequences.

 On your theory, the way you reasoned, 

shouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate 

inventory search, and if so, then we never get to any

exclusionary rule question?

 MR. KERR: That issue, of course, has not 

been briefed in this case. It would remain for the 

Eleventh Circuit to apply that in the event the Court 

reverses.

 At the same time, I wish to be clear that 

I'm not arguing that the exclusionary rule is available 

in every case when the Court overturns its precedent, 

merely that it is a remedy in some cases, and I think 

it's actually a necessary cost.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just 

follow up on Justice Ginsburg's question. Why did this 

defendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional 

claim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the 

inventory search is going to result in the admission of 

the evidence anyway?

 It seems that your theory goes too far in 

saying that defendants will never have an incentive to 

bring a constitutional challenge if there's some other 

ground on which the evidence might be admitted, and 

that's never been our law.

 MR. KERR: I agree that's never been the 

Court's law, and I think there's an important 

distinction to be made here. The distinction is between 

an argument that has a remote chance of success, and

defendants will make those claims, and arguments that 

have no chance of success, which is no -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's often -­

we do that. We take cases where you can bring a 

constitutional challenge or a different challenge all 

the time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was 

the law and was it clearly established? Defendants 

bring the qualified immunity cases all the time even if 

they have a tough case on whether it's clearly 

established. Harmless error cases, the underlying 

violation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court 

can decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't 

keep defendants from bringing the claims.

 MR. KERR: But there's a big difference 

between a tough case and no case. The difficulty of the 

government's claim is the defendant would know any 

effort to challenge this Court's precedent cannot 

logically lead to any relief. Either the defendant will 

lose on the merits, if the Court upholds its precedent 

or the defendant will lose under the good faith 

exception.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your incentive 

argument really only holds up when the ground on the 

alternative ground is hopeless? Otherwise we'll expect 

the defendants to bring a Fourth Amendment claim because

 MR. KERR: Hopeless meaning a zero percent

government's position, is that it -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm 

concerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise, 

the incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of 

the Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not 

possible to grant a remedy. Wouldn't the solution to 

that be not the rule that you are advocating, but 

instead a much more limited rule which said that in that 

case the exclusionary rule applied, but not in any other 

case, not in any case on direct appeal?

 MR. KERR: I think Justice Harlan's answer 

to that is persuasive, that it's inconsistent with basic 

norms of constitutional adjudication to treat the first 

case differently from other cases not on -- other cases 

on direct review.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not 

sure that that's right. Justice Harlan was talking 

about constitutional rights at a period where, as the 

Chief Justice said, the exclusionary rule was viewed as 

part of the constitutional right. But if this Court 

doesn't view the exclusionary rule that way any more, if 

it views the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic

rule which gives a particular defendant a windfall in 

order to gain systemic effects, systemic benefits, why 

would we do it any more broadly than we would need to do 

it? And we would just say: Look, we understand your 

point that this would very much change the incentives 

for defense counsel. We understand your point that it's 

kind of, I don't know, maybe inconsistent with Article 

III to take a case in which there was absolutely no 

chance of relief being granted, but we can deal with 

those issues simply by saying that in your case you get 

relief, but not in any other.

 MR. KERR: Justice Kagan, that was the 

precise premise of the Linkletter regime. The idea of 

the exclusionary rule as a judge-created remedy, the 

idea of the exclusionary rule as not being a personal 

right, that actually was the premise of Linkletter. So 

to go back to something that resembles that regime in 

substance, even if with a new label. I think is ill­

advised in light of the history of the Linkletter era, 

and the Court's struggles to try to articulate a 

consistent standard that can treat the first case and 

other cases similarly.

 I think Desist was a Fourth Amendment case, 

Peltier also a Fourth Amendment case, Peltier also a 

Fourth Amendment case. The government's proposal is

essentially a return to Peltier with a difference. If 

the Court wants to treat the first case differently than 

later cases, it is essentially recreating Peltier.

 JUSTICE ALITO: With respect to the 

incentives that you're talking about, is there really 

much difference between what would apply in a case like 

this and what already applies in cases that fall under 

Krull? Suppose Congress enacts a statute that 

authorizes a search under particular circumstances, as 

it did, as was the case in Almeida-Sanchez. Now, under 

Krull nobody is going to be able to, and no one who is 

subjected to a search under that statute is going to be 

able, to challenge, to obtain suppression, unless you 

can say that a reasonable law enforcement officer 

couldn't have thought that this statute which was 

enacted by Congress and signed by the President was a 

correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.

 Now, maybe there'll be a few cases like 

that, but in the great majority, the vast majority of 

cases, the person will not be able to mount such a 

challenge. So what is the difference between the 

situation here and the situation that the Court already 

approved in Krull?

 MR. KERR: I think there are two 

differences. One is that there is a substantial

difference from the standpoint of a defendant or defense 

attorney between a remote chance of success in a legal 

claim and no chance of success on a legal claim. Krull 

leaves open the possibility -- and it may be remote, but 

nonetheless a possibility -- of relief if the defendant 

can persuade a court that a reasonable officer would 

have known in light of this Court's precedent that the 

statute allowed unconstitutional searches.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, we could leave that 

open here. We could say that there's no good faith 

immunity if a reasonable officer couldn't have believed 

that a prior decision of this Court was a correct 

interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Maybe that 

sounds strange only because we have a higher opinion of 

ourselves than we do of the Congress and the President.

 MR. KERR: And yet I think your -- your 

hypothetical, your suggestion that perhaps the Court 

could adopt that standard, shows the difficulty of 

trying to craft a good faith exception that ends up 

running up against the Linkletter problem. This is 

exactly the issue the Court struggled with during the 

Linkletter era that Justice Harlan -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Essentially, is your 

argument essentially that we should distinguish never,

and hardly ever. Is that -­

MR. KERR: That's correct. Where the rule 

is never, defendants are unlikely to make any sort of 

claim, and this Court would be denied the opportunity to 

review its own precedents, and that's an essential role 

of this Court's decisions in the Fourth Amendment 

setting.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you might respond 

that the government's going to say, well, there's Monell 

that's in their brief, and you'll probably say that 

that's a weak substitute for a criminal defense 

attorney's doing it in the trial itself.

 MR. KERR: It is a weak substitute. There's 

been no case that I'm aware of at least involving 

liability against a municipality seeking law reform. 

It's because the Court has rejected the notion of 

municipal liability as being based on respondeat 

superior.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we were concerned 

with the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does 

have some exception for the safety of the officers, and 

I think you can read the case if there's some general 

safety considerations for not securing the car in a 

neighborhood rather than leave it by itself. If we 

adopted your rule, the prosecution in all those cases

would not have had the opportunity to make those 

additional defenses or those -- to advance those 

additional justifications for the search. Maybe you'll 

say, well, I'm just trying to resurrect Linkletter.

 MR. KERR: I disagree. Just to explain, 

Justice Kennedy, my rule would be to retain the existing 

practice of this Court. I'm suggesting no changes in 

the practice of this Court, and that is when the Court 

recognized the need to overturn Belton or at least to 

substantially change Belton in the Gant case, the Court, 

Justice Alito in his dissent, recognized that there were 

costs along with that and that led to review of cases in 

the lower courts. In many of those lower court 

decisions, the lower courts held that the searches were 

nonetheless constitutional under Gant, and that was 

absolutely proper. In those situations there is no 

constitutional violation, no one goes -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those cases were 

pending. I was concerned with cases that were closed, I 

suppose.

 MR. KERR: In the closed cases, I'm not in 

any way challenging the traditional rule of Teague v. 

Layne and Stone v. Powell that the new rule is not 

available. As soon as the conviction is final, the door 

is closed and no defendant can seek review. This is

only about direct review and the initial case in which 

the rule is announced, and that's why I think it raises 

a special set of jurisprudential problems because it 

implicates this Court's need to avoid advisory opinions 

and to avoid what would amount to a one-way street. 

Under the government's proposed rules, proposed rule, 

defendants would have a limited ability to challenge 

precedents that construe the Fourth Amendment too 

narrowly, but of course of government would be free in 

any case to challenge precedents that the government 

believes construes the Fourth Amendment too broadly. 

The concern is that over time that would lead to an 

asymmetry in the Court's outcomes, not as a result of 

the measured judgments of this Court, but rather as a 

result of the incentives on counsel, and the Court 

should strive to avoid that sort of result.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're asking us for 

an exception to our general approach, assuming the 

general approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you 

put it, cases where there's zero possibility of success, 

while allowing application of the good faith precedent, 

even if the chances of success are remote.

 Is it really worth the candle to have 

litigation over whether it was a difference between zero 

chance and remote chance, as opposed to continuing to

apply the good faith rule across the board?

 MR. KERR: Just to be clear, the Court has 

not applied the good faith exception in this setting. 

The government is arguing for an expansion of the good 

faith exception into territory which has traditionally 

been thought to be the regime of retroactivity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your 

position on that. Now, getting to my question, is it 

really worth it for us to have litigation over the 

difference between zero and remote in determining what 

rule we should apply in this case?

 MR. KERR: I don't foresee litigation on 

that point because, at least as I understand the 

government's rule, as soon as a defendant utters the 

phrase "This court should overturn its precedent," then 

the good faith exception would automatically apply. 

That's at least how I understand the government's 

proposed rule. So it would be up to this Court to craft 

exactly what the standard would be, but if the standard 

is broad enough such that upon asking for -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Most lawyers don't 

take that position. Most lawyers would argue the 

Court's precedents should be overturned and, if not,

argument has zero chance or only a remote chance.

 MR. KERR: In that circumstance I think the 

Court would be forced with issuing what -- forced to 

issue what may amount to an advisory opinion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to 

me -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense 

counsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going 

to say you should consider argument A because my second 

argument has got zero chance of succeeding.

 MR. KERR: I think the incentive on defense 

counsel, if the government's rule is adopted, is to 

never argue that cases should be overturned, and instead 

make not terribly candid arguments to this Court that 

every case is distinguishable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kerr, I've been on the 

bench 30 years or so now. I have never, never heard 

counsel come before the court and say that we should 

overrule a case without making the argument: The facts 

of this case are not within the prior decision anyway. 

It just doesn't happen.

 MR. KERR: Katz v. United States is perhaps 

a case worth focusing on, where the Court overturned the 

rule of Goldman and Olmstead that wiretapping does not 

implicate the Fourth Amendment. Katz's brief to this 

Court argued that the Goldman-Olmstead regime had -- was

no longer applicable, had been implicitly overturned by 

prior cases, and then said if it has not been implicitly 

overturned, it must be overruled. There was no attempt 

to try to distinguish the facts of the Katz case from 

the Goldman-Olmstead regime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There was still not the 

argument you should overrule the prior case, period, 

with no effort to show why you could come out that way 

without overruling the prior cases. I just don't 

know -­

Scalia, are rare. At the same time they are important 

arguments. It is an -- it is an alternative argument -­

between zero and remote.

 MR. KERR: Nonetheless, the incentive on 

counsel under the government's rule would be not to ever 

make the claim that a precedent should be overturned. 

And the Court needs that argument to be made in 

appropriate cases so the Court can enter decisions and 

consider the balance of the considerations 

appropriately. It has done so under the current

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Because the exclusionary rule has severe 

consequences for the truth-seeking function of a 

criminal trial, this Court has restricted its 

application to those situations in which it's necessary 

to further the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary 

rule, namely to shape police conduct.

 The Court has repeatedly rejected efforts to 

expand the exclusionary rule to serve other purposes, 

such as schooling judges who issue warrants on the need 

to respect the Fourth Amendment, reminding legislatures 

about their obligations under the Fourth Amendment, and 

for other purposes such as to preserve judicial 

integrity.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, what about 

Gant itself? Gant severely qualified Belton. Should 

there have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as 

Justice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the 

law?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, let me give 

two responses to that. First of all, the rule that the 

Eleventh Circuit adopted in this case, and that is the 

only rule before the Court, involves a situation in 

which there is binding appellant precedent that 

instructs the officer, tells the officer, what you're 

about to do complies with the Fourth Amendment.

 The state of the law in Arizona would not 

necessarily have risen to that level, in light of the 

dissonance in that court's opinions, in the Arizona 

Supreme Court opinions, about the reach and scope of 

Belton.

 So the question about whether the rule that 

we're urging here would have applied in Arizona is a 

separate question from the one that the Eleventh Circuit 

resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how would you answer 

it? Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get 

the exclusionary rule?

 MR. DREEBEN: Gant obtained relief. This

Court granted certiorari in Gant limited to the Fourth 

Amendment question, and Arizona never raised any good 

faith exception to the exclusionary rule in that case, 

so the Court did not address the good faith issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose it had 

been raised?

 MR. DREEBEN: The logic of our position 

would be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking 

Belton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn 

the actions of the officers who relied on it. To the 

extent that he was doing what he actually did do and 

which this Court's opinion in Gant accepted, which is to 

say that the Gant opinion, that the Belton opinion did 

not resolve the fact pattern in Gant, he would not be 

automatically governed by the good faith exception. And 

as a result, Gant is really the best illustration of how 

unusual it is for a lawyer to come to this Court and 

say, please outright overrule a Fourth Amendment 

decision.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, do you think 

that if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert 

petition and said you should overturn the following 

Fourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in 

the cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert 

petition knowing that there was no possibility of relief

for that petitioner?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kagan, I believe 

the Court could grant that petition, although it's 

highly likely that any criminal defendant who filed it 

would couple it with a claim that this Court should 

either reverse, modify, or limit any holding that came 

out.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you think that we would 

have appropriate Article III authority to decide that 

question without any hope of relief?

 MR. DREEBEN: Certainly the Court would have 

Article III authority, because it's always free to 

limit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents, 

including a holding, if one issued from this decision, 

that the good faith rule applies when the Court 

overrules its decision.

 Litigants can all the time be faced with 

impossible arguments under existing precedent, but that 

doesn't preclude this Court's Article III jurisdiction 

to adjudicate challenges to that precedent. That's 

indeed the very premise of Petitioner's argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume if Petitioner says 

we should be able to overrule our prior substantive 

precedent, he should also logically say that we should 

be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the

exclusionary rule. So that whenever somebody wants to 

come up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just 

say: You know, Your Honors, we're asking you to 

overrule two cases: The first one, the substantive rule 

of Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that -­

that change in law can govern the action of the 

policeman who didn't realize that the law was going to 

be changed.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia, and I think it illustrates why there is no 

Article III impediment. Now, this Court may 

prudentially be reluctant to take a case in which it 

knows that its resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue 

would not dictate a reversal of the judgment, even if 

the Fourth Amendment issue went in favor of the 

defendant, but it is not that dissimilar from the 

situation in qualified immunity, when there is no law on 

the books that governs an issue and a petitioner asks 

the Court to resolve the Fourth Amendment issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if he asks for the 

double overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's 

some chance that the Court would do it?

 MR. DREEBEN: It would be remote, but not 

zero.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've just raised the 

question of qualified immunity and the similarities. 

There is one problem that I have with the regime that 

you are suggesting, which is that because laws differ 

among circuits, now we've created a regime where we say 

if the law was clear or if there was law on this issue 

in your circuit, and the police officer relied on it, 

the exclusionary rule won't apply; but if the law was 

uncertain or not clear in another circuit, then the 

exclusionary rule does apply.

 There's something illogical about permitting 

that kind of difference to control the outcome of 

suppression. Are you through the back door trying to 

get in a qualified immunity thing? If any police 

officer has a reasonable cause to believe their conduct 

didn't violate the Constitution, then no suppression? 

That is what it sounds like your brief is ultimately 

suggesting.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're 

not kind -- trying to come in through the back door with 

qualified immunity as a standard in this case. If we 

ever were to urge that, it would be through the front 

door. We would make the argument overtly.

 This case doesn't involve that issue. Judge

carefully distinguished between cases in which governing 

precedent instructed the officers, your conduct is 

lawful if you do this, from cases in which the law is 

unclear and there is no governing precedent.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there's no value in 

your mind to the fact, as your adversary is saying -- I 

don't -- I haven't found one case previously by this 

Court where it has applied the good faith exception to 

the finding by the Court of a Fourth Amendment 

violation. Have you? It's never been done in any case, 

correct?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not directly under the 

exclusionary rule. United States v. Peltier considered 

the factors that now go into the good faith exception 

under the rubric of then-prevailing retroactivity law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what we're doing 

is sort of -- your adversary is right, we're returning 

to Linkletter, aren't we? We're sort of saying it's 

going to apply, the exclusionary rule is going to apply 

in some cases, but not all.

 MR. DREEBEN: Before -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're going to have the 

exclusionary rule apply sometimes but not other times.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's true, but that's a 

direct consequence of the logic of the good faith 

exception itself; and the considerations that had 

informed this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in the 

Peltier decision were taken out of the law of 

retroactivity when the Court decided Griffith v. 

Kentucky; but those same considerations became relevant 

to the good faith exception, which is tied to the 

question of whether there is a need to deter police 

misconduct because the police have disregarded the 

governing law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there 

anything to be said for simplicity? The normal rule is 

when the police violate the Fourth Amendment you exclude 

the evidence. That's the rule. Then there are some 

exceptions, good faith, et cetera. But that's the 

normal rule.

 You have a new law in this Court. The new 

law says, now this is a violation; we didn't previously 

think it is, but it is; and that applies to the case in 

front us and to other cases on direct appeal. The

reason that's simple is that's what we've always done. 

And somebody says let's make an exception here, bring in 

the exception, good faith, and we say no. Why? Not 

because any of the policy arguments are wrong, but just 

because, as this last 40 minutes demonstrates, once we 

do that it's so complicated, only 14 people are going to 

understand it and they're not going to understand it, 

either.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's so 

complicated, counsel. Don't worry about it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN: The principle is very 

straightforward. The principle is that the exclusionary 

rule applies only when it can deter police misconduct. 

When police rely on a warrant issued by a magistrate, a 

statute or a judicial decision issued by a court of 

appeals that governs their conduct, they are not making 

a decision about what the Fourth Amendment requires.

They are following a different actor in the system, and 

this Court has held that there is no deterrent value to 

suppress evidence with an important cost to the 

truth-seeking function of the criminal trial, which is 

why, even if it makes for a simpler rule, the Court does 

not automatically suppress evidence just to achieve 

simplicity. It does -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Actually, why don't we just 

abolish the exclusionary rule? That would be really 

simple. Whatever evidence tends to prove the truth 

comes in. That would be a very simple system if we're

case represents only an application of existing doctrine 

in the Court with respect to the purposes of the 

exclusionary rule.

in your position that the defendant who lives in the 

circuit that is most clearly wrong is treated worst.

as Justice Kagan's question made clear, the exclusionary 

rule is not a personal individual right. It's not a 

constitutional right at all. It is a remedy that this 

Court has devised, not to protect the defendant's 

interests as such. The Fourth Amendment violation has 

happened out of court. It cannot be repaired. The 

purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter future 

conduct by other counterparts of that police officer or 

the police officer himself, so that when he confronts 

the situation in the future he will be more solicitous 

of Fourth Amendment rights.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if there's a 

circuit split, how do we encourage police officers to be 

careful about the Fourth Amendment? There's a 

presumption somehow that because a circuit precedent 

exists that says it's okay to do this, that police 

officers have to do this. I don't necessarily believe 

that. If there's a circuit split and a police officer 

knows that other circuits are saying this is 

unconstitutional, why are we taking away the deterrent 

effect of having thoughts occur to the officer about 

thinking through whether there's a better way and a 

legal way to do things?

exceptions, and including in this case the inventory 

search, that the officers have many different ways of 

doing things than merely doing what this particular 

court thought was legal or this circuit. So I guess my 

question is, when there's a circuit split, why are we, 

as Justice Kennedy is saying, giving protection to the 

circuit that's plain wrong and to the officer who chose 

to follow that advice?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Sotomayor, we don't 

expect police officers to attempt to define the content 

of the Fourth Amendment on their own. They are 

recipients of the status of the law from the courts that 

govern their activities; training programs will be 

instituted based on that law. I'm sure that careful 

training programs will advise officers that there may be 

some legal risk if there's a circuit split, and that a 

decision may ultimately be reversed; but we don't expect 

police departments to try to make the Fourth Amendment 

decision on their own. And there's some sound -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're going to be 

protected -- they're going to be protected from that -­

MR. DREEBEN: Well -­

to get qualified immunity from any personal liability.

Fourth Amendment balance has been struck in any given 

way in a particular court is because that is felt to be 

the reasonable way for officers to operate. In other 

words -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that an officer 

when he goes out to do his job does not have primarily 

in mind not to get sued, but I think primarily in mind 

he wants to arrest somebody in such a manner that the 

person can be convicted of the crime that he's done, 

right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, that's exactly 

right. The officers are seeking to protect the public 

interest, and by not taking advantage of decisions in 

their circuits that explain that certain behavior is 

reasonable, they can be putting the public interest at 

risk by relinquishing procedures that have been held to 

comply with the Fourth Amendment and yet allow the 

police to solve crime or to arrest suspects.

 Now, there's been a lot of discussion in 

Petitioner's argument about the need to provide an 

incentive to counsel to raise Fourth Amendment 

challenges to existing precedent. I think it's useful 

at the outset to look a little bit empirically at that 

question, because some members of the Court have 

expressed concern about that possibility.

From as best as I can tell, this Court has 

not overruled one of its Fourth Amendment precedents in 

a manner that favored defendants' interests since 1969. 

Despite whatever incentives may have existed as a result 

of the exclusionary rule, defendants will typically 

understand that stare decisis is the normal course that 

this Court follows, and as a result, they are highly 

likely to structure their arguments in a manner that 

will seek to distinguish, limit, or undermine a 

precedent rather than calling for its outright 

overruling.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, particularly in light 

of that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice 

Kagan raised in one of her questions about retaining an 

exception to the good faith exception for the situation, 

for the defendant whose case comes up here and results 

in the overruling of one of this Court's precedents?

 The Court invented the exclusionary rule. 

The Court invented the good faith exception to the 

exclusionary rule. Is there anything to prevent the 

Court from inventing a new exception to the exception to 

the exclusionary rule?

nothing to prevent this Court from inventing that

encouraging litigants to ask the Court to overrule its 

decisions and thereby to receive a benefit when they do 

so. If it's limited to the first individual who 

actually succeeds in that endeavor, it would limit the 

costs of the exclusionary rule, which, after all, result 

in the exclusion of reliable probative evidence of guilt 

in every case where it's applied.

 And the Court could tailor the exclusionary 

rule in that manner. If it did so, it would certainly 

minimize the costs, and it would represent the least 

amount of intrusion on the purposes of the exclusionary 

rule. But I would caution the Court in this respect. 

If the Court were to adopt another purpose for the 

exclusionary rule, namely creating incentives for 

counsel to challenge existing precedent, that will 

represent a substantial departure from this Court's 

consistent holdings that the only function of the 

exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, and 

once the Court has acknowledged that an additional 

exception to the exclusionary rule is justified, even if 

in these rare situations, it will create pressure for 

litigants to urge that additional policy interests of 

the administration of justice would be served if the 

Court would create yet another exception.

particularly good, either, do you? I mean, if.

 We had one case raising a Fourth Amendment 

question, and let's say six others who raise -- that 

raise the same question, what would we do? We would 

grant the first and hold the second? No use to hold the 

second, because they're going to lose anyway, right?

would just grant the first and deny all the rest, even

that's why the normal rule has been that the person 

litigating the case gets the advantage of the new rule, 

as do other people whose initial appeals are not final, 

and there we are. That's a rule existing, I guess, for 

a long time. I guess these other people have to have 

raised the question in their case. They have to have 

asked for it. They can't -- they have to follow normal 

rules. Has that caused havoc, or has that caused

things -- the legal system, even before -­

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, it hasn't 

caused havoc, for several reasons. One is it's 

extraordinarily rare for this Court to overrule its own 

Fourth Amendment precedent. It's apparently equally 

rare, or almost equally rare, for the courts of appeals 

to overrule their precedent and adopt a more 

defendant-friendly Fourth Amendment rule.

 I cannot claim to have done an exhaustive 

survey of all of the courts of appeals decisions that 

possibly overruled Fourth Amendment holdings, but the 

results of my research disclose only one case in which a 

court of appeals overruled its precedent to favor a 

defendant, and that occurred in 1987 in the Fifth 

Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit adopted a good faith 

exception precisely like the one that the government is 

urging the court to adopt today and declined to suppress 

the evidence for that reason. No other circuit has 

apparently confronted the question of whether overruling 

a decision triggers the good faith exception.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought it was 

more for this Court, actually, anyway. I don't know if 

it has to be the words "overruling." My recollection 

was: Has the Court created a new rule of law? I think 

it goes back to Cardozo, Sunburst or something, that if

the Court creates a new rule of law, then does it apply 

prospective, retroactively? And the worked-out position 

was it applies retroactively, but to the litigant and to 

those whose appeals are not final if they raised it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And you want to change 

that, it seems to me.

 MR. DREEBEN: No. That is the retroactivity 

question, and the retroactivity question is -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You're hiving off the -­

the suppression. I understand.

 MR. DREEBEN: This Court has acknowledged 

that the exclusionary rule is not an individual right, 

it's a remedy. It doesn't involve any violation of 

constitutional rights of the defendant. It's a remedy 

that this Court devised after finding a Fourth 

Amendment.

 And I think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed 

out, in Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh 

Circuit, Judge Kravitch acknowledged that Gant is the 

law; the search in that case was unconstitutional. The 

next question is an entirely separate issue of remedy, 

and that remedy issue is governed by this Court's good 

faith precedents. The rarity with which courts of 

appeals have confronted this simply reflects the fact

that, even without the lack of incentive that Petitioner 

says will result if the Court agrees with the government 

today, holdings that overrule Fourth Amendment decisions 

squarely and favor defendants do not occur all that 

often.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were we right that -­

there were several cases that were TBR'd in light of 

Gant. Maybe some of them shouldn't have been TBR'd 

under your theory.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, before 

the litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there 

was only one precedent on the books in any circuit that 

I'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal 

system -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule 

judicial decisions. That was United States v. Jackson 

in the Fifth Circuit. It's cited in the Eleventh 

Circuit's opinion in this case. It happened in 1987.

 So I think it's fair to say that prosecutors 

and government officials were not raising good faith 

exclusionary rule arguments in the cases that were held 

for Gant. I don't believe that the United States had 

done so, and as a result, it was perfectly logical and 

in accordance with this Court's normal practice to 

grant, vacate, and remand those cases for further 

consideration under Gant.

But in the wake of Gant, courts began to 

think of the logic of Leon and Krull and this Court's 

recent decision in Herring v. United States and attempt 

to apply the logic of those decisions to a circumstance 

in which a police officer relies on a binding and 

governing appellate precedent, and they concluded that 

courts that announce precedents have every reason to 

expect that litigants will rely on them and that police 

officers will rely on them. Therefore, there is no 

deterrent purpose to be served by suppressing the 

evidence. It's all cost.

 And the cost would be that individuals whose 

convictions have been obtained based on evidence that 

was seized in reasonable good faith reliance on existing 

appellate precedent will now be able to overturn their 

convictions, and that's a heavy cost to the 

administration of justice. It's why the exclusionary 

rule has been confined to particularized circumstances 

where it's thought that it will actually achieve a 

benefit, and it has not been expanded beyond those 

purposes.

 So given that litigants, criminal 

defendants, have a tremendous incentive to challenge 

their convictions and to try to navigate around 

precedents while simultaneously showing that those

precedents may have underlying material flaws, this 

Court is highly unlikely to be deprived of cases in 

which litigants attempt to undermine precedents without 

actually calling for their overruling. That is what 

happened, for example, in Batson v. Kentucky, where the 

Petitioner in that case did not want to head-on confront 

Swain v. Alabama and ask for its overruling, and as a 

result asserted that racially discriminatory peremptory 

challenges were invalid under the Sixth Amendment, 

rather than the Equal Protection Clause. This Court got 

the case and concluded that the proper analysis was the 

Equal Protection Clause and it accordingly overruled 

Swain in relevant part.

 So it's highly unlikely that if, in fact, a 

precedent of this Court is beginning to fray around the 

edges and justices of this Court have written 

concurrences or dissents that explain that they no 

longer believe that the logic of that is sound, 

litigants will exploit those statements in an effort to 

narrow the precedent and ultimately expose its flaws, so 

that if this Court determines it can overrule the 

precedent, and it can do so even if the exclusionary 

remedy will not follow.

arguing for apply only in the situation where there is a

binding precedent that affirmatively approves a 

particular police practice, or would it also apply in 

the situation in which there is simply absolutely 

nothing on the books that prohibits the police practice, 

so that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to 

think that the practice was unconstitutional?

 MR. DREEBEN: This case, Justice Alito, only 

involves the example of binding appellate precedent, and 

Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit 

distinguished between the two situations. In the 

situation in which there is no precedent, such that an 

officer would not be instructed that his conduct is 

affirmatively unconstitutional, qualified immunity 

applies, and there would be arguments that there is 

nothing to deter if an officer acts within that empty 

space.

 But there is a countervailing argument, and 

the countervailing argument, which Judge Kravitch talked 

about in the Eleventh Circuit, opinion, would be that 

when there's no law on the books courts should give 

officers to -- an incentive to act in favor of the more 

constitutionally protective manner, rather than taking a 

flier on what might turn out to be unconstitutional.

is ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of

not searching. Do you think that that's -- do you 

accept that?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, I would 

not submit to the Court that the United States 

necessarily agrees with that. I think that this case 

doesn't involve that problem and, as I said, there are 

contrary arguments that could be advanced based on this 

Court's description in Herring of the purpose of the 

exclusionary rule to reach conduct that is either 

reckless or intentional or at the least systematically 

negligent.

 And, so, some day this Court may have to 

confront whether the narrow limitation that Judge 

Kravitch adapted -- adopted in her opinion is the 

correct rule of law versus a broader view that exclusion 

is only appropriate when the officers have engaged in 

truly culpable conduct. But that's not a bridge that 

the Court needs to cross in this case. It's not an 

argument that the United States is advancing for 

affirmance of the judgment.

 This judgment can be affirmed simply by 

holding that the syllogism that the court of appeals 

adopted that, absent a deterrent purpose there is no 

basis for exclusion, there is no deterrent purpose here, 

that's sufficient to resolve this case and the Court can

leave for another day, if it agrees with that 

proposition, whether the exclusionary rule should have 

any broader exception for good faith behavior.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KERR: Thank you.

 I would like to start with the costs -- or 

return to the costs here of the exclusionary rule. 

First, the plain error doctrine is going to largely 

address the concerns that the government has in this 

case. If this Court is seeking to limit the scope of 

the exclusionary rule when the Court overturns 

precedents under the plain error doctrine, if defendants 

don't raise a challenge to the search or seizure in 

their case there will be no relief available to them.

 So therefore, the only possible relief that 

could be granted is for individuals that saw the issue, 

raised the issue, and that will, of course, include the 

individual who raises the claim in a case where the 

Court overturns its precedent, therefore avoiding any of 

the difficulties similar to that of retroactivity.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in -- in one -- in 

one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the 

government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that 

this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules 

under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good 

faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -­

of overturning the conviction.

 MR. KERR: That's exactly right, Justice 

Kennedy. And, in fact, that exact argument was one of 

the reasons Justice Harlan concluded that the 

exclusionary rule should be available in the first case 

and on direct review. The Court needs to be aware of 

the costs when it overturns precedent. It should not 

depart from precedent lightly.

 And I think Gant is a good example. Justice 

Alito's dissent nicely points out the very real costs of 

the shift from the Belton rule to the Gant rule, and if 

there were no costs in a regime of pure prospectivity, 

the Court would feel much more free to overturn its 

precedents because no one would actually be affected by 

the rule of any cases that are either on direct review 

or in the initial case or of those individuals whose 

convictions are already final.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that could work to the 

benefit of defendants as a class, not the particular

defendant?

 MR. KERR: That works to the benefit of 

defendants as a class, absolutely. In fact, going back 

to the Linkletter era, that was one of the -- perceived 

as one of the benefits of Linkletter, that it freed the 

Court to overturn precedent. But I think that is an 

improper consideration. It is necessary for Fourth 

Amendment decisionmaking for the Court to accurately 

weigh the costs and benefits of any shift in the rules. 

And so I think that the costs of the exclusionary rule 

in that setting are actually necessary costs.

 And I also think concerns of a windfall that 

are available to defendants are overstated because of 

the many doctrines that limit the scope of the 

exclusionary rule such as inevitable discovery or 

standing. Actually the only individuals who would 

receive the benefit of the exclusionary rule would be 

those individuals who were not searched in the first 

place if the Constitution were followed.

 So, those are individuals who actually did 

not receive -- will not receive a windfall. They will 

essentially, if they were lucky enough to raise the 

issue, go back to the state that they were before the 

Constitution was violated. And again, that's a limited 

group of people, and those are, I think, the necessary

costs required by the basic norms of constitutional 

adjudication that Justice Harlan raised in his dissent 

in Desist v. United States, and I think in a lot of 

ways this case does return to those concerns of Justice 

Harlan, raised both in his Desist dissent and his 

separate opinion for the Court in Mackey v. United 

States.

 I also wanted to focus on how similar the 

issue is in this case to -- in the Linkletter era, if 

you read the Desist dissent, in particular Justice 

Harlan's dissent, it's clear that he's considering the 

issue of retroactivity to be about the scope of the 

exclusionary rule.

 The Eleventh Circuit below had this idea 

that retroactivity is about the availability of a rule, 

but rules are not sort of ephemeral ideas that are 

available or not without any impact. It must be that if 

they are available, they are available independently of 

when they were announced and should be enforced 

accordingly.

 If there are no further questions -­
