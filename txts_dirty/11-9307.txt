3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 11-9307, Henderson v. United 

States. 

6  Ms. Gilley. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. GILLEY 

8  APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

9  MS. GILLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  There are three primary points I would like 

12 to focus on this morning during my argument. First, the 

13 question presented by Mr. Henderson involves a very 

14 small subset of cases which are -- which come before the 

Court under Rule 55 -- 52(b) each year. 

16  These are the cases that were referred to as 

17 the special case in the Olano decision. They have 

18 errors which, at the time of trial, were unsettled or 

19 unclear; but, by the time they made it to the appellate 

court, they had become clear by a clarifying rule or a 

21 decision. 

22  Second --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about the time 

24 they come up here? 52(b) applies to every court, does 

it not?

Official 

1  MS. GILLEY: Yes, Your Honor. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: So suppose there's been --

3 been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an 

4 uncertain question of law until the case gets here. 

Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should 

6 nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with 

7 counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear? When we 

8 issued our decision, the law would be clear. 

9  MS. GILLEY: I believe that the Court would 

have the authority to do that because it says if it is 

11 on direct appeal or not yet final. So it would not yet 

12 be final unless the time had expired for the petitioner 

13 to get to the Supreme Court. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I wonder how we would 

go about deciding whether we would take such a case or 

16 not. We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel 

17 says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these 

18 objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the 

19 district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with 

me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you 

21 say that, that will make the decisions below clear 

22 error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it. 

23  Makes sense, right? 

24  MS. GILLEY: Well, I believe the Supreme 

Court has, under its own special rules, the -- the 

4

5

15

25

Official 

1 ability to take an argument in -- a petition that has 

2 not been raised before, but on its own could accept it 

3 if it is clear at the time --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then what your --

your first answer was that this is a very small set of 

6 cases that you're dealing with. If your answer to 

7 Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case 

8 that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error 

9 plain. That would open the door to a huge number of 

cases, wouldn't it? 

11  MS. GILLEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

12 I believe that the provisions to get to the Supreme 

13 Court -- frankly, I don't know the answer as to if you 

14 had skipped the -- the appellate court, and -- and we're 

still in that window of time, that transition period 

16 after the appellate court had ruled, and only then the 

17 clarifying error came, I think you could still come to 

18 the Supreme Court. 

19  But the very narrow -- the very narrow --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it would be narrow 

21 in the sense that substantial rights would have to be 

22 affected and the other conditions of Olano met. 

23  But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's 

24 question is, that itself would be another issue in every 

case. Is this one of those cases: Number one, it was 

5

Official 

1 wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear 

2 under all the Olano criteria. And that would have to be 

3 decided in every case. 

4  MS. GILLEY: Well, Your Honor, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So at the end of the day, 

6 it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that 

7 would be presented, both to this Court and the court of 

8 appeals, would be quite substantial. 

9  MS. GILLEY: Well, I think there would be 

very few that would come directly to the Supreme Court. 

11 The vast majority of the cases obviously would come 

12 through the circuits. 

13  And what I was referring to as a very small 

14 subset would be those cases where there is actually an 

unsettled error -- an unsettled claimed error at the 

16 trial. 

17  There are very few cases that would come out 

18 of the Supreme Court during the period of time of appeal 

19 that would allow for the petitioner to -- to say, well, 

now it's clear. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is a -- I 

22 mean, the time from the district court decision in this 

23 case to today is how long? 

24  MS. GILLEY: It's -- well, this case started 

in 2009. My client pled guilty in June of 2010.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's 2 years --

2 in any case in which -- in a typical case in which this 

3 happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right? 

4  MS. GILLEY: I think that my -- this case, 

Mr. Henderson's case, is unusually long. In fact, it 

6 was a year between the time he was sentenced in June of 

7 2010 until 2000 -- June of 2011, when Tapia was decided. 

8  So he was actually waiting between the 

9 period of the trial stage to -- into the Fifth Circuit 

for over a year before Tapia was even decided, and then 

11 several months after that before the Fifth Circuit ruled 

12 on the issue. 

13  So this is an unusually long period of time. 

14 I don't think that that's common. I think the vast 

majority of the cases do not come within that 

16 transitional period. As -- as the Fifth Circuit noticed 

17 after Mr. Henderson's case in Escalante-Reyes, they sua 

18 sponte had their own -- they called for an en banc in 

19 Escalante-Reyes and changed the position that they had 

in Mr. Henderson's case. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you what you think 

22 is the purpose of the Plain-Error Rule? 

23  Suppose that it was proposed to amend 

24 Rule 52(b) to take out the word "plain," so that the 

rule would read simply, "an error that affects 

7

1 substantial rights may be considered even though it was 

2 not brought to the Court's attention." 

3  So what does -- in your judgment, what does 

4 the word "plain" add? What -- what purposes does it 

serve? 

6  MS. GILLEY: Your Honor, it serves a very 

7 important purpose. And I must say that my understanding 

8 of that has evolved considerably since I started 

9 researching this issue. 

I think it's very important. And it 

11 certainly is helpful to -- to the practitioner because 

12 when you come to the appellate court, and you say, now, 

13 I have a -- a decision, it is now plain, or I have a 

14 rule -- a statute, that now makes this plain, it -- it 

is a very important prong in the Olano --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: But what purpose does it 

17 serve? Why should the rule not be that if -- if some --

18 if there was an error, and it was a really -- it was an 

19 error that really badly hurt the defendant, then it can 

be considered, even though it wasn't raised at whatever 

21 time it has to have been -- it wasn't raised, there 

22 wasn't an objection? What purpose does that serve? 

23  MS. GILLEY: The purpose of -- of 52(b) 

24 is -- is a safety belt for the very extreme measures of 

Rule 51, which says if you -- if you fail to raise

1 contemporaneously --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but I'm not asking 

3 why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised. 

4 I'm asking why do we require that the error be plain in 

order for it to be considered? 

6  Let me suggest two purposes it serves. It 

7 follows from the adversary system, and it serves 

8 judicial efficiency. 

9  Would you agree with that; those are the 

purposes of it? 

11  MS. GILLEY: I absolutely would. Yes. Yes, 

12 Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Does it serve 

14 those purposes better as applied at the time of trial or 

at the time of appeal? 

16  MS. GILLEY: The finding, the assessment of 

17 plain error; is that the question you're --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

19  MS. GILLEY: I think that it very much helps 

to assess and evaluate the plainness of the error at the 

21 time of appeal. That -- that is where it can really be 

22 helpful. And that, in fact, is what the Court did in 

23 both Olano and --

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Does it serve -- does it 

serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply 

9

Official 

1 the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time 

2 of appeal? 

3  MS. GILLEY: I think that it serves judicial 

4 efficiency very much better, as amicus very well stated 

in his brief, the example of the Ninth Circuit, where, 

6 if you don't have plain error, and then the appellate 

7 court must go back to the trial level, the trial stage, 

8 and determine was this, was this clear at the time of 

9 trial? Was it clearly against the defendant? Was it 

clearly --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you apply it at the 

12 time of trial, it may -- eliminate the need for an 

13 appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the 

14 ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it 

could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't --

16 it's not plain to us, I suppose. So you have that 

17 efficiency. 

18  But if you apply it at the time of trial, 

19 you avoid retrials. So which is -- which of those two 

is more consistent with the purpose of serving judicial 

21 efficiency? 

22  MS. GILLEY: Well, I'm not sure that that 

23 would be a correct assessment. I think that the 

24 judicial efficiency would be more at the time of appeal 

because, as many of the circuits have noticed, that's

1 what they are going -- they agree. I think it's -- you 

2 know, 8 to -- 8 to 2 that they find --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: But when, as is the 

4 situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time 

of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one 

6 way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely 

7 it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to 

8 the attention of the judge. 

9  He has a 50 percent chance of getting it 

right. And if he gets it right, then the case is done. 

11 Instead, your -- your client did not raise any 

12 objection, and the judge just went ahead. 

13  Now, if -- if the error was plain, you can 

14 say, well, he didn't need an objection, any -- any dumb 

judge would have -- would have known this. Okay? So 

16 you make that kind of an exception. But I don't see the 

17 reason for making that exception, where you could have 

18 brought this to the judge's attention, and he could have 

19 solved the problem; or, if he didn't solve it, maybe the 

prosecutor could have, by making some alteration in what 

21 he was demanding as a -- as a punishment or whatever. 

22  That -- that seems to me such a -- such a 

23 clear efficiency in the system. I don't know what the 

24 efficiency is when you do it at the court of appeals 

level. All you tell me is that, well, it saves you the 

11

25

Official 

1 trouble of going back and figuring out what -- what the 

2 situation was at the trial -- at the time of trial, 

3 right? But you've got to go back to the time of trial 

4 anyway to decide whether -- whether substantial rights 

have been affected, don't you? 

6  MS. GILLEY: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

7 multiple parts to that question. 

8  First of all, I think there -- I think that 

9 the cases -- the solicitors, the responders --

Respondents have conflated the idea of why we have 

11 52(b). It's not primarily for the efficiency of the 

12 judicial system. It's to -- it's to correct a very 

13 serious wrong, an injustice that was incurred by the 

14 defendant. That's the primary purpose of 52(b). 

And then, if you look at it the way the 

16 Court would -- the solicitors would have -- have the 

17 Court decide at time of trial, there would be no remedy 

18 for --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but there's -- this 

brings you back to Justice Alito's question. There's 

21 always an injustice when the district court has gotten 

22 it wrong. The district court got it wrong, applied the 

23 wrong rule. Justice has not been served. 

24  But we don't say, we want to do justice. We 

say, we're only going to do justice if it was clear. 

12

1  Now, why -- why would you -- why would you 

2 have that limitation on it? The only -- the only reason 

3 that limitation makes sense to me is -- is because when 

4 it is clear, it doesn't have to be raised below. The 

judge ought to know better, anyway, and so you're not 

6 sacrificing any efficiency. 

7  But if the whole purpose of it is just to do 

8 justice, I don't understand the reason for the clear 

9 limitation. Why should it only be when it's clear? 

MS. GILLEY: Well, we have the rules going 

11 back to the Atkinson case. And the question was what 

12 happens when we have the very serious Rule 51, if you 

13 don't have contemporaneous objection, you're out of 

14 luck? 

Fortunately, we have the safety belt of 

16 52(b). 

17  And then this Court, looking at the --

18 what -- what was codified from Atkinson, has the 

19 four-prong test. First, we have an error. It must be 

clear. The -- the reason for having it clear, first of 

21 all, it -- it creates efficiency in the -- in the 

22 appellate level court. The practitioner can now come 

23 and say, my client has a clear error. Tapia has now 

24 been decided, and it is clear. It was only unclear and 

unsettled at the time we were in court.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose one answer to 

2 Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require 

3 an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of 

4 everything that might change, but the answer to that, 

in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're 

6 just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge 

7 every -- everything that's important. 

8  MS. GILLEY: Well --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would seem to me the 

laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial 

11 objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly, 

12 preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk 

13 about what might be clear error. 

14  MS. GILLEY: Well, I think we must talk 

about clear error. And -- and I think that in my -- my 

16 briefing, in my -- in my beginning to the closing brief, 

17 and certainly in the amicus brief, which is an excellent 

18 source on this point. When the Court looked at both --

19 52(b) in both Olano and Johnson, they looked to the 

text, that this Court looked to the text of 52(b). And 

21 the clear error that they looked at was they decided 

22 those cases on the basis that the error was clear at the 

23 time of trial. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in Johnson did 

they -- I'm looking at the para -- two paragraphs the 

14

5

25

Official 

1 Court spent on this in Johnson. Where did they look at 

2 the text? 

3  I mean, obviously, they quoted the text, but 

4 the analysis seems to me to be based solely on judicial 

efficiency. 

6  MS. GILLEY: I think -- and -- and I would 

7 like to refer to Judge Owens' concurring and dissenting 

8 opinion in Escalante-Reyes in the Fifth Circuit. She 

9 addressed this quite well in three pages of her -- of 

her opinion, where the Justice did, in a unanimous 

11 opinion, state in -- let's see, I think footnote 5 --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm looking at 

13 where they talked about this particular question, the 

14 second prong, as they -- they put it. 

MS. GILLEY: Well, I believe that what 

16 Justice Rehnquist looked to was the text of --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was the Chief 

18 Justice, by the way. 

19

Rehnquist.

22 us. 

23

 MS. GILLEY: I'm sorry. Chief Justice 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It matters to one of

1  (Laughter.) 

2  MS. GILLEY: And -- and I noticed in my 

3 record that I, in fact, had promoted Justice Clark in my 

4 brief, which the errata shows, and so I'm -- I'm not 

perfect. 

6  But the -- Justice Rehnquist looked -- and 

7 he talked specifically about looking at -- at 52(b) and 

8 saying, "We're not going to expand on it. We're not 

9 going to cut it out of new cloth. We're not going to 

make new exceptions. We looked for it as -- as -- as it 

11 is." 

12  And I think that was just a couple of lines 

13 after acknowledging the fact that the petitioner said, 

14 well, it would have been a laundry list, and that's 

inconvenient, and it's futile, and it's a waste of time. 

16 But that, I think, was more of an argument that went 

17 along with what the Chief Justice wrote, that we're 

18 looking at the text, and it just doesn't make any sense. 

19  We've got Olano that says, at the very 

minimum, the error must be clear at the time of appeal. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I want to go back to 

22 Justice Alito's question for a moment because I 

23 thought -- and Justice Scalia. I thought, in your 

24 brief, you -- you said that their point's a good point. 

Their point is that the system works in a way that 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 requires the lawyer to object at the trial. Alright. 

2 And that is an efficiency because the trial judge has to 

3 -- has to correct -- he has to -- has an opportunity to 

4 correct mistakes. He can't be sandbagged. 

But, you said, that's theoretically always 

6 true, but, in your case, as a practical matter, it's 

7 really never true because no lawyer is ever going to 

8 think, oh, I would object, but I'm not going to object 

9 because maybe the law will become clarified by the 

Supreme Court, and I'll be able to get a plain error 

11 thing on appeal. The lawyer who thought that is like 

12 the unicorn, he doesn't really exist. 

13  (Laughter.) 

14  Okay. And you then said, on the other hand, 

there’s an efficiency on the other side. The efficiency 

16 on the other side is if you don't take your rule, when 

17 you get to the court of appeals, you're going to have to 

18 decide in real cases whether the law was so clear that 

19 the plain error doctrine still does apply at the trial 

level before. Either it was clear that the judge was 

21 wrong, or it was clear the judge was right, and there is 

22 no point to objecting. 

23  So now we have to decide, was he clearly 

24 wrong, was he clearly right, or was it a middle case. 

And when you get to real legal cases that have tough

1 issues, you discover that that's a hard question to ask 

2 -- answer case by case, court by court. Now, didn't you 

3 say all that? 

4  MS. GILLEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Well, then why 

6 didn't I hear you say it again. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Then let me ask you this 

8 question. Counsel, then let me ask you this related 

9 question. Something happens at trial. There isn't an 

objection. It goes up on appeal. And the -- the 

11 appellate court, there is an argument about whether it's 

12 a plain error or not. 

13  And the appellate court says, first of all, 

14 we think it was an error, but it's a -- it was a close 

question. We had trouble with this. So it wasn't 

16 plain, and, therefore, this defendant is out of luck. 

17 What's the justification for that? 

18  MS. GILLEY: I think that the four prongs of 

19 Olano are the justification. That's where I would have 

been --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: No, I mean in real world 

22 terms. What -- what purpose is served by that? 

23  If the court has concluded that there was an 

24 error, and it affected substantial rights, but it wasn't 

plain, what -- what justification is there for saying,

1 that's too bad? You know, you really got hurt, but it 

2 wasn't clear until -- you know, it wasn't plain until we 

3 decided this case, so go back to prison. 

4  What's the purpose for that? 

MS. GILLEY: Well, there -- there is no 

6 purpose for that. And -- and the --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Then why should it have to 

8 be plain at the time of appeal? 

9  MS. GILLEY: But the appellate court has the 

responsibility of applying the law as it is current. 

11 That's what the appellate court is directed to do. 

12 That's what Atkinson -- that's what -- even what 

13 Atkinson said. You apply the law at -- as it is 

14 current. 

And so what you're doing by interpreting 

16 time of trial as a point of determining the clarity 

17 of -- of the error, you are completely eliminating the 

18 ability for the appellate court to even rule on that 

19 question because there will never, ever be a plain error 

if you apply the time of trial as the point of 

21 determining whether it was clear or not. 

22  People like Armarcion Henderson would never 

23 have an opportunity to -- to have plain error because it 

24 would never be clear. We have to have --

JUSTICE ALITO: You could promote efficiency

1 at the appellate stage by having a rule like the rule 

2 that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a 

3 court the discretion to decide whether something was 

4 clear or go to the -- to the merits of the -- of the 

argument. You could -- that's -- you can serve 

6 efficiency by having that. 

7  But the Plain-Error Rule doesn't do that. 

8 In the situation I gave you, the court would say there 

9 was an error, it really affected your substantial 

rights, but we can't say it was plain to us until we 

11 decided this case, and, therefore, you get no relief. 

12 And -- and maybe there's a reason for that. I'm waiting 

13 for you to tell me what the reason for it is. 

14  MS. GILLEY: Well, the -- the reason would 

be similar to what Mr. Henderson faced in the 

16 three-judge panel. The -- the judge -- the panel said 

17 that the error was -- was clear, as far as they -- they 

18 know it happened. Tapia said it happened, and -- and 

19 there was no question about that; but, the fact that it 

was not clear at the time of trial defeated 

21 Mr. Henderson's ability to get relief. 

22  So even though the -- the Congress said, you 

23 shouldn't put these people in jail for the purpose of 

24 rehabilitation, it was clear -- everybody agreed it was 

wrong, but my client, instead of having the recommended

1 33 to 41 months, received a 60-month sentence. That's

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there a reason -- I 

4 think you represented your client at the trial. 

MS. GILLEY: Yes, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a reason why you 

7 didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that 

8 sentence? 

9  I mean, there was -- one thing is Tapia; 

but, before that, there was a statute that says, judge, 

11 don't lengthen sentences for purposes of rehabilitation. 

12 And you didn't call that statute to the attention of 

13 the -- of the judge, did you? 

14  MS. GILLEY: I did not, Your Honor. And 

that was a -- I knew that there was -- certainly, I was 

16 concerned, and I was -- that the -- the sentence was so 

17 much beyond what the sentencing guidelines had -- had 

18 recommended. 

19  There was -- the situation was I knew that 

at that point the guidelines were advisory. I couldn't 

21 figure -- at that point --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were you -- were you 

23 aware of the statute at the time? 

24  MS. GILLEY: I was not. In fact, I was not 

aware of that statute. And when I -- I did file a Rule 

21

1 35(a) motion eight days later. After I went and did my 

2 research, I realized there was only one case that I 

3 could find, In re Sealed out of the District of Columbia 

4 circuit, which had addressed that particular statute. 

And so I did file a Rule 35(a) motion 

6 timely, eight days after, and asked the trial court, 

7 based on 35(82)(a) to please correct that error in the 

8 sentencing. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And let me ask you, I 

don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the 

11 metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's 

12 important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this 

13 case, there wasn't going to be a new trial. There 

14 wasn't going to be a new jury. It's just the sentence. 

Has any argument been made that we should 

16 have a different rule for sentences than for errors that 

17 would require a new -- a complete new trial? 

18  MS. GILLEY: Your Honor, certainly 

19 Petitioner has not made that; but, there are so many law 

review articles out there right now on ways of changing 

21 plain-error review, it might --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some circuits have even 

23 said that. Some circuits have even said that. 

24  MS. GILLEY: Yes. That is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Second Circuit says

1 that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of 

2 substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the 

3 preceding question is a different balance. 

4  MS. GILLEY: That is correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So you can -- if you lose, 

6 you can't get through the door. If you win, you then 

7 have to go on to the next part of it, which says, did 

8 the error affect the fairness, integrity or public 

9 reputation of judicial proceedings. 

So if all that's at stake is a resentencing, 

11 not much harm is done, and you're more likely to satisfy 

12 the fourth. 

13  MS. GILLEY: And the third. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: If what's at stake is a 

whole new trial and everything, it's probably a little 

16 bit harder to satisfy that prong. 

17  So it's possible to build what Justice 

18 Kennedy was referring to into the present rule, isn't 

19 it? 

MS. GILLEY: It could -- it could be 

21 possible, and it could be --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that so? Why 

23 is that so? Why does -- does the effect upon the 

24 fairness of the proceedings change when it's sentencing 

or when it's the merits? I don't understand that.

2 and I --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're here 

4 complaining about sentencing. That's a substantial 

issue, isn't it? 

6  MS. GILLEY: It is very substantial. And 

7 there's a recent case out of the Eleventh Circuit that I 

8 was going to call to the Court's attention, Judge 

9 Gorsuch. And his -- his comment was, "This is such a 

serious, serious situation when we sentence a man or a 

11 woman to a time in prison when Congress says he should 

12 not be there. That is one of the ultimate injustices 

13 that we should look at." 

14  And -- and I think that's looking at it from 

the -- having a separate -- separate review system for 

16 sentencing certainly might be helpful. It could 

17 certainly be more speedy, although, frankly, in my case 

18 it would not have helped Mr. Henderson because it took 

19 Tapia a year after my client was sentenced before Tapia 

was decided. 

21  Of course, I think the argument could have 

22 been made and I certainly would have made it at the 

23 Fifth Circuit if Tapia had not been decided by the time 

24 we made it to the Fifth Circuit, I would have argued 

that it was clear error regardless. The statute was

25

Official 

1 very clear in that it was -- it was certainly -- when 

2 the Court eventually did look at Tapia, they used the 

3 straightforward -- you used the straightforward language 

4 of it. 

But I think that, that the main, the main 

6 point -- another point that I did want to make is that 

7 by deciding that plainness should be determined at the 

8 time of appeal, this Court would be consistent with its 

9 holdings in Olano and in Johnson, because in Olano, the 

Court said it would be, in this case, it is adequate 

11 that the error is plain at the time of appeal. 

12  In Johnson, the Court said there was, in 

13 fact, no error at the time of trial, but it is clear at 

14 the time of appeal. And so in both of those cases, the 

text of 52(b), which is on page 1 in my brief, the text 

16 of the brief is what the Court relied on and the Court, 

17 the Court said that based on that test, it's adequate 

18 that the Court find the appeal -- find the error plain 

19 at the time of appeal. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many months are left 

21 for the defendant's sentence? 

22  MS. GILLEY: He is scheduled to be released 

23 in May of 2013. He never did get the, the in-depth 

24 treatment program. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't?

Official 

1  MS. GILLEY: He did not, and it's unlikely 

2 he would have ever gotten it because of the fact that he 

3 had a gun charge. He pled guilty to a felon in 

4 possession of a firearm, which puts the -- the 

individual at a very low eligibility for getting into 

6 the program. 

7  The RDAP program is very highly coveted 

8 because if completed successfully, it reduces the time 

9 that you are going to be incarcerated. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the judge was not 

11 aware of those impediments? 

12  MS. GILLEY: The judge was very well aware, 

13 and that was part of the problem that we had. I was 

14 arguing at the time of sentencing for mitigating 

circumstances that, that my client really hadn't done 

16 anything and he had possessed this gun for about 10 

17 minutes. The facts are not important to this Court, but 

18 he had done nothing seriously wrong with this. 

19  He did, in fact, commit the crime and he was 

ready to take the punishment. The sentencing guideline 

21 range was 33 to 41. I did not object, the government 

22 did not object, and so I assumed it would be in that 

23 range.

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 

2  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

3  MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

4 the Court: 

The contemporaneous --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was Justice Breyer 

7 essentially correct that in most of the cases where an 

8 error is not plain at the time of trial that the third 

9 and fourth prong of Olano almost always take care of the 

issue? I mean, I've been looking for a case in this 

11 Court in which more substantial errors than the one that 

12 occurred here -- we are going to put aside the fact that 

13 I don't see how this Defendant on the third or fourth 

14 could ever win, given that he was begging for drug 

treatment during his sentencing, so how a resentence 

16 would affect the fairness or integrity of this 

17 proceeding is beyond my understanding. 

18  But isn't Justice Breyer right? 

19  MR. WALL: No. Not in the government's 

view. I think it's a question for another day how much 

21 work the fourth prong is doing in the lower courts, but 

22 I would say in all of these cases, the defendant is 

23 claiming that his sentence was lengthened. I think in 

24 all of them he will be able to meet the third prong and 

show that his substantial rights were affected. It

1 becomes a fourth prong question then. 

2  And in the Escalante-Reyes case, one of the 

3 dissenting opinions attached an appendix in which the 

4 Fifth Circuit, in 181 cases, had found that fourth prong 

met and had found plain error satisfied. But I would 

6 think it --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I would say to you 

8 that that's more in keeping with the attitude that 

9 Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most 

circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily 

11 met in sentencing than in trial cases. Whether they are 

12 right about that, that's not an issue we are facing 

13 today. 

14  MR. WALL: The Second Circuit has adopted 

that rule. I don't know that other courts have but it's 

16 really -- the prongs of the plain-error review test are 

17 meant to serve different purposes. The third and fourth 

18 prongs are looking at harms to the defendant and to the 

19 judicial -- the integrity of the judicial proceedings. 

The second prong is really designed to do something 

21 different. It's designed to enforce the contemporaneous 

22 objection requirement by isolating errors --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why? The very 

24 essence of 52(b) is when you don't make an objection. I 

mean, it's treating two -- it's addressing two different 

28

1 situations; A says when you've made an objection, you 

2 just have to prove prejudice; and B says you have to 

3 prove that substantial rights are affected. 

4  MR. WALL: Oh, no question. The purpose of 

that prong is to isolate out one set of errors, obvious 

6 errors, from all of the other trial errors that happen 

7 every day that are not correctable under Rule 52, 

8 debatable errors that even reasonably experienced 

9 district court judges and prosecutors might have 

overlooked in the hustle and bustle of a trial. 

11  That second prong is designed to say, "We 

12 want," as the Court said in Frady, "obvious egregious 

13 errors that the trial court and the prosecutor were 

14 derelict in countenancing." Because there we are not as 

worried about incentivizing the defendant to make a 

16 contemporaneous objection, because every party in the 

17 courtroom should have known and applied the law. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, why doesn't 

19 that describe this case? In here is a statute, never 

mind Tapia, the statute says to the judge, don't 

21 lengthen the defendant's sentences for purposes of some 

22 cure. And if the judge was not aware of that statute, 

23 he surely should have been, the prosecutor shouldn't --

24 wasn't it incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, 

Judge, sorry, you can't do that?

1  MR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, I think it cuts 

2 actually exactly the opposite way. There was a 

3 long-standing circuit split that the Court resolved in 

4 Tapia. Courts have reached different conclusions on 

this. And if the Defendant here had said, look, 

6 district court, you shouldn't lengthen my sentence based 

7 on rehabilitative purposes. 

8  Some courts have found that is impermissible 

9 and you should follow those courts, not the courts that 

have permitted it, I think a fair reading of the 

11 sentencing transcript is that the district court was 

12 genuinely on the fence here about what to do with this 

13 particular defendant and whether to lengthen his 

14 sentence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he was not aware of 

16 the statute. No one called it to his attention. 

17  MR. WALL: No. It is then exactly the kind 

18 of debatable, open, unsettled legal question that our 

19 adversarial system counts on parties to raise every day. 

And what we do in Rule 52 is we have a narrow safety 

21 valve for obvious errors that everyone in the courtroom 

22 should have caught. But I don't think that we can say 

23 that --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the -- I 

mean, that's the question. The word "plain" of course

1 refers by and large to an error that the lower court 

2 judge should have caught, so you should have objected. 

3 But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you 

4 have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and 

Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of 

6 Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a 

7 case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the 

8 law is now plain, means that the appellate court should 

9 treat this person the same as a thousand others who now 

will be treated according to the new law. 

11  And indeed, you're complicating it even 

12 further for the reason that I really meant my question 

13 to be aimed at you -- you know. I mean, in fact, the 

14 reason that I said that you're going to create 

distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going 

16 to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that 

17 he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal. 

18  And here we have six identical people in the 

19 circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the 

new rule's advantage, and six identical people in 

21 another circuit where the law was clear the other way 

22 and they get the advantage. But in the one circuit 

23 where the law wasn't clear, he doesn't get the advantage 

24 of the new rule. 

Now, that seems pretty unfair, and I could

1 at least make up some cases where it's just a horror. 

2 And if that's so, why don't we leave plain with enough 

3 wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the 

4 Court of Appeals can say, it is now plain and the other 

things are satisfied so we apply it to the defendant. 

6 That's the whole long question that I've got every part 

7 of it in there. 

8  MR. WALL: And I'll see if I can get them 

9 all in. So all I can say to you, Justice Breyer, is the 

same thing the Court has said in Puckett, Dominguez, 

11 Benitez, Young, the Rule 52 has an interest in error 

12 correction, egregious error correction, no question. 

13 But it is balanced against a very important systemic 

14 interest in judicial efficiency. And far from being a 

horror, that's a necessary corollary of our system --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Wall, your whole 

17 argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives 

18 argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer 

19 is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to 

make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made 

21 if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted. And 

22 this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier. 

23  I don't know of a lawyer who would say the 

24 following to himself: I'm not going to make this 

objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime

1 between now and my direct appeal the law is going to 

2 change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when 

3 it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection 

4 and get over not only prong two but prong three and four 

of the test, and life will be grand for my client. 

6  Now, who is going to say that? 

7  MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, it's not just 

8 about incentives. Even if I granted that the incentives 

9 of defendants would be entirely unchanged no matter what 

rule this Court adopted, and I don't grant that for all 

11 the reasons in our brief. 

12  But even if I thought that were right, every 

13 time a Court of Appeals or this Court issued an 

14 intervening decision of criminal law or criminal 

procedure, a set of defendants who had not raised a 

16 claim of that error at trial would come in to the Court 

17 of Appeals or this Court with a claim of plain error. 

18  And what we would see is a significant shift 

19 of judicial resources to plain-error cases, to do 

fact-intensive third and fourth prong review to consider 

21 a set of errors that were never meant to be put on the 

22 table under Rule 52(b). That's not what this safety 

23 valve was designed to do. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I can -- I can also not 

imagine a lawyer who intentionally makes that decision.

1 That -- that lawyer is a unicorn, I suppose. 

2  But I think there are a lot of lawyers who 

3 will not be as careful about finding all of the issues 

4 that they should bring to the court's attention, perhaps 

be unaware of a statute that they should have been aware 

6 of. 

7  If -- if we -- if we adopt the rule that's 

8 being urged by the Petitioner here, it does affect 

9 attorney behavior for the attorney to know that stuff 

that he -- he ought to know but doesn't know will --

11 will not be able to be patched up on appeal. 

12  MR. WALL: The government agrees with that, 

13 Justice Scalia. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, should the government 

agree with that really? Should some -- can you 

16 imagine -- isn't it just as much of a unicorn for an 

17 attorney to say, I'm not going to take great care 

18 because I think that the law is going to change between 

19 now and the appeal, and because I think I'm going to win 

on prongs two and three -- three and four. 

21  I mean, nobody can think that those 

22 circumstances would arise. They're flukes when they 

23 arise. And so it -- it doesn't affect either the 

24 attorney's intentional conduct or his level of 

preparation and care.

2 saying that I think lawyers are sitting in -- in trial 

3 courts intentionally going through the kind of thought 

4 processes that you describe. But I think the effect 

that Justice Scalia is talking about is real. 

6  I think, at the margins, which is what we're 

7 talking about when we're talking about these incentives, 

8 I do think that in cases like this one -- I mean, this 

9 is the heartland, where the district court says, I'm 

going to give you an above-guideline sentence in order 

11 for you to take a drug treatment class. 

12  Now, defendants all around the country at 

13 the time of Petitioner's trial were raising Tapia 

14 claims. This was not some novel legal claim unknown. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why was it a Tapia 

16 claim? Why wasn't it simply, trial -- trial judge, the 

17 statute says imprisonment is not an appropriate means of 

18 promoting correction and rehabilitation? Why weren't 

19 those -- why wasn't it really incumbent on the 

prosecutor to tell the judge, just read those words? 

21  MR. WALL: So, Justice Ginsburg, I didn't 

22 mean by Tapia claim, depending on -- because this Court 

23 hadn't issued Tapia. I mean a claim like the one in 

24 Tapia, where defendants were saying, Section 3582, the 

statute to which you're pointing, does not permit you,

1 district court judge, to do this. 

2  Lots of defendants were making those claims. 

3 They were percolating up through the circuits. Even 

4 defendants in the Fifth Circuit were making that claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Wall, why is this 

6 whole test, as you're proposing it, dependent on the 

7 smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and 

8 the speed with which a particular circuit reaches an 

9 issue or doesn't? 

I mean, this -- basically, what you're 

11 saying is we reward the circuits and the judges who 

12 don't reach issues, because if the law is unsettled, 

13 then if a substantial right is affected, that's so 

14 serious that it affects the fairness and integrity of a 

proceeding, that is not going to result in a reversal. 

16  It seems to me that if I'm a district court 

17 judge or a circuit court judge or anyone else or a 

18 circuit court, I would try to avoid as many issues as I 

19 could because there's going to be as little set of 

reversals as possible. 

21  MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And going back to what 

23 Justice Ginsburg said, we take cases where the split is 

24 8 to 1, okay, or 8 to 0, because a particular circuit 

hasn't gotten to -- to an issue.

MR. WALL: It's -- it's not about rewarding 

6 or faulting district courts. It's the way our system 

7 works. Where a court of appeals or this Court issues a 

8 decision that governs a district court, that's the law. 

9 And the Court said in Frady, we count on the trial court 

and the prosecutor to bring those kinds of egregious 

11 errors to the Court's attention. 

12  But where it's an open question --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why isn't the focus 

14 of the system on the nature of the error? 

MR. WALL: I think the focus of the system 

16 is on the contemporaneous objection requirement in Rule 

17 51, which is what Rule 52 is designed to enforce. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But 52(b) is about not 

19 making the objection. That's -- that's sort of going 

around in a circle. 

21  MR. WALL: Well, only in the sense that what 

22 Rule 52(b) does is it says okay, you didn't object. We 

23 will let you get a narrow form of relief, but only in

unnecessary because there was governing law which

9 argument were it not for Johnson. But Johnson is 


saying, look, if you're in a circuit where the law turns 

11 out to be absolutely clearly wrong, then you don't have 

12 to make an objection. And then what we do is we 

13 consider whether the matter was clear at the time of 

14 appeal. 

Now, once I see that, it's like both 

16 bookends. You don't have to make the objection, and the 

17 only time you do is when the law is unclear; and, that 

18 being so, we're going to have everybody doing research 

19 about how clear the law is one way or the other, which 

is going to be tough. 

21  But, more importantly, it seems to me what's 

22 happening is that 52 is being also used in part to 

23 isolate those Peggy Schooner type cases where it is just 

24 basically unfair not to apply new law. And in the words 

of Justice Marshall, he says that should apply, and

1 sometimes it's unfair not to apply it on the appeal. 

2 And -- and so I don't see how you explain Johnson on 

3 your theory. 

4  MR. WALL: I think Johnson -- as the Chief 

Justice pointed out earlier, the analysis in Johnson, 

6 is fairly brief. The Court did not discuss the text, 

7 history of the rule or this Court's previous cases. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, more than that, 

9 Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the 

case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear 

11 on appeal, the rule applies. 

12  It could have said that. The case would 

13 have been very easy. It -- it instead avoided that by 

14 saying, oh, well, this is a very special case. 

Well, it wouldn't be a special case if -- if 

16 the argument presented by the Petitioner here were 

17 accepted. I don't -- far from -- far from appearing 

18 that Johnson supports Petitioner's case, I think Johnson 

19 tends to undermine it. 

MR. WALL: Well, in danger of running afoul 

21 of Justice Kagan, I'm going to agree again. That's 

22 exactly the government's argument. If Johnson had 

23 resolved the broader question, it could not have set 

24 aside the -- the question here. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the government had a 

39

1 different argument before. 

2  In Johnson, the government called this 

3 distinction an amorphous one. And it says, "Nothing in 

4 the text of Rule 52(b) contemplates or permits any such 

distinction. An error is either plain, or it is not. 

6 It is more faithful to the text of Rule 52(b) and simpler 

7 for the courts of appeals to obviate that distinction 

8 altogether," said the government. 

9  MR. WALL: And this Court disagreed, but 

studiously avoided placing its decision on the text --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: This Court did not disagree. 

12 This Court took a half step. And the question before us 

13 is still the question that was before you when you wrote 

14 this passage, you being the government, which is should 

we distinguish between the Johnson case and this one. 

16 And you very clearly stated, both as to a matter of text 

17 and to a matter of what's simpler for the courts of 

18 appeals, that there should be no such distinction. 

19  MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, there is no 

question that in the briefs and in argument, the 

21 government in Johnson asked this Court not to draw a 

22 futility exception to Rule 52 for cases in which an 

23 objection would have been pointless at trial in light of 

24 governing precedent, and the Court disagreed with us on 

that.

1  And the question here is, is the Johnson 

2 tail going to wag the plain-error dog? Johnson rested 

3 on a policy consideration. They're just flatly 

4 inapplicable here. This is the heartland of cases in 

which a contemporaneous objection could have been quite 

6 helpful. This is not, as the Court said in Johnson, a 

7 case in which the defendant was being asked to make an 

8 objection that the District Court was powerless to 

9 grant. 

The District Court here, I think, was 

11 genuinely on the fence about what to do, and an 

12 objection could have been quite helpful. So to take --

13 I mean, either the holding in Johnson, which was limited 

14 and could not have been if the Court had decided on a 

broader ground, or the rationale. Even taking just the 

16 rationale, that doesn't apply here. 

17  I think the only way you could read Johnson 

18 that would help Petitioner is to say it resolved the 

19 broader question of what the text of the rule requires 

regardless of context. And that's the one reading of 

21 Johnson that's just not persuasive on the face of the 

22 opinion. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the -- the – well, 

24 this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like, 

four different interpretations of what Johnson really 

41

1 means. And mine, which is, perhaps, no better or worse 

2 than the competing ones, is -- is you go back to the 

3 Schooner Peggy, and you see the Chief Justice, and he says, 

4 in a case the law has changed, the Court must decide, 

according to existing law, the appellate court; and, if it 

6 be necessary to set aside a judgment rightful when rendered, 

7 but which cannot be affirmed, but in violation of the law, 

8 that judgment must be set aside. 

9  So there, we seem to be -- and Johnson 

seemed to me to bear this out; but, sometimes, you do 

11 forgive the need to object because the overriding 

12 principle is the principle of deciding the law as it is 

13 at the time of appeal, and to do the contrary is just 

14 too unfair. 

Now, that -- reading Johnson that way, I'd 

16 say, well, that rule applies here too. 

17  MR. WALL: Justice Breyer --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Sometimes. 

19  MR. WALL: -- there is no question that that 

concern animated this Court's decision -- retroactivity 

21 decision in Griffith, and there is no question that that 

22 is one of the concerns underneath the rule. But if it 

23 were the only concern --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it's not. 

MR. WALL: The rule wouldn't say plain. As

1 Justice Alito pointed out --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely. I mean, 

3 that -- that argument applies to whether the error was 

4 plain or not. Apply the law as it is. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. And that's why 

6 you make a balance. And the balance goes -- brings back 

7 the first question that I put. Because, in this kind of 

8 a case where the law is unsettled, we have what we'll 

9 call the uniform or the hippogriff problem, and that's 

the problem of it doesn't really make that much 

11 difference to the basic policy of objecting. 

12  And on the other side, you have the 

13 administrative potential mess of having to figure out 

14 how clear was the law in the court -- the district 

court. Is it a circuit where you'd say the law was 

16 absolutely -- is pretty clear that they were right? Or 

17 was it a circuit where it's pretty clear that the law 

18 was the opposite, in which case we waive the need? Or 

19 is it actually mixed up and you don't know, in that 

circuit, in which case you're arguing, don't waive the 

21 need. So I see the unicorn on one side versus an 

22 administrative problem on the other. 

23  MR. WALL: So I -- I want to suggest that 

24 the administerability problem is very small because it 

has not been difficult for the lower courts to apply

1 this test. 

2  And I want to suggest that there is a really 

3 significant cost on the other side, which is you're 

4 putting on the table an entire set of errors that Rule 

52 was not designed to remedy, and you are diverting the 

6 resources of the judicial system toward those 

7 plain-error cases, and you will see a set of such claims 

8 every time a court of appeals or this Court issues a 

9 decision of criminal law or criminal procedure. In just 

this circuit alone, it has issued five opinions in the 

11 last year considering just Tapia plain-error claims. 

12 And that's just Tapia. And that's just one circuit. 

13  And I think the question is, what's the 

14 obvious prong designed to do? What's it there for? And 

it's got to be there to catch something. And what it is 

16 there to screen out are errors that were debatable, that 

17 even reasonable district court judges and prosecutors 

18 might have missed and catch errors that everyone in the 

19 courtroom should have recognized because they were 

egregious under the law as it stood at the time. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- it 

22 strikes me that we are having a very unusual discussion, 

23 in that we are competing policy considerations that have 

24 been raised. This is a -- a rule with particular 

language, and I don't think we'd be having this type of

1 a discussion if we were dealing with a statute.  I think 

2 there would be a different focus. Obviously, the policy 

3 concerns would be raised but in a different context. 

4  Do you have authority for the proposition 

that we have more flexibility in interpreting the 

6 Federal rules than we would in interpreting the statute? 

7  MR. WALL: I -- not in general --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it 

9 highlight -- it -- just to take a moment -- it was 

highlighted for me in your brief when you said, well, 

11 Johnson, there was a special circumstance, so they read 

12 this rule, then, this way. This is not a special 

13 circumstance, so we are going to read the rule a 

14 different way. Is it because these are rules as opposed 

to statutes? 

16  MR. WALL: No. It's because we have 

17 Johnson. I mean, I -- Mr. Dreeben stood here in Johnson 

18 and said, We've got the most natural reading of the 

19 rule, and you shouldn't carve out a futility exception 

to it. And then, in our view, that is what the Court 

21 did without discussing the tax. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what about what the 

23 rules -- what the rules advisory committee? I mean, is 

24 it -- when 52(b) was put in the statute, they – they 

cited a case you cite in your brief, the Wiborg – or 

45

1 Wiborg case. That wasn't, at the time, error. It was a 

2 sufficiency-of-the-evidence error, the kind of thing you 

3 would expect the counsel to bring to the attention of 

4 the Court. 

And nonetheless, the -- the advisory 


6 committee put it in as an example of how 52(b) should 


7 operate. And why? They said they put it in there 


8 because it was a matter vital to the defendant. 


9  So the objection wasn't made, so the 


contemporaneous objection rule was -- was not observed 

11 and nonetheless, the Court said, We are going to take --

12 we are going to consider it on appeal because the matter 

13 is vital to the defendant. 

14  I can't imagine anything more vital than 

being deprived of 19 to 27 months of freedom. 

16  MR. WALL: Well, I -- but Wiborg falls 

17 squarely within what we all believe is the core of the 

18 rule. There wasn't sufficient evidence at trial. That 

19 would have been obvious to everyone in the courtroom 

that the prosecution hadn't satisfied some element of 

21 the offense. There is no change in intervening law like 

22 what we are dealing with here. 

23  And I take your point, Mr. Chief Justice. 

24 We think that we've got by far the most natural reading 

of the text. It's backed up by the history. It's

1 backed up by this Court's understanding in cases like 

2 Frady, that is designed to cure errors so egregious that 

3 the trial court and prosecutor were derelict in 

4 countenancing them, as this Court said in Frady. 

And I -- I don't see Petitioner or the 

6 amicus really taking issue with the government on that 

7 text or history or cases like Frady. I think they are 

8 resting it on Johnson, and for the reasons I tried to 

9 explain to Justice Kagan, I don't think any persuasive 

reading of Johnson gets them home. It could not have 

11 set aside this question if it had thought that it was 

12 resolving what the text of the rule Mr. Chief Justice 

13 meant, or general --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: What about Mr. Henderson 

sitting in prison, serving a sentence that we now know 

16 was imposed for a reason that is not permitted under 

17 Federal sentencing law? Is there anything that can be 

18 done for him? If -- if it was very clear at the time 

19 that the statute prohibited this, would it have been --

was it ineffective assistance of counsel for his 

21 attorney not to have made an objection? 

22  MR. WALL: I think he could certainly raise 

23 that claim in habeas and attempt to -- to get relief, 

24 but I don't think there is any relief for him under Rule 

52. And I don't --

7 he has been eligible for the RDAP in the time that he 

8 has been in prison, and he has never --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I guess, I -- I 

continue to be confused about what makes error plain or 

16 clear. I don't know why the pronouncement of a circuit 

17 court accomplishes that. Meaning, so we said in Tapia 

18 that the statute is perfectly plain, perfectly clear. 

19 And so why shouldn't it have been clear to those 

circuits or to that district court judge at the time of 

21 trial? 

22  You're equating the plainness of error with 

23 what the outcome is to -- in circuit courts, and I'm 

24 having trouble with that.

1 Sotomayor. I -- it's possible to imagine a case in 

2 which a district court judge was not foreclosed from 

3 reaching some legal conclusion that nevertheless no 

4 reasonable judge would reach. I just think it's 

impossible to say that that's what Tapia was. You had 

6 courts that had reached different conclusions, and you 

7 had a sentencing practice that had been in existence for 

8 decades. Now, this Court ultimately found and agreed, 

9 the government confessed to her, and the Court agreed 

that that was an impermissible sentencing practice. 

11  But it was still an open, debatable, legal 

12 question on which courts had reached different 

13 conclusions for many, many years. And I think to say to 

14 a district court judge in a circuit that has decided the 

question against the defendant, well, that's not clear 

16 law. I think a district court would look at you like, 

17 What are you talking about? I have an on-point Court of 

18 Appeals decision that tells me to do X or Y. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, can -- can I ask 

you about footnote 4 of your brief? This is the 

21 footnote in which you say that this case involves only a 

22 claim of sentencing error, and it doesn't involve a 

23 claim of actual innocence based on an intervening 

24 decision. 

Is that footnote meant to suggest that you

1 think, or at least that you contemplate the possibility 

2 that where there is an intervening decision making clear 

3 the conduct that a person had been convicted of was in 

4 fact not criminal, that you would think a different rule 

should apply? That the Johnson rule should apply? 

6  MR. WALL: We are leaving open, if the Court 

7 says that there is an actual innocence exception in 

8 habeas to procedural default rules, that whatever it 

9 covers, acts that are no longer criminal, sentences 

beyond the statutory maximum, that whatever that 

11 exception covers, we leave open the possibility that you 

12 could also get relief for that under Rule 52. That --

13 that those cases could -- those exceptions could trap 

14 each other. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Because then that creates 

16 yet another complication in this interpretation of Rule 

17 52. And one might say, we just want a uniform rule, 

18 that it should all be at one time, and having said which 

19 time it should be at in Johnson, and having suggested 

that it should also be in the time of appeal for actual 

21 innocence claims, that it would be strange to carve out 

22 this single set of cases involving intervening changes 

23 of the law, and say those should be at the time of 

24 trial.

whatever the Court decides to do with actual innocence, 

16 it shouldn't dictate the interpretation of procedural 

17 rules more generally.

JUSTICE BREYER: Then what harm does it do, 

6 in the interest of simplicity, in reading a word to mean 

7 what it says? The word is "plain error." It doesn't 

8 say whether they mean plain error at the time of trial, 

9 or plain at the time of appeal. 

Olano says it means plain at the time of 

11 appeal. If we say that's what it means, then that's 

12 what it means always. And what harm will that do, given 

13 the fact -- but, still, there's a plenty of a good 

14 reason, and appellate judges know their job, not to send 

things back, where it's some technical matter, where 

16 he's trying to sandbag the judge, where, in fact -- now

7 error that affects substantial rights, even if it wasn't 

8 brought to the judge's attention. 

9  MR. WALL: That's right. Even -- so that 

that's the first clause. And the second clause is, even 

11 if not brought to the court's attention, which suggests 

12 that that plain error, that egregious, obvious error, 

13 could have been brought to the district court's 

14 attention; not that it was debatable at the time, and it 

became clearer later because an appellate judge opined. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: That is Mr. Dreeben's
