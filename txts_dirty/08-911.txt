CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-911, 

Kucana v. Holder. 

Mr. Schoenfield. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In enacting section 1252(a)(2)(B), Congress 

limited its reduction of judicial review to where the 

authority for the Attorney General's discretion is 

specified under subchapter 2 of chapter 12 of Title 8. 

Congress did not express any intent to 

remove the courts’ jurisdiction to review discretionary 

decisions, the authority for which is specified under 

any other subchapter or in regulations, nor did Congress 

express any intent to delegate its constitutional 

responsibility to determine Federal jurisdiction to the 

Attorney General --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under what authority 

were these regulations issued? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: The regulation that grants 

discretion with regard to motions to reopen comes from a

section in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2, of the 

regulations. And that was authorized by section 1103 of 

Title 8. 

I should say the authorizing statute for 

the regulation is in subchapter 1, not subchapter 2. 

And that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that -- how does 

that read? I -- I recall the briefs say that, but I 

don't recall reading it. Is it -- does it appear 

somewhere? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1103, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the provision that 

-- that you contend provides the authority for the 

Attorney General's regulation. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1103(g)(2) 

authorizes the Attorney General to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know. Where is it, I'm 

asking? Is it -- is it in the briefs somewhere? 

You know, it's nice to know what we are 

talking about. When -- when you are relying on a 

section, it would be nice to have it in the materials. 

I mean, I guess I can send for it, but --

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Sure. It -- it indicates, 

on page 18 of the reply brief, that, quote, "Establish 

such regulations... as he deems necessary for carrying

out his authority under the provisions of this chapter." 

The fact that the statute we are focused on 

states that authority must be specified in this 

subchapter -- being subchapter 2 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Two. The -- the key word 

that is emphasized in this case is it's "under," 

instead of "in." 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: The word used in the --

in the statute is "under," which, of course, has a 

variety of definitions. We believe that taking the 

statute in context, that the correct definition to apply 

is "according to" or "within." 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be clearer if 

it had said "in." 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Congress could have said 

"in," but I think Congress made it clear by using the 

phrase "authority specified under," so we’re not -- we 

don't have a situation where, as Congress usually would 

do, they would say: a regulation under such and such a 

statute, where Congress uses the word "regulations." 

There is the -- the term "regulation" is not used in the 

statute. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you were to 

evaluate the validity of the regulation, I suppose, 

like, an APA case or similar to that, what statutory

provision would you look to, to see if the regulation 

was consistent with that statutory provision? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: We would look to section 

1103 in subchapter 1. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it really doesn't matter 

what "under" means, right? I mean, even -- even if you 

accept the other interpretation of "under," to wit, that 

it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your 

point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to 

the subchapter. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's absolutely correct, 

Your Honor. Although we don't think regulations are 

included, even if they were, it's not in the subchapter. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but -- is that 

right? Would -- would subchapter 1 give you much 

insight into the scope of the regulation and how it was 

a fair interpretation of the authority under which the 

Attorney General purported to act? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: I think that in terms of 

looking at the discretion of the Attorney General, 

historically, on motions to reopen, there have been --

there has been discretion. 

What the regulation did was to codify that 

historical authority and to be consistent with what the

courts had always done, but I think, in interpreting 

the scope of Congress's intent to reduce judicial 

review, we need to be very careful about that, 

obviously. And so, therefore, when it says "as under 

authority specified in this subchapter," we need to find 

the authority in the subchapter, which we don't. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- subchapter 2 

does talk about a special rule on reopening for battered 

spouses, children, and parents. Is that a statute where 

the discretion is committed to the Attorney General? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: No, Your Honor, because 

subchapter 2 does not say that the Attorney General has 

discretion to decide motions to reopen. That language 

is only found in the regulation. The only reference --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so it -- so absent 

the regulation, you would interpret the statute as 

saying there is no discretion? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Absent the regulation, I 

would interpret the statute as being silent as to the 

matter. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, that wasn't my 

question. Let's say there’s no regulation. And the 

statute says, number one, there shall -- so subchapter 2 

of the statute says, number one, there shall be motions 

to reopen. And then there is a special rule for

battered spouses. 

Now, you would interpret that statute, 

absent any regulation, as saying this is not within the 

discretion of the Attorney General? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: I would interpret the 

statute as not providing for discretion, yes, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how does an Attorney 

General decide without -- without using discretion? He 

must grant, in any case? Whether a battered spouse 

waits for 15 years, he must grant? 

Just under the statute, now. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: No. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is hypothetical. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Yes. 

No. I'm -- I'm not trying to say that, Your 

Honor. What I'm trying to say is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then there must be a 

discretionary component implicit. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: I would disagree in -- in 

this way: If the statute is silent as to matters of 

discretion, the Court can look to -- the Court could 

look to other sources to determine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you clarify, what

is the provision about battered spouses? I thought that 

that had to do with you could have more than one 

petition to reopen. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's correct, Your 

Honor. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the rule is you may 

reopen once and that -- that provision on battered 

spouses says, but if you are in that category, you 

can reopen again? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: I believe that's correct, 

Your Honor. I believe that the provision on battered 

spouses creates in a -- allows you to bring more than 

one motion to reopen. It does -- it does not address 

the issue of discretion. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would it -- I 

don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is 

that it doesn't make any sense. 

Why would Congress want to exclude review 

for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that 

are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the 

statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that 

are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney 

General is given the authority to make them 

discretionary and has done so? 

I mean, a discretionary judgment is a

discretionary judgment. Why -- at least if it's a 

legitimate one. I can understand why you would say 

discretion which is given to the Attorney General under 

the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has 

wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of 

discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute? 

One is explicit in the statute, and the other is 

pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to 

make it discretionary. 

Why would Congress want the one to be 

subject to judicial review and not the other? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Judicial review of motions 

to reopen has -- has been the traditional normal process 

for the court to take. I think what Congress was doing 

here was saying: In certain specified instances, we are 

going to remove judicial review, but not in all 

instances. 

And the question is, where did Congress draw 

the line? Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I'm saying why 

is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational 

line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised, 

since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled 

to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it. That 

makes some sense.

And I -- but where discretion is lawfully 

exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when 

the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute 

says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is 

lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the 

Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not 

allow it? I don't understand why -- why it would want 

to do that. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Well, let me suggest 

several reasons, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: First, if the Court was to 

read the statute as allowing a regulation to create 

discretion and, therefore, to remove judicial review --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't --

you don't contest that the regulation can provide 

discretion. You -- you don't say the regulation is 

invalid. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it is a valid exercise 

of discretion, right? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: And courts frequently 

review decisions for abuse of discretion. And motions 

to reopen, I would suggest, are particularly important 

because it creates a safety net for review. It deals

with -- like, rule 60(b) of the Federal rules, it deals 

with potentially new evidence, matters that weren't 

available to bring initially, and it's important that 

potential mistakes be reviewed. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to return for 

a moment to the battered spouse provision. The battered 

spouse provision specifically says that in the Attorney 

General's discretion, he may waive the time limit for 

the 1 year for the battered spouse. 

Now, that surely is discretion specified --

and I think the word "specified" is important here --

specified in subchapter 2. So there should be no 

judicial review as to that. 

You would have to agree with that, wouldn't 

you? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Yes, as to the -- as to 

waiving -- as to waiving the -- on the number of 

motions, yes. On that point, yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So then the 

thing that Congress cares about most is something the 

court can't review. That is counterintuitive. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Congress specified some 30 

instances of discretion to the Attorney General in 

subchapter 2, and I believe it drew the line there and 

said, if we did not specify it in subchapter 2, then it

is reviewable, just as courts have traditionally

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ones that have been 

codified by statute -- those prior to the codification 

were by regulation. Is that -- is that so? 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: The regulation regarding 

motions to reopen existed before the statute. Congress 

could readily have made that part of the statutory 

scheme if it had chosen to do so, but it did not. 

If there are no further questions, I would 

like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The statute at issue does not bar judicial 

review of denials of motions to reopen. And I would 

like to go right to one of the questions that was asked 

by Justice Scalia, which is: How do you make sense out 

of this statute, in terms of what Congress is doing in 

not allowing judicial review of specifications of

discretion in regulations, but -- I'm sorry, and 

allowing judicial review of things that are specified in 

regulations, but not things that are specified in the 

subchapter? 

And I think that the answer to this question 

comes from the text of the statute, particularly if you 

compare the two things that are in 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and 

(ii), that all of the things that are listed in (i) and 

that are covered by (ii) are substantive decisions that 

are made by the Executive in the immigration context as 

a matter of grace, things that involve whether aliens 

can stay in the country or not. And those are matters, 

at the end of the day, that the Executive, in the 

exercise of its immigration and foreign affairs power, 

has the authority to decide and that Congress did not 

want the Federal courts in the business of reviewing. 

But what the Federal courts have often 

reviewed are things where discretion is committed by 

regulation, and these are procedural matters that 

relates to whether an alien had a fair shot of getting 

his claim heard by the agency and by the Federal courts. 

Things like --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my question 

with reference to motions to -- to reopen? That is 

specified under subchapter 2. That's right there in

subchapter 2: There shall be a motion to reopen. 

Now, if you had no regulation upon it, 

wouldn't you say that would be within the discretion of 

the Attorney General? 

MS. SAHARSKY: I would say that the Attorney 

General has the discretion to issue regulations with 

regard to that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No, that's not my 

question. Hypothetical, not a real case. Just a 

hypothetical. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so we can talk about 

the statute. The statute says there -- subchapter 2, 

the one we are most interested in, specifies -- and 

that's one of the words -- that there shall be a motion 

to reopen. 

Now, don't you think that's within the 

discretion of the Attorney General, absent any 

regulations? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, because the statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So absent a 

regulation, there would be jurisdiction stripping under 

that provision, right? 

MS. SAHARSKY: No. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?

MS. SAHARSKY: Because in the case that you 

are positing, the discretion of the Attorney General is 

implicit in the statute. It's not specified in the 

statute. And here, Congress didn't say any time there 

is a discretionary decision, which is what implicit 

discretion would go to. It says: When discretionary 

authority is specified. 

Under this subchapter, that means that there 

needs to be something specific, specified, explicit, 

specifically noted in the text of the statute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. But you would 

give me, or would you, the concession that -- or 

agreement that the Attorney General's discretion to 

waive the time limit for battered spouses is committed 

to him? And that's non-judiciary reviewable, wouldn't 

you think? 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. That wouldn't 

be reviewable. Congress used the language of 

discretion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, that seems odd, 

that the thing Congress cares about so much that it 

makes a specific provision can't be subject to judicial 

review. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that is like the 

-- the various matters that Congress listed as specified

as discretionary within the text of the relevant 

subchapter, that it decided that this was a matter of 

Executive grace that it did not want the Federal courts 

involved in. 

But the Federal courts have long reviewed 

things like denials of motions to reopen, continuance 

denials, where you have a situation in which the Federal 

courts wanted to make sure that aliens were getting a 

fair chance to have their claims heard. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in fact, if -- if what 

we have is a motion in the category of grace, except for 

asylum, saying, of course, the Justice Department makes 

a decision that can't be reviewed. But then the 

department, let's imagine, has a regulation, and it 

says: Anyone can ask the department for a rehearing in 

such a matter, and we'll decide as a matter of grace 

whether to give you one. 

Now, you're saying that would be reviewed? 

MS. SAHARSKY: No, I'm not saying that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't it be 

reviewed? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You just said it was. You 

said every procedural decision is reviewed, which to me, 

makes no sense to begin with, because I can't imagine

that Congress, while they don't want them to review the 

substance at all, is perfectly happy to have the courts 

review every detailed matter of extra time to file a 

brief, extra time to have an oral argument. All those 

matters would be reviewable, I guess, in your view. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Two answers, Your Honor. 

First, the standard of review here is abuse of 

discretion. It has long been abuse of discretion. That 

doesn't mean that the Federal courts are involved in 

second-guessing the agency --

JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly the same is true of 

the substantive decision. I mean, that has nothing to 

do with it. 

I want to know -- look, this is where I'm 

going. I don't think your -- I can't find a reading of 

this statute that makes sense, except for one which I am 

trying on, and I'm sure there’s a lot wrong with it, 

that what Congress meant to do here is to take all the 

procedural decisions, including reopening ones, and 

treat them the same way that they are treating the 

substantive decisions. So that in his case, he wins. 

Because he gets review of the substance, he should get

some other case, they'd lose, because if you don't get 

review of the substance, you shouldn't get review of the

reopening. Both are the same thing. They are just 

filed at different times. 

So that, to me, is the only reading of this 

statute that I have yet found that made sense. But 

since no one argues for it, I'm sure I must be making 

some huge mistake. But that's what you can tell me. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think you are, if I 

am understanding you correctly. We actually have a 

footnote in our opening brief where --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, you are on the right 

side, because he wins. No, you're on the right side. 

He wins. I take that back. I'm sorry. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, let me try to explain. 

There are a number of matters that are committed to the 

agency's discretion after (i), things like adjustment of 

status. And if the alien sought review, judicial 

review, of an adjustment of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. SAHARSKY: -- status determination, we 

would say that's unreviewable under -- under (i).

JUSTICE BREYER: New things have happened;

determination that the Executive has already made, that 

that motion to reopen would not be --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not, but his 

motion to reopen is -- it's my hypothetical; I want to 

deal with it; I accept yours. My hypothetical is, 

something new came up. That's why he wants it reopened. 

MS. SAHARSKY: If something new came up --

JUSTICE BREYER: Something new came up. 

That's why he -- I think, isn't it true, often people 

want it reopened because something new came up? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, certainly that's what 

the statute requires them to do.

when something new comes up, we understand Congress as 

have wanting that to have been judicially reviewable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm asking you, what 

possible sense could it make? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Because Congress wants to 

make sense that the alien is getting -- make sure that 

the alien is getting a fair shot in terms of the 

process. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Look, we're -- two issues. 

One is grace in respect to -- let's call it fraud, and 

he loses. Something new comes up, and what does he 

want? Grace in respect of fraud in light of this new 

fact. 

Now, my question would be: What possible 

sense does it make to say the courts cannot review the 

first, but they could review the second? 

MS. SAHARSKY: If what he's seeking is a 

review of an exercise of discretion, then that is not 

reviewable, because of the reason that the initial 

determination is not reviewable.

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, by the way, this

That's where I get to the problem. 

You are trying to distinguish between 

whether it's done by regulation or done by statute. And 

I'm trying to distinguish on a very different context. 

Treat the motion to reopen the same as you treat the 

initial motion, whether it's done by regulation or 

whether it's done by statute. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right, and what I'm 

suggesting is that the difference there is between a 

substantive determination that's a matter of grace and a 

procedural determination to make sure that an alien gets 

a fair shot, and it is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- I'm 

sorry, do you want to finish? 

Okay. 

I -- I find it curious -- and maybe you can 

illuminate it for me -- that the Justice Department is 

before us, arguing that the Justice Department can't be 

trusted without judicial review. 

(Laughter.)

 And I find that doubly curious when the 

Justice Department won on the opposite position below. 

I mean, are you suggesting that the statute

is so absolutely clear that you could not stand there 

and say that your colleague down the hall in the Justice 

Department could be trusted to exercise his discretion, 

but in fact you are saying: I know we won on that, but 

we are not going to defend it because we think the 

Attorney General needs judicial review to help him stay 

in line? 

MS. SAHARSKY: In the vast majority of 

cases, of course we believe that the Board can be 

trusted, and that's why review is for an abuse of 

discretion, and it has been for many years. This Court 

has said in Dada --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if you take 

-- if you continued to argue the position you won on 

before the -- before the Seventh Circuit, it wouldn't be 

that the standard of review is -- is so deferential that 

it is okay. It would be there is no review at all. 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's right, but we did not 

argue to the Seventh Circuit that there was no 

jurisdiction here. 

In fact, it has been our position since 2004 

that the text of this statute, particularly the text, 

the context, the history, is so clear that we could not 

reasonably take the alternate position. It has been --

the Department of Justice was the opposite before 2004, 

correct? 

MS. SAHARSKY: There are only a handful of 

cases, and in those cases, several individual attorneys 

argued that there was no jurisdiction. And as soon as 

the leadership of the Office of Immigration Litigation 

heard of those cases, it sat down with the text of the 

statute and said: We think that the text here is clear, 

and we don't think the jurisdiction is taken away. And 

it directed all of the attorneys in the Office of 

Immigration Litigation not to be making this 

jurisdiction-stripping argument anymore. 

And it has been the United States' 

consistent position since then, and we urged it to the 

Seventh Circuit below, that when you look at the text of 

the statute, you look at authority specified under 

this subchapter. It’s Congress that specifies 

authority. "Specified under this subchapter" means "in 

this subchapter." It means "in the text of the 

subchapter." And we have to answer this question in 

this case by looking at the text that Congress enacted. 

I acknowledge that there is not legislative 

history, for example, to tell us what Congress intended 

to do here, but we think that the answer comes from the 

text of the statute. That if you are looking at the

substantive determinations that Congress was most 

concerned about in 1996 when it enacted IIRIRA, those 

were the things where Executive discretion was 

exercised it did not want the Federal courts getting 

involved in. But this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an idea of 

how many motions to reopen are brought to the courts for 

review each year? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there are approximately 

between 8 and 10,000 motions to reopen filed by the 

Board of -- before the Board of Immigration Appeals each 

year, and about between 15 and 20 percent of those are 

granted. 

So if you look at the -- the remaining 80 to 

85 percent that are denied, the general appeal rate for 

the courts of appeals is about 30 percent from the Board 

of Immigration Appeals. So if you assume that the 

appeal rate is about the same for motions to reopen, you 

could get a number that way. So, you know, we -- there 

are a substantial number –-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we are talking about 2 

or 3,000 petitions to the court each year? 

MS. SAHARSKY: But the -- the point that we 

are making is that there are these circumstances that 

Congress has recognized, and this Court recognized it in

Dada. The motions to reopen serve several important 

purposes, and, yes, they are reviewed under a very 

deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. We do not 

think in many cases that the Board was doing something 

wrong and that it needs to be overturned. 

But, for example, in the -- in a similar 

context of continuance denials, say there was an 

immigration judge who did not allow an alien to seek a 

continuance in order to get an attorney to bring forth 

his case before the immigration judge. Continuance 

denials, some circuits, including the Seventh Circuit, 

have said, are barred under this language. 

We don't think that judicial review of that 

is barred. We think that in the rare cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but that would 

be a question of law which is accepted. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I -- I am not sure that it 

would be a question of law in that circumstance. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you think it's 

so bad, the Attorney General doesn't have to do it. Why 

do you need a court to tell you that? 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the courts have 

long served a very important check on the Board's 

authority and on the Board's exercise -- you know, the 

Board has many cases before it. In rare instances --

correct? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, that's right, but the 

statute also -- the Attorney General -- the Board acts 

on behalf of the Attorney General under the statute, 

so the Board is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he doesn't 

like what they do, he has the authority to act himself. 

Whenever somebody delegates authority, they retain 

authority to act themselves. 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. The Attorney 

General does police the Board, but the courts of appeals 

have long done that too, particularly in the context of 

motions to reopen. 

This Court, just a couple of years ago in 

Dada, recognized the important functions that motions to 

reopen serve and assumed that there would be judicial 

review of motions to reopen. In fact, it noted that 

judicial review of motions to reopen, albeit under the 

abuse-of-discretion standards, goes back to 1916, and we 

just didn't see anything in 1996 to suggest that

Congress wanted to change that. And I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know where the 

motion -- where -- where did it originate? Where did it 

-- it was -- we now know it's in the regulations. It's 

in the statute. But how did motions to reopen BIA 

decisions originate? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Before the BIA existed, so 

back in the 1916 context, there were immigration 

officers, and you could ask them to reconsider or reopen 

your case. In -- I think it was 1940 or 1941, the Board 

came into being, and the Attorney General quickly 

enacted regulations that provided for either sua 

sponte reopening or for the filing of a motion to 

reopen. And those regulations existed in substantially 

the same form until 1996, when they were amended to make 

discretion explicit in the regulation, and the 1996 is 

essentially the same form that it’s in today. So there 

has -- there has always been an assumption that there 

can be such a thing as reopening. 

And I -- I just want to focus on what 

Congress was doing in 1996, because I think it's very 

telling. We know that Congress was focused on enacting 

bars to judicial review, and we also know that Congress 

was codifying for the first time an alien's right to 

file one motion to reopen.

But Congress just didn't make any effort to 

make denials of motions to reopen judicially 

unreviewable, and that's very telling, because there’s 

any number of ways that Congress could have done that. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I didn't do the math fast 

enough in my head when you were answering Justice 

Kennedy's question, but is he correct that the effect of 

accepting your argument is about 2,000 additional 

appeals that -- that the Department of Justice will have 

to brief and the courts of appeals will have to decide? 

MS. SAHARSKY: You know, I -- I haven't done 

the math on that, either, and I think it requires the 

assumptions that I set out to Justice --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. On the assumptions 

that you made, do you know what the -- the result is? 

MS. SAHARSKY: I -- I don't, because we 

haven't calculated the number of motions throughout, and 

we only have total numbers in the courts of appeals. 

But let me say, if you are concerned about 

the burden on the courts of appeals, every court but the 

Seventh Circuit that has considered the issue has found 

that the provision at issue doesn't bar judicial review. 

So I don't think that this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have any of those courts 

said that they don't have a workload problem?

addressed in footnote 18 in our reply brief, so I will 

just address it briefly here -- but if you have follow­

up questions -- which is: If you look at the statutory 

language, it says that an alien may file one motion to 

reopen. It doesn't limit the Attorney General's 

authority to allow more than one motion to reopen in 

certain circumstances. And, in fact, it --

strictly limits Federal court jurisdiction to review the 

discretionary decisions of immigration officials. In 

fact, as this Court has explained, the theme of the 

legislation was to protect the Attorney General's 

discretion from the courts. 

Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) is central to that 

theme. 

Before I discuss the language and meaning of 

the section, I want to make one point very clear. The 

section does not preclude judicial review of legal and 

constitutional claims. Both of those are expressly 

preserved by section 1252(a)(2)(D). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that provision came 

after the original jurisdiction stripping, a number of 

years after. So why should we look to that to inform 

what Congress intended at an earlier time with respect 

to judicial review --

MS. LEITER: Well, I have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or the scope of it or 

MS. LEITER: I have two answers to that, 

Your Honor. The first is, to the extent that the Court 

is concerned now about taking away judicial review of 

the really sort of important central motions to reopen

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re talking about us

be looking to that to define what Congress intended 

then, when it --

MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- stripped jurisdiction 

earlier or granted it? 

MS. LEITER: I believe this Court always 

would have understood and Congress understood that its 

jurisdiction strip would have had an exception for 

constitutional claims even as of 1996. 

In 1988, this Court issued Webster v. Doe, 

finding that section 701(a)(2), which is quite parallel 

to this provision, recognizes certain claims as 

committed to agency discretion by law. Congress --

excuse me -- this Court in 1988 recognized that 

provision as requiring a constitutional exception. And 

I think Congress, acting in 1996, would have recognized 

that the same -- very similar language in section 

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would also have a constitutional 

exception. 

I agree with you that there would not have

been a legal exception but for the enactment of 

1252(a)(2)(D). 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, couldn't we look 

at the fact that when Congress was considering whether 

to put back into the jurisdiction-stripping statute an 

exception for constitutional claims, it then knew, 

because the courts of appeals except for the Seventh, 

who just recently did it, were routinely taking 

jurisdiction over motions to reopen? 

Don't you think that was the time for them 

to tell us: Hey, you guys got it wrong; we are going to 

make motions to reopen statutorily discretionary, so if 

there’s any doubt about this, let's clear up what our 

intent is. 

MS. LEITER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

certainly had Congress done that, we wouldn't be here. 

However, it is not true that the courts of appeals as of 

that date had been uniform in their view that section 

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not extend to regulations. 

None had extended it to motions to reopen, 

but in CDI Services v. Reno in 2002, the Sixth Circuit 

recognized section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extending to 

regulations. That was in the context of a -- a petition 

for a visa extension. And Onyinkwa v. Ashcroft in 2004, 

the -- excuse me -- Eighth Circuit similarly recognized

that. And then in Yerkovich v. Ashcroft in the same 

year, the Eighth -- excuse me -- the Tenth Circuit also 

recognized 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as extended to regulations. 

So the confusion plainly existed as of the 

date of the REAL ID Act. And I think the burden was on 

Congress, frankly, in that position, actually to clarify 

the reverse. If Congress wanted to make clear at that 

point --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute, you’re --

you’re arguing from a real negative, because some courts 

had said that other statutes were covered by the 

jurisdictional bar. You’re arguing that they knew 

that no court had held that motions to reopen -- that 

there was no jurisdiction for motions to reopen, that 

somehow it should have --

MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, it is 

the same statute at section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). And they 

were holding exactly what the Seventh Circuit held and 

what we argue here, which is that section 

1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) extends two things specified as 

discretionary in regulations issued under the Act. 

They had not yet considered the issue with 

respect to motions to reopen, but with respect to other 

issues specified as discretionary in regulations, they 

held that the -- that the Act clearly extended to those

appears to be because the circuits, even the Sixth, 

Eighth, and Tenth, were persuaded by the existence of 

the consolidation provision, section 1252(b)(6), but 

motions to reopen should for some reason be treated 

differently than other things specified as discretionary 

in regulations. But their --

1252(b)(6), the consolidation provision. 

But as I explained earlier --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has any of them, since 

switching to -- or since holding this with respect to 

motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to 

other discretionary judgments? 

MS. LEITER: Not that I have found, Your 

Honor, but nor have they repudiated it. I haven't found 

a situation in which, after considering motions to 

reopen, they went back again to consider visa 

extensions, for example. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about 

what’s “specified” under subchapter 2. I think that's 

an important word, in addition to "under." And motions 

to reopen are specified, and it doesn't say 

“discretion.” It just says there shall be a motion to 

reopen.

Do you get any mileage from that, or you 

seem to rest your argument instead on the regulations? 

And I think that's almost a weaker argument. 

MS. LEITER: Frankly, Your Honor, I do not 

think that specification of discretion -- with the 

exception of the battered spouse's provision that you --

that you raised earlier, I do not think the 

specification of discretion with respect to other 

aspects of motions to reopen is sufficiently clear in 

the statute to convey discretion. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you consider --

you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where 

motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent 

regulation? That would seem very odd to me. 

MS. LEITER: No, Your Honor. I think when 

Congress referred to a specification of discretion in 

section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), they intended, effectively, 

to provide a notice requirement. There are many things 

that the Attorney General did under the Immigration Acts 

prior to the enactment of IIRIRA, after the enactment of 

IIRIRA, that were understood to be discretionary. 

What the statute calls for is a different 

category of discretionary decisions: Those things that 

are specified as discretionary to be unreviewable; other 

things that have long been understood to be

discretionary remain reviewable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to say anything 

about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I 

have had? This is -- it’s -- my thought is that both 

sides are arguing: We just look to see if it's 

discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and 

we draw the line on reviewability there. 

Now, what we're talking about is a big set 

of cases, including frauds and various things where 

there is some discretion substantively to let the person 

stay. Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says 

if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review. But if 

it's asylum, we want review. Isn't that how it works, 

basically -- basically? 

MS. LEITER: Basically. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Fine. I'm saying 

instead of looking to see whether it's a rehearing 

or procedural or reopening matter, period, you look 

to see whether it has to do with the basic category. 

If it's something that Congress doesn't want courts 

to meddle in, that carries over to reopening, which 

is the same thing; it carries over to rehearing 

petitions -- they’re all about the same thing. And if 

it's something that Congress did want courts to meddle 

in, like asylum, it carries over to reopening, and it

carries over to rehearing petitions and other such

So Congress has one simple judgment: We 

want courts to meddle in these affairs substantively or 

we don't. And our job would be to say, right, if that's 

what you want, unless it’s unconstitutional, that's what 

we give you. 

Do you see the way -- I'm just drawing the 

line vertically instead of horizontally. But I agree, 

nobody has. Now, to me that makes sense, but apparently 

to no one else. So I would like to be talked out. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, I 

think that "no one" includes Congress. I think that 

that -- that that line --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't leave anyone out. 

No one is universal. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. LEITER: That line might have made sense 

had Congress drawn it, but Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know they didn't? 

I mean, there’s such a thing in the law called -- what 

we think of often -- they often use the word "ancillary" 

to describe it. And when Congress passes a thing that 

has to do with X, you often interpret a statute to carry

with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing 

that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a 

separate sentence because you can't think of everything 

that describes every matter ancillary to X. That's 

normal in law. 

MS. LEITER: The words Congress used here, 

though, are those decisions specified as discretionary 

kind or --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and we would say those 

decisions specified includes those decisions that are 

totally wrapped up in the same thing. So that if a 

person tries to escape this by simply making his main 

argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it, 

because it's really the same thing. 

MS. LEITER: I agree, Your Honor, that that 

category of things is unreviewable. What I'm struggling 

with is that the regulation at issue here, regulation 

1003.2, specifies in no uncertain terms that motions to 

reopen are discretionary, and therefore, if "specified 

under" extends to regulations, there is no way in my 

view not to extend --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? This is not 

a matter that is the subject of the special provision. 

A reopening petition is the same kind of thing, 

identical to the initial petition, and so something that

I see the point, no point going further. 

MS. LEITER: With respect, Your Honor, I 

think the language Congress used was clear here and 

extends clearly to decisions -- decisions specified as 

discretionary under the subchapter. Congress could 

easily have said decisions specified as discretionary in 

the subchapter, but it did not. And the paragraphs --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any rhyme or 

reason why some universe of things that could be 

reviewed in court, Congress put some of the them in the 

statute and left others out? 

MS. LEITER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

description of something as discretionary has 

consequences for the Attorney General, for the 

administrative process. It has only the ancillary 

consequence of stripping the courts of jurisdiction. So 

court -- excuse me -- the Attorney General needs to 

determine a rule of evidence for motions before it, 

needs to determine rules of procedure, needs to 

determine a rule of decision, and so there are -- there 

are categories of matters where I could imagine Congress 

saying to itself: The rule of decision here is really

not something with which we need to concern ourselves. 

It is up to the Attorney General to decide whether this 

is a discretionary decision or whether this is instead a 

decision that he or she would like to -- to constrain in 

some way by having certain specific rules of decision to 

go by. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's -- the 

question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA 

exercises discretion. In all of these, the Attorney 

General exercises discretion. The question is immunity 

from court review, and ordinarily that's done by 

statute. And I do not know of another instance, perhaps 

you do, where the decision whether a matter that the 

agency rules on will be exempt from judicial review is 

made by the agency itself -- the very agency that makes 

the decision, rather than by the legislature. 

MS. LEITER: I will answer your question 

first. I can imagine Congress believing that there are 

categories of decisions where even the rules of decision 

are best left to the agency to determine. And in that 

category, Congress leaves it open to the agency to 

decide whether to specify those matters as discretionary 

or instead to specify more constraining rules of 

decision.

examples --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and I'm not 

questioning the discretion. The Attorney General can 

be given discretion to rule on the matter, but the 

question is: Does that mean that the exercise of 

discretion will be immune from judicial review? 

Congress might well say: Agency, you decide what’s 

within your discretion. But not say: And, Agency, we 

delegate to you, too, the matter whether the court will 

-- will review your exercise of discretion. 

MS. LEITER: Right. Two things, Your Honor. 

First, the jurisdictional consequence of the 

discretionary specification here attached after the 

Attorney General applied the label. So here this is not 

a situation in which the Attorney General was making a 

determination as to what things should be reviewable. 

The Attorney General was making a -- a decision as to 

what rule of decision to apply in motions to reopen, and 

Congress later attached the jurisdictional significance. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if your 

interpretation of "under" is right. 

MS. LEITER: Well, Congress acted later and 

may, if our interpretation is correct, have attached the 

jurisdictional significance at that point, yes.

examples of situations in which an agency is left to 

make a determination that has jurisdictional 

consequences, I have a few examples. The first is the 

Communications Act of 1934. This Court recognized in 

Global Crossing that the agency there could determine 

that a -- that conduct under the Act was unreasonable. 

That is an administrative determination under one 

section of the Act. It has the consequence under 

another section of the Act of creating a cause of action 

for individuals to recover in damages. 

A second example is actually section 

701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act which 

refers to categories of decisions that are committed to 

agency discretion by law. Courts have understood that 

that is not the broad subset of discretionary decisions 

but instead that subcategory of discretionary decisions 

for which there is no law to apply, and many courts 

recognize that the agencies may create the law to apply 

in those circumstances. 

So an agency may enact a regulation that 

binds the agency's own discretion and renders the issue 

reviewable where it would not otherwise have been. So 

there --

special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that

we are considering, if it were just under the APA, that 

a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency 

discretion under 702? Because it seems to me that, you 

know, there are sources we could look to, to see whether 

or not it's rationally exercised. 

MS. LEITER: I do not, Your Honor. I 

believe there is law to apply in this circumstance, 

particularly after enactment of IIRIRA. Congress now 

has provided guidelines for when some motions to reopen 

should be granted, the timeliness of motions to reopen, 

et cetera. So I do not think this is the broad 

category of -- or sorry -- the narrow category of things 

that are committed to agency discretion by law. I was 

using the example solely to show that there are other 

circumstances in which an agency action has the 

consequence of restoring --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I actually think it 

helps you because -- there is -- there is something to 

review, the agency does have discretion. But this 

statute strips it, because it provides for motions to 

reopen, specifically. But, of course, you --

(ii), and (iv) -- refers clearly to things provided in 

subsection (e) of the statute; whereas, Romanette (iii)

refers to the application of such section to individual 

aliens including the determination made under section 

1225(b)(1)(B) of this title. That is a determination by 

immigration officials at the border as to whether an 

individual who is otherwise inadmissible may have 

grounds to be detained and allowed to go through asylum 

proceedings. Clearly there, where Congress recognized 

that there was an administrative determination to be 

made, it used the preposition "under" to reach through 

the statute to the administrative determination. 

I also have three examples, Your Honor, of 

situations in chapter 8 in which Congress actually uses 

the phrase "specified under," the same phrase at issue 

here, to refer again through the statute to 

administrative determinations. These are not 

unfortunately in the briefs. 

8 U.S.C. 1227 -- excuse me. Let me start 

with 8 U.S.C. 1375a(a)(4) and (a)(6). This is a 

provision that calls for the preparation of a pamphlet 

on the legal rights of immigrant victims of domestic 

violence. Paragraph 1375a(a)(6) calls for the pamphlet 

to be distributed and made available, quote, "in the 

language as specified under paragraph (4)." Turning to 

paragraph (4) then, it clearly anticipates an 

administrative determination, because it says the

Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the 

Attorney General and the State Department shall 

determine at least 14 languages into which the pamphlet 

is translated. 

So that's an example of Congress using 

"specified under" to refer, yes, in the first instance 

to statutory language, as it does in our provision, 

specified under subchapter 2, but it is a situation in 

which the statutory language to which "specified under" 

refers clearly anticipates some exercise of 

administrative authority. 

Here, the exercise of administrative 

authority is the specification of languages. 

In our example, it is the specification of 

procedures for motions to reopen. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

before you finish -- if it is an appropriate time? 

What is your response to their argument they 

raise in the reply brief that this was specified under 

subchapter 1, rather than subchapter 2? 

MS. LEITER: Your Honor, subchapter 1 

includes the language that grants authority broadly to 

the Attorney General to issue regulations implementing 

the chapter, and the language implemented by the motions 

to reopen regulations exists in subchapter 2.

The motion to reopen regulations very 

clearly implements Section 1229(a), which is in 

subchapter 2. And a question asked earlier was where 

one would look to determine whether Regulation 1003.2 is 

a valid regulation, a reasonable interpretation of the 

statute, and for that, I believe one would have to look 

at the content of section 1229(a), which is in 

subchapter 2, so although --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the text refers 

not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says 

the authority for which is specified under this 

subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the 

authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1. 

MS. LEITER: Yes, Justice Scalia. I am 

certainly not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. You would have to say, 

no, Justice Scalia, if you want to win this. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. LEITER: Yes, the phrase includes the 

word the authority, Justice Scalia, but I don't think it 

can bear the weight that Petitioner and the government 

put on it. I believe that “authority” there references 

the authority that is clearly granted in section 1103 to 

implement the entire chapter. 

But what the section does is to indicate

where the specification of discretion must be located, 

and in this case, it must be located in either the 

statute or regulations issued under it, and to see 

that, I think the easiest illustration is to suppose 

that the statute read: No court shall have jurisdiction 

to review any decision specified as discretionary --

excuse me -- decision, the authority for which is 

specified as discretionary in the subchapter or in 

regulations issued thereunder. 

If Congress had used belts and suspenders in 

that way and made itself doubly clear, there would be no 

question here that the word "authority" was somehow 

superfluous or misplaced. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any reason why 

Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain 

that courts can review asylum decisions, but Congress 

would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of 

an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if 

something new comes up that justifies asylum? 

For example, a new government comes and 

takes over a country, and now they are going to 

murder the person, and that couldn't be considered the 

first time because the old government was there, and 

they were just going to torture him, all right? So --

so there's something new here.

Now, why would any human being say, we want 

to get courts involved in the first decision, but we 

want to keep them out of the second decision? 

MS. LEITER: The -- the best answer I have, 

Justice Breyer, is that Congress wanted to cut off 

review at some point, and it was a question of numbers 

of bites at the apple. I understand your point, that --

that the second --

JUSTICE BREYER: Reopening is not a bite at 

the apple. Reopening is a new thing; at least, by and 

large, and supposed to be -- a change. 

MS. LEITER: And that may have been part of 

Congress's concern, that, of course, by and large, it is 

supposed to be, but it may not always be used in that 

way, and, at some point, Congress wanted to draw the 

line. And I note here that Congress did not -- I mean, 

what Congress did here was to set up a regime under 

which things that are specified as discretionary are 

unreviewable. 

But there is some room here for the Attorney 

General to remove the specification of discretion if 

that system is unworkable --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, if your 

interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer 

just described, the government's interpretation produces

the opposite anomaly. Right? 

MS. LEITER: Certainly, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, and that's why I 

ended up with this unusual --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose it's a 

large question, if you are talking about, presumably, 

the unusual cases in which the motion to reopen is -- is 

justified, that you are talking about 2,000 or 

3,000 cases, and the question is whether or not those 

are -- should be reviewed in the executive branch or 

should be reviewed in the judicial branch. 

MS. LEITER: Well, the math that we were 

given earlier, I believe, does come out to about 2,000 

appeals per year, but I remind the Court that section 

1252(a)(2)(D) preserves those that raise questions of 

law or constitutional questions for review. 

So this is a far narrower -- I assume, 

although I do not have the numbers, but I assume a far 

narrower subset of those decisions that would be 

rendered unreviewable here, only those for which a 

discretionary factual determination has been made by the 

agency.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have other 

examples where -- “under” is commonly used -- statute 

and regulations thereunder -- but in the appendix that 

you have given us, it says, "under regulations." 

“Under” is always coupled with “regulations,” and you 

want us to transpose that to a statute that

MS. LEITER: Justice Ginsburg, we included 

the appendix to illustrate how Congress uses the 

preposition “under,” when it is talking about 

regulations, so we specifically looked for examples 

where Congress was talking already about regulations, 

and the 

preposition that accompanies that is always “under.”

them. What are the other two? 

(Laughter.) 

MS. LEITER: Thank you, Justice Scalia. The 

other two are section 1227(a)(1)(H), which refers to 

1182(a)(5)(A). 1227(a)(1)(H) -- both in Chapter 8 --

refers to grounds of inadmissibility -- excuse me --

specified under paragraph (5)(A) of section 1182(a). 

Turning to paragraph (5)(A) of section 

1182(a), that calls for the Labor Department to 

determine whether the United States needs immigrant 

laborers in a particular category. 

So, again, it's a use of the phrase 

"specified under" to refer to statutory language, but 

through the statutory language to what is clearly an 

anticipated exercise of administrative discretion. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: 1227(a)(1)(H). What’s the 

third one? And then I am going to ask you what the 

first one was because I forgot it. 

MS. LEITER: Okay. The third one is 

section -- again, chapter 8, section 1537(b)(1) and 

(b)(2). (B)(1) says that, after judicial review 

affirming a removal order, the Attorney General, quote, 

"shall remove the alien to a country specified under 

paragraph 2." 

And then, in paragraph 2, the statute says

that the alien may choose the country, but that the 

Attorney General has authority to review the alien's 

choice of country, and if the alien refuses to choose a 

country, the Attorney General has authority to 

specify the country. 

The first --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. What was the first 

one? Just -- just give me the -- the cite for the first 

one. I didn't write it down. I should have. 

MS. LEITER: 1375(a) -- (a)(4) and (a)(6).

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICK M. SCHOENFIELD 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Section 1252(b)(6) 

mandates that review of the underlying decision should 

be consolidated with review of a motion to reopen. I 

think that tells us several things. 

The first and foremost of which is Congress 

intended there to be review of motions to reopen -- at 

least some motions to reopen. To try to go back to

Justice Breyer's questions, I think one can extrapolate 

from the consolidation provision that, if it is 

impossible to consolidate because there is no review of 

the underlying decision, you do not get to have a review 

of those motions to reopen. 

And that is referenced, I believe, in the 

government's brief, at footnote 15 -- excuse me -- with 

some cases cited, where courts have so held. 

We did not focus on that because that is not 

Mr. Kucana's issue. As the Court has alluded to, 

Mr. Kucana's issue is the nature of asylum based upon 

changed country conditions, and those situations are 

where it may be a matter of life and death, certainly, 

also a matter of -- of liberty, to be able to bring 

forward new evidence, which did not exist before, about 

changed country conditions, and it is not two bites at 

the apple. It's the first bite at current conditions, 

which is essential. 

With regard to the case of Webster v. Doe, 

that my colleague cited orally, that was an extremely 

unusual case in which the Court essentially said that it 

could not -- it did not have any criteria to evaluate 

the discretion used by the director of the CIA. 

That is certainly not the situation we have 

here, where we are dealing with motions to reopen, which

are analogous to rule 60(b) and which are routinely 

reviewed on abuse-of-discretion standard. 

Additionally, let me note that, if you were 

to determine that the statutory language “specified 

under” is ambiguous that the applicable canons both 

point us to favoring judicial review -- favoring 

judicial review and not essentially allowing the 

Executive to pass a regulation which insulates itself 

from judicial review. 

That would be both the clear statement 

requirement as well as the principle laid down by this 

Court that, in an ambiguous situation dealing with 

deportation, ambiguities are to be construed in favor of 

the alien. 

If there are no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. SCHOENFIELD: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Leiter, you have 

briefed and argued this case in support of the judgment 

below, at the invitation of the Court, and have ably 

discharged that responsibility, for which we are 

grateful.
