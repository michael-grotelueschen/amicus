 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 10-945, Florence v. The Board 

of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington.

 Mr. Goldstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 We ask this Court to hold that a jail may 

strip search an arrestee in cases of reasonable 

suspicion. That is the rule that was applied throughout 

almost the entire country in the three decades after 

Bell v. Wolfish, without either administrative 

difficulty or any apparent increase in smuggling. We're 

here today, of course, because both the Burlington Jail 

and the Essex County Jail require every arrestee to 

stand 2 feet in front of a correctional officer and 

strip naked.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you apply the 

reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees? I thought 

you were making a distinction between felons and less 

serious offenders.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do apply it to all 

arrestees. The Respondents and the U.S. Bureau of 

Prisons do draw a line at major versus minor offenders. 

I think they do that because they think that people who 

commit more serious crimes might be inclined to greater 

criminality. But our rule is one of reasonable 

suspicion. Our question presented draws a line at minor 

offenders because this class definition is only people 

who were arrested for minor offenses.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the reasonable 

suspicion test more easily met if it's a felon detained 

for a serious felony?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is in the view of the 

courts that have considered this question, absolutely. 

In our view -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your -- in your view?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Yes, and, in fact -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you are going 

on a case-by-case basis based on the offense.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The category -- there is a 

categorical rule, and that is -- that was adopted by 

these Respondents, by the Bureau of Prisons, and four 

court of appeals, that says if you were arrested for a 

more serious offense, categorically there exists 

reasonable suspicion.

Our case-by-case rule, it's true, applies 

with respect to minor offenders. And, again, that's the 

class that was defined here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how would this work 

with respect to individuals who have been arrested for 

serious offenses? Let's say someone has been arrested 

for -- for assault. Say it's a case of domestic 

violence, assault. Would that be enough to justify a 

search?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think you will have to 

ask -- I know you want me to answer the question. Let 

me just be very clear. This is their rule. The 

Respondents draw the major/minor offense line. The 

Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. Now, 

in my view -­

JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand. You say 

that you don't want to draw that line; you want to apply 

it to -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to everybody, and I'm 

asking you whether the mere fact that someone has been 

arrested for a violent offense would in your judgment be 

sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If the jail made that 

judgment, we would think that a court would not overturn

that judgment. We think that illustrates that, by 

contrast to when someone is arrested for not paying a 

fine, that there is no justification whatsoever, because 

the logic of their own policy is that this is a person 

who's inclined to violence -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it -- I take it 

what we're trying to do is to protect the individual 

dignity of the detainee. But it seems to me that you 

risk compromising that individual dignity if you say we 

have reasonable suspicion as to you, but not as to you. 

You're just setting us up, and you're setting the 

detainee up for a classification that may be questioned 

at the time and will be seen as an affront based on the 

person's race, based on what he said or she said to the 

officers coming in.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so, it seems to me 

that your rule imperils individual dignity in a way that 

the blanket rule does not.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, a couple of points, 

Justice Kennedy. I think it's an incredibly important 

issue. They don't have a blanket rule. Remember, the 

Respondents apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They 

do strip everyone naked, but if they're going to look 

for contraband -- that is, look at the person's mouth,

look at their anus -- they apply a reasonable suspicion 

standard.

 Now, to your very serious concern that maybe 

we are inviting discrimination or at least an appearance 

of discrimination, remember that their rule is going to 

produce more of that problem than ours, because their 

rule is not that they have to strip search -- they have 

to strip search everyone for contraband, but their rule 

is they can. They can make a choice.

 This Court in the Fourth -- they say we -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure if it's 

their rule or our rule. Ultimately, it's going to be 

our rule.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, okay. Well, then -­

I hope that your rule is that there has to be a 

reasonable suspicion standard, which is the rule that 

was applied almost everywhere in the wake of 

Bell v. Wolfish, without -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: To do -- to do what?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

naked is different from a strip search.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what is permitted? 

There are various things. One is showering in the 

presence of officers?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Showering in the presence of 

officers is not something that requires reasonable 

suspicion. The courts have uniformly concluded that if 

you are just generally in an area in which you're being 

monitored by the officers, that's not a Fourth Amendment 

search that violates a reasonable expectation of 

privacy. This is different.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they can be 

inspected without their clothes; just nothing more than 

that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are two different 

scenarios. One is a common room where everyone is 

standing around, and for jail security purposes -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: A common?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: A common room, a common 

shower area. And, of course, for security purposes.

 This is different, Justice Ginsburg. You 

asked what's prohibited in the absence of reasonable 

suspicion. What's prohibited is standing 2 feet away 

from the person -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I want to know what's 

permitted.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, what is permitted is 

anything -- what is not subject to a reasonable 

suspicion standard is anything other than looking at -­

a close inspection of the person at arm's length. What 

the courts of appeals have uniformly recognized, in the 

lower Federal courts, what the literature recognizes and 

really what I think concerned this Court in the Safford 

case is that when you are standing so close to the 

person inspecting their genitals, looking directly at 

their most private parts of their bodies, that is a 

direct intrusion on their individual privacy -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Are you 

--are you suggesting three different levels? Stripping 

naked: It's okay to stand 5 feet away, but not 2?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that the 

courts have had to confront 5 feet versus 2 feet. What 

they have confronted is they acknowledge that jails are 

places that require security. And so, if you're just 

observing a shower room, that does not implicate a 

reasonable expectation of privacy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, are you 

-- are you taking the position that it's the purpose of 

the search -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, I'm taking -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that's at issue?

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's the closeness of 

it. There is not a problem, I think, with the question 

of 2, 3, 4, or 5 feet. These searches all occur in the 

same way, and that is the officer stands directly in 

front of you. The testimony here is 2 feet away. That 

seems to be the common -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unsure if it's okay 

to shower -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and have an officer 

watch you shower naked.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- the greater 

intrusion is that you're standing 2 as opposed to 5 feet 

away?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two versus 10 feet away or 

just generally observing the room. This is exactly -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's a 

line, that doesn't make much sense to me.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then let's go to the 

next line, which is -- that's one kind of search.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The second is I think 

what some have called a visual cavity search.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether you're going to 

have the individual open or expose private parts.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you make an argument 

that that's different than just a visual search?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You can. So, let me just 

say -- let me just try and close off my answer to the 

question of the 5 versus 10 feet and then turn 

immediately to this visual body cavity search.

 Remember, this is -- the Court will recall 

that this is a reprise of the argument in the Safford 

case, where the schools there argued that, well, there's 

an observation of these students in gym class, they 

shower together naked, they undress naked. And the 

Court said it's quite different when you're standing 

right there looking over the student. Now, as to -- and 

said that's what implicates a Fourth Amendment right of 

privacy, and the distinction did make sense.

 As to your question, yes, there is a 

material difference, we think, although we think both 

should be covered by our rule. But a visual body cavity 

inspection as occurred in the Essex facility here, where

you require someone to bend over and cough, which is 

what the testimony is in this case -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One, not the other?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.

 That -- the second jail had a slightly 

different search protocol, in which the testimony is 

that he was required to bend over and cough and expose 

his anus for inspection. And the Respondents themselves 

regard that as a more significant intrusion, and they 

apply a reasonable suspicion standard themselves to 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, what -- what 

you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some 

States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of 

what they have. But what you're asserting is that the 

Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and 

the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth 

Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard 

practice, to strip search people who were admitted to 

prisons. So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable 

invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the 

time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't believe that the 

premise is correct. If you read history differently 

than me, I'm not going to be able to persuade you. But

our understanding of the history is that the closest 

they can come to is two things: First, that people were 

strip searched upon arrest, and that's certainly not the 

rule under the Fourth Amendment; and that in certain 

jails at the time of the founding, other inmates in a 

process of ablution, what is almost kind of a ritual 

cleansing, would strip search new inmates. It had 

nothing to do with the jail officials themselves or 

trying to intercept contraband.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is somehow less of an 

intrusion -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just a -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- on your privacy, to be 

naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than 

one jail official inspecting?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, it wasn't a 

nearly -- the nearly uniform practice that I think your 

question assumes. And it's just a different kettle of 

fish entirely, that -- we don't believe, obviously, that 

that historical lesson obtains today, that the prisoners 

can strip search new inmates as they -- new arrestees as 

they come in.

 I do agree with the basic premise of your 

question that it's -- our position can't just be that, 

hey, I've got a reasonable rule. I do have to, in

either under the terms of Bell v. Wolfish or 

Turner v. Safley, establish that this is an exaggerated 

response, that this is much more, materially more than 

is necessary to accomplish their goals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But less intrusive than 

the one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved 

pretrial detainees?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Ginsburg, we 

disagree with that. At least as to the second search, 

we think that there is no difference between the degree 

of intrusion here and in Bell. But there is another 

significant reason that this -- not just in the nature 

of the search, but a big difference between this case 

and Bell is that the inmates in that case made a 

voluntary choice. They decided to have the contact 

visits that was -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if the 

pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry 

into the facility?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We do not. I tried 

everything I could to check the record of that case, and 

there was no record of an admission strip search at the 

MCC at the time.

and the visual body cavity search. You say that they 

apply reasonable suspicion standard to the visual body 

cavity search.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, is the visual 

cavity search therefore off the table?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it is not. We contend 

that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the visual body 

cavity search at the Essex facility. So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. But 

you would say that they had to have a reasonable 

articulable suspicion before they could do that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We say that under their 

written policy, they should have, but they didn't. The 

Burlington County -- the only evidence about a 

conclusion of the jail about reasonable suspicion is 

that the Burlington County intake officer filled out a 

form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. And 

Essex I don't believe contends that there was reasonable 

suspicion to engage in a visual body cavity search. 

They deny, as a matter of fact, that it happened.

distinction between what they actually do and the 

written policy.

Essex, after this search occurred -- and this is 

described in the Essex brief in opposition, in case you 

want to look at it later, at 3 in note 1. Essex, after 

the search in this case, changed its policy.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We were denied an injunction

a question of damages for the search that occurred at 

the time under their old policy.

prevention of the spread of lice and is observed while 

this is taking place from some distance by a corrections 

officer, let's say 10 feet away. Is that -- does that 

require reasonable suspicion?

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there -- could I just 

follow up on that? Is there a dispute of fact as to 

whether anything beyond that occurred in Burlington 

County?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In Burlington County, there 

is a dispute about the so-called genital lift, whether 

Mr. Florence was required to lift his genitals or not. 

There is no dispute that he was required directly in 

front of an officer to strip naked, despite the officer 

having made a finding, which is on page 390 of the joint 

appendix, that there was no reasonable suspicion to 

conduct a strip search. That is the only factual 

dispute -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- in the entire case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify two 

points for me? The first is, was he admitted into the 

general population at Burlington?

clear. What the record says is that for the first few 

days of his stay -- remember, he inexplicably was kept 

for 6 days. For the first several days, he was kept in 

a cell with only one other inmate, or possibly two, and 

one time he had lunch with other people. In Essex, he 

was admitted to the general population.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The prior charge against 

your client was the use -- involved the use of a deadly 

weapon. Assuming the prison knew this, wouldn't that 

provide the reasonable suspicion that you argue was 

missing?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, because it depends -­

because of the breadth of the phrase "possession of a 

deadly weapon," as this case illustrates. The record 

shows that the possession of the deadly weapon -- and 

that's why this charge was not pursued by the State -­

is -- was that he was pulled over at a traffic stop and 

he drove away. The deadly weapon is the car in this -­

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Sotomayor. The 

rap sheet does not contain that charge. What the rap 

sheet does show -- and we are perfectly fine with them 

looking at the rap sheet. The rap sheet -- and it's in 

the joint appendix. The rap sheet says that he had a 

single charge, he pleaded guilty, he got a term of 

probation. There is nothing about that the jail would 

have had any information suggesting that he had some 

charge involving a deadly weapon. And that's why they 

themselves certified that there was no reasonable 

suspicion.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the rap sheet 

always available immediately? I thought it was rather 

common -- correct me if I'm wrong -- just based on 

practice some years ago, that it -- it would take maybe 

24 hours, 48 hours for the wiretap -- for the wire 

services and the Internet to -- to report that he was 

wanted for questioning for some very, very serious crime 

in some other State.

 I mean, in my practice at least, county 

jails were much more dangerous than penitentiaries, 

because you don't know who these people are. You arrest 

them for traffic, and it may be some serial killer. You 

do not know.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. First, that is not 

the view of the jails in this case. Remember, they 

apply a reasonable suspicion standard. They did not 

find any concern in their own policies, neither does the 

Marshals Service, ICE, with this prospect of some prior 

offense.

 As to what the rule is and how common it is 

and whether this works in practice, the jail here did 

look him up in the New Jersey Criminal Justice 

Information System. That's in the record. They're 

required by New Jersey law to do that. It's a -- every 

single one of these jails has computer access to the 

NJ CJIS, and also to the NCIC; they just type in his 

identifying information.

 They were able to pull him up without any 

difficulty, and they have not complained that they 

didn't have enough information about him. They filled 

out a form saying there is no reasonable suspicion here. 

And remember, our rule only operates in a system, 

Justice Kennedy, in which the jail does have enough 

information. When -- our point is this: If the jail 

has the facts, as it did here, to affirmatively 

determine that there is no reasonable suspicion, which 

is what they decided about Mr. Florence, then it is an 

extraordinary intrusion on dignity and autonomy to strip

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- when they have no reason 

to do so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my 

understanding of the statistics -- and correct me if I'm 

wrong -- is that they get about 70 new people going 

through this process a day. Is there anything in the 

record about how much additional time it would require 

to look at each one, to look at their record, to 

determine which category they should fall into, to strip 

search or not, as opposed to having a blanket rule?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sure. There is because they 

do this already. They -- it is not an administrative 

problem. They apply our rule today. Remember, 

Mr. Chief Justice, when he arrived at the Burlington 

County Jail, they did an assessment of him and 

determined that there was no reasonable suspicion. The 

jails in this case did pull up his prior criminal 

history, and they have no problem doing that. They 

apply our standard today. It is not a difficult one.

visit and the same kind of close examination that you 

object to here. Now, your explanation why that is okay 

is that that is voluntary.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I have two explanations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That you don't have to have 

visitors. Can you really condition your -- your having 

visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Block establishes that 

you have no right whatsoever to have contact visits. 

So, under Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, of course, you can 

say I voluntarily relinquish my Fourth Amendment right 

in exchange for this privilege.

 But I have a second -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure about 

that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can -- you can 

condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver 

of constitutional privileges?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I believe that 

that's -- I think that's a fair statement of the law.

 I do have a second point, though, and that 

is that the principal reason underlying 

Bell v. Wolfish's holding that those searches were 

reasonable is that it was essential to deter smuggling,

and that deterrence rationale has much more of an 

attenuated relationship to this case.

 Remember that the inmate in that case was 

having a planned meeting with someone, and the 

representation of the government is that our problem is 

if you plan to have somebody come visit you and you're 

going to have a contact visit, you can plan for them to 

try and sneak something to you. This Court has set -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Goldstein, there, of 

course, were guards there who were watching the visits. 

And, as I understand that case, there was really no 

empirical evidence that smuggling came about as a result 

of these visits.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, can I just read to you 

what the Court said about that? Just so -- the Court 

did have a slightly different take, I think. And this 

is from page 559 of the Court's opinion: "That there 

has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was 

discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the 

institution on his person may be more a testament to the 

effectiveness of the search technique as a deterrent 

than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmate 

to secrete and import such items when the opportunity 

arises."

 And our point is that that -- when you have

traffic stops and the like -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, which is it you're 

doing? I mean, I imagine -- I thought you were saying 

you always need reasonable suspicion. So, I imagine a 

case where the person is going to be arrested, put into 

the general prison population. There is a warrant out 

against him for second-degree murder, and the policeman 

stopping him for a traffic offense arrests him because 

he knows he is wanted on a warrant in another place. 

And the jail has a policy that says when you're -- come 

in here because of second-degree murder, we strip search 

you. Okay? Can they do that under your rule or not?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's all they know.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. That's reasonable 

suspicion.

what the category of things is that the jail in your 

opinion is going to have to look into the 

characteristics of this individual person, and when I 

look at the ABA, they talk about minor arrests.

great question for them, because that's their rule. 

They have a rule that says for minor offenders that you 

have to have reasonable suspicion to search for 

contraband.

state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking 

about what is their rule, and we're trying to find out 

what are the limits -­

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the rule, and I 

think you've already qualified what you said opening. 

Opening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for 

everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders. Now 

you seem to be saying, well, this case involves only 

minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that. That's 

what I thought you were saying now.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, that's right. Because 

this case only involves minor offenders, we have 

articulated a rule with respect to minor offenders.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: For three decades the rule 

that was articulated by the Federal courts and applied 

without difficulty is one that says for minor offenses. 

When that was applied in practice it was basically done 

at a felony versus misdemeanor line. The court accepted 

that if you are -- the courts accepted that if you are 

suspected of a more serious offense, then for 

administrative reasons and because we just think you 

might be engaged in more criminality, then you don't 

have to have any individualized inquiry whatsoever.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand that -- I 

can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why 

for the search to see that -- if the person has any 

fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other 

communicable disease before he's put into the general 

population? Are -- are felons more likely to have those 

than non-felons?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, they are not.

aspect -- what the testimony in this case establishes is

-- for head lice, prisoners for body lice. You don't 

need a doctor to do that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, that's right, but if 

that is right, what happens is that medical 

professionals are the people who are assigned that 

responsibility. That's the testimony in this case. The 

only last point that I wanted to make is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not 

constitutionally required.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I agree. That -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's another thing 

that -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for 

body lice, and that's -- that's okay?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If that's what they're 

doing, I think that that is okay. The courts have said 

that that is not itself a -- because of the prospect of 

handling that problem with shampoo, which is what these 

jails do, that that's not a sufficient -- a sufficient 

justification to require the person to strip naked.

 The only other point that I did want to make 

is that this is the rule, not just at Burlington and 

Essex, but also of the U.S. Marshals Service, which has 

the intake of 220,000 inmates every year, and also of 

the Bureau of Immigration Customs Enforcement, which 

intakes 384,000 a year.

an intake of minor offenders of only a few thousand 

people a year. For the Marshals Service and for ICE, 

which have a combined 600,000 people every year, they do 

not have that separate housing rule.

you or do you not have an objection to the superseding 

ECCF policy?

because they still have to stand naked directly in front 

of the correctional officer under the superseding 

policy. What the superseding policy is, which is 

Burlington's policy throughout this, is that they will 

not search the person for contraband, which is their 

supposed interest here, for contraband, in the absence 

of reasonable suspicion.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 I actually appreciate the clarification that 

your questions brought to this case, because I think 

there's a bit of confusion that I'd like to try to clear 

up, although my -- my colleague's movement in terms of 

answering some of the questions left me a little bit 

perplexed as to exactly what the nature of their claims 

are.

 The -- the first question that it seems to 

me the Court should focus on is what policy is at issue 

here. And, obviously, since the class certification 

deals with one set of issues and the plaintiff's claims 

deal with another set of issues, I think you have to be 

careful.

 I think you have to focus on the policies 

that existed in 2005. That was the basis on which he 

was in fact searched under these circumstances. And the 

policy in Burlington was that -- was primarily aimed, 

frankly, at health and tattoos, and the policy at Essex 

was aimed primarily at contraband and then secondarily 

at tattoos and health.

 And the policy at Burlington was largely 

a -- you come into prison, you give up your clothes,

they look through your clothes, you take a shower, they

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that's actually 

what they do in Essex. In Essex, they do it that way.

does have -- I mean, part of the problem is 

terminological, all right?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: You know, Burlington is 

basically a body visual observation, and the district 

court said that's unconstitutional, that just observing 

at all is unconstitutional.

 To some extent, it seems to me my -- my 

friend here has given up that part of the district 

court's decision, which -- then clearly the court of 

appeals, to the extent it reversed that part, ought to 

be affirmed on that ground alone.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Visual observation from 

more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?

didn't say 2 to 3 feet.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What happened? Do 

we know? Was the search within 2 feet or not within 2 

feet?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on whose 

version of it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We don't know.

 MR. PHILLIPS: You have to remember, the 

district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff 

in this case. So, you would have to -- you would have 

to interpret -- you'd have to give us the benefit of the 

interpretation, which was that it was more than 2 feet.

 But the court of appeals reversed, of 

course, without regard to that, because the court of 

appeals said, look, if you -- if you apply this Court's 

decision in Bell v. Wolfish, it doesn't matter, because 

you can engage in a much more intrusive true body cavity 

search, which frankly is more intrusive than even what 

Essex County asks -- has -- does in this case, because 

he wasn't asked to bend over and to -- and to have a 

body cavity anal search. What he was asked to do was to 

squat and cough, in the event that -- because ordinarily 

that will cause the contraband then to fall out, and you 

can -- and you can catch it under those circumstances.

 So, this is -- that's sort of the context in

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, if I could 

understand your position, you think that there's no 

reasonable suspicion even for that more intrusive body 

cavity search; is that right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's correct. That's my -­

that's the rule of law I'm asking for.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And does it matter to you 

whether the person is being introduced into the general 

prison population, or would you also say that if the 

person is not being introduced into the general prison 

population? Do you still think that there's no 

reasonable suspicion requirement?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I would say, from my 

perspective, I think even -- even if they weren't going 

to be admitted into the general prison population, 

because the risks remain too substantial. But the truth 

is I don't have to defend that argument, because both -­

both of these jails admit the -- their inmates into the

arrested? There have been some stories in the news 

recently about cities that have taken to arresting 

people for traffic citations. So, suppose someone is 

just arrested because they have a lot of tickets for 

being caught on speed cameras, let's say. That person 

can be subjected to the searches that you're describing?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Alito. I think 

the basic principle we're asking for is that deference 

to the jails and -- and to the administrators of the 

jails requires that this Court respect their judgment 

that you can't make a distinction based on that specific 

individual; that whether somebody is a minor offender or 

a major offender, one, is never all that clear in the 

first place, and, two, isn't a basis on which to 

distinguish the risks that it poses to the -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Try the ABA. The ABA is 

minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you 

have to have reasonable suspicion. Now, I've read 

through the briefs, and I can't find a lot of 

contrabanders that were caught in that category. In 

fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or 

less. So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to 

avoid reasonable suspicion in that category?

 MR. PHILLIPS: If -- if you look at the 

expert testimony that was before the court, in the

defendant -- this is at 348a of the joint appendix. It 

says "a greater presence of contraband amongst those 

individuals that have minor offenses." That's his -­

that's their expert's characterization, that minor 

offenders bring in more contraband than major offenders. 

Our experts said misdemeanants can be more dangerous and 

more likely to bring in contraband -­

different rules, and San Francisco came in with I think

looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody 

who really was in this minor offender category, who 

really was found to have contraband. So, what should I 

look at to show that my initial reaction from a quick 

reading is wrong.

a testament to the effectiveness of the deterrent.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why do we change the 

policy? In Bell, we found that the policy was 

successful. Even though there were searches, contraband 

still got in. So, virtually every circuit -- in 

practice, the Federal system -- have been following this 

reasonable suspicion for minor crimes, and they've been 

fairly successful. So, why do we change the 

constitutional rule to let them do more?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I understand 

contraband is serious, but most of the studies point to 

it not being on intake, but coming in through guards, 

coming in through contact visits.

Amendment issue.

 When you get beyond that point and start to 

begin the -- what Essex does, which is not a true anal 

cavity search but simply an anal-focused and 

genital-focused search, I think that is subject to the 

Turner v. Safley and/or the Bell v. Wolfish standard.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to 

Justice Alito's question? Isn't one of the factors that 

we look at under the Fourth Amendment reasonableness? 

And should we be thinking about the fact that many of 

these people who are now being arrested are being put 

into general populations or into jails, sometimes not 

just overnight but for longer periods of time, like this 

gentleman, for 6 days before he sees a magistrate? 

Should we be considering a rule that basically says your 

right to search someone depends on whether that 

individual has in fact been arrested for a crime that's 

going to lead to jail time or not, whether that person's 

been presented to a magistrate to see whether there is 

in fact probable cause for the arrest and detention of 

this individual? I mean, there is something unsettling 

about permitting the police to arrest people for things, 

like kids who are staying out after curfew with no 

other -- based on probably nothing else.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: The one significant 

difference between Bell and this case is that in Bell, 

there was a real opportunity for people to plan, to 

conspire together to bring in contraband. Here, you're 

talking about somebody who's arrested on the spot, 

there's no opportunity for planning, for conspiracy with

may I answer the question?

 The policy is aimed at all people, not just 

at Mr. Florence, and if you aim it at all people, there 

are people who self-report who've obviously got an 

opportunity to bring in contraband, and there are a lot 

of people who just get arrested and happen to have drugs 

or something on them and, rather than show those when 

they're being stopped for a speeding ticket, will likely 

stick it in their pocket or put it somewhere else.

please the Court:

 The searches at issue in Bell are very 

similar to the searches at issue in this case, and they 

should be upheld. I want to start with Justice Kagan's 

question. It is true that contact visits in Bell are 

different from a person coming into the -- to the jail 

for the first time in that there might be a greater 

opportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices 

pointed out, there was less of an opportunity to 

actually get contraband, the person coming in was going 

to be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed 

out, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he's 

being watched the entire time.

 The visit -- the contraband situation in 

this case at intake, the person does have an 

opportunity, even if they are not self-reporting, 

knowing that they're going to be arrested. Protesters, 

for example, who decide deliberately to get arrested. 

They might be stopped by the police, they see the squad 

car behind them. They might have a gun or contraband in 

their car and think, hey, I'm going to put that on my 

person; I just need to get it somewhere that's not going 

to be found during a pat-down search. And then 

potentially they have the contraband with them.

arrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population 

is not a quick one. The person typically goes, for 

example, to a metropolitan police department -- that's 

what happens here -- and the person would mix 

potentially there in a holding cell with other 

offenders.

 If this Court, for example, adopted a rule 

saying that minor offenders would not be searched in a 

way that other offenders would, I have no doubt that 

there are some offenders in those circumstances, all on 

the bus together to go to the general jail population, 

who would give the stuff to the minor offenders -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the Federal 

rule. And, by the way, the brief was really confusing. 

When what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that 

the BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees 

to be subject to visual body cavity inspections. And 

then it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an 

exception for the very category of arrestee that we're 

talking about here, that they are not subject to body 

cavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion 

that they're concealing contraband. That the

misdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if that was 

confusing. The Bureau of Prisons' policy is that a 

person will not be put in the general population, being 

allowed to mix with other offenders, unless he or she 

has undergone the strip search.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I want to know 

how people in this category are treated in the Federal 

system. And you -- you -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You reversed it. They -­

those people are not subject to this visual body cavity 

search.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Those people, when they go 

into the jail, would be asked whether they're willing to 

consent to this type of search. In most cases, they do 

consent. If they don't consent and there is not 

reasonable suspicion, then they are not placed in the 

general jail population; they are kept separate from the 

other offenders. So, it is the case, the rule that the 

Third Circuit identified, which is a blanket policy that 

anyone that's going to go into the general jail 

population and mix with everyone else has to be strip 

searched. That is the Federal Bureau of Prisons' 

policy. I should note that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure 

I missed something. You say when they go in they're 

asked: Will you consent to a more intrusive body cavity 

search and be put into the general population; or if you 

don't, you don't have to be searched and we put you in 

some place else. Who consents to that?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the general jail 

population has certain facilities, you know, computer 

facilities and others that you don't get when you're in 

a cell by yourselves. As a practical matter, this 

arises very, very infrequently in the Federal system. 

We're talking about fewer than 1 percent of offenders.

 And the question before the Court at this 

point really is you have before you a blanket policy 

saying we need to strip search everyone, and is that 

something that's unreasonable or irrational in the way 

that the Court has considered its normal deference to 

prison officials? And I just -- I would like to -­

general propositions that your side is advancing, but I

skimpy. I thought there would be a stronger showing 

than I -- than I found in the briefs.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there -- there are not 

empirical studies of this type of information. 

Typically it arises when there are incidents at a 

facility, and incident reports are written up. They're 

not published regularly. There's not some kind of 

laboratory study that you can do. The facilities have 

an incident that they try to deal with. Sometimes it 

makes the news. Those are some of the things that we 

reported. And I would hate for the Court to think that 

there is not evidence of people who've committed -­

minor offenders in the record bringing in very serious 

things into prisons and jails.

 I'd point you to footnote 15 in the 

Government's brief, which talks about people being 

arrested for traffic offenses and smuggling crack pipes 

in body cavities. I'd point the Court to both experts 

in this case cited by Mr. Phillips. I'd point the Court 

to the record in Bull, the San Francisco case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The issue has to be 

certainly some misdemeanor. Some people charged with 

misdemeanor crimes will try to smuggle things in. The 

issue is how many of them would not have been found on a 

reasonable suspicion standard? I think Justice Breyer

said, in the San Francisco study, it appears only one.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that that's a very 

hazardous thing for courts to do with 20/20 hindsight. 

You know, the Court could look back at individual 

offenders and might have information -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we don't have 20/20. 

We have how many years? Fifteen years since Bell -­

MS. SAHARSKY: What I -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where prisons have 

been applying the reasonable suspicion standard. And 

the most you can muster under that standard is one 

example of a case where someone has entered? At some 

point, empirical evidence has to mean something in terms 

of us judging the question of reasonableness.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I agree with you, but what 

I'm saying is that the individuals who are doing the 

searches at issue have very limited information about 

people. This is when you have people who are coming 

into the first -- the system for the first time. They 

have had the most contact with the outside world. You 

have the least amount of information about them. In the 

Federal system, you don't know -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- I do have a 

question about that today. I know that when -- it's bad 

to base your judgments on your own personal experiences.

When I was a prosecutor, it took sometimes days to get a 

rap sheet. I understand that that's no longer the case 

today, that they're virtually almost always accessible 

by computers today.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That may be true, but it's 

not the information that the people who do intake and 

are doing the searches have. They do not have that 

information at their fingertips in the Federal system. 

They have name, date of birth, and they have the offense 

that the person was charged with. They don't know 

anything else.

 And the question before the Court, if I may, 

is whether there are reasons for a blanket rule that 

this Court should defer to. And I would say there are 

several.

 First of all you cannot say that there are 

some minor offenders that don't pose a contraband risk. 

They are documented in the record. Second, you have 

individuals who are making very quick determinations. 

They're -- they have large numbers of people to -- to 

get through -- into the general prison population. They 

have very little time, and if they guess wrong, those 

mistakes can be deadly. Third, the rule needs to be -­

require everybody who is arrested to disrobe and shower 

under the observation of the corrections officer from a 

certain distance. Now the question would become: How 

many people who do that will still be able to smuggle in 

contraband?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, there would be 

contraband found in -- that would be in body cavities. 

And we have documented in this record and other records 

in our brief that there are folks who do that, and that 

contraband is not found until they do these squat and 

cough procedures.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's my -- that's my 

problem. I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of 

your evidence. I was just trying to throw it out -- or 

I understated it. San Francisco's point is really that 

30 to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people 

who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have 

been -- and there is just that footnote really which has 

a few examples. Definitely, they're there in this 

category. So, would it be helpful if you included in 

the excluded part people who are high on drugs? You 

see? So, we give you the high on drugs people. It's 

the drug offense, and those who are high on drugs and 

those -- I mean, is there a way of drawing this rule 

that we can even catch most of the people in footnote

MS. SAHARSKY: I think the fundamental 

question for the Court is who is supposed to be doing 

this line drawing. And you've said case after case 

after case that you're going to defer to the prison and 

jail officials who are seeing this stuff on the ground 

day to day.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's obvious that the 

simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for 

everybody.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the fact they do it 

for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for 

traffic violators or something might be consistent with 

little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some. 

That's why I keep looking for it.

 MS. SAHARSKY: There are many good reasons, 

though, to have a policy to do it for everyone. It is 

easily -- easy to administer when you have lots of 

people. It is done for the protection of people like 

Petitioner who don't want to be knifed in the shower -­

there's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the 

Federal policy? Before you said because there aren't

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. The Federal Government

the Third Circuit's holding, and that's what we're 

defending in this case. That's -- because when you have 

a rule that treats everyone the same, you don't have 

folks that are singled out. You don't have any security

I have three points to make: The first is 

that my friend from the United States says defer to the 

experts. But the point that the United States 

consistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders 

that go into the Federal system every year. I don't 

understand the claim that -- this only involves 1 

percent of Federal offenders.

 The Marshals Service and ICE admit 600,000 

offenders every year under our standard. They are not 

kept in separate housing. These are cited in our brief. 

Six hundred thousand people, is their expert judgment, 

are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when 

they're admitted to jail.

 The second point, about numbers, 

Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study, 

and that is the County of Orange case. The district 

judge there did an unbelievably detailed job going 

through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system 

and was able to identify only a single instance where 

contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable 

suspicion standard.

 There is also evidence in this case, and it 

is the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep 

pointing to. There's a memorandum from the Essex jail 

system. It's at page 70a to 71a of the joint appendix.

And it tells you two really relevant things. It says 

every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and 

that they only found 14 instances of contraband. And 

they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances 

out of 25,000 would not have been found under a 

reasonable suspicion standard. So, you have evidence in 

this record about this particular case.

 Third, a couple of points have been made 

about whether -- Justice Breyer, you asked whether 

someone who's high on drugs. The uniform rule -- and 

this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the 

American Correctional Association. What they say is 

that essentially almost anything will do. What will not 

amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor 

offender -- and we do have -- there are 700,000 people 

in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor 

offenses. This is -- this is a lot of people who are 

having a very significant intrusion on privacy.

 And the expert standard, the rule that was 

applied under Bell v. Wolfish, is that when you have 

people who come in on a minor offense -- they don't have 

any drug history. They are not high on drugs. There 

was no opportunity to hide a weapon. I'm not sure where 

they think the gun is going to be hidden that's not 

going to show up in the very close manual pat down that

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you're really 

arguing for a -- an individualized reasonable suspicion 

standard. I think you're arguing for a rule that draws 

distinctions based on categories that correspond only 

perhaps very roughly to reasonable suspicion.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first, there are real 

categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, 

like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug 

history. And then on top of that, if there's any 

individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that 

will do as well.

 We are not saying that categorically people 

will be excluded from being searched. We're saying that 

there are entire categories that will automatically be 

searchable. We're just saying don't throw the baby out 

with the bath water.

 When somebody is pulled over like Mr. 

Florence, and there's just -- it's laugh-out-loud funny 

to think he's smuggling in -- something into this jail; 

that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the 

direct, you know, 2 feet away, I'm going to look at your 

genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying 

we're going to oversee the showers.
