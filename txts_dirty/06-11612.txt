 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-11612, Gonzalez v. United 

States.

 Mr. Newton.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. NEWTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Petitioner was not present at the bench 

conference and did not have the assistance of an 

interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his 

attorney's consent to conduct jury selection. The 

record does not reflect the Petitioner personally 

consented or ever learned of his attorney's consent. 

Whether defense counsel CAN unilaterally waive a 

criminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at 

jury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious 

constitutional question. Applying the constitutional 

avoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering 

this question by interpreting the "Additional Duties" 

Clause of the Federal Magistrates Act to require 

defendant's explicit personal waiver of the right to an 

Article III judge at felony jury selection.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Newton, you're not 

claiming in this case that the defendant was any way 

disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the 

voir dire, are you?

 MR. NEWTON: I'm contending that the denial 

of his right to an Article III judge at felony jury 

selection violated his rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no 

objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate 

judge. There were no objections to any -- well, she 

didn't do the questioning. She allowed the lawyer to do 

the questioning.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, I think it was a 

combination, Your Honor. No, we're not making any 

allegation of discrete error during the jury selection 

process. We're contending that there should have been a 

personal waiver of the right to an Article III judge. 

The "Additional Duties" Clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This may not be a 

pertinent question, but where does the right to voir 

dire come from in the first place?

 MR. NEWTON: The Court has discussed the 

right to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital 

cases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the 

right to an impartial jury --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's derivative 

from other rights? In other words, it helps implement 

the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps 

guard against an equal protection violation, but it's 

not on its own a free-standing right.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I would say 

that the Court has said that, in a Federal case 

particularly, you have a right to an Article III, 

Section 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment 

right, and the Court has referred to this as an 

allocation of Federal judicial power in the people as 

well as in judges. So selecting the jury obviously is a 

-- has constitutional implications with respect to the 

structure of Article III as well as any personal right a 

defendant may have to -- to an impartial duty.

 The "Additional Duties" Clause is silent 

about the type of waiver or consent required and the 

silence is understandable.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where a defendant is 

waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's 

something that an ordinary person can probably readily 

understand. But how likely is it that an ordinary 

defendant is going to have any kind of independent 

opinion on the question of whether it's better for the 

voir dire to be presided over by a district judge as

opposed to a magistrate judge? Isn't the situation 

going to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that 

your client will simply turn to you and say, which do 

you think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends, 

that's what the client is going to do? Isn't that the 

realistic situation?

 MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I don't think 

that's necessarily true. I've had -- I represent people 

in trial court as well as on appeal, and I've had many 

clients who like district judges better than magistrates 

or magistrates better than district judges, depending on 

how they've encountered them in prior proceedings. So I 

don't think that's an assumption I would make.

 And, more importantly, other personal 

rights -- the right to a grand jury, a petty jury --

those are rights that a lot of defendants don't 

understand. I've had to explain to foreign clients what 

a jury is because they don't have juries in foreign 

countries.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a big 

difference between having a judge trial and a jury of 

one's peers. The difference between having a magistrate 

judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire 

doesn't have -- is not a question of the same dimension.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's hard to

put these rights in terms of relative importance. The 

Framers clearly believed Article III independence was 

essential to our separation of powers and to the rights 

of defendants. John Marshall -- the Court in Hatter 

quoted from former Chief Justice John Marshall saying 

that the rights -- the right to an independent judge is 

perhaps most important in a -- in a criminal case 

because the rights of the most powerful person, the 

prosecutor, versus --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're not talking 

about a trial. We're talking about the voir dire. And 

perhaps you could tell me one piece of information. In 

the Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always 

the judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed 

to me extraordinary. The magistrate said it was her 

practice to let the lawyers do it, right?

 MR. NEWTON: Well, certain judges in Federal 

court tend to give the lawyers a lot of leeway. Other 

ones -- other judges I've appeared before do it 

themselves. I think it depends. But ultimately it's 

the magistrate who is ruling on challenges for cause or 

ruling on what questions are appropriate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whose thumb is the 

magistrate under? Is he under the thumb of Article I or 

Article II or Article III?

MR. NEWTON: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who decides whether he 

stays on or she stays on as a magistrate?

 MR. NEWTON: Article III judges are the ones 

who select magistrate judges --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So we're really not talking 

here about giving away any Article III power. I mean, 

the magistrate is only subject to Article III.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the 

magistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the 

attributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts. 

The Court in Gomez unanimously thought that the 

magistrate's role at felony jury selection was not 

really that of an adjunct because there was no 

meaningful Article III review of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but the 

reason -- the reason presumably is that an Article III 

judge, which goes -- who goes through a much more 

substantial process of selection and confirmation is 

much more qualified. Now, if you want to make that 

argument, that's fine, but that's a quite different 

argument from saying that we're giving away Article III 

powers to magistrates, right? Magistrates are creatures 

of Article III.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, I think it's a twofold

argument. It's one that we presume that Article III 

judges who have gone through the Senate confirmation and 

presidential appointment process, that they are more 

qualified as a general rule. But it is also an Article 

III exercise of power because magistrate judges do not 

have those protections that Article III provides to 

life-tenured district judges. So it is -- it's both of 

those things.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you go back to I 

think it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the 

comparative significance of the waiver here. The 

paradigm examples of waivers that have to be personal 

are, you know, waivers of counsel, waivers of the right 

to put the State to trial. This question of waiving an 

Article III judge as opposed to an Article III appointed 

magistrate just does not seem to rise to the 

significance of -- of the -- of the -- of those other 

paradigm waivers and what is -- what is your response to 

that? You started to say that, you know, that the 

Framers said Article III judges are important because 

they -- they have independence and so on. But beyond 

that kind of high theoretical level, is there anything 

in practical terms that you think brings this kind of a 

waiver to the point of significance of, say, waiving 

counsel?

MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. There are 

basically three characteristics that I can discern in 

the Court's jurisprudence about other personal rights 

that must be personally waived by a defendant on the 

record. First of all, it obviously must be a 

fundamental right, and I think that the Court's 

decisions in Hatter and Gomez and the plurality opinion 

in Northern Pipeline, -- all those decisions I think 

establish that the right to an Article III judge at a 

critical stage of a criminal case is a fundamental 

right. But there's more than just that. That's 

necessary but not sufficient, because we have lots of 

fundamental rights that can be waived during the trial 

by the attorney.

 The other two characteristics are I think 

what distinguish this right and make it more like 

waiving counsel and waiving a petit jury and a grand 

jury and the right to go to trial at all. And besides 

being fundamental, the second characteristic is that 

this right concerns the players in the game as opposed 

to the rules of the game, the framework of the 

proceedings in the sense of the players. The right to a 

jury trial, the right to a grand jury, the right to 

counsel, those are rights that concern the players in 

the game, as opposed to, say, the confrontational --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I see what you're 

doing. You're constructing your argument so that we 

have structural protections. I can understand that 

argument, but Justice Souter's question points out just 

as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as 

a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post 

-- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are 

subject to waiver.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, if I can 

answer your question, but also the third characteristic. 

The third characteristic of this kind of right is 

timing, how it's waived. The Court in Barker v. Wingo 

said these personal rights are to be waived at a 

discrete point in time, as opposed to something during 

the heat of battle of the adversarial process. So --

and I would respectfully disagree that the right to an 

Article III judge, at least the right to have it without 

a personal waiver, is a fundamental right. This is 

something the Framers considered to be of utmost 

importance, and in Hatter the Court said the 

considerations that led the Framers to believe this was 

an extremely important right --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I was interested in 

your comment on trying cases, but to say that you have 

to sit down and explain to the -- to the defendant the

difference between the magistrate and an Article III and 

why you like this particular magistrate -- it's the 

attorney that does all the questioning, after all -- it 

seems to me is -- is a burden. It's not justified by 

the position that you're -- you're submitting to us.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Congress has 

made the judgment that this is such a fundamental right 

that it must be personally waived by a defendant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In practice, it's 

more a tactical decision than a theoretical one. I mean 

you can explain to your client the difference between 

Article III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more 

interested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so 

doesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you 

know, he runs a tight ship. This magistrate will let me 

raise all sorts of other things. I mean, it's like an 

objection at trial, in other words. It's going to be a 

tactical decision rather than a theoretical 

constitutional one.

 MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, the very same thing 

could be said of waiving a jury or a grand jury.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you get to 

that point, which case of ours holds that the right to a 

jury trial is a personal right that the defendant must 

waive rather than waive through counsel?

MR. NEWTON: Two cases Your Honor: Patton 

v. United States, 1932, and Adams ex rel. U.S. v. 

McCann, which reaffirmed, and the Court has cited those 

two cases repeatedly for the proposition that this is a 

right that must be personally waived. The fact that 

there is a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it was the holding 

in Patton?

 MR. NEWTON: Patton I suppose would have 

been --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it was dicta.

 MR. NEWTON: But it became enshrined in 

Adams, and it has been cited repeatedly for that 

proposition. The rule reflects it. The rule of 

criminal procedure reflects it. The fact that there is 

a strategic or a tactical aspect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what Adams stood 

for was that the defendant can himself waive the right 

to jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to 

do it on his own he can do it without counsel. It 

doesn't mean that if counsel does it without his 

objection at the time it's invalid.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's -- the 

language in Adams which quotes from Patton says it must 

be the express, intelligent consent of the defendant,

which has been widely interpreted as personal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that can be 

expressed through counsel. I mean, does -- you know, 

does your client consent to this? Yes.

 I mean it's quite a different question to 

say that he has to be the one who stands up in court and 

says it.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, my alternative position 

is, at the very least, the record needs to reflect that 

when counsel speaks, counsel is directly speaking with 

the approval of the client.

 In Peretz that was the situation. In Peretz 

the pretrial conference involved a waiver by the defense 

attorney in the presence of his client and then followed 

up by -- at the jury selection process the magistrate 

said: Mr. Attorney, do I have the consent of "your 

client"? And this was, again, in the presence of the 

defendant.

 That's in marked contrast to what we have in 

this case, which is all indications were going to be it 

was going to be Judge Kazen picking the jury, the 

Article III judge. And, then, all of a sudden, the 

magistrate judge appears and directs only the attorneys 

to come to the bench.

while back to the Gomez case. And if I remember that 

case correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the 

objection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to 

indicate whether the defense counsel had done that in 

consultation with the defendant. We don't have any idea 

what the defendant's wishes were, but it was the 

defendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that's distinguishable because when one is objecting to 

the violation of a right, that's different from 

acquiescing in a knowing and voluntary and intelligent 

waiver of the right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the lawyer's 

choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it 

was anything other than the strategic choice of the 

lawyer. And your position is that it must come from the 

client, and there's no indication that it did in the 

Gomez case.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, in Gomez it 

was an objection to a alleged violation of Article III, 

as opposed to a waiver of the right to an Article III 

judge. So it's -- it's the converse of what we have in 

this case.

 In this case, there was no showing on the 

record implicitly or explicitly that Mr. Gonzalez,

Petitioner in this case, waived or knowingly acquiesced 

in his attorney's waiver.

 I want to return, if I could, to -- to 

Congress's intent. In 18 U.S.C. Section 3401(b), 

Congress was crystal clear they believed in a 

misdemeanor case the waiver of a right to an Article III 

judge had to be personal and expressed by the Defendant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course, that 

was for the whole trial. This is for a very discrete 

aspect prior to trial.

 MR. NEWTON: In Peretz the Court equated an 

entire delegation of a misdemeanor trial to delegation 

of felony jury selection. They were comparable, the 

Court said. The dissent in that case, at least Justice 

Marshall's dissent, said it's more important. So we 

have at least eight members --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Peretz, also, if I 

understand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a 

failure to object. It seems to me that Peretz undercuts 

your argument.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, as I -- as I 

think I've explained in the brief, Peretz is full of 

many statements that are ambiguous. But everything in 

Peretz has --

ambiguous, but isn't it -- I've reread Peretz after many 

years getting ready for this argument, and it seems to 

me that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading 

the "waiver failure to object" phraseology as being 

equivalent.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Peretz has to 

be read in light of two things:

 One, it has to be read in light of the facts 

of that case where there was a failure to object after 

the attorney had personally -- or had stated his client 

personally considered it. Secondly, Peretz was decided 

before the Court in Olano distinguished between waivers 

and forfeitures. "Consent," even in the Fourth 

Amendment context, means at least knowing acquiescence. 

"Waiver" clearly means an intentional and knowing 

relinquishment of a right, and mere silence cannot be 

interpreted as -- a mere failure to object cannot be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, yes, but --

everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom? 

Certainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be 

waived by counsel.

 MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you can't simply say it 

requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that 

express and knowing waiver to the defendant.

Sure, it does, but who has to be "express," 

and who has to be "knowing"? That's the issue before us 

here.

 MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. I was 

responding to -- there is really -- the Government makes 

two arguments based on Peretz: One, that mere silence 

equals to a waiver or consent, and that's what I was 

responding to.

 The second argument -- Peretz did not deal 

with the issue of who is the one to consent, because in 

Peretz there was, practically speaking, personal 

consent. The Court reframed the questions presented in 

Peretz to assume consent. There is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except for one thing, 

and that is, if -- if it is sound to say that Peretz 

equated "waiver" with "failure to object," "failure to 

object" is a -- is a failure, if you will, of counsel, 

not of the defendant. Defendants don't get up and make 

objections; counsel do. And, therefore, it seems to me 

the implication of Peretz is that it would be a -- a 

decision of the lawyer that would count for 

constitutional purposes.

 MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I would think in 

certain cases, if it's a personal right and a defense 

lawyer stands up and says in the presence of his client,

my client consents, and the client doesn't object or 

respond that, I disagree, then it's fair perhaps to 

assume there's a sufficient showing of -- of personal 

waiver by the defendant.

 But, again, what we have in this case is 

just vastly different. We have nothing in the record --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point was you 

were saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as 

authority for the Government's position because the 

facts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that 

the -- the client had in fact consented, or that was the 

representation to the Court. And my point simply was 

that does not seem to have been the reasoning of the 

Court, because the reasoning of the Court in equating 

"waiver" with "failure to object" was a reasoning that 

in its reference to "failure to object" seemed to 

pinpoint the actions of the lawyer alone. Clients don't 

object; lawyers do. A failure to object, therefore, 

refers to, in effect, a failure by the lawyer, alone; 

and that would be the only significant datum for 

constitutional purposes. What is your response to that?

 MR. NEWTON: I disagree. I think that you 

have to read Peretz in light of the very special facts 

in that case, which involve two statements in the 

presence of the defendant: That the defense was not

objecting or was consenting; and, then, in particular, 

the defendant, himself, was giving consent.

 And I think you have to also look at the 

Court's repeated focus on the fact that Peretz himself 

gave consent in that case.

 There was no occasion to decide which --

which party, the lawyer or the defendant, was the one to 

properly waive in the Peretz case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there has to be 

a showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?

 MR. NEWTON: Under 18 U.S.C. Section 

3401(b), which I contend is the obvious analog for 

waiving in the felony context, yes, absolutely. I 

think, at the very least, to avoid a constitutional 

doubt, and that's -- also, I should say up front, all of 

these arguments that we are -- or points we're engaging 

in here simply show this is a serious constitutional 

question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So you think there has to be 

a colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of 

counsel's, this is the different, this is what a 

district judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is, 

do you understand the difference between the two?

 MR. NEWTON: It's going to obviously depend 

on the defendant because every case involving waiver

depends on the particular circumstances. But, at the 

very least, there needs to be a showing of a knowing, 

voluntary waiver of a right to an Article III judge.

 This is done every day in America.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's a different 

context, but -- it does not relate to the magistrate 

versus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer 

could stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding 

could do all the questioning and the lawyers would do 

none, without the -- without the express consent of his 

client?

 MR. NEWTON: In terms of the jury selection 

process?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the 

voir dire is peculiarly the -- an area in which the 

lawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and 

the client does not.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, I would think the lawyer 

could in that situation for the simple reason that you 

have already at that point established, presumably, an 

Article III judge is presiding or it has been validly 

waived.

 But picking the jury, the jury selection or, 

more properly, the jury exclusion, because it's really 

excluding jurors rather than picking them, that is a

qualitatively different thing than deciding whether 

there is a jury in the first place or whether an Article 

III judge should preside over the jury selection. So I 

would say the lawyer could do that, because that's more 

the heat of the battle, the adversarial process working, 

as opposed to a discrete point in time before it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think a 

jurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially 

careful about selecting the jury panel and then decided 

they would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary 

list, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire 

during the trial, just to have a preliminary screening 

of qualifications of the -- of the entire panel?

 MR. NEWTON: I think certain jurisdictions 

have done that before. I think there's been bargaining 

by prosecutors and defense counsel. That again occurs 

during the adversarial workings of the proceedings as 

opposed to the discrete point in time before.

 The -- Justice Alito asked about how this 

procedure would work. This has gone on every day in 

American courtrooms since 1979. Every day around 

America in courtrooms, Federal courtrooms, in magistrate 

judge cases over misdemeanors this kind of colloquy goes 

on. This is done every day. It's done in the very same 

courthouse that Mr. Gonzalez was tried in because they

regularly refer felony guilty pleas to magistrate 

judges.

 And in the brief I've cited a couple of 

cases reported in Westlaw where District Judge Kazen has 

accepted reports and recommendations where the 

magistrate judge said, I went over the right to Article 

III judge with the defendant personally, he executed a 

waiver, and this was done on the record.

 So, this is not some innovative proceeding. 

This has been done since 1979 when they amended Section 

3401(b). The legislative history to Section 3401(b) 

clearly shows that Congress believed the right to an 

Article III judge was a constitutional right that had to 

be personally waived by the defendant. That is further 

evidence this is a serious constitutional question. The 

Court should avoid answering that serious constitutional 

question because you can easily interpret the Federal 

Magistrate's Act, in particular the "Additional Duties" 

Clause, to allow for consensual delegation, which Gomez 

talked about and Peretz talked about, only if it's 

personal consent. So, this is not a leap of logic to 

think that Congress would have intended this in a felony 

case.

 Gomez held Congress never intended this, 

this was not something Congress intended, so the Court

is going to have to fill in a gap in terms of what kind 

of consent is appropriate. And Congress has clearly 

signaled they believe a defendant's personal express 

consent is the type that is required. At the very least 

there is a serious constitutional question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was there a right to 

voir dire at common law? I have the impression the 

judge would send somebody out and, you know, grab the 

first 12 people they could find.

 MR. NEWTON: I don't know, Your Honor. I 

don't know the answer to that question.

 If I could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I --

MR. NEWTON: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we supposed to go 

through every one of the rights that a defendant has in 

a trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the 

lawyer can make, this one the defendant must make 

personally?

 MR. NEWTON: No, Your Honor. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: One by one? I mean, I 

never thought that that was the approach we take.

 MR. NEWTON: I think the Court has already 

decided the vast majority of these. Taylor clearly 

referred to the confrontation or the Compulsory Process

Clause. There are numerous other cases in which the 

Court has said, at least implicitly, that it's waived by 

the lawyer's failure to object. But there are a special 

class of rights: The right to a jury trial, the right 

to a grand jury, the right to counsel, the right to 

plead not guilty.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to your 

structural argument, which makes a certain amount of 

sense just insofar as knowing where the line is.

 On the other hand, I'm just not sure of the 

practical significance of the client's participation 

when it's really the attorney who is making the decision 

whether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut 

his stuff in front of the jury for a little longer than 

the district judge would. I just don't see how the 

client can really have much informed input into that at 

all.

 MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the Framers 

clearly believed it was an extremely important right for 

defendants. Congress clearly believed this was a 

constitutional right defendants had to personally waive. 

The fact that the lawyer may be in a better position to 

make the judgment would be equally true in waiving a 

jury or a grand jury.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The decision whether to have a magistrate 

judge conduct voir dire is a strategic call that counsel 

is uniquely qualified to make. Counsel is best equipped 

to determine whether the magistrate judge's particular 

style, reputation or practice in addressing prospective 

jurors or resolving objections outweigh the independence 

conferred by Article III.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it might 

be said of the right to plead guilty as well. The 

lawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of 

sentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are 

of the jury returning a verdict of innocence. I mean, 

the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the 

judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.

 MS. BLATT: That's correct. And for the few 

fundamental decisions where the defendant must 

personally explicitly make, they have a monumental

impact on the defendant, and they protect values that 

extend beyond mere -- mere trial strategy.

 If a defendant is indicted for a criminal 

offense, he readily understands he's going to have to 

decide, do I want to plead guilty, do I want to stand 

trial, do I want counsel, do I want a jury. He does not 

readily appreciate that decisions that occurred during 

voir dire, such as whether to have an Article III judge 

or a magistrate, whether to exercise peremptory 

challenges, whether to challenge jurors for cause, 

whether to object to the prosecutor's actions. These 

are all decisions that are entrusted to counsel's best 

professional judgment and his fiduciary obligation to 

represent the defendant.

 The defendant -- I mean, the defense lawyer 

also speaks for the client in exercising the defendant's 

confrontation clause rights, introduce or object to 

evidence, to object to the closing of the courtroom. 

There's just a small handful of fundamental rights. And 

for the vast majority of criminal defendants, they don't 

even have Article III rights, Mr. Chief Justice; they're 

in State court.

 So it's an important right. It implicates 

important trial issues. But nonetheless, counsel is 

best equipped to make it. And I do think, unlike the

decision whether you're going to be convicted or stand 

trial or even testify, this is a decision where the 

defendant is overwhelmingly likely to defer to counsel's 

tactical and strategic judgment.

 In this case, I just wanted to point out one 

other thing about the magistrate. As Justice Ginsburg 

said, she not only let the lawyers pose their own 

questions to the jurors, she also gave the lawyers each 

an extra peremptory challenge. And that just shows that 

magistrate judges can have particular styles or 

practice, and counsel would be uniquely situated to 

assess the value of that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did she rule on strikes for 

cause?

 MS. BLATT: They were all by consensus, so 

yes, she ruled on them in that jurors were excused for 

various reasons. But there was -- it was pretty much by 

consensus by defense counsel and the prosecutor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- I mean, that 

is, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge 

who is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir 

dire has, to allow or not allow a strike --

MS. BLATT: Right, and defense counsel's 

going to have to weigh in any given case whether the 

magistrate judge is going to rule on any objections and

de novo review is possible, but it's difficult as a 

practical matter, as the court noted in Peretz. The 

defense counsel is best situated to decide, and I want 

to get the most favorable jury I can for my client, 

what's the best way to do that? Is this magistrate 

judge better off -- am I better off with which one?

 And defense counsel, if he has any concerns, 

can object to the magistrate's role and then would be 

entitled under the Federal Magistrate Act to have an 

Article III judge conduct voir dire.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- I know you 

don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the 

Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the 

client has to waive. Would we be better off just 

adopting the rule that there has to be express waiver, 

or would you then recommend that we ask the further 

question whether or not there was an implied consent?

 MS. BLATT: An implied consent in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he was there, he 

probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was 

going on.

 MS. BLATT: If an explicit personal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I, frankly, don't think we 

should go down that route.

 MS. BLATT: If a personal explicit waiver is

required, there wasn't one here. The express waiver was 

by defense counsel, so it would not meet that test of 

having -- I don't know what the implied waiver would be. 

There is an expressed waiver by defense counsel.

 If counsel just said nothing and there was 

no objection, which is not what is at issue in this 

case, then there would be a question on how do you read 

this Court's decision in Peretz.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask how it works in 

practice? Does the magistrate's ruling on objections to 

jurors, are those rulings subject to review by the 

district judge or are they final?

 MS. BLATT: Under this Court's decision in 

Peretz, there would be de novo review at the end of the 

process. And here an Article III judge actually swore 

in the jury but there was, nothing was ever objected to 

by the magistrate's role. There was no --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in practice, as I 

understand it, very often the judge will, will review 

the magistrate's decisions on contested objections.

 MS. BLATT: He can. Right. Yes. And if 

the Court said in Peretz that the Constitution would 

require that the review be de novo and they recognize in 

a footnote this Court that as a practical matter it 

might be difficult to reweigh credibility

determinations, and you have the same kind of issues 

when a magistrate judge conducts Social Security cases 

or suppression hearings, the magistrate rules on or 

weighs credibility and there is a de novo review by the 

Article III judge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that work? You 

have some jurors, and you have juror's excused for 

cause, and there is an argument about that, then that 

juror has to sit down and wait for two days and then 

they go back and they review that before the district 

judge. I just don't know mechanically how that can 

work.

 MS. BLATT: I don't know if it can be done 

that day. I mean, in this case, the jury selection was 

just a matter of a couple of hours.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, if the Article 

III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused 

for cause, then you go back and bump the juror.

 MS. BLATT: I think this discussion just 

shows why a defendant -- this would not be a right that 

he would readily appreciate and understand. This is 

something defense counsel would just decide. And is it 

-- in this particular trial, and this was a short drug 

trial, this voir dire occurred without incident and it 

was pretty routine. Is this something that if it were

different type of case defense counsel might think, no, 

I don't want whatever disruption it might be and we want 

an Article III judge. And defense counsel is of course 

able to object.

 I also wanted to point out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you 

think the right to a jury trial is something that has to 

be personally waived by the defendant or can that be 

waived through counsel?

 MS. BLATT: We read a discussion of it in 

Florida v. Nixon and New York v. Hill including that 

among the rights that required a personal explicit 

waiver. But if we're wrong about that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were those -- was 

the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?

 MS. BLATT: No, it was just a descriptive: 

There are decisions of such moment that the defendant 

must personally make and this is usually included in the 

list. But whatever -- whatever --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I was 

researching it, I saw that it was usually included in 

the list, but I thought it would track back to some case 

that held that it was, but it never -- never does.

defendant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's our list, after all, 

right?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. BLATT: It's a very short list, and I 

just think it's something that a defendant can readily 

appreciate, even though it may be a strategic call, 

whether or not he is going to plead guilty or even take 

the stand. I mean, the right to testify is a decision 

that personally belongs to the defendant, but you still 

don't need an on-the-record, explicit personal consent 

by the defendant personally. If the defense lawyer 

says, we have no witnesses, the client's assent is 

assumed and that's just the way our criminal justice 

system works. The lawyer does speak for the defendant 

in all but the very few exceptional cases.

Government prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's

power, we're going to tell the district -- the

a simple thing to do, put on the record that the 

defendant himself consented.

 That would be -- that would no longer be

think a -- there is nothing to stop them --

 MS. BLATT: I don't think so. I mean -- and 

that's why the Court took the case to resolve that 

circuit. And I read the decision as reading this 

Court's decision in Peretz to require it. Or at least 

there was some constitutional doubt about it but I don't 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They specifically said, 

we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under 

the Constitution. So my question was could a circuit 

still say, we think it's better for the defendant 

himself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be 

the rule?

 MS. BLATT: I mean, I don't think I have a 

fully developed answer on that, but my guess would be 

our position is no. But I don't -- I don't think 

there's at least anything to stop the particular 

magistrate judge in any given case from saying -- from

addressing the defendant or requiring it. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, suppose the 

question would come up. I mean, if the circuit does 

that the question would come up, if the magistrate 

doesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of 

course if it's objected to you deal with it then.

 MS. BLATT: Right. Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then we'd have 

to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether 

that's a basis for reversal.

 MS. BLATT: Right. And on that issue our 

position is clear: There is a rule that would dictate 

how it would be resolved and Rule 52(b) of the Federal 

Rule of Criminal Procedures has no exception, and plain 

error would apply. And so if there was some sort of 

error, the defendant would have to make the necessary 

showings for plain error review, and on that I would 

like to address, since we are on the subject, that if 

the Court disagreed with us on the merits, Rule 52(b) 

would apply and we think that all the concerns that 

animate a contemporaneous objection rule are at their 

peak when the defense counsel expressly agrees to the 

course of action followed by the court, and Petitioner's 

rule of automatic reversal would open the door to 

gamesmanship and sandbagging because it would allow

defense counsel to wait and see if the defendant is 

convicted before objecting to the magistrate's role.

 And before I get to -- I wanted to turn to, 

if you apply plain error, I just wanted to point one 

thing out about the Court's decision in Peretz. This 

was not something that was just not at issue in the 

case. The petitioner extensively argued that the waiver 

in that case was ineffective because it did not meet the 

requirements of Section 3401(b); there was no personal 

explicit waiver; the defendant did not understand what 

was happening, he didn't speak English well, and so on; 

and the dissenting justices picked up on that and urged 

the Court and dissented because there had -- one of the 

reasons there was not an explicit and personal waiver by 

the defendant. And the Court nonetheless upheld the 

magistrate's role in jury selection despite the absence 

of that waiver.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If Mr. Gonzalez had stood up 

at some point during the voir dire 0and said, Your 

Honor, I've just learned you're not an Article III 

judge, and I want an Article III judge to preside over 

the voir dire, what would happen?

 MS. BLATT: Well, our position is the 

magistrate judge could say sit down. This is if defense 

says my counsel is putting in some evidence I don't like

or my counsel is not cross examining the witness or my 

counsel just asked a juror a question that I'm really 

uncomfortable with. I mean, this show belongs to the 

lawyer, and the magistrate judge could tell him to -- to 

be quiet.

 The defendant has not made a -- and his time 

is not up yet -- in effect an assistance of counsel 

claim, but if he has an objection and he think his right 

rises to the level to testify, that he has some duty --

that the lawyer had some duty of personal consultation, 

then he can make that Sixth Amendment argument. We 

don't think it would have any merit because this is no 

different than the myriad other types of trial rights 

that belong to counsel.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the 

magistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and 

that is that rule is that the attorney can make the 

waiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I 

know you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to 

your client about it; I want you to explain what the 

rules are? Would that be overstepping?

 MS. BLATT: No. I think there is some room 

for that. I mean I -- some room for that for the court, 

but it's -- it's not like it's the right to testify. It 

would be hard to, you know, if there was some argument

over objection or how to question prospective jurors. 

There's not a hybrid defense team where the -- the judge 

is always supposed to turn to the defendant and say are 

you sure you're comfortable with what your counsel is 

doing?

 If the Court does conclude that there is 

error, the Petitioner, we don't think has made the 

necessary showing for plain error review. The first 

problem and the most fundamental is the error is not 

plain, because this Court has already upheld the role of 

the magistrate judge in jury selection in Peretz, 

despite the absence of a personal waiver; and at least 

four courts have read that decision to allow a 

magistrate judge to conduct voir dire, either when there 

is an absence of an objection or there is express 

consent by defense counsel.

 And even assuming this Court doesn't reach 

the question of whether the error had an effect on 

substantial rights, the error did not seriously affect 

the fairness, integrity or public confidence of criminal 

proceedings. The error -- the voir dire in this case 

occurred without incident or objection, as Justice 

Ginsburg pointed out, to anything that the magistrate 

judge did; and there is no indication -- and I don't 

think we have heard any -- there is no indication that

the defendant actually disagreed with his counsel's 

professional judgment to consent to have the magistrate 

judge, or even had an opinion on the subject. And 

Petitioner's rule would, as I said, open the door to 

gamesmanship because it would relieve counsel of any 

obligation to call an error to the court's attention and 

therefore give the court the opportunity to correct the 

error.

 If there are no questions, we would ask that 

the Fifth Circuit's decision be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Blatt.

 Mr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. NEWTON: Thank you, Your Honor.

 I'd like to return to Section 3401(b), which 

the plain language of, and the legislative history 

behind, clearly show a congressional intent in the --

context for personal waivers on the record by 

defendants. It would be anomalous not to require the 

same thing, at least in some similar form, in the felony 

context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I just -- a question 

that has troubled me. Basically, what you say that is

of such importance here is the composition of a jury. I 

mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to 

rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a 

magistrate or should it be an Article III judge. But 

if -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it 

needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal 

by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about 

-- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to 

permit a strike for cause. That affects the composition 

of the jury.

 Now do you need -- do you need the 

defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point, 

or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?

 MR. NEWTON: It would be enough if the 

lawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is 

the kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns 

the heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike 

a discreet point in time before.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see.

 MR. NEWTON: The other point I'm trying to 

make is that the -- it's not just the fact that it's a 

critical stage; it's a critical stage where there is a 

right to an Article III judge over the critical stage. 

The Court in Gomez clearly recognized that jury 

selection is a critical stage. So it is the Article III

right that implicates the right to a jury trial, but it 

is fundamentally the right to an Article III judge that 

is at issue.

 The Government makes much of its claim that 

there could be meaningful Article III de novo review of 

magistrate judge rulings. The court unanimously in 

Gomez stated that the Court highly doubted it would be 

possible to have such review, and it realistically 

speaking is not possible because delays between the time 

that the district judge can get back to conduct a 

review, and in Gomez the Court found -- pointed out that 

if you bring jurors back and question them again, you 

run the risk of making them hostile -- they think they 

did something wrong -- where you don't have that in an 

erratic situation where you're delegating an evidentiary 

hearing. Witnesses get recalled all the time. They 

know that's part of the process.

 So, realistically speaking, there is no de 

novo review, which is why it's not an adjunct situation 

here. It's not the magistrate judge acting as an 

adjunct; it's the magistrate judge acting as an Article 

III judge.

 The Government argues plain error doctrine 

should apply, Rule 52(b). Justice Scalia's concurring 

opinion in Freytag noted that there are different kinds

of rights that can be waived or forfeited, and most 

rights can be forfeited short of a waiver, but there are 

certain kinds of rights -- and we contend this is one of 

them -- that cannot be forfeited short of a valid 

waiver.

 The Court in Barker and in Boykin v. Alabama 

stated that there are certain personal rights where the 

prosecution has the entire responsibility to spread on 

the record the valid waiver. And if the prosecution 

doesn't meet that burden in the trial court, it's 

illogical to apply the burden on the defendant on appeal 

when it's the prosecution that would need to assure it 

was the defendant's personal waiver that happened in the 

trial court.

 The Court in Wynn and Glitton and other 

cases moreover has said, if it's a fundamental question 

of judicial administration, then it can be raised for 

the first time on appeal.

 I think the Court also should consider the 

facts of this case in deciding whether there was 

gamesmanship. There wasn't. Clearly there wasn't. 

Mr. Gonzalez was cut out of the equation entirely. The 

magistrate judge only invited the attorneys to the 

bench, left him sitting there without the assistance of 

an interpreter. You have to consider his personal

characteristics. He had no experience in the Federal 

criminal justice system. He did not speak English 

fluently. He was in no position to object. He didn't 

have the meaningful opportunity to object. And under 

Rule 51(b), there should be de novo for that reason as 

well.

 I finally I just -- I want to return to my 

main point, which is -- I'm not asking the Court to 

decide as a matter of constitutional law whether a 

personal waiver is required. I think there's a very 

strong argument based on the Court's precedent that 

should happen and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

sentence.

 MR. NEWTON: I'm asking the Court to avoid 

that question by interpreting the "Additional Duties" 

Clause, whether it's a supervisory authority matter or 

as a statutory construction matter, to basically model 

3401(b). Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
