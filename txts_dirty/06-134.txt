 [10:02 a.m.]

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-134, The Permanent Mission 

of India to the United Nations et al. vs. The City of 

New York.

 Mr. Howley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. HOWLEY: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court.

 These are tax enforcement lawsuits. If 

jurisdiction existed, the only issue a court would 

decide is whether a tax is owed. This type of case did 

not fall within any real property exception to sovereign 

immunity before Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act and Section 1605(a)(4) of that act did 

not create a new exception where none had otherwise 

existed. Congress chose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you could say the 

same thing if the mission here sold its property to 

someone and someone was claiming the right to possess 

the property by reason of the sale. And you could come 

up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the, 

the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.

MR. HOWLEY: Uh --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it would clearly come 

within the property right exception, wouldn't it? You 

-- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction 

that created the, the right in real property assuming 

the right in real property exists.

 MR. HOWLEY: Actually, Justice Scalia, I 

believe that if you had a dispute over what happened 

with the sale of property that it would fall within the 

based upon commercial activities exception in 

1605(a)(2).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that, let's 

assume that exception didn't exist.

 MR. HOWLEY: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you had nothing but the 

real estate exception. You would come in and say this 

ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but 

whether there was a proper contract or not. And I --

frankly we wouldn't accept that.

 MR. HOWLEY: No. And I think that's a very 

different case from what we have here because in that 

case the issue for the Court to decide is which of the 

parties has the right, has the title in the real 

property. That is not in issue here. The City of New 

York does not seek title in this property. Their action

is to declare the validity of a tax lien and the issue 

in an action to declare the validity of a tax lien is 

whether the tax is owed and whether it has been paid. 

That is the issue that's presented to the Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what New York is 

seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest 

in the land. It runs with the land, doesn't it?

 MR. HOWLEY: I -- I -- yes. I acknowledge 

that there are some similarities between a lien and a 

right in property. For example, that it runs with the 

land. But there are dissimilarities that are far more 

numerous and far more significant. Unlike rights and 

property a lien does not give the lien holder any right 

to own, access, possess, cross over, collect rents from, 

exclude or any other right in the property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't he force a sale of 

the property to collect the lien?

 MR. HOWLEY: This action does not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that this 

action does not because of the sovereign immunity. But 

-- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien 

is. In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a 

sale of the property so that he can get out the money 

represented by his lien?

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes. If the lien holder

commences an action to foreclose on the property, then a 

consequence of that could be the sale of the property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can he commence 

an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any 

ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the 

property?

 MR. HOWLEY: I do not dispute that a lien 

holder has an interest, a security interest in the 

property. But Congress did not write in Section 

1605(a)(4) all interests that are in issue in property. 

Congress in fact had the European Convention in front of 

it which said rights, interests and obligations in 

property. Congress chose language from the European 

Convention elsewhere but did not choose that language 

here. Congress said only rights in property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're distinguishing 

between rights in property and interests in property? I 

would think that every right in property is an interest 

in property and vice versa.

 MR. HOWLEY: No. I do not believe so, 

Justice Scalia. There -- there -- there has to be a 

reason why Congress chose language verbatim from the 

European Convention in other sections of the statute 

such as the counterclaim exception, but in this 

exception said we are not taking interest and

obligations from the European Convention, we are only 

saying rights. And this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The counterclaim sounds 

to me very much like it comes straight out of the 

Federal Rules, not out of any convention. It's the same 

transaction and occurrence, right?

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes. Yes. The, the 

counterclaim exception --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's exactly what 

it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory --

MR. HOWLEY: Yes, but Congress said, in the 

House report Congress refers to the European Convention 

as the source for the counterclaim exception in the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so Congress said we are 

taking this from the European Convention. This -- this 

language also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress didn't really say 

it. I mean the committee said it to be precise.

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes, that's absolutely correct, 

Justice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Good.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What was your distinction 

between a mortgage and a tax lien?

 MR. HOWLEY: I don't think there is a 

distinguished, a distinction between a mortgage and a

tax lien.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, so think they can't 

enforce mortgage under this? That is to say the bank 

can't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?

 MR. HOWLEY: No. But Congress, Congress 

passed another exception here, 1605(a)(2) that said 

actions based upon commercial activity provide an 

exception to sovereign immunity and these exceptions 

have to be read together. They have to be read --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's, that's where it's 

hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell 

the real estate. Ordinary secured interest in mortgage 

is secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an 

interest in property, I think. I mean is there, is 

there any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest 

in property?

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, actually there is. In 

the, in -- when the United States waived immunity from 

suit concerning real property it limited its waivers to 

liens and mortgages and not rights in property. And so 

there has been distinctions made between mortgage liens 

and liens on the one hand and rights in property on the 

other.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that point in 

some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New

York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that 

tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that 

they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as 

opposed to an attachment.

 Is it not true? And I don't, and I'm not 

talking just about order of priority for creditors. I'm 

talking about the superiority insofar as being or not 

being an interest in property.

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, yes. It is superior to 

other types of liens.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. HOWLEY: It is an interest, a security 

interest in the property, but it is not a right in the 

estate of the property, and it doesn't give any type of 

the possession and ownership rights that every other 

right in property gives.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there New York law to 

that effect?

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes, there is. And we have 

cited it in our brief. The Respondent has attempted to 

distinguish it, because a Court of Claims jurisdictional 

act was passed that deemed a lien an interest in 

property for purposes of jurisdiction in the New York 

Court of Claims but the essential nature of a lien is 

not, under New York law, a right in the estate.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I had -- I had 

thought that it is an estate in land in at least some 

jurisdictions. And Justice Breyer was asking about the 

same thing. In other words, there are liens -- there 

are liens and liens. There are different kinds of 

liens.

 MR. HOWLEY: There appears to be in 

different jurisdictions, different treatments of liens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that brings up 

the basic question I have, is this a question of State 

law or Federal law?

 MR. HOWLEY: This is a question of Federal 

law. This Court has held --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if you have 

different rules in different States, there is going to 

be one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. And this Court held in Saudi Arabia against 

Nelson and Argentina against Weltover that the exception 

language -- they are dealing with the commercial 

activities exception -- must have the meaning that 

Congress understood the restrictive theory of sovereign 

immunity to require at the time it passed the statute.

 And so when defining what a right in 

immovable property in issue means, we have to give that

the meaning that the restrictive theory of sovereign 

immunity required at the time in 1976. And in 1976, no 

court here in the United States or anywhere in the world 

had held that sovereign immunity was abrogated merely by 

having a statutory lien on the property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Had the State Department 

taken a position at that point, at the time the Act was 

passed?

 MR. HOWLEY: There is -- not to my 

knowledge. There is vague language in the testimony in 

the House report, general language about 1605(a)(4) 

relating to real property disputes, but there is not 

precise language about whether liens are or liens are 

not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nothing vague 

about the State Department's brief in the Englewood 

case.

 MR. HOWLEY: No, there is not, Justice 

Ginsburg. But they lost in Englewood. They lost and 

the Englewood Court relied on a D.C. Circuit decision. 

And I believe that the Solicitor General will say that 

they have reconsidered their position, they have 

reconsidered Article 29 of the European Convention, 

which they relied on heavily in the Englewood brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But anyway, at a time

closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department 

was taking the position that a lien was an interest in 

land.

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes, that is correct. But they 

have since decided that that position was wrong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they just may 

be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were 

to Libya.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not beyond the realm 

of the conceivable, is it?

 MR. HOWLEY: It's not beyond the realm of 

the conceivable.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I take it there has 

never been a case in the history of the world you'll 

tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned 

money to build an embassy has ever brought a case 

against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won 

under anything like this exception, because they can't 

sue them.

 MR. HOWLEY: Not that we're aware of, and 

not that we've seen --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ever. And there is none 

the other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes.

lend money to build embassies?

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, because once you lend 

money and you engage in commercial activity, if the 

claim is based upon the commercial activity, Congress 

had provided a separate section, 1605(a)(2) that 

protects the American citizen who has lent money to an 

embassy.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And how did it work before 

1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th 

century, embassies, if you know.

 MR. HOWLEY: I don't know about 19th century 

embassies. I do know that since the Tate letter, which 

predates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there has 

been a commercial activity exception here in the United 

States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't buying land that 

you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the 

residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying 

that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes 

on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, this Court held in Saudi 

Arabia against Nelson that it's not just engaged in, 

related to commercial activity, but the cause of action, 

the claim has to be based upon commercial activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the Indian embassy could

own real estate throughout New York City, which it 

wouldn't have to pay taxes on? Or if it didn't, nothing 

could be done about it?

 MR. HOWLEY: It depends on the use they put 

that property to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? No. You're saying, 

you're saying it's not a commercial activity. I mean --

MR. HOWLEY: The mere ownership of the land 

is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends upon the use, 

and the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy 

itself or the residence of the ambassador. I mean, they 

could use a piece of property for anything.

 MR. HOWLEY: As long as it's not commercial 

activity, it would not be taxed and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the buying and 

occupying of it is commercial activity.

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, the buying of it, if the 

claim is based upon the buying of the property, under 

Saudi Arabia against Nelson, then the commercial 

activities exception would apply. But the mere 

ownership of the property is not commercial activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it commercial 

activity for New York to say, we provide garbage 

services, electric services, et cetera.

MR. HOWLEY: Well, separate and apart from 

the jurisdictional issue, the Vienna Conventions do say 

that if there are fees for services provided, such as 

garbage collection, water, those types of services, then 

there is no immunity from the fees for those services. 

And those fees should be paid. The separate issue of 

whether that's commercial activity, it may be. It 

doesn't matter whether the city provides a service such 

as water, or a private entity provides a service such as 

water. That may be commercial activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they pay fees and New 

York taxes. Suppose New York doesn't have fees. 

Suppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property 

tax.

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, no, that does not -- on 

the substantive issue of whether it's immune under the 

Foreign -- under the Vienna Conventions, a tax is 

immune. They are immune from a tax, but they're not 

immune for a fee for service. That is how the Vienna 

Conventions --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in reality, you will 

never get there, because the Vienna Convention deals 

with the substantive liability -- you're talking about 

jurisdiction. On your theory, you would never get to 

the fee for picking up the garbage, because you wouldn't

have any jurisdiction.

 MR. HOWLEY: No, Justice Ginsburg, not at 

all. That's not my position. Let me make my position 

clear. If there is a fee for service provided, such as 

garbage collection, or provision of water, that would 

fall under the commercial activities exception. But if 

there is a tax, unless the activity at issue and the 

cause of action at issue is based upon the commercial 

activity, there is no jurisdiction. This does not mean 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The commercial activity, 

it's applied to that same building that you say can't 

be -- it can't be any suit for taxes.

 MR. HOWLEY: Yes. There cannot be a suit 

for taxes. There could be a suit for specific fees for 

services rendered. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even if this, the 

building were only the mission and the representative, 

the minister to the U.N., even then --

MR. HOWLEY: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the water of a 

municipal service, garbage collection, could be charged.

 MR. BAKER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just as 

if the Indian mission went out to a private water 

company and said, please supply me with water, the

private water company could sue, based on commercial 

activity, to collect for the water it had provided. It 

doesn't matter if it's the city.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's the city. Not 

a private company, the city itself.

 MR. HOWLEY: The nature of the activity 

doesn't change just because it's the city providing the 

water as opposed to a private entity providing the 

water. We have to look at the nature of the activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this isn't a 

suit for the taxes. I mean, we are not talking about a 

suit for the taxes.

 MR. HOWLEY: We are here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We are talking about a 

declaration as to the interest in the land.

 MR. HOWLEY: No. No, Justice Scalia. 

Absolutely not. Joint Appendix page 78 is the city's 

amended complaint. And even in their foreclosure claim, 

even in their foreclosure claim, what they ask is for a 

judgment of foreclosure directing that the Defendant pay 

the amount of taxes, interest and other charges due. 

They are not asking for an interest in the property.

 All this case is about is money. It's not 

about rights in the property. And there is a very big 

problem with allowing a claim for money to become a

right in property merely by having a local law passed 

that converts the claim into a lien. The City of New 

York tomorrow could pass a law that said, if you don't 

pay your parking tickets, that is automatically 

converted into a lien on the property. And then while 

we can't sue you for the parking tickets, we have 

created a right in your property.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could easily say 

there has to be a relationship to the property itself.

 MR. HOWLEY: Well, that's not -- that's not 

what the City's position is. The City's position is a 

lien is an interest in property and falls within the 

statute. And Congress didn't write in the statute 

arising out of, related to. It said, rights in the 

property are an issue. So if under the City's theory, 

if they passed a lien law tomorrow converting all 

parking tickets into liens on property, then their 

position is they could sue us for parking tickets. And

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 An action to determine whether property 

taxes are owed is not a case in which rights of 

immovable property are an issue, and it's not 

transformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and 

recharacterizing the case as one to determine the 

validity of the lien.

 And I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice 

Ginsburg, on the question you just asked, because I 

think it's very important to emphasize that under 

Respondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the 

potential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in 

the FSIA in the following sense: Respondent's theory 

doesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the 

debt that's secured by the lien.

 So under Respondent's view, the fact that 

this case involves a debt that arises out of property 

taxes is largely beside the point. The load bearing 

weight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed 

effects of the lien on the property. And so for 

example, you could have a case in which a commercial 

activity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues 

a foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's always brought up to 

answer the problem, well, you know -- let me give you a 

case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity, 

but it seems to me that the -- that the lien interest 

has to be honored. Let's suppose that there is an 

American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with 

the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a 

commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which 

to house the employees in -- in their mission.

 However, he retains an interest in that real 

estate. He retains a lien on the real estate, to have 

money paid to him at some point. He is not willing to 

give the full amount of the property, but most of it. 

And he retains a lien. Now, under your theory, that 

lien would not be enforceable, is that right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the lien wouldn't 

constitute a right in the property, and that's 

consistent with what -- the way this Court has always 

described liens. As we point out in pages 21 and 22 of 

our brief, the Court has said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Enforceable or not.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: The lien would not be 

enforceable against a foreign sovereign, because -- at 

least with respect to the immovable property.

JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems very strange to 

me.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: We are only talking about 

the immovable property exception. And with respect to 

that exception, this Court has expounded that a lien on 

land constitutes no property or right in the land 

itself. And it said that on more than one occasion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that the 

Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in 

1985. What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm 

looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case, 

which you argued that these liens were interests in 

property. Are those arguments no longer valid?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we, of course, 

reviewed our position in that case, and we have come to 

the conclusion that it was incorrect. And in the 

Englewood case, that argument was the third argument in 

the brief. The first two arguments in the brief were 

more along the lines of the Court of Appeals decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the 

argument that it was an interest in property. The brief 

was very clear that it is an interest in property, and 

that a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an 

estate in the property.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It survives bona fide --

it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other reasons 

you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to 

enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to 

compensation if eminent domain is exercised. All of 

those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let me try to take up 

some of those in order. First with respect to the 

question of whether holders of a lien are entitled to 

compensation in eminent domain, we don't take issue with 

the proposition that a lien is property. A lien is 

property, but the question under the statute is whether 

a lien confers a right in the underlying immovable 

property. And so in an eminent domain proceeding it may 

just be that just compensation is owed to a lien holder 

because to the extent that the eminent domain proceeding 

takes that lien there's compensation owed for that 

property. But that doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What property is it a right 

in if not the immovable property?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it follows that 

immovable property and when the immovable property 

disappears the lien disappears. You know, if it's blown

away or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is 

gone.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA : But otherwise wherever 

the property goes the lien follows it. How can you say 

that that's not an interest in the property?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think it's a 

right in property, Justice Scalia. The lien is a 

species of property, of intangible personal property, in 

the same sense that a cause of action would be, because 

after all what a lien is is essentially at bottom a 

claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can the, 

how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin 

waste of the immovable property?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, a lien holder can 

bring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to 

understand what interest the lien holder is protecting 

in that situation. An action for waste by a lien holder 

is to protect the security interest. It's different 

from an action for waste by someone who holds a right in 

the property. And New York law appears to recognize 

this because New York I think has two species of waste 

actions, one brought by a security interest holder and 

one brought by the holder of property rights. There's a

case, Travelers Insurance, in which the Second Circuit 

reviewed New York law in this matter -- it's at 14 F.3d 

114 -- and describes how there's two species of waste 

actions depending on which sort of plaintiff you have in 

issue. And that recognizes that the interest, if you 

will, that a lien holder has in the property, is 

different from a right in the property.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about paragraph 3 just 

after paragraph 2 in the complaint? Paragraph 3 asks 

the court to bar and forever foreclose the defendants 

from all right, interest, claim, etcetera in the parcel. 

Well, what about that? What they're asking, I just 

heard it. So what's the answer to that? They seem to 

be saying, we have the right to the parcel, you the 

defendant have no right to the parcel.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't -- you'd have 

to ask Respondent's counsel exactly what they mean by 

that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I did in part, so he 

can answer.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because Respondents have 

repeatedly indicated in this case and in the court of 

appeals and in this Court that they can't foreclose on 

the property and so they've abandoned any claim for 

foreclosure. And a foreclosure action wouldn't result

in the property being deeded to Respondent. It would be 

put up for sale and a third party would purchase it. So 

I'm not -- I can't tell you exactly what that paragraph 

means.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In a very practical way, 

you're expressing that right means ownership means 

ownership. But the title is certainly impaired by this 

lien. India could not turn around and sell it to anyone 

without doing something to discharge the, lien right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the title is certainly 

clouded by this lien.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think liens 

generally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that 

something's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in 

the property. And I could give you one other example.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be a 

right in the property. If you look at it from the 

owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's 

title in the property. It affects the owner's title. 

Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the 

lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner. 

And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in 

which rights in immovable property are an issue, and 

here the question is whether the, the mission's right to

the property is, is impaired by this lien.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think our arguments apply 

equally both to the lien holder and to the property 

owner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with 

respect to both of them a lien -- the lien doesn't 

affect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right 

to exclude others, which this Court has characterized as 

the most fundamental of property rights. It doesn't 

affect the right to receive income from the property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It affects the right to 

convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous 

right that goes along with the real estate.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it has a practical 

consequence on conveyance because it, as Justice 

Ginsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title. But there 

are other instruments that result in a cloud on title 

but that wouldn't be considered rights in property. One 

example would be a contract, a purchase option contract 

to purchase property. The holder of a purchase option 

wouldn't be considered to have a right in the property 

unless and until the option was exercised. At least 

that's the general rule, even though the purchase 

contract in a sense constitutes a cloud on the title in 

the same way that a lien might constitute a lien on the 

title.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long did the United 

States take the opposite position and when did it 

change?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long did the United 

States adhere to the position that's reflect in the 

Englewood brief and when did it change?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I'm not aware that we 

took the position before the Englewood brief, so I think 

that would be 1985. And I don't think we've had 

occasion to revisit that position until this case.

 And let me point out with respect to the 

Englewood brief, the first two points made in that brief 

were along the lines of the court of appeals reasoning 

in this case, which was to the effect that a statute 

that refers to a right in immovable property encompasses 

obligations arising out of immovable property. And 

Respondent doesn't attempt to defend that position, but 

that's the predicate on which our Englewood brief 

rested. And so we think there's good cause for us to 

revisit our position from that case.

 Now, with respect to the question of whether 

a lien establishes rights in property, which is now the 

focus of Respondent's argument, I would point out that 

in other areas of the law the Court has looked to

questions concerning whether there is a right to exclude 

others, whether there is a right to obtain income from 

the property, whether there is a right to assert 

possession of the property. That's, for example, the 

types of considerations this Court takes into account in 

the tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can 

attach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is 

a right to property at stake.  And we think the same 

sorts of consideration should inform the Court's 

assessment of the immovable property exception in this 

case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about an easement? 

That doesn't involve any of those things. You can't 

exclude people and so forth.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, an easement I think 

would qualify as a right in property because at least 

your standard easement would provide a right of access 

to the property by a thoroughfare. And so both sides 

would be affected in their use of the property in that 

sense.

please the Court:

 There are three reasons this case puts in 

issue rights in immovable property: First, the plain 

language of the statute; second, the statute's purpose 

and legislative history; and third, international 

practice as it existed in 1976.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cardozo, before you go 

any further, I had been under the impression from your 

brief that you're not trying to enforce anything 

against, against India or against the mission. You just 

said you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is 

a valid lien. But, but here it is in your complaint 

you're asking for foreclosure. Which, which is it?

 MR. CARDOZO: Justice Scalia, we know that 

Section 1610 would preclude us from actually 

foreclosing. We're not allowed to do that. There's no 

question about that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You just asked for it to 

scare them? Was that it?

 MR. CARDOZO: No. We do want, as the 

discussion preceding me highlighted, we do want to get 

in and take what we think is, as a practical matter, is 

our property. But we can't. We understand that. So 

what we're, what we're saying in our complaint in 

paragraph 3, as Justice Breyer pointed out, is we would

like to bar them from holding title. But as we quickly 

conceded as soon as we filed the action, we can't 

foreclose because of the provisions of Section 1610. 

But it doesn't mean that the fact that we can't 

foreclose doesn't mean that we don't have a right in 

property. Let me give you a very good illustration. If 

there is a possessory dispute, someone, an embassy, 

rented premises and agreed that if they didn't pay the 

rent they would lose their ability to continue to occupy 

the premises and they failed to pay rent, that's a title 

dispute. The person who rented the property would bring 

a suit saying: I have a right to get back into my 

property and there is clearly a right in property in 

Section 1605. I can't believe that Congress said, that 

Congress intended to say, well, you can bring an action 

for nonpayment of rent and seek possession except for 

1610, that's okay. There's jurisdiction in an action 

for rent, but if you want possession of property because 

you haven't paid your taxes, and of course you still 

can't foreclose, there's no jurisdiction. That doesn't 

make any sense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they'll say as 

was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the 

commercial act exception covers that.

 MR. CARDOZO: Your Honor, it may or may not

cover the commercial act exception. And going back to a 

question that Justice Breyer asked, there are, there are 

cases, not in the United States, but -- and we're citing 

some of them in footnote 24 in the red brief -- that 

when someone, not the commercial property exception, 

someone lent money to, to build an embassy and they 

defaulted on the mortgage, the German court said 

jurisdiction. It's not a question of enforcement, but 

jurisdiction.

 The reason for this is if you first look at 

the language of the statute, the language of the statute 

doesn't say only certain kinds of rights. It says all 

rights in property if they're in issue.

 We believe that we have a right in the 

Indian and Mongolia premises. We --

JUSTICE BREYER: The problem that actually 

is bothering me with your side of the case which I find 

difficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you 

have. All right, it seems to me anything at all can be 

reduced to a lien, any judgment, at least certainly slip 

and fall cases and you didn't keep the ice up in front 

and I want $4 million damages plus 300 million in 

punitives and where it is I have a lien against the 

embassy here. And I can't think of a distinction once I 

go down your road. I mean, he at least has an absolute

distinction which I can see, but once I go down your 

road where is the stopping place? What's the principle?

 MR. ROBERTS: Let me try, Justice Breyer. 

First of all, if there was a judgment on that 

hypothetical tort action that you just mentioned, if 

there were a judgment you wouldn't have gotten the 

judgment in the first place unless you had originally 

come within --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm imagining a city or 

Belarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip 

and fall on ice -- you know, you get a lien against the 

property prior to -- okay. I mean, it's easy to imagine 

that kind of thing.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in a range of subject 

matters. So I'm looking to what the stopping place is 

once I start down your road.

 MR. ROBERTS: And the stopping place I think 

is a Federalism concept and a due process concept, 

because as this Court has held in a number of cases, 

there's a real due process question if liens are created 

with no concern about the effect on the defendant. You 

have to take a look at the interest of the so-called 

plaintiff and you have to find whether there is a 

relationship between the lien and the underlying claim.

Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you just say --

you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of 

countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if 

they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of 

stuff easements, which, which the other side says is 

undoubtedly a property interest. So they could say 

that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give 

you an easement over the property of, of the defendant 

worth so much money. And that would undoubtedly be 

enforceable.

 MR. CARDOZO: Justice Scalia, they did say 

that and certainly if an easement is a right in 

property, either because of the hypothetical you just 

gave or a traditional easement, there is nothing 

different with a tax lien. In fact, a tax lien is a 

much greater interest.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I still have my question 

because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't 

carry around in my head all of the possible things that 

might be liens against property. And so maybe my 

imagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are 

arguing that every lien against the property is in fact 

a right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you 

arguing that there is some distinction between some and

the other. And I noticed that the Restatements and 

others are trying to distinguish between whether the 

lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't 

grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to 

work with and so I want to know how you see it.

 MR. CARDOZO: And what I see, Justice 

Breyer, is when you take a look at the cases in this 

Court such as Connecticut against Doehr and the other 

cases which put limits, the constitutional limits on 

liens, of course if a State passed a statute that runs 

afoul of the various due process concerns that this 

Court has articulated that is certainly one check that 

we have.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take the 

parking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York 

would make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking 

ticket a lien on all, all property.

 MR. CARDOZO: Justice Ginsburg, I think that 

would be a hard question, but if it does not run afoul 

of the constitutional concerns that I just articulated 

and it was a lien applicable not just of course to 

foreign sovereigns, but to any unpaid parking ticket --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.

 MR. CARDOZO: -- I think that then that 

would come within the immovable property exception.

would have to do I suppose -- you've mentioned the due 

process point -- would be to perhaps give a hearing 

before the lien was declared and that would be enough?

 MR. CARDOZO: I think, I think it certainly 

would, Justice Souter, if in fact there was a hearing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, provided that, 

provided notice of hearing was offered, the parking 

ticket lien would be in the same position as this lien, 

right -- the hearing.

 MR. CARDOZO: I think that's right. I think 

that's right. And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And under New York law 

does property, do property tax liens have some superior 

status? Are they distinct under New York law from other 

liens?

 MR. CARDOZO: Well, they're -- as tax liens 

you may get into a priority fight in a bankruptcy 

context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to 

priority.

would have any different lien, any different status,

liens -- tax liens do have in certain circumstances a

greater priority. It's hard to think through exactly 

where that issue would be.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I had thought they 

had a greater priority and that they even survived 

purchase from bona fide sellers.

 MR. CARDOZO: That certainly, that is 

certainly true and a property -- excuse me for 

interrupting -- a tax lien would run forever with no 

time limit, for example, whereas a mechanics lien has a 

statutory time on it. If you got into a dispute about 

those two liens obviously the tax lien would have --

would have priority.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask 

this question? Suppose another jurisdiction had a tax 

system which was just a little different from New York's 

and didn't provide for a lien until after a suit had 

been brought and there had been a failure to pay or had 

to get a judgment first. On that case, that 

jurisdiction could not enforce this tax law?

 MR. CARDOZO: That is correct, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And don't you think it's 

sort of a strange way to define a tax immunity, by --

by, by describing the -- the interest in immovable 

property?

MR. CARDOZO: Well, we start off with the 

statutory language and the statutory language says right 

in property. We are not talking about the abstract 

right to tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, but the basic issue 

in final analysis is whether they have to pay their 

taxes, isn't it?

 MR. CARDOZO: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The ultimate issue is 

whether they have to pay their taxes.

 MR. CARDOZO: The ultimate substance --

underlying substantive issue is that but -- and of 

course, the State Department even today says these taxes 

should be paid. But the jurisdictional issue is whether 

there is a right in property. And so if you just -- if 

you don't create a lien, if a particular State did not 

create a lien, that would not give you the right, which 

is what the statute, statutory language says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any States that 

don't? Isn't it fairly standard? For --

MR. CARDOZO: I believe -- I believe it is 

fairly standard, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

50 States that, that don't say this. I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May, may I just ask, for a 

kind of a footnote kind of question? I mean you 

referred again to the text. And if we are going to go 

on a very strict reading of the text as I understand it, 

you don't have to claim a right in property, you have to 

have a claim in -- in which someone's rights in 

immovable property are in issue. So whether the, the --

and so long as you create a cloud on the title, however 

that cloud is classified, it puts in issue the title of 

the named title holder, so that the debates about the 

distinction between a lien and easement and so forth is 

essentially irrelevant as long as it's a cloud on the 

title. If we are going to be that, if we are going to 

be literal, isn't that so?

 MR. CARDOZO: I, I agree with that. And 

here today the right that India and Mongolia claim in 

their property is in issue, because we say you do not 

have the full right to your property and if this lien 

runs long enough, it's going to wipe out the value of 

their property completely. And all the statute, the 

statute doesn't say as the European Convention says the 

foreign sovereign's right in property. The statute says 

either -- in effect, either side's right in property.

great deal of help by looking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the -- the European, 

the European treaty looks at it from the other side, 

you're saying. It looks at it from the foreign 

sovereign side.

 MR. CARDOZO: The European Convention 

phrased differently looks at it from both sides, Justice 

Scalia, which is why they needed the words obligation. 

If you look at Article 9 of the European Convention it 

first talks about the foreign sovereign's right or 

interest in property, and then it says "or the foreign 

sovereign's obligations arising out of that property." 

That's a different phrase than the FSIA which doesn't 

use the word foreign sovereign; it says "its" rights in 

property have to be an issue. So you didn't need to 

encompass all the language of the European Convention.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the obligations 

arising out of the property in the European Convention 

include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?

 MR. CARDOZO: It would include a controversy 

over that absolutely. And let, let me talk about the 

international practice because we should take a look at 

international practice to -- to guide us.

 What was the practice in 1976? Well, first 

of all we know that the restatement second and comment

in paragraph 68 says disputes over rights or interest in 

property. And the restatement third, which was 

concededly a few years after the 1976 adoption of the 

statute, makes it perfectly clear. It says it 

explicitly. But where did the restatement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This says what explicitly?

 MR. CARDOZO: Says that there is 

jurisdiction over tax claim. Section 455 of -- of 

restatement third.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over tax liens or 

claims?

 MR. CARDOZO: Over tax claims. Excuse me, 

Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't go 

that far.

 MR. CARDOZO: That -- we don't have to go 

that far because we believe we, as a -- we have a right 

in property arising from the lien. Now let's look at 

the foreign cases before we get to the European 

Convention and we cite a number of them in footnote 24. 

There is for example the case I referred to in response 

to Justice Breyer, a suit over a mortgage. A suit over 

a mortgage. It's not the commercial exception; a suit 

over a mortgage.

 There is a case in England in 1975 which

analyzes broadly what's the meaning of this real 

property exception. And that case in England which we 

cite says a security interest, a suit over security 

interest for a mortgage, there is jurisdiction within 

the immovable property exception.

 There is a large number of cases. You look 

at the Harvard Review of 1932, the status of the law at 

that time, extensive review of all the relevant cases, 

says the same thing. Then that brings us to the 

European Convention which was adopted shortly before the 

FSIA and which the State Department told Congress was 

consistent with the FSIA.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this the Vienna 

Convention?

 MR. CARDOZO: Pardon me? No, the European 

Convention.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: European Convention.

 MR. CARDOZO: Right. And the European 

Convention in Article 9 as I say has a very broad 

immovable property exception. I'm not looking just at 

the language. I'm looking at what does this convention 

reflect as far as international practice was at the 

time? And that practice at the time as reflected by the 

convention, as reflected by these cases, all say that 

there is a very broad immovable property exception that

should cover this kind of dispute.

 Now let me make one, one or two final 

points. If this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- the 

convention used language quite different than that was 

used by Congress. So I'm not quite sure how that 

international practice reflected in or arising out of 

the convention is terribly pertinent.

 MR. CARDOZO: I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice, 

I'm not talking just about the language. I'm talking 

about the European, the international practice as 

reflected by that convention because the 1976 

legislative history of the FSIA says we are trying to 

conform United States practice into the, the practice 

that is followed internationally. And I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in some cases 

they used language directly from the convention and in 

this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly 

ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying 

to do.

 MR. CARDOZO: Then I would say where did 

they get that source from? And that's where I cite the, 

first the international cases themselves which reflect 

as of 1976 the same philosophy reflected by the European 

Convention. There is no question that the wording is

different. I'm not, I'm not disputing that. What I'm 

saying is that wording conveys an intent from the 

international point of view to have the broad parameters 

of an international, of an immovable property exception 

and that was consistent with the international cases 

that have been decided at that time.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did their practice draw a 

distinction between occupied by the ambassador himself 

and property occupied by employees of the embassy?

 MR. CARDOZO: As a substantive matter, 

Justice Stevens, the answer to that question is of 

course yes. Because the Vienna convention in Article 20 

-- 23 says that the premises of -- of the mission may 

not be, may not be taxed. And then you look at Article 

1 to look at what is the meaning of premises of the 

mission and they talk about where the business of the 

mission is conducted, or where the ambassador resides. 

It doesn't talk about the rest of the employees. And 

since 1952, the State Department even before the Vienna 

convention and subsequent has been advising missions in 

New York, it's on their web site today that they must 

pay taxes on staff housing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you what, what do 

you get out of this case? You've withdrawn your claim 

for judgment of foreclosure. What are you going to get

out of it? Declaratory judgment that they owe the 

taxes? I'm not sure they have ever contested that they 

don't owe taxes.

 MR. CARDOZO: Oh yes I think if you look, if 

you look at the Petitioners' brief I think they do 

contest that they, that they have to pay the tax. But 

what we'll get out of this is the following.

 First of all, start with the fact that the 

statute says you can bring an action in this 

jurisdiction even if you can't execute. We have the 

State Department telling us, the Solicitor General 

telling us in their briefs, footnote 17, that countries 

pay lawful taxes. So if we can get, if we can proceed 

to judgment and get that, and get that declaration, we 

believe based upon what the Solicitor General has said 

they will pay their taxes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but --

MR. CARDOZO: In addition --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say he is wrong about a 

lot of other stuff.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you believe him 

about that?

 MR. CARDOZO: And the -- the reason I 

believe him about that is that Congress has passed a law

that says if you don't pay your taxes reflected by a 

judgment, whatever the amount of that tax is, you're 

going to lose 1110 percent of your foreign aid. And so 

I believe we are going to get a lot out of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I can ask you 

to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into 

a muddle here.

 I'm still now being very, very literal. I 

think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in 

which is involved rights to property. And you say, but 

this is a right to property in this case; if I win this 

case then I have a right to sell that house. Therefore, 

I have a right in property.

 Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't 

that apply to every case where a State might say if you 

win this case you can sell his house? I mean, I can 

easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a 

State would say, you win, you can sell their house to 

collect the judgment.

 MR. CARDOZO: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: So I'm still back in a 

different route at where I'm having the problem, which 

is a problem of distinguishing in principle between 

either your absolute principle, "do it," his absolute 

principle, "don't do it," or something in the middle.

MR. CARDOZO: And I think the something in 

the middle, Justice Breyer, is if you're talking about a 

prejudgment lien which I think is your hypothetical. 

It's --

JUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical was doing 

away with the prejudgment lien. I would say the exact 

same words apply with just as much force if there is no 

prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State 

were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell 

this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in 

which there is at issue your right to sell his property, 

just as there is here.

 MR. CARDOZO: But Justice, Justice Breyer, 

in that hypothetical, you don't have a right in property 

until you win the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you?

 MR. CARDOZO: We have, we have a, there is 

an in issue today our right to property and I believe 

that that is a distinction and I believe also -- and of 

critical importance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait a minute. But 

the -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is 

brought, even before the final judgment. So you know, 

let's give the devil his due. It would be a case in 

which rights in immovable property are in issue.

MR. CARDOZO: Yes. And if you want to look 

at it from the embassy side under my theory, their right 

-- under my lien their rights are an issue today. And 

under Justice Breyer's hypothetical if it meets the 

other due process concerns which I think under that 

hypothetical would raise a number of interesting ones --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's your big 

defense. To do that they would have to do it for 

everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as 

well as for the embassy, right?

 MR. CARDOZO: That's right. That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it only the case that 

the, that the only instances in which, consistent with 

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say 

you get the house, would be instances of litigation 

arising out of commercial activity?

 MR. CARDOZO: Yes. That is -- that is --

that is correct. Because it's only in the commercial 

activities exception can you execute and then only in 

certain limited circumstances --

premises are not being used for the purposes of the 

mission.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now I take it you 

under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions, 

the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before 

any judicial proceedings.

 MR. CARDOZO: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because they are 

unpaid. And this is probably a question more for them 

than for you, but as you understand their position, if 

you put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are 

they entitled to demand its removal?

 MR. CARDOZO: Of course they can. And in 

fact the Republic of Argentina case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean of course they 

can under their view?

 MR. CARDOZO: No. They can bring an action 

to quiet title. They can bring an action --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. No.

 MR. CARDOZO: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE KENNEY: Excuse me.

lien be released --

MR. CARDOZO: They can demand it.

-- because it violates the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act? Is it their position that you have no 

right at all even to notice a lien against the property?

 MR. CARDOZO: Well, I haven't heard their 

articulation of that position, but they certainly could 

write --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would seem to me to 

follow from what they're saying.

 MR. CARDOZO: I think it may. I think they 

certainly have a right to ask us to reconsider and make 

the various arguments on the merits to us. There are 

cases preceding the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act 

where a country felt the lien was invalid and brought a 

lawsuit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is can 

they demand that the lien be removed solely because of 

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

 MR. CARDOZO: They could demand that, but I 

don't that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act answers 

the underlying substantive question. You'd have to look 

at the Vienna Convention as well as New York law to 

answer that question, because all the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act is talking about is the jurisdictional 

issue, not the substantive issue.

can't bring this lawsuit to have, to try to foreclose or 

at least to have a declaration of our rights, this 

lawsuit can't be brought anywhere. No place in the 

world can New York City have a conclusion as to who owns 

this property. That is absolutely inconsistent with the 

underlying immovable property exception and the local 

action rule, which says that land -- that a sovereign 

has a prim evil interest in its land, it has the right 

to adjudicate its property.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: With reference to the 

offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under 

the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do 

you have to have a judgment first?

 MR. CARDOZO: No. The statute talks about a 

judgment. It can't just be that.

 So finally, even though we cannot execute on 

our property -- on the judgment, it has a major impact, 

this case has a major impact on what we can do. If we 

can't do it there's no other place for our problems to 

be resolved. I urge that the decision below be 

affirmed. Thank you.

commercial case or a case like yours?

 MR. CARDOZO: Theoretically it would have an 

application in a counterclaim situation as well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. CARDOZO: -- Justice Souter. I think 

those are the three things. Of course, you don't need 

that statute for the commercial exception because you 

can execute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. You can go 

directly.

 MR. CARDOZO: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So in practical terms, with 

the possible exception of a counterclaim, the foreign 

aid setoff would simply apply to a case like this, then?

 MR. CARDOZO: That's right. And Justice 

Souter, while certainly the Congress that passed those 

statutes was not the Congress that passed the FSIA, 

there is, certainly should be an effort to harmonize 

what the Congress has done.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HOWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Article 29 of the European Convention 

expressly excludes any intent to create an exception for 

tax claims. That was the international practice at the 

time. What we have here is a bootstrap and I refer to 

the Court to its decision in Ministry of Defense of 

Republic of Iran against Elahi, where this Court said 

that when you have an action to impose a lien, it is 

analyzed as an attachment under Section 1609-1610 of the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And what the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act says is you cannot use an 

attachment to get jurisdiction where jurisdiction 

otherwise does not exist.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position 

that it's improper even to notice the property with the

 MR. HOWLEY: Under New York law, yes, and we

right to impose the lien because the Vienna Convention 

and New York law prohibit the taxation of the property 

and you cannot impose the lien to collect something that 

you're not entitled to. And this is a dispute that has 

historically been resolved through diplomacy, not in the 

courts, because the fact is whatever happens in this 

case to India and Mongolia is likely to happen to the 

United States around the world and that's a foreign 

policy question for the State Department to decide.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean we'll have to 

start paying our taxes around the world?

 MR. HOWLEY: I'm afraid so, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a real problem for 

us? I don't think so.

 MR. HOWLEY: I am afraid so.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
