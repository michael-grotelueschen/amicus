 We'll hear argument next in Case 06-637, 

Board of Education of the City School District of the 

City of New York versus Tom F.

 Mr. Koerner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD KOERNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. KOERNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and members 

of the Court. In 1985 when this Court decided the 

Burlington decision, it based -- it based it based on 

the broad remedial clause set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1415, 

which allowed an impartial hearing officer, a state 

review officer, or the court, itself, to grant relief 

where appropriate.

 In so doing, it noted that there was no 

other substantive section which touched and concerned 

the issue before the Court, and that is whether an 

individual can voluntarily remove a child and seek 

tuition reimbursement before the conclusion of the 

administrative and court remedies.

 It made a point of noting that it felt it 

was gleaning the congressional intent; and, had Congress 

known that the administrative and court process would be 

protracted, it would have provided a process which would

allow the child to be removed.

 Similarly, in the sequel, the Carter case, 

the Court made the other -- the same conclusion. It 

noted that, although the primary responsibilities to 

educate the child in a public school, least restrictive 

environment, there would be occasions when you would 

place that child outside, having been in the school 

system.

 1412, which was the eligibility section 

during this period, was very truncated. It did not 

provide a lot of conversation concerning the 

relationship of public and private schools within the 

IDEA. It provided that you had to provide the child who 

demanded it a FAPE, a free appropriate education. If 

you couldn't do that, the public school had to then pay 

for the tuition. It was silent though on the 

relationship between the private schools where the child 

voluntary removes.

 In 1997 the IDEA was codified, and for the 

first time the specific section was inserted dealing 

with the relationship of children and private schools. 

Indeed, 20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(10) -- just the beginning, 

just that paragraph, says "children placed in private 

schools" and the structure was detailed. Subdivision 

(A) dealt with the relationshiop of the private schools

with the public system generally and noted that, in that 

particular case, while the children would be entitled to 

some small amount of Federal funding, they would not be 

entitled in private school to a free appropriate public 

education.

 We also noted that if a parent was 

dissatisfied with the service plan, they'd have to seek 

relief administratively. They would not be entitled to 

an impartial due process or a court review. It was a 

recognition that children who are placed in private 

school were entitled to much lesser services than 

children placed in public school.

 Subdivision (B) dealt with the situation 

when children were not placed in public school but the 

local district consented that they could not provide a 

free appropriate public education. As a consequence, in 

those cases and in only those cases, since the public 

would then be supervising and directing the private 

school, they would be responsible for the tuition.

 Sub (C) is the issue now before this Court. 

Sub (C) is entitled Children Placed in Private School, 

Payment and Where the Local Education Aagency Did Not 

Consent. And that particular section is broken down 

again into three parts. The first part says, if a child 

is offered FAPE, that is, a child is given a program

which is adequate, you cannot get reimbursement if you 

remove your child during any time but in this case 

during the pendency of the administrative and the court 

process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you 

agree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we 

should defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the 

comments accompanying the regulations?

 MR. KOERNER: The answer is no because the 

Secretary's interpretation on the note in common and the 

letter submitted to the educational consultant is 

inconsistent with its own Federal regulation. Its 

Federal reguation, titled Children Placed in Private 

Schools When FAPE Is at Issue, also requires that you 

previously receive --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just mirrors the 

statute --

MR. KOERNER: That's exactly -- it does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then --

MR. KOERNER: But the note --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Assuming we would 

think the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely 

to think the same language in the regulation is 

ambiguous.

 MR. KOERNER: Well, Chief Justice, if it's

ambiguous and we ought to at least discuss the nature of 

the ambiguity, then that ambiguity under the spending 

clause should redound to the benefit of the local 

education district as well, for if it does not set forth 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which -- which 

prevails, Chevron deference or spending clause 

presumption?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, the Chevron deference 

requires notes and comments which are persuasive and 

analyzed. There is absolutely no analysis in the note 

and comment in this case. All it says conclusively is 

that the decisions of this Court in Burlington and 

Carter create an independent obligation separate and 

distinct from the statute. It doesn't explain why the 

specific language of the statute should not be 

incorporated in the Burlington court. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: If Gilbert F. had attended 

the public school for 11 days, would this case come out 

differently, in your view?

 MR. KOERNER: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the student here had 

attended the public school for let's say 11 days before 

being transferred to the public -- to the private 

school, would your, would your arguments still fly?

MR. KOERNER: No. If the -- if the child 

attends a public school and receives special education 

and related services --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You've added something to 

the question, though, didn't you?

 MR. KOERNER: No, I don't think so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Attending public school and 

receiving --

MR. KOERNER: I -- I thought, I'm sorry --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that was my 

assumption. Let's say he attends public school in a 

special education class for 11 days. His parents think 

the public -- the placement that's proposed, the IEP 

that's proposed by the school is inadequate, and they 

turn out to be correct, and they want to send their 

child to the private school, but they understand this 

argument based on the statutory language, so they say 

all right, we are going to put him in the public school 

special education class for 11 days, so -- we've already 

got the placement in the private school all lined up at 

the end of the 11 days. He goes one day, we give 

notice; we take him out and we put him in the private 

school; then they are entitled to reimbursement subject 

under your argument.

 MR. KOERNER: That -- that would satisfy the

statutory definition, but when it went before the 

impartial officer, or the State review officer, there 

would be a very compelling argument that there was a 

lack of cooperation, because it's not just that you're 

in the system, but that you articulate the problems that 

you have with the public placement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends on 

the particular circumstances. I mean, if the parent is 

able to show look, the school district is being very 

unreasonable here; it's clear he is going to need more 

than the services they were going to offer, well that 

wouldn't have --

MR. KOERNER. Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- run afoul of any 

of the other provisions.

 MR. KOERNER: My only comment, Chief 

Justice, was that yes, that would satisfy the statutory 

section as long as the notice was given in triple I, but 

we would then have an argument in the individual case 

that the parent was not cooperating. So for the purpose 

of this case, where they come into the system even for a 

minimum period and give the appropriate notice under 

triple I, yes, that would -- it would be satisfied.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress 

ever have wanted to adopt a scheme like that? What

possible purpose is served by simply requiring the 

student to be in a placement that is by definition not 

providing a -- not providing FAPE for this very short 

period of time? It makes no sense whatsoever.

 MR. KOERNER: The reason Congress wanted to 

provide it is the reason that this Court discussed in 

Burlington. The upset of this Court in Burlington was 

that it was an extremely protracted process. The child 

there was subject to a very long impartial hearing and 

State review and court review --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that enabled the 

parent to remove the child immediately and risk that --

MR. KOERNER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the public education 

would be found inadequate.

 MR. KOERNER: But the reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all that section does 

is to repeat the Burlington scenario. It says, it 

codifies what the Court held. The Court didn't say 

anything in Burlington about the situation where the 

child was never in public education.

 MR. KOERNER: That's correct, but it's a 

statute of limitations. It says that you must receive 

special education and related services. There is no --

there is no exception to the condition -- if you look at

the particular statute when they refer to "may," they 

are only talking about the relief that a court or 

impartial hearing officer or State review officer can 

grant. They are not talking about the predicate, you 

must be in the system.

 Now you asked, Justice Alito, why do they 

have to be in the system, and the reason is Congress 

thought that if you're in the system and you have a 

vested interest in the system, that because of all the 

processes that are there, including mediation, including 

a modified IEP, that it would increase the numbers of 

people in terms of cooperation who want to participate 

in the system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it wasn't that. 

I thought it was simply Congress figured that there are 

probably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan 

in particular, who are going to send their kids to 

private school, no matter what, and they can get special 

services in private school, but what the heck, if we can 

get $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine.

 In other words, this was meant to be an 

option for people who wanted to go to the public schools 

but couldn't go to the public schools because they 

couldn't get the private services there, but it was 

never meant to be an option for people who had no desire

to go to public schools at all anyway, and --

MR. KOERNER: I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and without this 

condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was 

never in the public school, was he?

 MR. KOERNER: That's correct. He never had 

any contact with the public school at all except to 

request a free appropriate public education.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there not children --

I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism 

Society that says many school systems simply do not have 

the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?

 MR. KOERNER: Yes, but you don't know that 

until you've actually been subjected to the process 

itself. Indeed in Schaffer, you, this Court said that 

you had to presume that the officials in the department 

of education of a local school district are going to do 

their job. Their job is to try to find an appropriate 

IEP. If it turns out that it's insufficient, of course 

you can then litigate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there not cases where 

school districts have said from day one, look, we don't 

have facilities to handle this type of disability?

 MR. KOERNER: But if we don't -- if the 

public schools district does not have the facilities,

then it will consent to a private placement to deal with 

the particular problem it cannot deal with. We are only 

talking about cases where the school system believes it 

can deal with an individual problem and at the very 

least if the person's child comes into the system, they 

will have the opportunity to work with the parent and 

try to work out a situation. In -- as this Court is 

well aware, the primary obligation is to find a public 

education for this child, and if from day one you assume 

that the individual education plan is defective, not 

only is it inconsistent with Schaffer, it's inconsistent 

with the whole statutory scheme which is set up to try 

to work cooperatively. Indeed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it true that 

the parent will never be reimbursed? Let's take the 

parent that Justice Scalia has hypothesized, will never 

get one penny of that tuition unless that parent carries 

the burden -- the parent would have the burden of 

showing that there was no appropriate public education?

 MR. KOERNER: The parent in this case can 

never get reimbursed because they don't meet the 

predicate which is that their child had to previously --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the question I 

asked.

 MR. KOERNER: Oh I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I said that the parent --

let's assume that the parent never sends the child to 

public school, nonetheless seeks reimbursement. In 

order to get reimbursement that parent would have to 

show, would have bear the burden of showing that there 

is no appropriate public education available; is that 

not true?

 MR. KOERNER: Yes. You mean assuming the 

statute does not apply?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that is -- but the 

parent would not have to show that the parent would have 

used that available public remedy --

MR. KOERNER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it were there?

 MR. KOERNER: And Congress could have 

concluded that the parent you're referring to who placed 

that child immediately in a private school, and who may 

not have an interest in obtaining a public school 

education for that child, may not be as cooperative and 

as collaborative as someone who has a child in the 

system, to work out an individual education plan because 

of some of these --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the conclusion would 

be that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of 

showing that there is no appropriate public education.

MR. KOERNER: But the problem is, if you go 

to an impartial hearing officer as in this case, and you 

have a child that's been in a private school for a 

number of years and is doing very well, and the private 

school special ed teacher comes in and highlights all 

the successes of the kid, and then the New York City 

Department of Education comes in with is profit plan 

which is based on speculation, because the child has 

never been in the system, is it so unreasonable for 

Congress to conclude as a matter of statutory, explicit 

language that the child should go into the system so 

that at least with respect to your burden there's at 

least a participatory program where they try to help the 

child get an individual education.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress's purpose really 

was what you -- what you suggest and what I think 

Justice Scalia's question suggests, that there was a 

desire to make parents who really had no interest in the 

public school system give the public schools a chance, 

why is it that, even as you read the statute, there's no 

requirement that the child remain in the public school 

system for any significant period of time? It's just 

pro forma.

 MR. KOERNER: Indeed, Justice Alito. 

Congress in this case got it completely right because

not only did they put in the explicit language, they 

also put in a time period because they understood that 

this Court had ruled in a number of cases that its upset 

was with the protracted period that a family has to have 

a child in the system.  But by having a notice provision 

and by thereby ensuring a parent that by giving notice 

and specifically articulating the reason why the plan is 

deficient and giving the school district an opportunity 

to cure the problem, everybody would understand 10 days 

later that they can leave. So the very problem that you 

highlighted in Burlington and Carter is no longer a 

problem under the explicit legislation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think they may --

they may well have to stay longer than 10 days to either 

realize that the program is inadequate or to feel 

comfortable that they'll be able to establish that on 

the record. It's pretty hard to say something's not 

working after only on 10 days.

 MR. KOERNER: Chief Judge, you're absolutely 

right. And that is why I say that would be based on an 

individual determination. All the statute says is come 

into the system. What happens after that, if you give 

your notice as was raised in a hypothetical, that would 

go to whether or not there was the duty to cooperate 

which was fulfilled, which also is a requirement for

this particular section for reimbursement.

 It's not just that you are in a program and 

private school is providing appropriate service and then 

you have an IEP that may not provide the free 

appropriate public education, but you also have to show 

you cooperated with the program because the whole 

primary purpose of the program is to provide a public 

education.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, to be fair, this 

provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who 

wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a 

private school. It also applies to somebody who is 

already in public school, and the program offered by the 

-- by the city is patently inadequate. You are 

compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a 

program that anybody would see will -- will not meet the 

needs.

 MR. KOERNER: That is correct, but your --

first of all, Congress could weigh the balance between 

that particular problem and the need to give the school 

district an opportunity to try to provide a program, but 

it does run contrary to this Court's discussion in 

Schaffer which presumes that the school district is 

going try to accommodate the child, try to provide the 

needs of the child.

In effect, I think all of these questions 

are based on the assumption that the plan is going to be 

automatically deficient. I don't believe there's any 

foundation this Court has indicated there's no 

foundation. That's why it said in Schaffer that the 

parent has the ultimate burden of persuasion because it 

presumed that the plan -- if you accept that principle, 

which has already been articulated and you accept the 

fact that specialists on the Board of Education have --

are going to try to adjust to this kid's needs, then 

having the kid in the system even for a short while is 

something that Congress could determine. And indeed 

that's what the language says.

 Now, we recognize that there is an absurd 

argument, but it was difficult for us to understand how 

it would be absurd to require this when indeed it would 

solve the problems of Burlington and Carter because it 

makes sure that if a parent doesn't want to stay for a 

protracted period, it doesn't have to stay and then they 

can litigate later. As Judge Alito noted, it would be 

as little as 10 days.

 I mean some arguments -- some of the 

arguments I should at least mention that the other side 

has made: The chief -- in the Second Circuit, the 

argument was that there was an ambiguity because the

word "only"0 wasn't used. So if I may use the example 

that an individual may be eligible for welfare 

recipients -- welfare benefits if that individual 

previously received food stamps, the argument would be, 

well, that's a little ambiguous because you didn't say 

"only received food stamps." Of course, the condition 

doesn't have to have "only" and it probably undermines a 

lot of statutes that Congress has passed. The language 

is very, very clear.

 The second argument that is made both by the 

Solicitor General and Respondent is that there's been an 

-- implied repeals of this Court's decisions in 

Burlington and Carter. But an implied repeal is when 

you have two statutes that are specific and the latest 

specific statute is inconsistent with the earlier 

specific statute. These courts' decisions were based on 

a general remedy provision and, more importantly, this 

statute encompassed what this Court held because it 

provided that you can remove your child once in the 

system and the notice provision provides that you don't 

have to be in the system very long.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any suggestion in 

the reasoning in the Burlington case that it was limited 

to a situation in which the student had been receiving 

public school special education?

MR. KOERNER: No. But it was a holding 

where the student was in fact receiving special 

education. The next case, of course, would have been 

one where the -- now, a more interesting question would 

have been raised if you had (iii) and not (ii). If you 

only had the notice provision where Congress 

contemplates you have to be in the system to give 

notice, and I came to this Court and I said, under 

(iii), Congress has really contemplated you have to at 

least be in the system for a short amount of time. You 

didn't have (ii), which clarifies exactly what Congress 

said, and this Court would have to then consider whether 

or not (iii), by itself, would be -- would create enough 

of an ambiguity in its (inaudible) decisions or whether 

or not (iii) could be enforced without referring to (ii) 

because why do you give notice?

 Think about the result in this case. For 

someone in the system, they have to give notice and an 

opportunity to cure, and the IEP can be modified. If 

you're not in the system and you never had any interest 

in the system and you sought tuition reimbursement, you 

would have less of a bureaucratic process. There would 

be a preverse incentive to stay outside the system. You 

wouldn't have to give notice. You would just have to --

that's true, because the problem would be you would go 

to the hearing to see if you were getting the adequate 

education and you would have -- you would essentially 

have to make a facial challenge rather than an 

as-applied one, and the school would say, well, you 

didn't give us a chance; we were going to do this and we 

were going to do that. So it would be a heavier burden 

to carry. The parents would have a heavier burden.

 MR. KOERNER: But that would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if they did --

MR. KOERNER: But that would be an 

individual determination, Chief Judge. What I'm saying 

though, for everybody in the system, it doesn't depend 

on an impartial hearing. You have to give notice 

before you get to the next step. If you're outside the 

system, you don't have to participate in any process 

other than to seek at an impartial hearing the right to 

get reimbursement. So that actually there's less 

bureaucratic processes outside the system, and there's 

and incentive (1) not to cooperate and (2) just to 

marshal all your arguments in the impartial hearing and 

hopefullyl you're going to prevail and get the payment 

for the private education; whereas, if you're in the 

system --

still that it would be easier to prevail at the 

impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it 

didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried.

 MR. KOERNER: Except for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I were the 

impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a 

harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't 

even try. The school's going to come in and say, here's 

what we would have done if you'd given us a chance and 

you didn't give us a chance.

 MR. KOERNER: But there is a dynamic at 

these hearings that, if you come in and that you're in a 

private school and you show that your child is doing 

well in the private school, and we come in with a 

theoretical plan that has never been implemented, there 

is going to be a dynamic with the impartial hearing 

officer who will tilt towards keeping the child --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the basis for 

saying that, when the one thing that the statute is very 

clear on is that the starting premise of any 

reimbursement claim is that an appropriate public 

education is not available? That wouldn't concentrate, 

testing that wouldn't concentrate on what the private 

school is doing but what the public school could do.

 MR. KOERNER: You're right, Justice

Ginsburg. I was only commenting on the dynamic. Of 

course, we would try to show it, but we can't show it 

based on -- any actual interaction with the child. We 

can't show we observed the child in the school and tried 

to make the following modifications.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have the 

burden; the parents do.

 MR. KOERNER: Yes. That is the technical 

relationship. That's right. I'm talking more about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The parent would presumably 

cover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and 

Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z; 

Z is not going to be enough. And the burden on you 

would be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.

 MR. KOERNER: That's correct. But, of 

course, what we're saying has no actual practice.

 But all this is separate and distinct from 

the language of Congress. And unless that language is 

observed, it does require that you have to previously 

receive special education related services.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about an exception if, 

in fact, the school district admits that they can't do 

anything for this child?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, then, Your Honor, that 

comes under Section B of the same section, 20 U.S.C.

1412(a)(10)(B), where the school district does not 

believe it can provide the service, then it will consent 

to a private school and will give reimbursement because 

that will be the equivalent of the free appropriate 

public education. We are just talking about cases where 

there has not yet been -- where the school believes they 

can provide it. The parent and the child disagree.

 Now, there are two other arguments that I 

want to address. One, recognizing that the language 

seems to support the petitioner's position. They argue 

that, in fact, they did get special education and 

related services because for the years 1997 and 1998 and 

1998-1999, we settled with them and we did pay the 

tuition. But Paragraph 17 of each of those agreements 

specifically provided that the settlement was not to 

create any admission for future applications.

 And as this Court is aware, both under the 

Federal Rules of Evidence in its decisions in Arizona v. 

Colorado and the U.S. First International Building 

Company, if you settle, it has no probative value. All 

you do is settle the specific claim. You don't settle 

the legal issue.

 The second argument they make is, well, we 

have got an IEP. An IEP is a proposal of how we would 

service the child. And that IEP would constitute a

special education and related service. But an IEP which 

the parent rejects could never be a special education 

related system. You have to be in the system receiving 

it.

 And indeed, in Section 1414 of U.S.C., it 

specifically provides if you reject the IEP, you've 

waived any right to a free and appropriate public 

education. So once you do that, it ends the discussion.

 I have a few minutes and I'm going to 

reserve that time for a possible reply.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. GARDEPHE, 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. GARDEPHE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 When a child with a learning disability has 

been denied a free and appropriate public education, 

which is what happened here, IDEA authorizes an award of 

private school tuition reimbursement, whether or not the 

child previously receives special education related 

services under the authority of a public agency. The 

Board's argument that it can both deny space and remain 

not liable for private school tuition reimbursement is

not compatible with the statute or with this Court's 

jurisprudence. 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii) did not overrule 

Burlington and did not impose the Hobson's choice in 

that case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did it do, then? What 

meaning do you give to it?

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, Congress was 

focused on the public school context. And the language 

in (C)(ii), which refers to previously received, is 

intended as a setup for (C)(iii). When you get to 

(C)(iii), you get the notice requirements. That's what 

Congress had in mind. That's why the reference is 

there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

It makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which 

authorizes the enrollment in a private school and 

payment for that. And it is prefaced with a condition: 

If the parents of a child with a disability who 

previously received special education and related 

services under the authority of the public agency, 

enroll the child in a private -- the implication is if 

there were parent of a child who was not so enrolled, 

this provision does not apply. So then you fall back on 

the fact that the old provision covered in our cases 

would have applied but that makes this meaningless.

I mean if you say that our prior cases 

overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the 

limitation serve?

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, the first 

question is whether that is intended to be exclusive. 

And I don't think it was, because the "only if" language 

is not there. And the "only if" language is actually 

used in IDEA in multiple places. And Congress knew how 

to say only if it intended, if it intended --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where else does it say that 

the city will pay for the cost of a private education 

except there? That's the only place it says it. And 

part of the requirements for getting it is that the 

child was receiving service at a public institution.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, Congress did not 

intend that exclusive language. If it had, it would 

have used the "only if" language.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't Congress 

adequately give the equivalent of what you call the 

"only if" language when it began (iii) by saying the 

cost of reimbursement described in clause two? The 

reimbursement described in clause two is described in 

terms of the clause that Justice Scalia is zeroing in 

on.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Because, Your Honor, the

context is public school. That is the situation that 

Congress was seeking to address, and that's why you 

have --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. I'm just not 

getting this. Can you rephrase that?

 MR. GARDEPHE: Yes. If you look at 

(C)(iii), Your Honor, it obviously repeatedly refers to 

prior to the removal of a child from the public school. 

So Congress was clearly focused on and it was intending 

to give guidance to the courts in their equitable -- in 

exercising their equitable powers. So in the context of 

a child who was in public school, these are the types of 

notice and cooperation things the court should take into 

consideration.

 The question, Your Honor, is whether they 

intended this to be the exclusive vehicle by which 

tuition reimbursement could be obtained? And the answer 

to that, Your Honor, is no. And the reason why the 

answer is no is because there is no "only if" language.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you read --

hypothesize two statutes: One, the statute before the 

phrase "who previously received special education" was 

added and the statute after? You read both of those 

statutes the same way; right?

 MR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor, I don't.

Because the question is, does that language serve any 

purpose? And my answer to that, the language in 

(C)(ii), "previously had received," yes, it serves the 

purpose. The purpose is it gives factual context for 

what comes in (C)(iii).

 The other thing I would like to say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand. 

You read "who previously received special education 

services," and you say that includes who previously did 

not receive special education services.

 MR. GARDEPHE: No. What I'm saying is that 

that provides the context for what follows in (C)(iii). 

The context it provides is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There would be no 

reason for Congress to put that language in if the same 

right to reimbursement existed if the child had not 

previously received special education services.

 MR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. The point of 

that language is to provide the backdrop for (C)(iii) 

where Congress did intend to give guidance to courts in 

the exercise of the equitable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because your friend 

reads that the exact opposite way and says, since 

(C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public 

school, that that's a limitation on how you should read

(C)(ii).

 MR. GARDEPHE: I understand that, Your 

Honor. But the question is whether -- it really boils 

down to if Congress intends to address the full --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that case, isn't 

it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says 

"Reimbursement for Private School Placement"? It 

doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement 

when the child previously attended public school.

 MR. GARDEPHE: But, Your Honor, (C)(ii) is 

not exhaustive. Let me give an example.

 I'm sure this Court would agree that the 

requirement, the second requirement in Burlington that 

the private placement has to be appropriate is the law 

in this land. And (C)(ii) doesn't set forth that 

requirement. (C)(ii) does not set forth that 

requirement. And what that says to me is that (C)(ii) 

was never intended by Congress to be exhaustive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That just means that 

(C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues 

that might arise. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't 

address exactly what its title says, "Reimbursement for 

Private School Placement."

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, I believe it's 

probative on the issue of whether Congress intended

(C)(ii) to set forth the requirements for private school 

tuition reimbursement and all the factual context in 

which that could be rendered.

 I do want to address one point, which is 

that did Congress deal with this issue later? That is 

to say, in terms of the notice factors that it set forth 

in (C)(iii), which I have argued to you applied to 

parents whose children have been in public school. The 

answer to that question, Your Honor, is, yes, they did. 

They addressed it in 1415(f)(1)(B), which require the 

2004 amendments to IDEA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that set 

forth?

 MR. GARDEPHE: 1415(f)(1)(B) -- I'm sorry, 

Your Honor, it's not in the appendix to the solicitor 

general's brief. But at 1415(f)(1)(B), Your Honor, what 

that provision requires is that parents, prior to a due 

process hearing, must meet with the IEP team, they must 

meet with the school district, they must lay out their 

complaints about the IEP, and the statute provides give 

the school district an opportunity to resolve the 

complaint.

 So Congress did not deal with the full 

waterfront in the 1997 amendments. It returned to this 

issue in 2004 and imposed those notice and cooperation

requirements that, as I've argued to you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were those 

provisions at issue when this dispute arose? They are 

the 2004 amendments --

MR. GARDEPHE: These were 2004 amendments, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You haven't identified the 

statutory provision that you think provides the 

authority for the payment in this case.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, I believe it 

begins with 1400(d)(1)(A) and 1412(A)(1); both of which 

impose the requirement on school districts to make 

available the free and appropriate public education for 

the child. I believe it begins there. It then 

continues to 1415 (i)(2)(C)(3), which is the provision 

that grants courts to -- sorry, grants such relief as 

the court determines is appropriate. There is no 

evidence either in the 1997 amendments or in its 

legislative history that there was an intent to appeal 

or override that remedy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it's how 

broadly you read legislative history. I thought there 

was a statement by Representative Castle that this would 

limit the payments that school districts had to make.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Yes, Your Honor, and I think

with respect to the children in the public school 

system, if you read (C)(3) -- and again these are 

permissive -- but if (C)(3) is applied, then I think 

Representative Castle's comments make perfect sense 

because they provide for certain notice obligations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when it comes to 

reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place 

their child in the public school are in better shape 

than the parent who place their child in public school 

and then want to remove him.

 MR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. And the 

reason for that is, there was case law preceding the 

1997 amendments that imposed reasonableness 

reasonableness and cooperation requirements on parents 

even before the 1997 amendments came into effect. As I 

did mention, after 2004 those requirements were now 

statutory, but the reality is as a matter of case law, 

it was already very clear in 1997 that if you didn't 

give notice to the school district, if you didn't 

cooperate in the formation of an IEP, you were not going 

to get tuition reimbursement. And of course that flows 

directly from, in particular, Carter's statement that 

the reimbursement remedy is subject to equitable 

considerations.

 So it has always been the law that if a

parent does not cooperate, does not give notice, does 

not cooperate in the formation of an IEP, that they will 

not get -- or that the court has the discretion to deny 

the tuition reimbursement remedy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But cooperation does 

not require sending the child to the public school.

 MR. GARDEPHE: No, Your Honor. I think it's 

clear that Congress never intended, to quote Justice 

Scalia, that parents would be required to place their 

child in a patently inappropriate placement in order to 

qualify for tuition reimbursement, and to address 

Justice Alito's point, Your Honor, we don't know --

whether it's 10 days or 11 days or 1 day -- we don't 

know. We can draw some guidance, I suppose, from the 

ten- day requirement in (C)(3), but that's by no means 

clear. The parents can give notice ten days before the 

school day begins -- a school year began -- that they 

find the placement inappropriate. So this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well in my case they 

would note have received any benefits, under the terms 

of the statute.

 MR. GARDEPHE: But Your Honor, it highlights 

that if they can place the child in for one day, this is 

an utterly meaningless provision that Congress never 

could have intended to require because it serves no

purpose. And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why your 

friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make 

clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is 

not able to provide the appropriate public education. I 

mean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there --

even if it was describing as you say the most common 

situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it 

doesn't serve that purpose at least?

 MR. GARDEPHE: Let me give an example that 

highlights my point. I place my child in the 

kindergarten in public school for one day. I then 

satisfy the statute, previously have received special 

education-related services. Five years later I can 

still rely on that. Ten years later, I can still rely 

on that. It's a talisman. It can't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you're saying 

is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going 

to be a hurdle in some cases.

 MR. GARDEPHE: It doesn't serve any useful 

purpose, Your Honor, and if it doesn't serve any useful 

purpose there is no reason to believe that Congress 

intended it to have that effect.

it serves is allow the school district to show what it

can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical 

statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to 

see if the plan that the public school has developed is 

going to work or not going to work, that the impartial 

hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete 

setting.

 MR. GARDEPHE: This Court has addressed that 

balance in Burlington, and the answer was no, the 

statute does not require that parents place their child 

in an inappropriate place.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the whole 

point is the statute was then amended after Burlington. 

So to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to 

me to be very compelling on the question of what the 

amended statute provided.

 MR. GARDEPHE: But again, Your Honor, there 

is no evidence in that amendment that it was intended to 

be exclusive or intended to be exhaustive of the 

circumstances and factual context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I agree -- Im 

not sure I would agree with you that you could get 

special services which --in third grade and then come 

back 10 years later and get private school tuition. I 

would really read this as saying if the parents of a 

child who previously received special education under

the authority, enroll the child in a public elementary 

school -- I think that there has to be a temporal 

connection between the prior receipt and the enrollment. 

I don't think you can go back 10 years.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Let me go back --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to read it 

that way, anyway.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Let me address that, Your Honor. 

What that would mean, then, I suppose, is that parents 

would be required each year to put their child in a 

public school for some period of time to qualify, and 

then place their kid in private school if they didn't --

and then you're talking about a disruption --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in the private 

school reimbursement you're in the private school 

reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later. 

Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today.

 I don't understand you assertion that 

somehow this would amount to repeal by implication. The 

provision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems 

to me is just like a provision for, for a court's 

exercise of its equitable powers. "Shall grant such 

relief as the court determines is appropriate" -- if a 

court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and 

then there is a statute that's passed which renders that

equitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say 

that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by 

implication. It's just that what is appropriate depends 

upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at 

the time that the relief is sought.

 MR. GARDEPHE: The point we are trying to 

make, Your Honor, is that in light of Burlington, which 

obviously Congress had knowledge of when it enacted the 

1997 amendments, is it credible to believe that they 

would have restricted, limited, overruled the holding of 

Burlington, and never said a word about it?

 JUSTICE BREYER: But they have (b). What 

about (b)?

 See look, there are two situations. 

Situation (a) is that the school district thinks they 

can give them a good education, adequate. Then he 

should go and try it out, and if by the way the school 

district just can't do it, then (b). So what's been 

wrong with that scheme? Why doesn't that cover the 

waterfront?

 MR. GARDEPHE: There is no evidence that 

Congress intended a tryout period.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just the language -- the 

language.

 MR. GARDEPHE: It's not just language.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If they just can't do it 

then their job is to put the kid in a district --

MR. GARDEPHE: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in a place that can do 

it. And if their argument, which is your case, is it 

they object to the facility, then have an argument about 

that, about whether it should be this private school or 

that private school. That's what it seems to me your 

case is about, and that's why I think B.

MR. GARDEPHE: In a perfect world, Your 

Honor, school districts who are confronted with a 

situation would always make the decision to place the 

child in private schools at public expense, but 

unfortunately there are disagreements between school 

districts and parents about what is appropriate, and 

then sometimes school districts don't do what they are 

supposed to do under the statute and in fact the city's 

interpretation here would incentivize school districts 

not to provide services because if they never provided 

services they wouldn't be liable for the reimbursement. 

Again, this can't be what Congress intended.

 I did want to back up my assertion about the

JUSTICE BREYER: (b), that's my question, 

(b). I thought you were right. Until I heard that. 

Then I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it, 

judge, is what I heard, because in the situation where 

the school district has not provided there is another 

section of the statute that takes care of the child. 

That's what I want to hear your response to.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Your Honor, that relies on 

the good faith of the school district. (b) relies on, 

(a)(10)(B) and B relies on the good faith of the school 

district to make a determination that they can't provide

the services. That's not always going to happen. There 

may be -- there may be a disagreement about whether they 

can provide the services or not between the school 

district and the parents.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have review 

before the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged 

bad faith, correct?

 MR. GARDEPHE: Pardon me?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have reviewed 

before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on 

the part of the school district.

 MR. GARDEPHE: Yes, Your Honor. Obviously, 

the parents contend both that the plan was not 

appropriate, and that it wasn't offered in good faith. 

But I -- I did want to back up my assertion on the "only 

if" language and -- and recite some statutory 

references. Because I believe it stems very clearly 

from the statute when you go through the provisions.

 "Only if" or "only" are used in many, many 

places 1415(f) (3)(E )(ii), 1414(a)(1)(C)ii, 

1411(b)(1)(A ), 1401(19)(C), 1415(k)(4)(C) in the '98 

version of the statute, 1413 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Bingo. You got me on that.

that Congress knew how to say "only if." They didn't do

that here, because they had no intention of creating an 

exclusive remedy.

 And this Court said in Winkelman that courts 

should be cautious in reading into the statute an 

implicit limitation, and this limitation goes to what 

the Court also said in Winkelman is the primary mandate.

 Finally, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what was that 

primary mandate?

 MR. GARDEPHE: The primary mandate was to 

provide or -- or make available a free and appropriate 

public education to every child with learning 

disabilities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no issue of 

mainstreaming in this case at all; right?

 MR. GARDEPHE: There is not, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Neither of the 

options are mainstream options?

 MR. GARDEPHE: That's correct, Your Honor, 

and that's at Second Circuit Appendix 168.

 The school district here said tnat the 

child's disabilities could not be addressed in a 

mainstream setting, so there is no mainstream issue 

here.

chose to carve out populations of children, it did that 

in a very, very direct way. It did that in 

1412(a)(1)(B) where it lays out very limited exceptions 

for children who do not receive the guarantee with 

respect to a free and appropriate public education.

 The limitation is very, very clear. It's 

very, very limited to certain age groups where it would 

be inconsistent with state law, or there is an 

incarcerated child. But there is no other place that 

Congress carved out populations of children other than 

in 1412(a)((1)((B), and there is no reason to believe 

that Congress intended in a backdoor fashion to carve 

out the populations of children, some of which were 

mentioned in the argument of my adversary.

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Petitioner takes the position that a school 

district may both refuse to provide a child with a 

disability with an appropriate public placement and 

refuse to pay for an appropriate private placement.

 This Court has twice before considered and 

twice before unanimously rejected --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, he hasn't -- he hasn't 

said that.

 MR. GARRE: I think he does in the sense, 

Your Honor, Justice Scalia, that the -- the school 

district can take the position, even if the IET that is 

proposed is inadequate and it's adjudicated to be 

inadequate, because the Schaffer presumption that was 

brought up earlier does not apply in this case. Because 

we are talking about situations where a parent can prove 

that the placement was inadequate. In that situation 

the parent cannot qualify for reimbursement unless it 

subjects his child to the inappropriate placement.

 This Court rejected that rationale in clear 

and unambiguous terms in the Burlington case. Justice 

Rehnquist put it in that case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Under a different statute.

MR. GARRE: Under a different statute but 

interpreting the fundamental requirement of the statute 

that all children with disabilities are entitled to a 

free and appropriate public education. But that 

requirement didn't change, and this is what Justice 

Rehnquist --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are interpreting some 

very general language: "Shall grant such relief as the 

court determines is appropriate."

 MR. GARRE: The -- the part of the 

Burlington case I'm referring to Justice Scalia is the 

interpretation of the fundamental requirement of 

providing free and appropriate public education. And 

what Justice Rehnquist said there -- and the unanimous 

Court agreed -- is forcing a parent to choose between 

subjecting his child to inadequate public placement or 

paying for private placement deprives the parent of his 

right to a free and appropriate public education.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So does the 

10-business-days notice requirement for people who are 

in public schools also violate Burlington, because for 

10 business days they are going to be subject to an 

inappropriate education?

 MR. GARRE: The way the 10-business-days 

requirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs --

virtually all of them are proposed towards the end of 

the school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted 

the proposed IEP during the summer. And it's at that 

point that they have to make a decision whether to 

litigate that, put their child in a private school, or 

put them into a public school.

 So the 10 business days in practice is not 

going to require the child to go into the inadequate 

placement. That was true in the fact pattern --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in a situation 

where it's not in the summer, where they say, well, 

let's see how it works, and then they go to the public 

school, I would have thought your argument also would 

say it's not -- they don't have to give notice of 10 

business days because in Burlington you said you don't 

-- you have to make available the tuition reimbursement. 

They passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10 

business days.

 MR. GARRE: And we don't -- we don't dispute 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute 

that limitation. You dispute the other one, though, 

which says they have to have previously received 

special-education services.

 MR. GARRE: In order -- in order to qualify

for reimbursment in that provision which is -- which is 

followed by the provision describing in more concrete 

detail the circumstances that courts ought to take into 

account in determining whether reimbursement is 

appropriate.

 And if I can explain the way we read Section 

1412(a)(10)((C), the first part of that subsection is 

Subsection (C)(i). That hasn't come up during the 

argument today. It is barely mentioned in Petitioner's 

brief. That subsection -- it is on page 5a in the 

appendix to the Gray brief, lays down the general rule 

-- the rule that tells school districts when they don't 

have to worry about paying reimbursement. And that is 

when they provide a free, a public -- an appropriate 

public education in the first place.

 That -- that is consistent with Burlington 

and Carter, and that lays down the general rule. School 

districts that provide an appropriate placement don't 

have to worry about reimbursement.

 Subsection (C)(ii) then goes on to identify 

a particular fact pattern which also happens to be the 

most common situation in which reimbursement claims are 

presented to the courts. And Congress in that 

situation, along with Subsections (3) and (4), provided 

the courts with more concrete guidance in determining

how to exercise their discretion in that situation.

 The legislative history supports that 

interpretation. On pages 25 to 29 of the National 

Disability Rights Network brief they explain how 

Congress in the legislative history indicates that they 

were focused on case law applying this Court's decision 

in Burlington and Carter where the students were already 

enrolled in public school.

 There is no indication whatsoever at all in 

the legislative record that anybody had in mind scaling 

back the fundamental mandate of the statute for school 

districts to provide a free and appropriate public 

education for every child.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Anywhere? I thought 

Representative Castle said that this would result on 

easing the burden on the school districts to pay 

tuitions.

 MR. GARRE: And it would, Your Honor, 

insofar as we are dealing with flushing out the 

requirements for students enrolled in public school. 

But there is no indication that Congress meant to scale 

back this Court's interpretation of the act's 

fundamental mandate to provide a free and appropriate 

public education.

 Petitioner's give-it-a-try rationale just

doesn't fit to advance its argument before this Court. 

It doesn't fit to the extent that Petitioner is 

suggesting that you have to give public school a try, 

because it's clear that the -- their interpretation 

would apply to students in public school, as well as 

private school. It would apply to all students entering 

the special education system, including the student 

who's been enrolled in public school from kindergarten 

to 11th grade.

 If he hasn't previously received 

special-education or related services, then, under 

Petitioner's view, if he's offered a grossly inadequate 

plan, he has to be subjected to that plan in order for 

his parents to qualify. And Petitioner's interpretation 

doesn't require the parents to give the proposed 

placement at issue a try. All it requires is that they 

show that they received previous special-education 

services at some point in the past.

 And that's the way it worked in Burlington; 

that's the way it worked in Carter; and that's the way 

it works in most of the cases. Students are already in 

the special education system, and they are proposed an 

IET at some point typically during the summer. And the 

parents at that time say this IET is inadequate for my 

child, and I want to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's no problem. I 

mean both sides agree that you can move to a private 

school if that's so; right?

 MR. GARRE: If you have previously received 

special- education services. But my point, Justice 

Scalia, is under Petitioner's -- the way they read the 

statute, you don't have to give the proposed placement 

at issue a try. So to the extent that this Court 

thinks, or Petitioner is arguing, that Congress wanted 

to make sure that we could better evaluate whether or 

not this proposed placement proposed placement is going 

to work for this child. That doesn't fit with the 

statutory language because in practice the students --

all they have to show is that they received services at 

some point in the past and if they have they can go into 

private school and seek reimbursement. It doesn't 

require a student to be subjected to the inadequate plan 

unless you happen to be the student who is enrolled in 

public school or enrolled in private school and you're 

entering the special education system. At that point 

then, Petitioner's interpretation requires the parents 

to enroll their child who has already been determined to 

have a learning disability in a plan that is inadequate, 

and we think that is an untenable result.

is you don't necessarily know it's inadequate until 

later in time. Right? The school board thinks it is 

adequate.

 MR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor. But 

two points about that -- first, parents who do enroll 

their children in private school at their own financial 

risk. And as Justice Scalia pointed out in his 

concurring and dissenting opinion in Winkelman, there 

are particular incentives against bringing frivolous 

reimbursement claims in this context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except those -- there are a 

lot of parents who are going to send their parents to 

private school, no matter what. They are well-heeled 

and this is just an opportunity to have New York City 

pay $30,000 of it.

 MR. GARRE: And Justice Scalia -- two points 

on that, first the statute provides in clear and 

unambiguous terms that all children with disabilities 

are entitled to a free and appropriate education. The 

child find requirement, which Section 1412 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even the child who would 

turn down the adequate education provided by the public 

schools. I don't think that was the intent of the 

statute.

 MR. GARRE: And I agree with you on that,

Justice Scalia, and that's why the way that school 

districts can avoid reimbursement is to offer an 

adequate placement in the first place. That's what 

Section 1412(a)(10)(C)(i) provides. It lays down the 

general rule. School district today talks about we need 

to have collaboration, we need to have cooperation 

during the IEP process. They hold all the cards during 

that process. And if they want to avoid reimbursement 

they should do what this Court said in the Carter case, 

that's provide the student with a free, appropriate 

public education.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If they don't have an 

adequate placement, they should not have to pay the 

freight for people who would not be coming to public 

school any way. That's what this provision prevents.

 MR. GARRE: I disagree with that, Your 

Honor. I think that's inconsistent with the statutory 

mandate to provide a free and appropriate education for 

all children with disabilities. I would say though, and 

I want to be clear on this -- even though appearance of 

students in private school or in public school who 

haven't previously received special education or related 

services qualify for reimbursement under our 

interpretation of the statute. It doesn't mean that 

they are entitled to reimbursement. In the situations

Your Honor may have in mind, where the parents genuinely 

aren't complying in good faith or genuinely aren't 

interested in sending their kids to public school, they 

only want to try to gain the system -- in those 

hypothetical situations, courts have equitable 

discretion to deny reimbursement claims, and they have 

denied those reimbursement claims.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. KOERNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

First, this particular provision, as the Chief Justice 

noted, is called payment for private school placements 

where they don't have the consent of the local 

education. Any reasonable reading of that is that it's 

all encompassing. And any person who has to apply has 

to satisfy those provisions. Second, this statute did 

not overrule Burlington or Carter. In those cases the 

children were already receiving special services. Now 

it could be in a future case someone would speak to 

extend those cases, but Congress has now spoken to make 

sure that Burlington and Carter go no further than you 

have previously held. Third, there is an assumption

that the program is going to be defective from day one. 

But that's contrary to this Court's decision in Schaffer 

which presumes the good faith of the individuals who 

propose in program. And that is the heart of the entire 

case. Fourth, let's assume, for example, that someone 

can create an ambiguity in this case. Citing the 

Arlington case, in which you placed yourself in the 

position of the local education officer, when you look 

at this particular section -- and particularly C double 

2 -- double i and triple i. Would you, in that 

position, understand that it doesn't really mean what it 

says, that previously received special education 

services was only meant to cover the people already in 

the system and was not intended to cover people outside 

the system. That isn't what it says. More importantly, 

the ambiguity is clearly not obvious. So how would a 

local officer who has to understand whether or not to 

place the funds at risk know whether or not in complying 

with this particular situation, it was explicit or 

implicit?

 JUSTICE ALITO: During the period between 

Burlington and the enactment of this statute, would you 

have any doubt about your potential obligation to 

reimburse a parent -- during the period of Burlington 

and the enactment of the statute, would the school board

have had doubt about its potential liability for 

reimbursement, in a situation like this?

 MR. KOERNER: I think so. I think, because 

of Burlington and Carter, where the children were 

already in the system, this would be the next step. 

Would we have presented to you the fact that you 

shouldn't expand it? Probably. Would I know what you 

would conclude? No, but the statute eliminated that 

entire discussion. It is clear. But again, there is a 

very big spending clause -- as I mentioned in my earlier 

presentation, if it's so ambiguous that you can read out 

a specific provision, how can that ambiguity not go down 

to the benefit of the city through it's local education 

system?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this statute 

was also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in 

which case it wouldn't have spending clause notice 

argument.

 MR. KOERNER: No, the -- this is just a 

grant provision, Your Honor. It's not premised on any 

constitutional provision. It's a grant where funds are 

provided to the local education district, and in return 

they agree to comply with all the conditions set forth 

in the IDEA. There are no constitutional limits. Thank 

you very much.
