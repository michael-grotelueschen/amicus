CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

Welcome back.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEVENSON: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't changed your 

mind in the interim, have you? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. STEVENSON: No, Justice Scalia, I 

haven't. I do want to emphasize -- yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you start -- I 

know that Enmund and Tison has to do with death 

eligibility with respect to adults, but it does draw a 

line between death eligibility with respect to 

intentionality or not, or recklessness. 

Assuming for the sake of argument that some 

of us might be interested in whether a line should be 

created for juveniles who intended or didn't intend 

death, with respect to their eligibility for life 

without parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how

would we write that? Would -- would we just import all 

the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence? Or would we say 

something different with respect to juveniles? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, I -- I think you --

you could do that. In fact, in Graham, the Court makes 

these statements that they're trying to exempt and 

shield juveniles who did not kill, quote, "or did not 

intend to kill." And that language could be a basis for 

organizing the Court's thinking on this issue. 

And, obviously, in this case where there 

wasn't a requirement of the specific intent to kill that 

was required in the Alabama case, that -- that might 

dictate a certain different outcome. I think the 

challenge with that is that juvenile status, juvenile 

intent, is a much more complicated issue, and that for 

many of the same reasons that are problematic with how 

kids function at the first stage of these trials, it 

would be hard --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That has to do with your 

general rule, which -- which we shouldn't impose it at 

all. 

MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's right. 

But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if we go even to 

your second step rule -Â­

MR. STEVENSON: I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assuming we 

bifurcate --

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, I hear --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- then -- then we still 

have the question of when do we permit a mandatory 

imposition of --

MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think there's no 

question, Justice Sotomayor, there would be more 

justification for those crimes where there is an intent 

to kill, because this Court in its jurisprudence had 

recognized that kind of hierarchy which you've outlined 

and is exhibited in Enmund and then in the Court's other 

cases. 

Now, it's true that in -- in Arkansas under 

this provision, an adult would still be subject to the 

death penalty, because they used this "recklessness" 

language so that even the focus on "intent to kill" that 

we addressed in Enmund might not categorically protect 

these other juveniles, which I think the Court can 

rightly acknowledge have diminished culpability. 

It's also worth noting that in many of these 

States where there are children being sentenced to life 

without parole, there is no confusion about this. They 

are being convicted of homicide offenses for which there

is no intent to kill. No dispute. Those jurisdictions, 

those provisions would likely be addressed by the Enmund 

analysis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in fact, Jackson 

was convicted with a non-intent, just a felony --

MR. STEVENSON: Well, it would -- you're 

absolutely right that it's felony murder, but it's a 

little different. In Arkansas, if you cooperate or give 

aid to someone who commits a crime, even if it's not 

intentional, if it's a reckless indifference to life, 

you can be found guilty of what is capital felony 

murder. And the Arkansas court has interpreted that to 

mean for an adult you'd be subject to the death penalty. 

And here Kuntrell Jackson was subject to life without 

parole. 

The State argues that there was support for 

that and even some kind of intent, because there was a 

dispute about the words -- just quickly, you know, these 

three --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't matter. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The jury didn't have 

to -- all the jury found was that he didn't meet his 

affirmative burden of proving. 

MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. That's

exactly right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he didn't counsel --

they didn't make a finding --

MR. STEVENSON: That's exactly right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as to what words were 

used and what the intent was. 

MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's exactly 

right. And the dissenters at the Arkansas Supreme Court 

relied on that in making the determination that they did 

not conclude that intent had been established here in a 

way that would support the judgment that -- that we 

seek. 

But that goes back to one of the earlier 

questions that was posed about what happens at the guilt 

phase. Is it -- Justice Kennedy, it is true that in 

Alabama and in most jurisdictions, you would not be 

permitted to tell the jury what the sentencing outcome 

would be. And in many of these cases, there -- there 

isn't a lesser included. That's going to be up to 

the -- to the prosecution in -- in some of these crimes. 

And there are a range of offenses for which that would 

not help a jury kind of deal with the -- the kind of --

the choice that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is that really -- is that 

true under the law of Arkansas? In most jurisdictions,

I would think if -- if someone's charged with the 

highest degree of homicide, the defense can request an 

instruction on -- you don't have to have a separate 

charge on a lesser included offense; the defense can 

request an instruction on lesser included offenses if it 

would be supported by the evidence. 

MR. STEVENSON: It -- it would really 

depend, Justice Alito, on the facts. For example, one 

of our provisions in Alabama makes the -- the crime sort 

of a -- a homicide, a capital crime, if the victim is 

under the age of 14. You're not entitled to some 

diminished culpability, some other kind of homicide 

charge unless there's something else going on that would 

support that. Our laws and this Court's law say there 

has to be evidence in support of that lesser included 

instruction before the court is constitutionally 

obligated to provide it. And so, for that reason, it's 

not a given that that would happen. 

And I think the challenge with the mandatory 

scheme that we've been talking about in both of these 

cases is that it does put the sentencer in a very 

difficult situation, where there is no ability to 

consider the age; there is no ability to consider the 

factual diminished culpability that might exist in one 

case or the other; no ability in either of these cases

to consider the fact that an older codefendant got a 

lesser sentence. That there is something else going on 

here that -- that goes beyond just the particulars of 

this crime and this particular offender's culpability. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Before we leave it, 

could -- what was the instruction the jury was given? 

Was it you find him guilty if he was deliberately 

indifferent, if he was recklessly -- what are the words 

they used? 

MR. STEVENSON: It's a reckless indifference 

to life. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If he was recklessly 

indifferent to life. 

MR. STEVENSON: And if he gave aid or 

assistance to someone in that capacity, and the 

question, Justice Breyer, turned on -- on this statement 

made that the -- the codefendant who testified against 

Kuntrell Jackson --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. 

MR. STEVENSON: -- initially told the police 

he -- that he came in and said, "we ain't playin'," and 

then he testified that he said, "I thought you all were 

playing."

indifference means that. Meaning, if he knew they were

carrying guns, doesn't that make him liable for the 

reckless indifference --

MR. STEVENSON: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether he thought 

they would use them or not? 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, and that's what the 

State argued here, is that the fact that he had 

knowledge of this gun and that they went in there made 

him guilty of reckless indifference even though it 

didn't create the kind of intent to kill that -- that we 

typically require for these kinds of showings. 

That's again why there was a significance 

around this language, that if you come in and you say 

something declaratory that suggests that it's directed 

at the victim, it might help kind of support that intent 

finding if you don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Reckless -- reckless 

indifference to life suffices for the death penalty for 

an adult. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. What -- what the Court 

does --

JUSTICE BREYER: But -- so, you'd -- if 

that's right, then we'd -- you would have to argue on, 

if we took this tack --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- which I don't know that 

you could --

MR. STEVENSON: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- but that you cannot 

sentence a juvenile to life without parole for murder 

unless he, e.g., specifically intends the death or 

something equivalent, but something stronger than 

reckless indifference to life. 

MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's correct, 

Justice Breyer. And, again, I think that this Court 

knows its own precedents, but as you'll recall, Tison 

followed Enmund, and in Tison v. Arizona is when the 

Court allowed there to be this kind of room around this 

intent standard in the way that you've just described. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So, you would draw the line 

at -- at a specific intent to kill? 

MR. STEVENSON: Again, my -- I would -- I 

would categorically prohibit no matter what the intent 

is. I think particularly for children at this age. 

What I think this case highlights, what's meant by "I 

thought you all were playing" versus "we ain't playin'" 

isn't a very good indicator of whether someone should be 

subject to life without parole. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What if it was a lot 

clearer? What if they had said, okay, before we go in,

let's understand what's going on here; Shields has 

got -- has got the sawed-off shotgun, and if we need to 

use it, we'll use it; we'll do whatever it takes to --

to bring this off? 

MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think the evidence --

JUSTICE ALITO: There might not be a 

specific intent --

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- to kill there. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think the evidence 

that would support a finding of aggravated murder would 

obviously be stronger, but even there -- and this is 

what the Court points out in -- in Roper, the -- that 

the decisionmaking of children, that the thinking of 

children is categorically different. They're not 

thinking three steps ahead; they're not thinking about 

consequences; they're not actually experienced enough 

with the world to understand how they deal with their 

frustrations in the same way that an adult is. And so, 

their judgments about what they intend to do, their 

declarations, mean something very, very different. 

And one of the factors that we haven't 

talked about, but I just want to emphasize, is it's not 

just their inherent internal attributes; it's also the 

external circumstances that they find themselves in.

Kuntrell Jackson was born in a household where there was 

nothing but violence and guns and people shooting each 

other. His grandmother shot his uncle. His mother shot 

a neighbor. His brother shot someone. They were all 

put to jail. 

But, unlike an adult, these children don't 

have the ability to escape. A child of 14 cannot leave 

his criminogenic or violent environment. They have no 

control over that. And because --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- I'm sorry; go ahead. 

MR. STEVENSON: And just because of that, I 

think it does reinforce why even their judgments, their 

so-called intentional judgments, reflect a very 

different kind of understanding of their character, 

their potential for rehabilitation, than it would with 

an adult. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: One of the arguments that 

the State makes is that when you look at all these 

numbers, the number that is most different between this 

pair of cases and Graham is the denominator. And I'm 

wondering whether you would address that. What kind of 

denominator we should be using here and how it compares 

to the denominators that we've used in past cases. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think, first of all, 

it is true that homicide offenses are -- are less common

than non-homicidic offenses. In Graham, this Court 

looked at a range of non-homicide crimes, and that was a 

huge number, 300,000. That's largely because we were 

talking about a multitude of offenses and here we are 

talking about a single offense. 

I think the fact that there have been 7,000 

children arrested for -- for homicide and non-negligent 

murder -- manslaughter over this 40-year time period and 

only 79 children have been sentenced to life without 

parole is a significant fact that reinforces our claim 

that this is a very rare sentence. That is 1 percent. 

And the fact that it's over 40 years, that's also true 

for the 79. We got to that --

JUSTICE ALITO: It's arrests to start out 

with; it's not -- it's not convictions. 

MR. STEVENSON: That's right. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And it's not for the type of 

offense for which one could be sentenced to life 

imprisonment without parole. It's a broader category of 

homicide offenses. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, you're absolutely 

right, Justice Alito, on the first point, that these are 

arrest data. Of course, that's what we used in Graham, 

because, again, in this cohort, conviction data simply 

is very difficult to get. But it's not true that only

children arrested for aggravated murder are subject to 

life without parole. As I've mentioned, in the States 

that create the largest population of these kids, all 

kinds of homicide can subject you to life without 

parole. So, it is true --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it true that in the 

States that permit life without parole for a minor 

homicide -- a minor murder, a person -- a minor 

convicted of -- of murder, that that is permitted for 

every non-negligent homicide? 

MR. STEVENSON: In some States, yes. 

That is, to the extent that you are -- you get convicted 

of murder, some of these States -- South Dakota and 

Pennsylvania come to mind -- whether it's first degree 

or second degree, you're subject to life imprisonment 

without parole and it is a mandatory sentence. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Some States, but not in all 

of the States. 

MR. STEVENSON: Not in all States. That's 

true. 

JUSTICE ALITO: That's a really -- you've 

got a very imprecise denominator. You have arrests --

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- for a broader category of 

offenses.

3  JUSTICE ALITO: We don't know how much 

4 smaller that number would be if we narrowed it down 

appropriately, do we? 

6  MR. STEVENSON: Well, we can't get beyond 

7 what the data tell us. But I want to suggest it's no 

8 less precise than what this Court had to deal with in 

9 Graham. In Graham, we talked about 380,000 non-homicide 

offenders. Half of that class were people convicted of 

11 drug crimes, which no one has suggested would subject 

12 you to life without parole. Another 60,000 were 

13 convicted of assaults. And kids get into fights all the 

14 time. But we used the aggregate of all of those numbers 

when we made that comparison. 

16  So, I'd actually argue that we're dealing 

17 here with a category definition that is much more 

18 precise than what we dealt with in Graham. 

19  And, Justice Kagan, to return to your 

question we do have some precedents that help us with 

21 this. In Coker v. Georgia, this Court was trying to 

22 make an assessment about the propriety of the death 

23 penalty for the crime of rape. And what this Court 

24 noted was that 9 out of 10 of the juries that made decisions 

about life versus death chose life. And there we were 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 talking about kind of a death rate, if you will, of 10 

2 percent. Here, with a larger universe, we're talking 

3 about a rate of 1 percent. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: How do you -- think about 

5 this, which is not your favorite position, but it's a 

6 position you've taken. It's -- it's the same question I 

7 asked before. If I say, well, doesn't there have to be 

8 some line, 3 years old, you'll say "of course." Ten 

9 years old? You say "of course," but nobody -- there's 

10 no problem with sentencing 10-year-olds to life without 

11 parole. Twelve years old? Well, hum. Now, maybe, your 

12 opponents want to defend that one. Thirteen years old, 

13 14 years old? And, of course, I'm walking right into 

14 the buzz saw: Well, leave it up to the legislature. 

15  But suppose that -- that there's something 

16 to be said for not leaving it up to the legislature, at 

17 least for the numbers that were in that range. But how 

18 would you defend the cutoff at -- for no life without 

19 parole at, say, 14, older than 14, rather than older 

20 than 15, rather than older than 13? 

21  What kind of argument is there that isn't 

22 totally random for picking that number as the age below 

23 which you cannot impose life without parole even for the 

24 most horrendous murder?

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. I think two nonrandom 

arguments can be made for two ages. I'll start with the 

young age of 14. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MR. STEVENSON: When you consider the fact 

that 13 jurisdictions have thought about this and have 

all but one set the age above 14, I think we can then 

rely on that to make a determination that if there's a 

minimum age, it's above 14. 

I think we can also, consistent with this 

Court's precedents, look at the frequency of the 

sentence for this population. Most States have never 

sentenced a child to -- to life without parole for a 

crime at 14. They've just never done it. Thirty-two 

States, there are no children 14 and younger serving 

life without parole. And so, I think that allows this 

Court in a very nonrandom way to defend that judgment. 

But I also think a nonrandom argument can be 

made to draw the line at 18; that is, offenders under 

the age of 18. That's exactly what this Court has done 

in Roper. It's what this Court has done in Graham. 

What we've relied on about juvenile status is applicable 

to that pool. I concede that these other indicia are 

not quite as compelling. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Eighteen, you use for a lot

3  MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Not 79. 

5  MR. STEVENSON: That's right. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And the difficulty is that. 

7  In Roper, it said, well, don't worry so much about --

8 about not having the death penalty -- the other one. 

9 Don't worry so much about it because there's always life 

10 without parole. 

11  MR. STEVENSON: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And the fact that 

13  18-year-olds or 17-year-olds in many respects are quite 

14  mature or at least can be. 

15  MR. STEVENSON: 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: 

17  not quite right. 

18  MR. STEVENSON: 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 

And so, that makes 18 seem 

Well --

Or -- but there's a problem 

20  with each of them. So, that's where I'm trying--

21  MR. STEVENSON: Yes, but I guess just on 

22  that point, Justice Breyer, I think you're right that 

23  the indicia are more complicated, but I want to just 

24  stress that they're less meaningful here, because with

1  mandatory sentences, they don't tell you the same thing 

2  they do in these other contexts. 

3  But I also think it's true that we have 

4  recognized that up until the age of 18, you are a 

juvenile. Your status is coherent with what the Court 

6  has recognized in these other cases. And so, I do think 

7  it's defensible there. While it's true that you're more 

8  developed than a child of 14 or a child of 10, it's also 

9  true that you're not an adult. And we make that 

distinction in lots of ways. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other 

12  distinction that you have been able to think of, growing 

13  out of the literature or growing out of the law, where 

14  the cutoff for some roughly comparable series of things 

is between 14 and 15 or between 14 and 16, or something 

16  like that? 

17  MR. STEVENSON: Well, yes, this Court in 

18  Thompson made a distinction between offenders that were 

19  under the age of 15, 15 and younger, then older 

offenders. And for 20 some years, the law in this 

21  country was you could not subject younger offenders to 

22  the death penalty in ways that you could older 

23  offenders. And so, there's clearly precedent for that, 

24  and we've appended also lots of statutes, I mean, that 

also make those kinds of distinctions. I mean, we do

1  draw these lines frequently in a range of areas, not 

2  just dealing with the constitutional questions that 

3  we're dealing with here. 

4  But just kind of to complete my analysis, 

Justice Kagan, about these comparisons, the other point 

6  that I'll -- I'll reference is that, in Thompson, this 

7  Court was also struggling over this question about 

8  frequency and rarity. And what the Court did there is 

9  actually look at the number of juveniles that were 

sentenced to death under the age of 16 that were on 

11  death row and compared them to the number of people on 

12  death row at the time, and they noted that it was 

13  .36 percent of the population of people on death row. 

14  If you did the same thing here, the 

Sentencing Project reports that there are over 41,000 

16  people in the United States serving sentences of life 

17  imprisonment without parole. And if you compare our 

18  number of 79 to that, that's actually, again, a lower 

19  proportion of people serving life without parole than 

the Court found to be constitutionally significant in 

21  Thompson. 

22  So, I think Thompson and Coker all reinforce 

23  what we're saying here, that this is an exceedingly rare 

24  sentence where the majority of States have never chose 

to impose it. And that would provide a basis for this

2  JUSTICE ALITO: In Coker --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stevenson, you're 

4  making an argument now in Jackson's case, and Jackson 

was the felony murder case. And I think at least in 

6  your brief, you made the argument it was just 

7  happenstance, bad luck, that in Jackson's case the shop 

8  attendant was killed. And in Graham's case, the person 

9  who was assaulted survived. 

But your argument to us seems to make no 

11  distinction between the two cases. 

12  MR. STEVENSON: No -- no, I -- I don't 

13  intend to do that Justice Ginsburg. I think -- I think 

14  there is a distinction. There's no question that 

there's a stronger argument that, by traditional 

16  measures, there's lower culpability in Kuntrell 

17  Jackson's case. He was not found to have specifically 

18  intended to kill. In the State of Alabama, he could not 

19  have been subject to life without parole, and there are 

States where he would not be subject to that, based on 

21  his degree of culpability. 

22  I -- I guess my -- my point is, is that even 

23  there, there is a challenge if the Court wants to engage 

24  in that kind of thinking. What children intend, because 

they are children, is a very complicated question. It's 

22

Official 

1  a very different question. 

2  I don't mean to concede that it's an 

3  irrelevant question. I think the Court absolutely can 

4  and should conclude that there is diminished culpability 

in the Jackson case, and that's evident based on the 

6  facts of the crime. Actually, it was the dissenter 

7  in the Jackson case that made this observation about the 

8  consequences of crime. And, of course, for many 

9  non-homicide crimes, there are these kind of fortuities 

that sometimes prevent death wonderfully, and we were 

11  grateful for that. 

12  My point is that the differences between 

13  children and adults, these internal attributes, if you 

14  will, these deficits in judgment, are not 

crime-specific. The person who intends to kill doesn't 

16  actually have any better judgment, any more character, 

17  any more maturity, any more impulse control than the 

18  person who doesn't. And a way of characterizing a rule 

19  would be to recognize that and -- and to create a 

categorical ban. 

21  If there are no further questions, I'll --

22  I'll reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

1  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

2  MR. HOLT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

3  may it please the Court: 

4  The decision below falls squarely within the 

framework of Roper and Graham, and there are three 

6  reasons to affirm this judgment: First, murder is the 

7  worst of all crimes. Society has drawn that line. 

8  Second, legislatures have the power to 

9  authorize sentences that are commensurate with crimes 

like murder. 

11  Third, Jackson has not demonstrated any 

12  consensus in this case against the practice, and, in 

13  fact, there is a supermajority of States and of 

14  governments that authorize this sentence. 

The landscape of this case is -- is 

16  different than Graham, because in Graham no one was --

17  no one was killed. Terrance Graham was lucky no one was 

18  killed, because he acted with a reckless disregard for 

19  human life as well, but it's an important thing in our 

law that the law punishes the -- the result, the harm 

21  that is inflicted. 

22  And if I could, go to the Arkansas statute. 

23  Jackson was charged with the highest crime you could be 

24  charged with in Arkansas -- it was capital felony 

murder -- in that the legislature has set out several

1  enumerated, several violent felonies that if you commit 

2  this particular crime -- and aggravated robbery is one 

3  of them -- if you commit that crime and in the course 

4  and furtherance of that, you or an accomplice act with 

extreme indifference to the value of human life during 

6  the commission of it or in the flight from it, then you 

7  are guilty of capital felony murder. 

8  So, in this case the jury was called 

9  upon -- because there were other accomplices with 

Kuntrell Jackson, they were called on to determine 

11  whether or not Kuntrell Jackson acted as an accomplice, 

12  whether he aided and assisted and whether or not he or 

13  an accomplice acted with extreme indifference to the 

14  value of human life. 

In that process, Kuntrell Jackson asserted 

16  the affirmative defense that essentially is available 

17  for capital murder. He said that, I did not have -- I 

18  was not the triggerman, and I did not -- I did not 

19  commit the homicide offense, and I did not aid or 

procure counsel. All of those are listed -- the exact 

21  words of the affirmative defense are listed in our brief 

22  at page 4. And -- but he asserted that defense. 

23  The Arkansas Supreme Court noted in its 

24  opinion that in his challenge to the sufficiency of the 

evidence, that there was sufficient evidence to convict

1  him of capital murder and that the jury was well within 

2  its right to believe that he said that he -- that when 

3  he walked in and took -- took the lead in this robbery 

4  that he said, "We ain't playin'," and after that, the 

clerk responded that she was going to call the police --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I know 

7  that this seems like block building, but I think of law 

8  as sort of logical. If you're involved in a felony and 

9  you counsel the felony where someone dies, under 

Arkansas law, you're guilty of felony murder, correct? 

11  MR. HOLT: Of capital felony murder, yes, 

12  Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. So, whether or 

14  not that he intended to counsel the crime, he was guilty 

of felony murder, unless he could prove the affirmative 

16  defense, right? 

17  MR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, obviously, he didn't 

19  prove the affirmative defense, but that doesn't mean 

that the jury actually found that he used one set of 

21  words or another. It just means that they didn't 

22  believe he had proven by his burden of proof that he had 

23  not counseled, correct? 

24  MR. HOLT: That's correct. The Arkansas 

Supreme Court said they could -- they could accept that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But not that it was an 

6  actual finding by the jury. 

7  MR. HOLT: No. No, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 

9  MR. HOLT: It was not an actual finding 

because an actual -- in regard to sentences in terms of 

11  years, we don't require that individualized 

12  responsibility that we do, for instance, in a death 

13  penalty case. So --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- so, in Arkansas, if 

a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old is in a getaway car and 

16  knowingly accepts the money that someone gets from a 

17  robbery and intends to drive off with it, and that other 

18  person shoots the teller and kills him, then that 

19  individual who is 14 years old is guilty of felony 

murder, capital felony murder? 

21  MR. HOLT: Your Honor --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: He aided. Is that right or 

23  not? 

24  MR. HOLT: Yes.

3  a gun and shoots the teller? Morally speaking. 

4  MR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

6  MR. HOLT: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if the answer to that 

8  question is "yes," what is the argument for not being 

9  able to tell that to the jury or judge who's going to 

impose the sentence? What is the argument for not 

11  allowing a judge or a jury at least to think about that 

12  question, before they have -- before imposing mandatory 

13  life without parole? 

14  MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, that -- that --

telling a jury about that doesn't go to their guilt. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I know. I mean, my 

17  obvious point is that -- that the Arkansas system, once 

18  we have he was the getaway driver or assisted the 

19  getaway driver, they must sentence him at that age, or 

despite that age, to life without parole. 

21  And so, the other side is saying, well, at 

22  the very least -- he has three other positions -- but at 

23  the very least, the Constitution -- maybe it's the Due 

24  Process Clause -- requires the sentencer to take that 

into account, the fact that he was just the

1  assistant/getaway driver and may not have thought about 

2  the murder in reality and may not have expected it in 

3  reality. Why not have to take that into account in 

4  sentencing? That's the argument. 

I want to hear directly your answer to that, 

6  which is taking the fourth or possibly the weakest of 

7  his positions or the least radical. What is your answer 

8  to that one? 

9  MR. HOLT: Your Honor, it's -- a legislative 

judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline 

11  for -- for all murderers, whether they're juvenile 

12  murderers, whether they're getaway drivers. And when 

13  you -- when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets 

14  you liability for being a capital murderer, then that's 

the -- that is the minimum sentence. 

16  What he's gotten, on account of his youth, 

17  is he's gotten -- this -- this Court decided in Roper in 

18  that he could not -- he could not get the death penalty. 

19  All of those individualized characteristics that would 

get him the lesser penalty, he doesn't even have to put 

21  on. It's swept off the table because he is not exposed. 

22  And that -- those are all those factors in terms of what 

23  he -- what he might -- that might mitigate. 

24  So, he would actually sort of be 

double-dipping to come back again and say, oh, and by

1  the way, I'm a youth, and so I should get even -- I 

2  should get not the lesser punishment; I should get the 

3  lesser, lesser punishment. 

4  So, there's a certain symmetry that this 

case has with -- with the Graham case, in that the 

6  Graham case was very specific about the way it defined 

7  itself. One commentator has made the note that the 

8  majority opinion in Graham contained the word 

9  non-homicide 47 times. 

Graham essentially said what it wasn't. It 

11  wasn't a homicide. It was that other line that society 

12  draws between homicide and every other crime. And 

13  crimes are -- the criminal statutes are scalar. There's 

14  a certain amount of culpability that's built into each 

one of those, whether it be capital murder or 

16  first-degree murder or second-degree murder. And it 

17  does go on what you know, the -- the knowledge that you 

18  have. Maturity is taken into consideration, or 

19  immaturity is taken into consideration in capital murder 

in that you can't get the worst -- if you've been shown 

21  to do these acts, you can't get the worst punishment. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the standard in 

23  Arkansas for moving a child from the juvenile system?

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was age 12. 

2  MR. HOLT: Yes. Your Honor, Arkansas has 

3  sort of a three-tier system. The age for moving into 

4  the adult system is 14. And -- but the middle-tier 

system in Arkansas is called extended juvenile 

6  jurisdiction. And in that particular case -- in those 

7  cases, the prosecutor can move to take a younger age and 

8  put in -- and it's a blended sentence between the -- and 

9  a youth is just found delinquent of a crime and not --

and not found guilty. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what are the 

12  factors the judges and prosecutors use in making that 

13  determination? 

14  MR. HOLT: Your Honor, at age 14 -- and it's 

the specific -- there are specific crimes that a 

16  prosecutor would move a case into an adult court. It is 

17  the prosecutor's discretion weighing -- there are 10 

18  different factors that include the severity of the 

19  offense, the -- and -- but they also take into 

consideration the maturity of the -- of the youth, 

21  the --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if you submit 

23  that as a justification for your scheme, why couldn't 

24  those same factors be applied to the judge -- by the 

sentencing judge after the conviction? In other words,

1  all of the -- all of the discretion is up front before

3  MR. HOLT: Well, there is discretion up 

4  front, and that is the only -- that is the only instance 

when a defendant can actually challenge a transfer, 

6  where a prosecutor decides to put it. But there are 

7  also -- so, there is -- there's discretion at the front 

8  end. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess my point is, if 

the concern is that -- that we have too indefinite 

11  standards, too few specifics to guide the judge in 

12  determining whether there should be a life sentence, the 

13  same criticism could apply to the determination to send 

14  him -- put him in the adult system at the outset. 

MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, the -- it is --

16  admittedly, it is at the discretion of the prosecutor on 

17  those ages to move it into the --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume discretion is 

19  guided by certain standards, or it's no discretion at 

all. So, there are standards. 

21  MR. HOLT: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

22  prosecutor -- that -- that decision to move it in there 

23  is challengeable. It is reviewable by a court. He 

24  moves -- the juvenile moves it to transfer it to -- back 

to juvenile. That is appealed. That was done in this 

32

Official 

1  case, and then the Arkansas -- the Arkansas Court of 

2  Appeals reviewed that decision and said that the 

3  court -- the court's decision was not erroneous. So, 

4  that -- that is the discretion that one would exercise 

on the front end. 

6  Again, on the latter end, this Court has 

7  said in Harmelin that the individualized sentencing is 

8  not required, and, in fact, the -- all of the -- all of 

9  the -- the mitigating circumstances that would -- that 

have been considered because it's -- he's -- the death 

11  penalty has been taken off the table. That's a big --

12  that's a big deal, especially in a case like this one 

13  where Kuntrell Jackson -- we believe the evidence showed 

14  that he also acted with reckless indifference to the 

value of human life, based -- based on the evidence in 

16  this case. That he would be -- by way of analogy, that 

17  he would be a Tison offender himself. 

18  But irrespective of that, the legislature in 

19  Arkansas -- it's -- the legislative judgment has been 

that the minimum sentence that a person can receive for 

21  committing a capital murder in Arkansas is life without 

22  parole. 

23  I would like to clarify one point that I 

24  think -- earlier that was made. The two other 

individuals in this particular case were -- one was a

1  cousin who testified against Mr. Jackson, and he was 15. 

2  He had turned 15 the day before this robbery. And the 

3  second, the second individual, the triggerman, was -- he 

4  was also 14, and he received a -- a sentence of life 

without parole as well. 

6  It's our position that -- as is Alabama's, 

7  that the main -- the principal justification in this 

8  case lies with the -- the retributive principle that 

9  society needs to convey the message that people like 

Laurie -- that Laurie Troup's life, the victim in this 

11  case, was more important than the money in that cash 

12  register. The harm here was irrevocable. And this kind 

13  -- the punishment for this -- it's qualitative -- death 

14  -- the death penalty is qualitatively different. 

But the punishment for -- for this crime 

16  reinforces the sanctity of human life, and it expresses 

17  the State's moral outrage that something like this could 

18  happen. We think that the respect due life is -- is 

19  what this message conveys, and it conveys it more as a 

life-without-parole sentence than it does life-without. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say the sanctity of 

22  human life, but you're dealing with a 14-year-old being 

23  sentenced to life in prison, so he will die in prison 

24  without any hope. I mean, essentially, you're making a

along your lines, is permitted by the Constitution 

6  nonetheless to make any mitigating argument he wants. 

7  And Arkansas has to do that. They have to let him make 

8  any mitigating argument he wants. 

9  And so, the argument here is basically, 

well, the same is true when a 14-year-old, because of 

11  the lack of maturity, faces life without parole. And 

12  that seems to me the hard issue in this case. Just 

13  as -- just as the death penalty is unique for anyone 

14  and, therefore, requires mitigating elements, isn't the 

life without parole special enough for an adolescent 

16  that you have to let him at least make any mitigating 

17  arguments he wants? 

18  Now, Arkansas hasn't really expressed a view 

19  in its legislation on that question, or maybe it has and 

just rejected it. But I don't know. That's -- if you 

21  want to say something about that, I'd be interested. 

22  MR. HOLT: That's -- that's not a view 

23  that -- that I know that's been expressed. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But I mean, that's 

what their brief is filled with on the other side,

1  basically. And so is Roper. 

2  MR. HOLT: Yes, Your Honor. But death is --

3  death is qualitatively different. And -- and that's 

4  been taken off the table. I think that all of -- all of 

those things that he would put to get the -- that he 

6  would -- that he would put forward to get the lesser 

7  sentence is -- initially is that he would just get a --

8  as I said, a lesser, lesser sentence. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say that Arkansas 

has no life with parole? 

11  MR. HOLT: Your Honor, the only provision --

12  and this does go to show that Arkansas has thought about 

13  this in ways, has taken deliberate steps. In its 

14  extended juvenile jurisdiction, there is the provision 

that -- that a -- for instance, a 14-year-old in this 

16  particular case, if -- if they had deemed that they 

17  would go in extended juvenile jurisdiction, could 

18  receive a life penalty, except it is life with parole, 

19  yes. So, that is -- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not available 

21  to an adult. That's only in the --

22  MR. HOLT: That's not available to an adult. 

23  No, Your Honor. 

24  As I -- as I was saying, the -- there's a 

certain constitutional symmetry to this case and to

1  Graham's case because -- because Graham committed a -- a 

2  non-homicide offense and he was a youth, and so he had 

3  twice-diminished punishment. But he only received one 

4  diminishment in his -- in his punishment, because he 

had -- he was -- he had twice-diminished culpability. 

6  In this particular case, Jackson does not have 

7  twice-diminished culpability. He has -- he is a youth. 

8  Even if he were to -- even if we were to say 

9  that, well, he didn't pull the trigger, or we can't show 

that he didn't -- that he acted -- didn't act with 

11  reckless indifference, even if we were to say that that 

12  was twice-diminished, he is still criminally 

13  responsible. There's not a -- there's not a special 

14  class of not guilty by reason of youth. He is still 

criminally responsible for what he did. 

16  And -- and a -- teenagers must know that if 

17  you commit the worst crime, you will get the worst 

18  punishment that's available under the Constitution. And 

19  so, the symmetry here is that -- that Terrance Graham 

was the lucky one. It's not that Kuntrell Jackson was 

21  the unlucky one. This is a -- when you go into a place 

22  with a sawed-off shotgun, it's a dangerous activity; 

23  it's inherently dangerous. And what was left out of the 

24  calculus a minute -- a few minutes ago was the fact that 

he could -- it's not just kill or intend to kill, but

2  And, certainly, the evidence in this case 

3  demonstrated that Kuntrell Jackson could foresee that at 

4  an armed robbery, someone could get hurt. And that's 

what the law punishes, is the result.

8  Mr. Stevenson, you have 8 minutes remaining. 

9  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

11  MR. STEVENSON: Just -- just a few points. 

12  Justice Kennedy, I just want to kind of 

13  remark, there is some literature out there about 

14  commutation in Arkansas. And it was actually quite 

common up until 1980, and this case that my colleague 

16  referenced was prior to that date. But since then, it's 

17  been very uncommon. There's only been one commutation 

18  since 2007 with the -- with the current governor, and 

19  that was for a non-homicide offense. 

I -- I also want to say, just kind of 

21  consistent with my earlier argument, that this Court did 

22  strike down mandatory death sentences in 

23  Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana for 

24  many of the reasons that the Court has highlighted here 

that made that sentence unconstitutional and

1  inappropriate. And we think that in the same way, the 

2  Court could certainly do that here. 

3  But my final point is really to just say we 

4  are not suggesting that States should not be able to 

impose very harsh punishments and very severe sentences 

6  on even children who commit these kinds of violent 

7  crimes. That's not our position. 

8  The State of Arkansas and the State of 

9  Alabama have parole boards in place. They can even 

impose sentences that give them the authority to 

11  maintain control of the lives of these children for the 

12  rest of their natural lives. 

13  What we are arguing is that they cannot do 

14  so with no hope of release, that that would be 

incompatible with child status. And that's the rule of 

16  Roper. That's the logic of Roper and Graham. It could 

17  be argued that every person is more than the worst thing 

18  they've ever done. And a policymaker and a 

19  decisionmaker might consider that in constructing what 

kind of sentences to impose and what kind of regime to 

21  create, and that's totally up to the legislatures. 

22  But what this Court has said is that 

23  children are uniquely more than their worst act. They 

24  are quintessentially children in a way that the 

Constitution requires that we respect their child

1  status. 

2  And our argument is simple. Our argument is 

3  that it would be unusual to recognize that in virtually 

4  every area of the law, but when a crime is committed, to 

simply abandon it, to simply ignore it. Roper and 

6  Graham teach us that we can't do that consistently with 

7  our Eighth Amendment prohibitions. 

8  And so, for that reason, it is unusual, and 

9  it's our judgment that it would be cruel to declare 

these children fit only to die in prison given what we 

11  now know about their status, about their development, 

12  and about their potential. 

13  And for those reasons, we would ask this 

14  Court to reverse the lower court judgments and grant 

relief in this case, Jackson v. Arkansas. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

17  Stevenson, Mr. Holt.
