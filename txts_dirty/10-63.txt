3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 10-63, Maples v. Thomas.

5             Mr. Garre.

6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8             MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10             Two factors distinguish this case from those

11 in which the Court has found cause lacking to excuse a

12 default:  First, the State itself had a direct hand in

13 the extraordinary events leading up to the default in

14 this case; and, second, the actions of Maples's

15 attorneys, which rise to the level of abandonment, are

16 not attributable to Maples under agency law or other

17 principles that this Court has invoked in determining

18 when attorney conduct may be imputed to a client.

19             For either or both of those reasons, the

20 default at issue in this case is not fairly attributable

21 to Cory Maples, and the contrary decision of the

22 Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You talk about the

24 State's role.  I assume that you're talking about there

25 is the failure to take action after the return of the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

4

1 notices.

2             MR. GARRE:  I think that's -- that's right,

3 Mr. Chief Justice.  I would couple that, though, with

4 the fact that the State initially set up a system for

5 the representation of indigent capital defendants that

6 relies extremely heavily on the good graces of

7 out-of-State counsel to represent indigent capital

8 defendants in Alabama.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, put -- putting

10 that -- that to one side, what if only one of the three

11 notices had been returned?

12             MR. GARRE:  I think -- if only one from the

13 out-of-State pro bono counsel?

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.

15             MR. GARRE:  I think that would be a

16 different case.  I think what's remarkable about this

17 case is you have both out-of-State attorneys, the

18 notices come back marked "Return to Sender -- Left Firm"

19 in an envelope, and the clerk does nothing.  And what's

20 extraordinary about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the

21 system in this case relies on the out-of-State attorneys

22 to provide --

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Who says so?  Who says so?

24 Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney,

25 and you have to have a local attorney for the case,



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

5

1 don't you?  And -- and you want us to believe that the

2 local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case

3 at all?  Is this really what the -- what the law

4 requires?  I -- I think there is a serious ethical

5 obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice.

6 He is one of the attorneys for your client.  And he got

7 the notice, right?  That one was not returned.

8             MR. GARRE:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He failed to check with --

10 with the New York lawyers who were working with him.

11 Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?

12             MR. GARRE:  We have three points on the

13 local counsel, Your Honor.  First, the record shows that

14 the notice is not attributable to Mr. Maples because Mr.

15 Butler had disclaimed any relationship apart from

16 facilitating the admission of his out-of-State

17 attorneys.

18             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Disclaimed to who?  To --

19 I mean, how could a clerk be expected to know that the

20 local counsel really isn't taking any part?  I mean --

21 so was the disclaimer to the clerk?

22             MR. GARRE:  I think a -- a couple things on

23 the clerk's perspective.  First, we do think that it was

24 well known in Alabama that, under this unique system,

25 out-of-State attorneys were doing all the work in these



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

6

1 cases, and local counsel were simply facilitating their

2 admission.  Second, one of the --

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, who says that, Mr.

4 Garre?  I mean, is there anything in the record on that

5 point, on the Alabama system generally?

6             MR. GARRE:  A couple of the things, Your

7 Honor.  First, we do have the amicus briefs, which

8 discuss that anecdotally.  I would say that the State of

9 Alabama in its brief in opposition to this Court a few

10 years back in the Barbour case specifically touted the

11 role of out-of-State attorneys under its system and, as

12 far as I could tell, didn't mention local counsel once.

13 So, I think it was fair to say that it's known that the

14 out-of-State attorneys here were doing all the work.

15 But even if the clerk --

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're begging the

17 question, which is how is the clerk supposed to know

18 this?  This is a functionary in the clerk's office who

19 sends out notices, receives back mail that's not

20 returned.  There has to be some local counsel that does

21 work.

22             MR. GARRE:  Well --

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How is he supposed to

24 know the difference between those that do and those that

25 don't?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

7

1             MR. GARRE:  What -- what -- I think the

2 clerk would be imputed with knowledge, general knowledge

3 of the system.  But beyond that, what the clerk know --

4 knew was this:  He knew that two of the three notices

5 that went out were returned, both to the out-of-State

6 attorneys, which ought to be an extraordinary event in

7 the life of any clerk's office.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But, you know, even if

9 local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and

10 nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a

11 functionary, surely the function would include when he

12 gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people

13 who do the real work know about the notice.

14             MR. GARRE:  Of course.  But the point is --

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He didn't perform that

16 function.

17             MR. GARRE:  In this case, the local counsel

18 didn't perform as a mail drop, and that was

19 intentionally so.  His own affidavit makes that clear.

20 And I think what's important is the State itself must

21 not have viewed him as a meaningful player.

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he didn't have a mail

23 drop?  I just didn't hear what you said.

24             MR. GARRE:  My point was that ordinarily a

25 local counsel would serve as the mail drop; he would

1 forward notice.  In this case, Mr. Butler made quite

2 clear from the outset that he was not even performing

3 that role.  The role that he intentionally performed was

4 to admit out-of-State counsel and to let them do the

5 work.  But the State itself --

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  To whom did he make that

7 clear?  You said he made it clear at the outset.  To

8 whom?  And where is that in the record?

9             MR. GARRE:  It's in his affidavit, Your

10 Honor, the petition appendix page 256.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  His affidavit after --

12 after the fact, right?

13             MR. GARRE:  That's right, Your Honor.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did -- did he tell the

15 clerk of the court that that was the case?

16             MR. GARRE:  He did not.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes, you know, I'm counsel

18 of record.  He's the counsel of record, right?  I'm

19 counsel of record, but I don't even do so much as to

20 forward notices to the guys that are doing the real

21 work?  Did he tell the clerk that?

22             MR. GARRE:  He did not tell the clerk --

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's extraordinary.

24             MR. GARRE:  -- but the State itself, Your

25 Honor must not have viewed him as a meaningful player,

1 because when the default at issue in this case occurred,

2 the State sent a letter -- faxed it -- to Mr. Maples

3 directly on death row in Alabama, without --

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said that even before

5 that.  In the rule -- you said the Rule 32 -- didn't you

6 say something about -- the -- the notice that went from

7 the prosecutor to Maples did not go to the local

8 counsel, right?

9             MR. GARRE:  The clerk sent out notices to

10 all three attorneys of record, the two out-of-State

11 counsel and Mr. Butler.  Mr. Butler did receive the

12 notice.  He didn't do anything, both because he hadn't

13 assumed any role beyond facilitating admission --

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did the -- did the

15 prosecutor -- I'm not talking about the clerk now.  The

16 prosecutor had a filing in connection with the Rule 32

17 motion.  Did the prosecutor send that to, well,

18 everybody?  Maples and everybody?

19             MR. GARRE:  He did not.  The State -- and

20 this is at page 26 of the joint appendix.  The State

21 served it on his out-of-State counsel and not Mr.

22 Butler, his local counsel.  And when the default

23 occurred, the State contacted Mr. -- Mr. Maples directly

24 in prison, which would have been unethical if the State

25 had known or believed that he was represented by



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 counsel.

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you seem not to rely

3 on what the State as prosecutor did.  It seemed to me

4 the State as prosecutor was recognizing that Maples had

5 no counsel; therefore, sent -- said you'd better file

6 your habeas; this is how much time you have -- sent it

7 just to him.

8             MR. GARRE:  I absolutely agree with you,

9 Justice Ginsburg.  I think that that is further evidence

10 that everybody knew that Mr. Maples didn't have any

11 local counsel in any meaningful sense.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does the Constitution

13 say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that

14 every judicial action has to be noticed --

15             MR. GARRE:  Well --

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- to the parties to the

17 case?  The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice,

18 do they?

19             MR. GARRE:  The Constitution doesn't say

20 that explicitly --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Federal rules don't

22 say it.  You don't have to give notice in the Federal

23 rules, do you?

24             MR. GARRE:  We think notice of a

25 postconviction order in a capital case would at least



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 implicate a due process interest in receiving notice,

2 that it's reasonable --

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Capital cases are

4 different?  If you're going to go to jail for life you

5 -- you don't get notice, but if -- if it's a capital

6 case --

7             MR. GARRE:  I think under the --

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I mean, it's either a

9 rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule.

10             MR. GARRE:  Well --

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if -- if it's a rule

12 for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are

13 unconstitutional, you're saying.

14             MR. GARRE:  The Mullane case specifically

15 takes into account the interests of the individual

16 receiving notice.  There could be no greater interest of

17 an individual than receiving notice in a capital case

18 where the individual's life is at stake.  Ultimately we

19 don't think this Court has to find a constitutional

20 violation.  It has to find that the events --

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Once you're in court and

22 you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what

23 goes on in the court.  That's the assumption of the

24 Federal rules.  And it seems to me a perfectly

25 reasonable assumption.  And I'm not about to hold that



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1 -- that they are unconstitutional simply because an

2 extraordinary requirement of notice, which is not

3 required by the Constitution, has gone awry.

4             MR. GARRE:  Here Mr. Maples did not have an

5 attorney that was serving in an agency role in any

6 meaningful sense.  That's laid out in Ms. DeMott's

7 amicus brief; it's laid out in our case.  What's more is

8 the State here didn't simply just, we think quite

9 unreasonably, rely on a role that local counsel was not

10 performing in Alabama --

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- but --

12 your case it seems to me turns critically on Butler's

13 role.  How much, in addition to what he did or didn't

14 do, would he have to do to put him in a position where

15 he was in fact representing Maples in your view?

16             MR. GARRE:  I think that the ordinary role

17 of local counsel, which would have been to, at a

18 minimum, forward notice in a proceeding, would be a

19 meaningful relationship.  The relationship that -- that

20 Professor DeMott describes here is one of sub-agency.

21 And, in fact, if you look at the Alabama rules, they put

22 the onus on the out-of-State counsel to associate the

23 local counsel.  That's at page 365 of the joint

24 appendix.  The out-of-State counsel did that.  Mr. --

25 Mr. Maples wasn't involved in that transaction.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Where do we look -- where do

2 we look to see that it's standard practice for local

3 counsel throughout the country to contact out-of-State

4 counsel when something like this is received?  I

5 remember a case from the Federal system in which local

6 counsel appeared and did exactly what was done here,

7 moved the admission of an out-of-State criminal defense

8 attorney, who then tried the case for a year, got sick,

9 and the judge said to the local -- local counsel:  Come

10 on in; you're going to take over this trial and try it

11 for the next 6 months.  And the local counsel said:

12 Whoa, I only signed up to move the admission of this

13 fellow.  The judge said:  That's too bad; you're counsel

14 of record, and you have to take over the case.

15             I don't understand that what is alleged to

16 have occurred here is that far out of the ordinary.

17             MR. GARRE:  I think Mr. Butler -- just

18 simply saying, I'm going to allow -- I'm going to

19 facilitate your out-of-State attorneys to represent you,

20 but that's my role.  He had, quote, unquote, "no role"

21 after that.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He can't define his role as

23 a lawyer.  Once he appears before a court and says, I am

24 counsel of record, he has certain responsibilities.

25 It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1             MR. GARRE:  Well, clearly that's right.

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And if they don't extend

3 even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the

4 people who were doing the legwork in the case know that

5 -- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't

6 imagine what his responsibility is.  It's not up to him

7 to define it.

8             MR. GARRE:  That's exactly our point,

9 Justice Scalia, which is that he forswore any

10 responsibility.  The lawyer in the Holland case just had

11 those responsibilities, too.  He abandoned his client.

12 This -- what Mr. Butler here did here was inexcusable.

13             But there's another factor at play here, and

14 that's the confusion that the court itself affirmatively

15 created when it sent an order that, by its term,

16 directed that all counsel of record receive it.  And

17 that's what the order said; it's on page 225 of the

18 joint appendix.  And --

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Before you get to the

20 court, could I ask you about what the State attorney,

21 the prosecuting attorney, knew?  Did the prosecuting

22 attorney know that these two individuals from New York

23 were representing this person?

24             MR. GARRE:  Certainly, it knew that they

25 were counsel of record in the proceeding.  I'll let my



Official

15

1 -- my friend answer that question.  What we know,

2 though, is when the default occurred, it took the

3 extraordinary step of faxing a letter directly to Mr.

4 Maples in prison, which would have been unethical if it

5 believed he was represented by counsel.

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So you think

7 you have -- in your view, the counsel of record knew

8 that these two people in New York were part of the

9 representation.  Did the counsel -- I mean, not the

10 counsel of record; the counsel for the State.

11             Did the counsel know that they hadn't gotten

12 the notice?

13             MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't want to speak for

14 my friend.  I don't -- there's certainly nothing in the

15 record to -- to establish that they knew that these

16 out-of-State attorneys didn't get notice.

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there any reason to

18 think that the State attorney or whoever was prosecuting

19 thought that the local counsel was likely not to do

20 much?

21             MR. GARRE:  Yes.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes?  Okay.

23             MR. GARRE:  The very actions it took,

24 Justice Breyer.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Now, so it's



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 possible -- we'll find out later -- that the State --

2 the prosecuting attorney who works for the State knew

3 all those things:  One, he's represented by counsel in

4 New York; two, they didn't get the notice; three, the

5 local attorney isn't going to do anything; and

6 conclusion:  They likely knew he didn't get the notice,

7 but they are asserting that this is an adequate State

8 ground to bar him coming into habeas; is that the

9 correct posture of the case?

10             MR. GARRE:  That's true, Justice Breyer.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, all we have to decide

12 is whether under these circumstances the State

13 attorney's knowledge of all those facts mean that the

14 State cannot assert this is an adequate State ground.

15             MR. GARRE:  Right.  And I think the State's

16 actions --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do we know that he knew all

18 of those facts?

19             MR. GARRE:  No, Justice Scalia --

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, we don't know

21 that.

22             MR. GARRE:  But we know -- we know what

23 action it took, and that action was an action that

24 assumed that he didn't have meaningful counsel, or else

25 it would have been unethical.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, can I --

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Let me ask you this, if I

4 may.  I don't know if -- I don't think the briefs

5 covered it.  It may be in there.  Do you know, in

6 Alabama and/or nationwide, in how many capital cases

7 there is no appeal?

8             MR. GARRE:  I don't know that, Justice

9 Kennedy.  I think the Alabama system here created a

10 system in which it would allow for appeals, not only in

11 direct appeals, but postconviction proceedings.  The

12 extraordinary -- there are several extraordinary

13 features of the Alabama system, and we think that

14 ultimately they helped to facilitate the extraordinary

15 and shocking events in this case.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if -- the New

17 York lawyers did not abandon Mr. Maples prior to the

18 time that they left their law firm in New York, right?

19             MR. GARRE:  That's right.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, their conduct

21 prior to that time would be attributed to him, right?

22             MR. GARRE:  I think that's right.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  Part of

24 their conduct was setting up their arrangement with Mr.

25 Butler where he would show up as counsel of record but

1 not really do anything.  So, why aren't the consequences

2 of that arrangement attributed to Maples as well?

3             MR. GARRE:  Well, I don't think they would

4 be attributed.  I think what you're looking for is

5 whether the default itself is attributable to Maples.

6 The New York -- what -- what the out-of-State attorneys

7 did is they left the representation without fulfilling

8 their duty to notify the court or Mr. Maples.  Mr.

9 Maples was in -- was sitting in a prison cell in Alabama

10 under the reasonable belief that he was represented by

11 counsel who would appeal if an adverse decision was

12 issued.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Garre, can I go back to

14 Justice Kennedy's question?  This was not an appeal.

15 The question was how many capital cases is there no

16 appeal.  He had been convicted and had appealed, right?

17 The -- this is --

18             MR. GARRE:  The direct proceedings had

19 concluded.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The direct proceedings were

21 over.  He had appealed up to -- up to the State supreme

22 court.  Did he seek cert here, too?

23             MR. GARRE:  He did, Justice Scalia.

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  He did.  And this was a

25 postconviction --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

19

1             MR. GARRE:  It was, but when the State sets

2 up that system and allows for appeals, it can't

3 arbitrarily deprive it of an appeal based on the sort of

4 circumstances here.

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That may be, but I don't

6 think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal, I

7 mean, postconviction.

8             MR. GARRE:  I'm not aware of any State that

9 does not allow appeal in postconviction proceedings.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can be allowed, but it

11 would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be

12 sought.

13             MR. GARRE:  But I think --

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, in -- in this -- in

15 this case, there was a direct appeal, and then there was

16 this proceeding that we're talking about here.  The

17 trial judge waited for 18 months.  So, you would think

18 there's some merit to the underlying claim.  Any

19 statistics on whether or not -- on how often an appeal

20 is abandoned or not pursued in this kind of case?  No

21 statistics?

22             MR. GARRE:  No.  I mean, the statistics that

23 I'm aware of are that habeas claims are in a material

24 sense often successful in capital cases.  We've cited

25 those in our reply brief.  Here we think the underlying



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

20

1 claims are quite serious.  The question in the case is

2 really not who shot the victims.  The question is, was

3 whether Mr. Maples was going to be convicted for capital

4 murder or murder that would result in life imprisonment.

5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- I'm aware of the

6 allegations.

7             MR. GARRE:  And I think, going back to the

8 court's and the clerk's actions here, one of the things

9 that exacerbated the chain of events here was that you

10 had an order which directed that all parties would be

11 served.  Mr. Butler did say that he saw that that order

12 directed that the out-of-State counsel would be served,

13 which created an added risk of the likelihood --

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, I have two

15 questions for you.  Is that -- is this State the only

16 one that doesn't appoint counsel in a postconviction

17 capital case?

18             MR. GARRE:  Well, I believe that Alabama may

19 appoint them.  They don't provide for appointment in all

20 cases.  I believe Georgia is another State.  But in that

21 respect, I think these States are alone.

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But the vast majority

23 do?

24             MR. GARRE:  Absolutely.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In capital cases?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1             MR. GARRE:  The vast majority do.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Number two,

3 I thought there were two questions in this -- in this

4 part of your case.  The first is, don't we have to

5 decide that abandonment, which you have termed, is

6 cause --

7             MR. GARRE:  Yes.

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- in a -- to excuse a

9 procedural bar in a State court.

10             MR. GARRE:  Right.  And that is --

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we have to decide

12 first whether we extend Holland to this setting.

13             MR. GARRE:  Well, I think they're

14 independent grounds.  If the Court concludes that the

15 State's own actions --

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the due process.

17 I'm talking about -- yes, both we would have to decide.

18 Assuming -- we have to decide the first question.  Is --

19             MR. GARRE:  Well --

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Will we extend Holland

21 to this type of situation?

22             MR. GARRE:  I don't -- I don't -- I just

23 want to be clear on this.  They are independent grounds.

24 If the Court concludes that the State's actions --

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes, I -- I understand.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1             MR. GARRE:  But with respect to the

2 attorneys, that's right.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  Could we find --

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What -- what is the line,

6 Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old

7 negligence?

8             MR. GARRE:  It would be the line established

9 by agency law going back to Justice Story's time.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, if this local counsel

11 simply goofed in not -- not advising the people that

12 were doing the legwork in the case, why -- why is that

13 abandonment?

14             MR. GARRE:  I think it's actually more of a

15 situation where he disclaimed any meaningful role at the

16 outset.  I think, you know, the real abandonment going

17 on here was the attorneys in New York who left without

18 notifying the court or their client.  But that --

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Putting aside the question

20 of local counsel, could we find that there was an

21 abandonment if the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell

22 continued to represent Mr. Maples after the two young

23 attorneys left the firm?

24             MR. GARRE:  The Court could.

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  And does the record show



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

23

1 that they -- they did not represent Mr. Maples, that

2 this was done purely by the two attorneys?  Is there a

3 finding by a court on that?

4             MR. GARRE:  There is not a finding.  We

5 think that's the better reading of the record, and I'm

6 happy to explain why.  But most importantly, we think

7 it's irrelevant whether he was represented by the law

8 firm in the fictional sense.  He was represented by

9 individual lawyers in that proceeding.  They were the

10 ones who Mr. Maples agreed to have represent him in that

11 proceeding.  The Alabama courts made specific findings

12 that Mr. Maples's lawyers were Ms. Ingen-Housz and

13 Mr. Munanka.  It said that after the default.  At that

14 time --

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in the -- in the

16 practice of a law firm, these were very junior people.

17 Wouldn't the law firm have to have some involvement in

18 giving them permission to provide this representation?

19 I mean, usually there's something like a pro bono

20 committee and a higher level.  Can -- can such junior

21 associates just go ahead and say, we want to spend a lot

22 of our time defending a man on death row?  Wouldn't they

23 have to get some kind of permission?

24             MR. GARRE:  I think one would ordinarily

25 expect that.  And we're not condoning the actions here.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

24

1 I would say that, at the outset of this litigation,

2 there were individuals from the Legal Aid Society who

3 were well familiar with capital cases involved.  They

4 apparently dropped out of the case.  But we know --

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, what do we know about

6 Mr. De Leeuw's role, Mr. Garre?

7             MR. GARRE:  What we know is what Mr. De

8 Leeuw has said, which is that he was involved in the

9 case at some point.  It's not clear what his involvement

10 was.  At the oral argument in the Eleventh Circuit, he

11 said, on page 302 of the joint appendix, that he was --

12 they were awaiting further action from the court.  So,

13 we don't know what his involvement was.

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Garre, we don't

15 know, we don't know.  Isn't that just proof that if we

16 were to find that Holland applied, a Holland exception

17 applied, that we would have to remand this case?

18             MR. GARRE:  I think that would be

19 appropriate, Your Honor.  Of course, we think the Court

20 should find that the Holland -- the Holland exception,

21 or more particularly --

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In that regard, there is

23 one part of Holland that you don't really address, which

24 is that Holland contrasted a statute of limitations

25 issue with respect to access to a Federal court with a



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 procedural bar and said that the State's procedural bar

2 had interest of federalism, that we had to be cautious

3 of ignoring a State procedural bar because of

4 federalism.  If we were to extend Holland in the way you

5 want, how do we justify ignoring federalism in that

6 situation?

7             MR. GARRE:  That's right.  There are those

8 distinctions.

9             Our point is that Holland recognizes that

10 attorney conduct that amounts to abandonment is external

11 to the client under agency and other principles.

12 Coleman itself recognizes that external conduct is not

13 attributable to the client and can't be a basis for

14 cause.

15             So, the Federal -- federalism interests are

16 simply not implicated in a case where you find that the

17 attorney's actions are external.  And we think if you

18 look at the principles you looked at in Holland, agency

19 law going back to Justice Story's time, the principles

20 of professional standards of care, you would find that

21 an abandonment -- of course, that must be external to

22 the client.  Justice Alito said in his concurring

23 opinion that where someone is not acting as an agent in

24 any meaningful sense, it would be grossly inequitable

25 and unfair to attribute the agent's conduct to the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 client.

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre --

3             MR. GARRE:  That's the principle we're

4 asking.

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could we go back to the

6 state of the record?  You've said a few times, and your

7 brief does, that the record is skimpy on various

8 important matters.  Would you go further and say that

9 the record is irretrievably corrupted, tainted by

10 conflicts of interest?

11             MR. GARRE:  I think there are conflicts of

12 interest here.  They're laid out in the legal ethics

13 briefs.  The Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys were

14 representing Mr. Maples up through the argument and

15 decision in the Eleventh Circuit.  But I think -- for

16 purposes of what this Court would do, I think a remand

17 would be appropriate, because if you conclude, as we

18 think you should, that abandonment of counsel would be

19 an external factor, then it would be appropriate to

20 remand for further proceedings.  We don't know what

21 these other attorneys were doing.  The record doesn't

22 show that.

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We do know, though, that

24 they were not counsel of record.

25             MR. GARRE:  We absolutely know that they



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

27

1 were not.

2             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, we know that the two

3 who were listed as counsel of record --

4             MR. GARRE:  They were not.

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- were not representing

6 him, and they hadn't told the court.

7             MR. GARRE:  They were not counsel of record.

8 Mr. Maples never agreed to have anyone else represent

9 him in a way that could bind him.  The Alabama court

10 specifically found not only that they weren't counsel of

11 record, but they were not authorized to practice in

12 Alabama.  This is on page 223 of the petition appendix.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it seems to me it's up

14 to you to produce the facts that would justify our

15 reversing the case that you're asking us to do.

16             MR. GARRE:  We asked --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you say, well, we don't

18 have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can --

19 no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place.

20 If the record doesn't show the things that you need to

21 show to get this case reversed, the case should not be

22 reversed, it seems to me.

23             MR. GARRE:  But the petition did include a

24 request for an evidentiary hearing.  And I think the

25 problem is that both the district court and the court of



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

28

1 appeals short-circuited the inquiry into counsel's

2 actions because it believed that Coleman v. Thompson

3 applied in the abandonment situation.  And where a court

4 made that kind of legal error, it would be appropriate

5 for the Court to send it back and say, no, Coleman v.

6 Thompson does not apply in the extraordinary case of

7 abandonment, or an attorney's actions cannot be

8 attributable to a client under agency law.

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  When did you first make the

10 abandonment claim?

11             MR. GARRE:  Well, I think we've argued --

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  When was it?  Wasn't it

13 first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?

14             MR. GARRE:  I think explicitly.  Now, we

15 think that -- two points on this.  We think --

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's rather late.

17             MR. GARRE:  We think that all along they

18 argued that the attorneys' actions established cause.

19 That's why both the district court and the court of

20 appeals addressed that and rejected it erroneously under

21 Coleman.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That isn't abandonment.

23 That isn't abandonment.  The attorneys' actions

24 established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.

25             MR. GARRE:  We think this falls squarely



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1 within the rule of Yee v. Escondido, where -- where the

2 party makes the claim below -- which they made the claim

3 here that the attorneys' actions established cause --

4 you can make new arguments, different arguments.

5             And I think, particularly given that

6 Sullivan & Cromwell had been involved early in this case

7 and the possibility of conflicts of interest would make

8 it appropriate for this Court to consider our

9 abandonment issue, which was raised in the petition for

10 rehearing, explicitly raised in the petition for

11 certiorari -- explicitly -- we think it's properly

12 before this Court.

13             If there are no further questions at this

14 time, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.

20             MR. NEIMAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

21 and may it please the Court:

22             In trying to sidestep Coleman, Maples is

23 advocating at least three principles that are

24 incompatible with the way our justice system works.

25 First, Maples is asking this Court to hold that due



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1 process required not just actual notice to his attorney

2 of record, John Butler, but in fact something more than

3 that.

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Let's say the three

5 notices are sent out; all three of them come back, okay?

6 Let's even go further and say the prosecutor knows that

7 nobody representing Mr. Maples received notice.  What

8 happens then?

9             MR. NEIMAN:  In that case, Your Honor, there

10 would be a much more substantial argument --

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yeah, I know it

12 would be more substantial.  That's why --

13             (Laughter.)

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  My question is what

15 happens?  Are you prepared to acknowledge that in that

16 case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his

17 lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and,

18 therefore, the failure to file the notice should not

19 constitute an adequate and independent State ground

20 barring collateral relief?

21             MR. NEIMAN:  I don't think that the return

22 of all three notices would justify necessarily a finding

23 of abandonment in toto by all the lawyers.  It could

24 signify a number of things.  I do think that it would

25 raise questions about whether the clerk had a due



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1 process obligation to do more under Jones v. Flowers.

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What does the return mean

3 when you get -- get a notice returned?  It just said no

4 longer at Sullivan & Cromwell, is what the two of them

5 said, right?

6             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Does that necessarily mean

8 that they've abandoned the case?  It just means you got

9 the wrong address, doesn't it?

10             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that the only thing

12 it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at

13 Sullivan & Cromwell?

14             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't know how that would

16 be an indication of abandonment.  Can't you switch a law

17 firm and keep the client?

18             MR. NEIMAN:  Absolutely, Your Honor,

19 although the presumption generally is that the client

20 stays with the firm.  But that's correct.  The client

21 certainly can move firms when the -- when the lawyer

22 moves firms.

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Neiman, I think we're

24 blurring two issues.  We're not talking about

25 abandonment in this respect.  We're talking about notice



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 going to no one, and a -- and a clock ticking from a

2 certain date that no one knows about.

3             I mean, they were preparing for a hearing

4 before this judge.  So they weren't anticipating that he

5 was going to rule without anything further.

6             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

7 They certainly were preparing for an evidentiary

8 hearing, and, in fact, contrary to my friend's

9 statements about what we know about Mr. De Leeuw's

10 involvement in this case, on page 228 of the J.A.,

11 Maples expressly alleged that De Leeuw and others at

12 Sullivan & Cromwell were preparing for the evidentiary

13 hearing.  But --

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But as far as -- as far

15 the record shows, De Leeuw is not on the record at all.

16 There were three counsel of record.  Two of them --

17 well, let's go back to this -- this -- the first issue.

18 The State by its own conduct showed it didn't regard

19 Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't

20 even send its Rule 32 response to Butler; isn't that so?

21             MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I respectfully

22 disagree with that assessment of how we can read the

23 service of the Rule 32 answer.  Under Alabama law, a --

24 a pleading or an order may be served on only one counsel

25 of record when a party has multiple counsel of record.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1 So, for example, that answer was served upon Mr. Munanka

2 at Sullivan & Cromwell, but it was not served, expressly

3 at least, on --

4             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about --

5             MR. NEIMAN:  -- Ms. Ingen-Housz.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the notice

7 that he's -- he had lost in the Alabama court and he'd

8 better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do

9 something about it?  That notice went only to Maples,

10 right?

11             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

12 The -- the State's attorney in that -- in that instance

13 decided to send a letter only to Mr. Maples.  Of

14 course --

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And Mr. Garre made the

16 point that if Maples were represented, that that would

17 be improper, to -- to send a notice to Maples alone.

18 So, the -- so, the State's attorney must have thought

19 that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he

20 didn't notify any of them.

21             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, the record does not

22 reveal why Mr. Hayden decided to send the letter to Mr.

23 Maples alone.  One --

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, he didn't have

25 to send the letter.  That letter had no legal effect,



Official

34

1 did it?

2             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, it was just:  By

4 the way, your time has expired.  I mean, this is not --

5 what could the lawyer do about it?

6             MR. NEIMAN:  Well, and it --

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It wasn't a required notice

8 that he had to give to the lawyer or to anybody else.

9             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So he just made this

11 extraneous, volunteered statement to Maples instead of

12 to his lawyer.  I don't -- I don't know what that

13 proves.

14             MR. NEIMAN:  At that point in time, the

15 State case was over.  So, it was hardly clear if Mr.

16 Hayden was going to do something that he didn't have to

17 do under the rules.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why did he do it?

19 Why did he do it, then?  Just gloating that -- that the

20 fellow had lost?

21             (Laughter.)

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What was the point

23 of it?  He must have thought there was a problem, right?

24             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, he certainly was

25 aware that Mr. Maples's lawyers had failed to file a

1 notice of appeal.  But -- and his letter reveals that he

2 is very aware --

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that surprising?  I

4 think Justice Kennedy asked your adversary:  How often

5 do appeals lie from the denial of State postconviction

6 remedies?

7             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I agree with my

8 friend that we don't have statistics on that front.  I

9 think it's fair to assume that, for the most part, when

10 a Rule 32 petitioner loses at the trial stage, they're

11 going to appeal.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In a capital case.

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Particularly in a -- in a

14 capital case.

15             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor,

16 although there are some instances in which a capital

17 petitioner or someone on death row decides that they no

18 longer want to invoke the process of the courts, and

19 they're ready for their sentence to be carried out.

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just have two questions

21 going back to the very beginning, when we were talking

22 about the misaddressed or the unreceived mail.  When the

23 notices come back "no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell,"

24 that's just as if it said, functionally, don't you

25 think, "wrong address"?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

36

1             MR. NEIMAN:  Not quite, Your Honor.  I think

2 that -- that the notice saying that the person's no

3 longer at Sullivan & Cromwell indicates that the person

4 is no longer at the firm.  I guess the notice could come

5 back --

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, it's pretty clear

7 that they didn't get their -- get the mail, get the

8 letter, because it's sent back.

9             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One other thing while I'm

11 talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps.

12 Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what

13 you allege to be the procedural default?  If you thought

14 there was substantial merit to the underlying claims,

15 even though you take the position that they ultimately

16 should be rejected, could you have simply waived the

17 procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?

18             MR. NEIMAN:  I don't think the law makes

19 that crystal clear, Your Honor.  But I certainly know of

20 no law that suggests that the Attorney General of

21 Alabama necessarily has to assert every single potential

22 defense within his or her arsenal.

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Has Alabama ever waived

24 lack of timely appeal in a capital case?

25             MR. NEIMAN:  I'm not aware, Your Honor.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

37

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could we go

2 back to the Chief Justice's initial question?  Let's

3 assume the two letters went to Sullivan & Cromwell and

4 came back "left firm," as they did, and that the letter

5 to Butler came back "deceased."  Would there be cause in

6 that situation to excuse the State's procedural ground?

7             MR. NEIMAN:  Perhaps, Your Honor.  It -- it

8 would depend on why the letters came back from Sullivan

9 & Cromwell, I suppose.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, we -- we know that

11 they -- that both lawyers in this case didn't move to

12 another firm.  Both of them took jobs that precluded

13 them from representing this defendant.  So, I don't know

14 how I define abandonment other than I take a job where I

15 can't work for you anymore.

16             MR. NEIMAN:  The -- the cause argument in

17 that case, Your Honor, would be substantially stronger,

18 as I've said before, in part because death, of course,

19 is an external factor.  So --

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you accept -- I

21 don't mean to interfere with the question, but -- so,

22 you accept the idea that there is a distinction between

23 malfeasance and abandonment.

24             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I think we would be

25 prepared to recognize that, in certain cases, an



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

38

1 abandonment of a client by an attorney would terminate

2 the agency relationship with -- between the attorney and

3 client.  And --

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Okay.  So, then the

5 only thing -- the only thing we're talking about is

6 whether, on these particular facts, there has been

7 abandonment or not.  Right?

8             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  From your

10 perspective.

11             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  But one thing

12 I do want to stress is that my friend has suggested that

13 an evidentiary hearing or further evidentiary

14 proceedings are necessary on this particular question

15 because we don't know what role the other attorneys at

16 Sullivan & Cromwell played in the matter.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But we do know they

18 weren't counsel of record.  We do know that the only two

19 counsel of record were no longer representing him, and

20 he had no reason to know that they weren't, but they

21 were not -- they couldn't represent him.

22             The two -- the only two out-of-town counsel

23 were the two who disabled themselves from representing

24 him by taking other jobs.

25             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

39

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So, there was no one from

2 Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record.

3 So, on the record, they had abandoned him, and there was

4 no substitute.

5             MR. NEIMAN:  I disagree with that

6 assessment, Your Honor.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, the argument is that

8 on the record or not is determinative for the out-of-

9 town counsel, but it is not determinative for the

10 in-town counsel.  The fact that he is counsel of record

11 doesn't count, but the fact that those two are does

12 count.  And only when you combine those two does the man

13 have no counsel.  Right?

14             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is that

15 inconsistency in Maples's argument.  On the one hand,

16 Maples says that Butler -- or that the other lawyers at

17 Sullivan & Cromwell weren't his attorneys because they

18 weren't counsel of record.  But Butler was counsel of

19 record, but he wasn't his attorney.

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The notice inquiry is

21 supposed to be a pragmatic one.  As far back as Mullane,

22 we've said that the question that we're supposed to ask

23 ourselves is:  Is this what somebody would do if they

24 actually wanted to accomplish notice, if they actually

25 wanted the person to get that letter?  So, I'm just



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 going to ask you, General, if you were a lawyer in an

2 important litigation and you send off an important

3 letter to two lawyers, your principal adversaries, as

4 well as to a local counsel who you think may not be

5 involved in the substance of the litigation, you don't

6 know for a fact, but you think that there is some

7 substantial likelihood that he's not particularly

8 involved, as local counsel often aren't -- so, you send

9 off this letter and you get it back from the principal

10 attorneys, and you ask yourself:  Huh, should I do

11 anything now?

12             What would you say?

13             (Laughter.)

14             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I suspect that, in

15 those circumstances, I might well personally do

16 something else.  But, of course, my prerogatives as

17 Solicitor General of Alabama are quite different from

18 the prerogatives of a clerk in Morgan County, Alabama.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the --

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, as then the clerk has

21 to believe that it's an important letter.  Right?  It's

22 not important enough to be required by the Federal

23 rules.  How important is it?

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Justice Scalia is right.

25 I'm assuming that a letter disposing of a -- of a ruling



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

41

1 in a capital case issued after 18 months when nobody

2 knew that that letter was coming, that that's an

3 important letter for a death row person to get.  So,

4 Justice Scalia is right to that effect.

5             So, you get this, and you say, well, you

6 would have.  But that's the question that we have to ask

7 about the clerk as well.  The clerk -- the question for

8 the clerk is, if he had really wanted the person to get

9 notice, what would he have done?

10             MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I disagree.

11 The -- as far back as Mullane, this Court has said that

12 at the end of the day, actual notice to a party,

13 particularly within the jurisdiction, is the finish line

14 for due process purposes.  Mullane expressly --

15             JUSTICE ALITO:  You can see from these

16 questions that the arguments that you're making in this

17 capital case, which is sui generis, are pushing the

18 Court to consider rules that would have far-reaching

19 effect, such as a rule that places upon a clerk of the

20 court a constitutional obligation to serve counsel with

21 important documents in the case similar to the

22 constitutional obligation to serve initial process in

23 the case.  And the question that I would like to ask is

24 whether this -- the -- whether you as the Solicitor

25 General or the Attorney General of Alabama have an



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1 obligation to push this matter in this way.  This is a

2 case where -- as I said, it's a capital case, as we all

3 recognize.  Mr. Maples has lost his right to appeal

4 through no fault of his own, through a series of very

5 unusual and unfortunate circumstances.

6             Now, when his attorneys moved to file an

7 out-of-time appeal, why wouldn't you just consent to

8 that?  If he did not receive an effective assistance of

9 counsel at trial, why not get a decision on the merits

10 on that?  Why push this -- this technical argument?

11             MR. NEIMAN:  There are several responses,

12 Your Honor.  First, at least at the Rule 32 stage, the

13 -- the notice of appeal deadline was a jurisdictional

14 one.  And you're right, the State did oppose the motion

15 for an out-of-time appeal, but there wasn't much the

16 State could have done even if it had consented --

17             JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no --

18             MR. NEIMAN:  -- on that front.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  There's no possibility under

20 Alabama rules for an out-of-time appeal in this

21 circumstance?  No extension?

22             MR. NEIMAN:  The holding of the Alabama

23 courts here, as recognized by the Eleventh Circuit, was

24 that this would not be an appropriate circumstance for

25 an out-of-time appeal.  Now, as to the question about --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

43

1             JUSTICE ALITO:  But is that a discretionary

2 matter or is that a flat rule, once you've passed a

3 certain time deadline, you're out of -- you're out of

4 luck; there's no opportunity where there's good cause

5 for an extension?

6             MR. NEIMAN:  There is opportunity where

7 there's good cause for an extension.  But the -- what

8 the court held here, what the Alabama court held here,

9 was that this circumstance in which the person had

10 counsel of record, and counsel of record hadn't notified

11 the court of their address -- of their changes of

12 address, and, more importantly, Mr. Butler, who was, in

13 fact, serving as Mr. Maples's agent in this case and

14 received --

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, this goes to my

16 earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of

17 questioning.  If the State of Alabama had told the State

18 court, in all of the circumstances, we think there

19 should be an out-of-time appeal granted -- you're -- are

20 you indicating that the State court said, well, that's a

21 good idea, but we can't do it because it's not

22 appropriate in these circumstances?

23             MR. NEIMAN:  That seems to be the holding of

24 the Court of Criminal Appeals in this case, Your Honor.

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Did you -- did you oppose



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 it?  Did the State oppose the out-of-time appeal?

2             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, the State did

3 oppose the out-of-time appeal, and the State pressed the

4 procedural bar in Federal court in this case.  But the

5 State had every prerogative to do so, in part because

6 this Court recognized in Coleman, a case where the

7 petitioner undoubtedly could have said that he lost his

8 right to his appeal through no fault of his own, that

9 the State had the power to do that.  There are good

10 reasons for the State --

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could the State in --

12 excuse me.  Could the State in the -- in the Federal

13 litigation have waived the procedural default?

14             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I think the law  is

15 not exactly clear on that, but I know of no law that

16 would say that the Alabama Attorney General has to press

17 every single non-jurisdictional defense at his or her

18 disposal.  But he did not do so here and had good reason

19 not to.  That's in part because Coleman says that this

20 is how procedural defaults work.  There are good reasons

21 for procedural defaults.  They are grounded in the same

22 equitable principles that led --

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you agreed with

24 me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the

25 adequate and independent State grounds.  So, under your



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily

2 controlling.

3             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, if I have suggested

4 that abandonment itself is an exception to the AISG

5 doctrine, let me correct my earlier answer.

6             My suggestion is that abandonment can

7 sometimes allow a court to determine that a particular

8 lawyer has become external to a client, that the agency

9 relationship has been terminated.  Of course, merely

10 becoming external to the client doesn't mean that the

11 abandonment itself will constitute cause.  The

12 abandonment also -- or the lawyer's ending of the

13 relationship would also have to impede the ability of

14 the remaining members of the defense team or the

15 defendant himself to comply with State rules.

16             And here, even if there is some argument

17 that Ingen-Housz and Munanka abandoned their client,

18 which I don't think there is on this record in light of

19 the way they left the case with Butler, Mr. De Leeuw,

20 and others at Sullivan & Cromwell, even if there were

21 some argument on that front, Butler -- it's not clear

22 that the actions of Ingen-Housz and Munanka actually

23 impeded the ability of the remaining members of the team

24 to --

25             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  When -- when lawyers stop



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 representing a client, as the two did, isn't there some

2 obligation of them to tell the client and the court,

3 we're no longer representing you, and arrange for

4 substitutions?  There were never any substitutions on

5 the record of the other counsel.  The record said these

6 two people are representing Maples, and those two

7 weren't.  They never told the court, and they never told

8 Maples.  Isn't there some obligation on -- on their part

9 to the court when they stop representing a client to

10 advise the court?

11             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor, I think there

12 is.  But I don't think that means that what happened

13 here constitutes cause.  The record is clear.  Mr.

14 Maples himself has alleged, that Ingen-Housz and Munanka

15 arranged for this case to be handled by Mr. De Leeuw,

16 and the record makes clear that Mr. De Leeuw was

17 involved in this case in representing Maples even before

18 the default occurred and even before Ingen-Housz and

19 Munanka were -- well, even at the same -- even before

20 Ingen-Housz and Munanka left, I should say.

21             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it -- is it -- I'm still

22 unclear on one factual thing.  Did the State's attorneys

23 know that the letters had come back?

24             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor --

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  Should they have known?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, the record is not

2 clear on that point.  I can represent to the Court that

3 the State's attorney did not know that the letters had

4 come back.  I --

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do they check the -- do

6 they check the docket every so often to see what's

7 happened?

8             MR. NEIMAN:  Most -- most attorneys have an

9 obligation at some point to check the docket, and that's

10 -- that's one problem with the position that Mr. Maples

11 has taken regarding Mr. Butler here and the ability of

12 these parties to obtain information from the court.

13             But in this case, it's my understanding --

14 and this is not on the record.  But it's on the record

15 obviously before this Court now.  But it's my -- it's my

16 understanding that the State had no idea that Mr.

17 Maples's attorneys had not -- Mr. Maples's two attorneys

18 in New York had left their firm or had --

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Why did --

20             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did they -- why

21 did they send to Maples alone the notice, you'd better

22 file your Federal habeas?  They didn't send it to those

23 counsel.  Where did they -- what made them send it --

24 send that notice directly to Maples and not to either of

25 the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

48

1             MR. NEIMAN:  Again, this is -- this is

2 information that's not in the record, Your Honor.  But

3 it's my understanding that counsel looked at -- looked

4 at -- figured out what had happened, figured out the

5 appeal had been missed, had calculated how much time Mr.

6 Maples had to file his 2254 petition and, based on his

7 20 years of experience, said that in light of the fact

8 that the State court proceedings were over, the most

9 prudent thing for him to do would be to send the letter

10 to Maples himself.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, he had figured out

12 that something had terminated the relationship between

13 Mr. Maples and his lawyers?

14             MR. NEIMAN:  No, Your Honor, I don't think

15 that's -- I don't think that's an accurate

16 characterization of --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, even --

18             MR. NEIMAN:  -- of what exactly happened in

19 this case, but in the very least, his lawyers had missed

20 -- had missed the deadline.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Even if you assume that he

22 had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his

23 knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the

24 fault on the part of the State that's alleged here.

25             MR. NEIMAN:  Well, more so than that, Your



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

49

1 Honor.

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did he tell the clerk of

3 court that he was only going to send it to Maples?

4             MR. NEIMAN:  As far as I know, no, Your

5 Honor.  But, of course, the clerk -- the notices came

6 back to the clerk long before the State's attorney sent

7 the letter in this case.

8             But that's an important point, I think, both

9 with respect to the clerk issue and also the abandonment

10 issue.  The relevant question here is not what the

11 Assistant Attorney General of Alabama thought had

12 happened in this case.  The relevant question on the

13 clerk issue is what the clerk knew, and that of course

14 is governed by Rule 7 of the rules governing admission

15 to the Alabama bar.

16             The relevant question on abandonment is, had

17 Maples in fact been abandoned?  Had -- had these

18 attorneys left him completely without counsel?  And the

19 record definitively establishes that that had not

20 happened, both because Mr. Butler remained counsel here

21 and in a much more meaningful way, I think, than my

22 friend suggests.  And --

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, could you tell

24 me -- I'm assuming you've practiced in your State for a

25 while.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

50

1             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How frequent is it in

3 the Alabama capital system that local counsel takes the

4 laboring oar, or even an active participation, in the

5 defense or actions of a capital defendant?

6             Your -- the amici here says generally they

7 did what Mr. Butler did; they just facilitated the --

8 the admission of the volunteer attorneys.  Was that your

9 experience?

10             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, of course, that

11 information's not in the record.  We respectfully

12 disagree, as a factual matter, with the factual

13 assertions made by the amici on that front.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If we have to

15 send it back, I guess we'd have to say what the rule is.

16 So, what -- what is the rule?  What about a rule that

17 says, where in fact attorneys do abandon the client and

18 the local attorney does as a matter of practice in the

19 State do virtually nothing except to facilitate foreign

20 representation, and where the State had cause to

21 believe -- cause to believe -- that all that was true,

22 then the State cannot assert this as an adequate ground.

23 That's all.

24             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, a remand would not

25 be appropriate in this case on those -- on those grounds



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1 for a number of reasons.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?

3             MR. NEIMAN:  One is that Rule 7 of the rules

4 governing admission to the Alabama bar made emphatically

5 clear that the role of local counsel was not simply --

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Irrespective of what the

7 rules were, you'd have to show -- he would have to show

8 that, in fact, in the State it is a practice such that

9 the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except

10 facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to

11 whether the State -- and the State knows that.

12             If he shows both of those things and shows

13 that the letter came back and shows this was abandonment

14 or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this

15 individual has no idea about filing a piece of paper and

16 thinks somebody else is doing it.  And that's enough to

17 say this is not adequate State ground that would block

18 Federal habeas.  Now, your argument against that is

19 what?

20             MR. NEIMAN:  At least twofold, Your Honor.

21 One, as a simple matter, those factual assertions were

22 not made below.  So, in order for the Court to remand on

23 that particular issue, it wouldn't be a remand for an

24 evidentiary hearing, on whether those allegations --

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  It seems in the briefs --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

52

1 there's certainly a lot in the briefs that seemed to say

2 that.

3             MR. NEIMAN:  There's certainly a lot in the

4 briefs that says that.  But one problem Mr. Maples faces

5 here is that he had the burden as the petitioner in this

6 habeas proceeding to make the requisite factual

7 allegations that he believed would establish cause.

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Neiman, am I correct

9 that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is

10 represented by more than one attorney, the notice does

11 not have to go to all of them?

12             MR. NEIMAN:  That is correct, Your Honor.

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can only go to one,

14 right?

15             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, as far as local counsel

17 knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this

18 thing, right?

19             MR. NEIMAN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Is it correct or

21 does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the

22 people who have been served.  Were the New York people

23 listed on the notice that went to Butler?

24             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  The notice --

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, then he knew



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

53

1 he wasn't the only one getting notice.

2             MR. NEIMAN:  Right.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or he knew that he

4 was the only one who was supposed to get notice.

5             MR. NEIMAN:  Well, the -- the cc line in

6 this case cannot establish cause and cannot be deemed

7 State interference for any number of reasons.  The first

8 is that -- I suppose it could only be held to establish

9 cause if it would have been reasonable for Mr. Butler to

10 assume that the cc line communicated a message that it

11 was perfectly okay for him to do nothing and to not take

12 further action, based on what is in the cc line.  And

13 there are at least three reasons why that would not be a

14 reasonable reading of the cc line.

15             The first is that the cc line doesn't

16 communicate that Ingen-Housz and Munanka, who were the

17 people listed on the cc line, will in fact receive the

18 order.  All it says is that the order will be sent to

19 Ingen-Housz and Munanka.

20             The second is that the -- even if it would

21 have been reasonable for him, for Mr. Butler, to assume

22 that Ingen-Housz and Munanka would receive the -- the

23 order in this case, it would not have been reasonable

24 for him to have done nothing, given that Rule 7 of the

25 Alabama rules made him jointly and severally responsible

1 for -- to the client and to the court in this case.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I guess the problem is,

3 accept the rule; it exists.  But if a lawyer says, I

4 don't care, I'm not going to do whatever the rules

5 required me to do, what more do you need for

6 abandonment?

7             If a lawyer comes in and says, I understand

8 this is a rule of the court; I understand that I'm

9 supposed to do x, y, and z; I don't care; I'm just

10 not -- that's the question.

11             MR. NEIMAN:  Yes, well --

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the difference

13 between "I don't care" and abandonment?

14             MR. NEIMAN:  I -- Your Honor, I guess I

15 should just make -- just make a couple points in

16 response to that.  The first is that, as I understood

17 the question posed about the cc line, that is all about

18 not abandonment, but whether the clerk -- the clerk's

19 actions can be blamed for -- or the default can be

20 blamed on the clerk.

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're not talking about

22 the notice issue; we are talking about the abandonment

23 question.

24             MR. NEIMAN:  On the abandonment question, if

25 it really were -- if it really is true that Butler had



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

55

1 decided he was going to do nothing in this case and not

2 represent his client and not be an attorney for the

3 client, then there might be a viable argument that

4 Butler was not -- was not -- had abandoned the client in

5 some way, but that is not the -- a reasonable reading of

6 the record in this case.

7             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we find --

8             MR. NEIMAN:  Butler --

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If we find that these

10 lawyers did abandon their client, will there be some

11 sanction imposed upon them by the bar?  I often wonder,

12 just as when we find that there's been inadequate

13 assistance of counsel in a capital case, does -- does

14 anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate

15 in a capital case?

16             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I suppose it would

17 depend on exactly what the allegations are --

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Have you ever heard of

19 anything happening to them?  Other than they're getting

20 another capital case?

21             (Laughter.)

22             MR. NEIMAN:  Your Honor, I have not.

23 Certainly the rules would provide that a breach of the

24 rules of professional responsibility would be

25 sanctionable by the State bar, both against the Alabama

1 attorney here and the New York attorney.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You said a few

3 moments ago that Butler did more than your friend

4 suggested.  What more did he do?

5             MR. NEIMAN:  Well, of course, we discussed

6 in the briefs the very -- the undisputable fact that

7 Butler filed numerous things, and after the default

8 occurred in this case.  But even --

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, after the

10 default, sure.  But what did he do before?

11             MR. NEIMAN:  Butler's affidavit certainly --

12 that was filed in the State court proceedings certainly

13 doesn't say:  I'm -- I was in this only to swear these

14 people in or move for their admission and nothing else.

15             What Butler says --

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What did he do more

17 than that?

18             MR. NEIMAN:  Butler said -- says, on page

19 255a of the petition appendix, that he agreed to serve

20 as local counsel.  "Local counsel" has a specified

21 meaning under Alabama law.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you made a

23 fairly serious suggestion that your friend had not

24 accurately represented what Butler did.  And you still

25 haven't told me one thing he did more than move the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

57

1 admission of the out-of-town attorneys.

2             MR. NEIMAN:  Well, let me withdraw any

3 suggestion that I am saying that Butler had in fact done

4 something that's -- that's clear on the record.

5             And my time is up.  May I finish?

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Sure.

7             MR. NEIMAN:  The -- my point was that Butler

8 did not simply agree just to move these people -- move

9 these people's admission.  Butler said he would be local

10 counsel.  And local -- the role of local counsel is

11 defined by Rule 7.  It includes an obligation to attend

12 hearings, conferences, and the like.  It also --

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

14             Thank you.

15             Mr. Garre, you have 4 minutes remaining.

16           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY GREGORY G. GARRE

17                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18             MR. GARRE:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19             We agree that this is a sui generis case.

20 The facts are extraordinary, the facts are shocking, and

21 our position is simply that under this Court's

22 precedents and the extraordinary facts here, Mr. Maples

23 has established cause to excuse the default.

24             With respect to local counsel, apart from

25 the fact that the State communicated directly with Mr.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

58

1 Maples, an extraordinary step after the default, maybe

2 the other telling thing is that in 2006, Alabama itself

3 eliminated the local counsel requirement for pro bono

4 proceedings, recognizing that it could only create

5 problems; it didn't add anything.

6             With respect to abandonment, I understood at

7 times my counsel -- my friend, to acknowledge that

8 abandonment may establish an external event with respect

9 to the client.  If that's so, then I think it's clear

10 that we're at a minimum entitled to a remand.  There

11 were statements about what was clear from the record.  I

12 think, at a minimum, the record is not clear on a number

13 of things that this Court would have to get into if it

14 were going to consider adopting the State's position

15 that Mr. Maples was not abandoned.  Mr. Maples was in a

16 prison cell.  His attorneys of record did not tell him

17 that they had left the firm.  They were required not

18 only to tell the court --

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  We don't have to adopt the

20 State's position that he was not abandoned.  We have to

21 adopt your position that he was abandoned.

22             MR. GARRE:  And you have a record of the

23 attorneys leaving with not only not notifying Mr.

24 Maples, not notifying the court, and not obtaining the

25 court's approval, which is required by Rule 6.2 of the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

59

1 Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is troubling to me

3 about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear

4 that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there

5 will be many, many cases in which the allegation is:  My

6 attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent; the

7 attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect

8 abandoned me.

9             And that will substantially change existing

10 law.  Now, how can that be prevented?

11             MR. GARRE:  Working through agency

12 principles that go back to Justice Story's time, working

13 through the principles established in this Court's

14 decision in Holland and that will be applied in Holland.

15 The lower court in Holland issued its decision on remand

16 and found that Mr. Collins had abandoned Mr. Holland,

17 using this Court's precedent as a guide.

18             So, I think Holland already recognizes that

19 attorney abandonment can be external.  We're just asking

20 the Court to apply the same principles and recognize

21 that what's external in one context cannot be not

22 external in the other context.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Counsel, do you know how

24 often Holland relief has been granted -- since it's very

25 recent, but how -- how frequently Holland relief has



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

60

1 been granted by the courts below?

2             MR. GARRE:  I don't know the answer to that

3 question.  I'm not aware of any flood of relief in such

4 cases.  I expect that this would be very extreme.  I

5 think the facts here are about as extreme as you can

6 get.

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Garre, how do we

8 distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, a

9 very botched, transfer of responsibility within a law

10 firm?

11             MR. GARRE:  Well, where you have counsels of

12 record leaving without obtaining the approval that

13 they're required or telling the Court, I think that is

14 abandonment pure and simple.  Beyond that, you would

15 look to agency principles, whether there's a breach of

16 loyalty.  This is going to be a fact -- you would want

17 to get into the facts, although I think it is a very

18 high bar.  I think the Holland decision makes clear it's

19 a high bar.  I think this case clearly passes that bar,

20 but it's something that the courts will work out

21 applying agency principles, applying the Court's

22 decision in Holland.

23             Recognizing what Holland said in this case

24 isn't going to create any new rule; it's simply going to

25 extend logically the recognition that attorney



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

61

1 abandonment is external to the client as it always has

2 been under agency principles.

3             With respect to notice, this Court doesn't

4 have to find a constitutional violation on the State's

5 part.  It's enough for cause that the Court finds that

6 the State's actions are external.  And I think the key

7 inquiry is what Justice Kagan recognized, which is you

8 look to what a person who is actually desirous of

9 providing notice would do.  In this situation, the clerk

10 got two notices back, "Left Firm."  It opened it up; it

11 would have seen this is an order in a capital case, and

12 it did nothing.  I don't think anyone who actually

13 desired to provide notice of an inmate with his life on

14 the line would do nothing, reasonably, in that

15 situation.

16             Mr. Maples is not asking to be released from

17 prison.  He's asking for an opportunity to present

18 serious constitutional claims of ineffective assistance

19 of counsel to a Federal habeas court on the merits.

20             If the claims are as meritless as the State

21 suggests, that clearly will have little burden on it.

22 But simply allowing those claims to be adjudicated on

23 the merits in Federal court will go a long way to

24 preserving the legitimacy of the system of criminal

25 justice in a case in which a man's life is at stake.
