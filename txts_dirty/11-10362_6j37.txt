7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA, 

8  FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

9  MR. PAOLELLA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The plain language of Section 2680(h)'s is law 

12 enforcement proviso waives sovereign immunity in 

13 clear, precise and unambiguous terms. It extends the 

14 waiver to any claim for one of the six enumerated torts 

committed by a Federal investigative or law enforcement 

16 officer acting within the scope of his or her 

17 employment. 

18  And it defines investigative or law 

19 enforcement officer as any officer of the United States 

who is quote, "empowered by law," unquote, to carry out 

21 searches, seizures or arrests. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that include, say, 

23 a meat -- a meat inspector? There is a wide range of 

24 Federal employees that have arrest or search or 

seizure -Â­

MR. PAOLELLA: The proviso doesn't say any 

employee of the United States who is authorized to carry 

out a search, seizure, or arrest. It used the term "any 

officer of the United States." And I believe that the 

term "officer" carries some water here. If we look at a 

spectrum of individuals who have powers -- for example, 

to carry out searches -- we can envision on the one hand 

very traditional core law enforcement officers. 

Let's take a DEA officer who can carry out 

arrests, do searches and seizures, is authorized to use 

force. At the other end of the spectrum, we have 

something like a meat inspector or an OSHA inspector, 

who may have a limited ability to carry out searches, 

but these are searches that are in really a law 

enforcement capacity -- an administrative capacity as 

opposed to a core law enforcement capacity. 

So the government raises the argument, and 

we think it's a plausible interpretation, that by using 

the term "officer" rather than any employee of the 

United States, that there was some limiting factor 

imported into the statute, thereby the statute's plain 

language. 

And I would trust my colleague from the 

Solicitor General's office to map the boundaries of 

that. I would say that in any case, a correctional

officer, who are the individuals who are involved here 

in committing the complained-of acts, certainly falls 

much closer to core law enforcement on that spectrum 

than to the administrative side. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a general matter, first 

in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a 

correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to 

be a peace officer? Do you know? 

MR. PAOLELLA: The -- yes. In many states 

that use the term "peace officer" in the statutes 

defining a peace officer for things -- for example, 

authorizing the use of force or authorizing the carriage 

of weapons -- many States -- it's not uniform, but many 

States include correctional officers within that ambit. 

The Federal Government typically does not 

use the term "peace officer" in its statutes, but if you 

look at Federal statutes that use the term "law 

enforcement officer," which is the very term that's used 

in subsection (h), many -- many of those other statutory 

schemes expressly include correctional officers. So, 

for example, for purposes of civil service pay, for 

purposes of death benefits, of retirement benefits. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove that 

they're officers. I mean, that's -- that's not the test 

for an officer, how much you're paid. The test is

1 whether you exercise significant authority under the 

2 laws of the United States. That's a pretty fuzzy line, 

3 but I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises 

4 significant authority under the laws of the United 

States. 

6  MR. PAOLELLA: I would think in the context 

7 of the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard 

8 could exercise any more authority than they do. In 

9 addition to their correctional function, prison 

correctional officers are essentially the police force 

11 for the prison. 

12  They are charged with maintaining order, and 

13 they're charged with enforcing the laws of the United 

14 States within the confines of the prison, and indeed in 

some specified cases, outside the prison walls. For 

16 example, they are explicitly authorized under Section 

17 3050 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code not just to carry out 

18 arrests in prison for violations of the Federal law, both by 

19 prisoners and visitors, but to carry out arrests outside 

the prison walls to prevent prisoner escapes or to 

21 prevent assaults on other law enforcement officers. So 

22 there's quite expressly an arrest authority granted to 

23 correctional officers. In addition, they have the power 

24 to search for contraband, both in the context of 

visitors to prison and prisoners themselves.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you've argued 

something slightly different than I took from your 

briefs. Earlier, in response I think to 

Justice Ginsburg, you were queueing closer to the 

Solicitor General's position that this has to be limited 

in some way. And you said you'll let them establish the 

boundaries. I don't want to let them establish the 

boundaries. 

I want you to tell me, is it criminal law 

enforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with --

acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a 

law enforcement activity? Because I am finding it hard 

to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on 

an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she 

is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional 

assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that. 

Assuming it falls within the definition of a law 

enforcement activity. 

MR. PAOLELLA: Justice Sotomayor, let me 

begin answering that question by making a distinction 

which I think is an important distinction here, between 

the definition of status and the definition of the 

conduct that's implied here. Because I think this is a 

crucial difference between the amicus's argument on one 

hand and the Solicitor General's office on the other

hand. 

The amicus would limit the type of conduct 

that's covered by the statute. They would limit it to 

actions that occur in a law enforcement capacity. So 

I'm not sure exactly what that means. I think that gets 

passed along with ---

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think they're saying 

is arrests, search and seizure, and whatever the third 

was. 

MR. PAOLELLA: Or some other similar 

activities, which, again, I'm not sure addresses the 

topic --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's define it more 

broadly. Let's assume I was willing to define it to 

include all of the activities that a law enforcement 

agent would engage in, including protective services, 

security services, like your officers. 

MR. PAOLELLA: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that we've 

defined it more broadly. What's the problem with their 

position? 

MR. PAOLELLA: The problem with their 

position is -- with the amicus --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And of -- yes, with 

amicus's or the government's, meaning, instead of

limiting it to criminal activity, limited to law 

enforcement activities broadly defined. 

MR. PAOLELLA: The problem with amicus's 

requirement is it has no textual basis in the 

statute. The statute is very precise. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I will give you --

I'll give you a textual basis. Why is it if all the 

statute is concerned about is the status of being a law 

enforcement -- investigative or law enforcement 

officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does 

not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander, 

misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract 

rights? 

There is excepted from the provisions of the 

Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault, 

battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious 

prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander, 

misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract 

rights. 

However, for -- for purposes of this 

exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the 

exemption, they leave out the latter part. Why did they 

only put in the others? I think the reason they only 

put in the others is that those are the kind of torts 

that would be conducted in the course of conducting a -Â­

what's the words -- investigative or law enforcement

MR. PAOLELLA: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The others would not --

would not occur. 

MR. PAOLELLA: I think that that is a 

limiting factor that is not just implicit but explicit 

in the statutory text. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's -- it's a 

limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an 

intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative 

or law enforcement officers to those activities 

conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing 

the law. 

MR. PAOLELLA: Well, the fact that Congress 

was so explicit about categorizing precisely the kind of 

torts that are covered here -- that sort of conduct --

and the fact that Congress was so precise about 

cross-referencing Section 1346(b), which incorporates 

the scope of employment requirement, suggests to me that 

when Congress wanted to confine the capacity in which 

the acts occurred, it could do so, and it did in fact do 

so.

those other ones? That's what I'm asking you. What 

possible reason is there to leave out libel, slander, 

misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract 

rights? 

MR. PAOLELLA: That was a policy judgment 

that Congress made, that it would not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I didn't deny that 

it's the judgment. What reason could there be for that 

judgment? 

MR. PAOLELLA: That it didn't think that 

those sorts of torts in this context -- and I think we 

all agree this is a law enforcement-oriented provision. 

It's called the law enforcement proviso. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I give you a reason. 

MR. PAOLELLA: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason -- the reason 

they left it out is that they don't think those torts 

would be committed in the course of investigating or 

enforcing the law. 

MR. PAOLELLA: I think that's right, 

Your Honor, but that doesn't mean that from that we 

ought to draw an entirely extra-textual additional 

limitation that goes beyond the specific line that 

Congress did, in fact, draw here.

limitation is scope of employment. 

MR. PAOLELLA: That's right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The scope of employment 

is, and you don't add on anything else to that. You 

don't add arrest, search and seizure. 

But does this whole issue have an academic 

flavor, because how in the world could the conduct 

involved in this case qualify as within the scope of 

employment? 

MR. PAOLELLA: First of all, Your Honor, I 

think that the question of scope of employment was 

something that was conceded below. It was never 

litigated. It was never briefed before the Respondents' 

brief. And from my reading of the question presented as 

this Court formulated it, it was excluded from the 

question presented. So I don't think this Court needs 

to address it. It's more properly addressed on remand 

if it's important. 

But here I think that there is an argument 

that's within the scope of employment. And if you look 

at cases, for example the Mary M. case out of the 

California Supreme Court, there the California Supreme 

Court held that a sexual assault by a law enforcement 

officer of an individual who was subject to that 

officer's authority could be held to be within the scope

of employment, because an officer is vested with 

authority and it is reasonably foreseeable that that 

authority can sometimes be abused if it happens when the 

officer is in uniform, on job hours, dealing with 

someone who that individual is authorized to use 

appropriate force against. 

And even in Pennsylvania, you see cases 

where people do outrageous things, like a private 

detective shooting a picketing protester, where the 

Pennsylvania courts have held that that's within the 

scope of employment. 

It's a complicated issue. It's an issue of 

State law and it will be different in every State, which 

is why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to 

be handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this 

Court on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law. But 

I think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania 

courts would find this within the scope of employment. 

Your Honor, if there's no further questions, 

I will reserve the remainder of my time.

please the Court: 

The text and structure of the law 

enforcement proviso in the Federal Tort Claims Act more 

generally make clear that the proviso unambiguously 

waives sovereign immunity for claims arising under the 

six intentional torts listed for acts or omissions of 

persons qualifying as Federal law enforcement officers 

while acting within their scope of employment. 

Nothing in the statute supports amicus's 

additional limit, which would require such officers to 

be acting in a law enforcement capacity or by exercising 

law enforcement authority, neither of which phrase 

occurs within the statute itself. Quite the contrary --

JUSTICE KAGAN: What are the kinds of 

things, Mr. Yang, that would be within the scope of 

employment, but would not be acting in a law 

enforcement capacity for a law enforcement officer? 

What's the difference between those two standards for a 

law enforcement officer? 

MR. YANG: Well, this is complicated by the 

fact that for the Federal Tort Claims Act, scope of 

employment is a question that turns on State law. As a 

result it will vary. Some States have a rather broad 

understanding of scope of employment and sometimes in 

fact will encompass within the scope of employment

rather egregious intentional torts. It's not 

necessarily what the Court might think of as within the 

scope of one's Federal law enforcement authority. 

So with respect to law enforcement 

authority, I mean, this -- that makes the question a 

little more difficult because that is not something that 

actually appears in the statute and it's not something 

that the United States embraces as a test because it is 

a creation of the amicus. 

What the statute here does, the only term --

the only place that it uses law enforcement is in the 

defined term "investigative or law enforcement officer" 

and then what it does in defining that term --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But you can't give me just a 

couple of examples of how the difference would matter, 

you know, in some States, where something would be --

would meet the scope of employment test, but not meet 

the acting as a law enforcement officer test, for a law 

enforcement officer again. 

MR. YANG: Again, acting as a law 

enforcement officer test is not something that appears 

in the statute and it's not something that even amicus 

has tried to meet the limitations of. It could mean 

various things. It could mean, for instance, something 

as limited as executing a search, seizing evidence or

making an arrest. That would be the Pooler type of 

rationale. 

It could be something incident to that, 

writing a report, as amicus suggests. It could be other 

things. Law enforcement officers often aren't doing the 

very things that we're talking about. They go on 

patrol, they talk to kids in schools. There are all 

types of things that law enforcement officers might do 

that don't fall within what might thing -- what one 

might think of as what, you know, you see on television 

when officers are making contact with the public in 

rather high stakes incidents. 

So it's difficult both because we have a 

State law term that varies and a term that doesn't even 

appear in the statute and that we don't embrace. So 

again, it's difficult to provide examples in any 

definitive way because both of the comparators shift 

depending on what we're talking about. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Yang, even if --

if -- it depends on State law, that's clear. But does 

the United States sometimes concede scope of authority 

so it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in 

the case, the individual officer is off the hook, so 

that the United States could make the argument: It 

never happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff

charged? 

MR. YANG: I believe, if I understand your 

question correctly, the answer is yes, but let me 

qualify that. This came up in a case called 

Osborne v. Haley. And the question about scope of 

employment for purposes of the Westfall Act turns on 

whether at the time of the alleged incident the officer, 

or employee in many cases, was acting within the scope 

of his or her employment. 

Now, when the United States investigates, 

this is authority that is delegated to the Attorney 

General, which is in turn redelegated to the U.S. 

Attorney's offices, investigates the relevant 

circumstances and determines that the allegations are 

just false, not correct at all, in fact it never 

happened, the employee was sitting at his or her desk 

beavering away at important Federal matters, in that 

instance, the Government will say that the employee was 

in fact acting within the scope of his or her employment 

and can explain that the reason for that is the 

Government rejects the underlying factual assertion. 

That's something that then is litigated if 

the Plaintiff seeks to challenge the scope 

determination. And the Court's decision in Osborne 

explains that this is how the situation will play out,

is that then the merits of the case ultimately condensed 

into a challenge to the scope certification of the 

Attorney General. 

So, no, we don't simply say they were within 

scope for no reason. We determine whether they were 

within scope by evaluating the circumstances at issue 

and if the alleged circumstances did not occur and the 

employee was acting within the scope properly, we will 

certify that the employee was acting within the scope. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back and 

tell me, yet again -- you give a limiting principle, but 

I'm not sure how it applies. You seem to be saying --

do you agree with your -- with the Petitioner that law 

enforcement officer includes correction officers? 

MR. YANG: It does. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And why? Because they 

have all of those other powers, so how is that different 

from those in the civil area who have similar powers to 

arrest, search and seize, to --

MR. YANG: Well, I guess there are two 

elements to the definition of investigative or law 

enforcement officer within the statute. First, they 

have to be an officer of the United States. And the 

term "officer" when we are talking about Federal 

officers, the dictionary definition that most commonly

people who have normal Federal criminal law enforcement 

-- well, not Federal but criminal law enforcement 

responsibilities. 

That -- you know, when you back out to the 

second criteria, we think that reinforces --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about Customs 

agents? 

MR. YANG: Customs agents? I don't know if 

they have criminal -- I believe if we assume that they 

are simply doing a civil function, Custom agents would 

not fall within the term "officer" as normally applied. 

Let me give you an example that the amicus 

raises, Federal forest employees -- Forest Service 

employees. Forest Service employees, the clerks that 

work in D.C. are not what one would normally think of as 

an officer, particularly when we are talking about the 

phrase "law enforcement officer." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem is park 

employees I think of as officers when you meet them at 

the parks. They are guarding the parks. 

MR. YANG: Some, some --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or they may also be 

giving tours. They are usually doing sort of a mixture

The Forest Service, as other park -- the Park Service, 

has different roles for various individuals within their 

employ. And there are, in fact, law enforcement 

officers in the Park Service, and there are law 

enforcement officers in the Forest Service, and their 

duties are what one would traditionally think of as law 

enforcement.

didn't take this position below, right? 

MR. YANG: That is correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a change of heart. 

How long ago was it that the United States took the 

opposite position, the position argued by amicus here? 

MR. YANG: Well, this is the Orsay position, 

which is not the Pooler position I believe the Court is 

talking about. Pooler, the Government has not taken the 

view that the Third Circuit was correct and Pooler, as 

far as I can tell, except within the Third Circuit, is 

binding precedent.

Pooler's limited approach and apply a more amorphous law 

enforcement capacity, law enforcement authority, the 

Government has done that in a number of lower cases, 

including several courts of appeals --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it couldn't be that 

obvious, I guess? 

MR. YANG: Well, I think in those cases the 

Government took a position that never was a position 

that made it to the Solicitor General's office. And 

when we took this -- both in the Reynolds case when 

there was an adverse decision to the United States and 

in this case, we determined that the position was not 

one that could be -- was not correct under the text. 

And I think, as amicus's -- amicus does, I 

think, a valiant job of trying to defend that position, 

but at the end of the day, there simply is not a textual 

argument to get to that outcome. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is true that 

there is a strong textual argument for your position. 

But let me ask this: Are there any studies or any 

statistics we can look at to see as a predictive matter 

how many prison suits against the government this ruling 

that you propose would -- would cause? It seems to me 

we have close to 200,000 Federal prisoners, I think, and

to break up fights. 

So there is going to be any number of 

instances where the question is did the guard overreach. 

And if I make the assumption, and it's just an 

assumption because I haven't looked at any statistics, 

but there is -- this is going to vastly expand the 

number of cases in which the Government is the 

defendant. Doesn't that bear on the likelihood of the 

congressional intent to adopt your position? 

MR. YANG: I guess there is a few parts to 

that question. On the statistics, I am not aware of any 

statistics that we would be able to reliably extrapolate 

to see what this would mean. I think there may well be 

some additional cases. However, there are other tools, 

as we explain in our reply brief, including the Prison 

Litigation Reform Act, which requires the prisoners both 

pay their filing fees and if they obtain three strikes, 

must in fact -- they lose IFP status and must pay that 

filing fee in advance, and it's a substantial amount of 

money for many prisoners, given what they earn. 

So we think that it's not a reason to ignore 

what we think is the plain text, particularly where 

Congress here has in the proviso specifically referenced 

Section 1346(b). Section 1346(b) makes clear that the 

waiver of sovereign immunity applies to acts or

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you suggest why 

Congress might have left out libel, slander, 

misrepresentation? 

MR. YANG: Yes. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would they leave 

that out if they are only looking at the office and not 

at the function that the person is performing? 

MR. YANG: Well, I think that those torts 

serve as a rough approximation of what Congress 

anticipated would be the areas where it thought the 

United States should be liable, when we are talking 

about Federal law enforcement officers. And I think in 

fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I mean, that's the 

point. So what you are saying is that it suggests that 

they mean Federal law enforcement officers engaged in 

law enforcement. 

MR. YANG: Well, not -- I don't know that 

that is the case, Justice Scalia. Certainly there is 

some correlation between those torts and how we should, 

for instance, understand "officer of the United States," 

things like false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious 

prosecution. All evoke Federal criminal law enforcement 

ideas. However, when we look at the text that Congress

used to implement the statute, the text is not like any 

of the other instances within the Federal Tort Claims 

Act, where Congress has limited the waiver to particular 

types of activities or carved out certain activities. 

In fact, what Congress did was reference 

back to the general waiver provision which explains that 

the waiver applies to acts within the scope of 

employment. 

If Congress had wanted, for instance, to say 

only within law enforcement capacity, it would have used 

very different language. The language of sections --

the other provisions in Sections 2680, for instance, 

subsections (a), (b), and (c), which limit -- which 

carve out the execution of a statute or regulation, 

exercise of discretionary functions, the loss, 

miscarriage or negligent transmission of postal matter, 

assessment or collection of taxes or customs duties, (f) 

specifically directs -- carves out the imposition or 

establishment of a quarantine, (j) carves out the 

combatant activities of military forces. If Congress 

wanted to use similar language like law enforcement 

activities of a law enforcement officer, it would have 

done that. 

And the United States -- I don't want to 

bang the drums too loudly here. We did take a contrary

case, we simply determined that the position could not 

be one that would square to the test. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume we adopted 

the definition Justice Scalia just proposed, law 

enforcement officer engaged in law enforcement 

activities. Would correction officers be engaged in law 

enforcement activities? 

MR. YANG: Well, yes -- maybe yes, maybe no. 

What we are talking about is an undefined term and the 

term does not even -- does not appear in the statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you can look at it 

both ways. Are correction officers as officers who are 

protecting or securing prisoners, are they acting in a 

law enforcement capacity in your -- forget about what 

act, what tort they commit, but do they function --

MR. YANG: There could be many answers to 

that question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. 

MR. YANG: You could, as the amicus or as 

the Petitioner suggests, say that the enforcement of a 

criminal sentence is part of law enforcement capacity, 

so anything that they do is law enforcement. 

You could think of law enforcement capacity 

as more like arrests, you know, searches for violations

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ, 

FOR AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW, 

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 

I hope to convince the Court of two things 

today. First is about our reading of the law 

enforcement proviso as limited to conduct of 

investigative or law enforcement officers acting as 

such. The first is that that reading is textually 

plausible. It is a reasonable reading of what Congress 

enacted in light of the structure of the statute and in 

light of ordinary English usage. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask, in light of 

your opening statement, are you then abandoning your 

position that it must be either arrest, search or 

seizure? You have used the Ninth Circuit formula. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's

not really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the 

Third Circuit are from each other, because there haven't 

been cases that have arisen that have really tested the 

proposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally 

only, the execution of a search, the seizure of 

evidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would 

exclude conduct very closely incident to one of those 

things. Those cases just haven't arisen. 

So the courts have used different 

formulations. They appear to mean slightly different 

things by them, but I wouldn't want to exaggerate the 

differences between the Third Circuit and the Ninth 

Circuit. Both are trying to capture what Congress was 

getting at here, which was the law enforcement proviso 

was about law enforcement activity. It was about 

covering the United States under the FTCA for abuses of 

law enforcement authority like had occurred in 

Collinsville, which was the national scandal that 

prompted the enactment of the proviso. 

So I think the answer to, Justice Ginsburg, 

to your question, is: We think that if you take the 

Third Circuit's language in Pooler, which of course is 

not this case, but if you take the Pooler language 

literally and you say that the only conduct covered is 

conduct in the course of -- that's language the Court 

27

Official 

1 used a few times in Pooler -- in the course of a search, 

2 an arrest, or a seizure of evidence, that's problematic 

3 because it's clear that Congress was trying to cover 

4 abuses of law enforcement authority, including malicious 

prosecution and abuse of process, which we know because 

6 Congress included those torts in the exception to the 

7 exception. And if you had a situation where an officer 

8 conducted a search and then wrote a false report about 

9 the search that he had conducted, the writing of the 

report wouldn't literally be in the course of the 

11 search. And so if you take those words in Pooler literally, 

12 that would be excluded. That can't be right. 

13  So to that extent we agree with the Ninth 

14 Circuit position rather than the Third Circuit position. 

But again I'm not really sure that it's fair to 

16 attribute that extreme position to the Third Circuit. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, the statute 

18 itself has a kind of conduct-based limitation in it. It 

19 says law enforcement officers acting within the scope of 

their employment. 

21  So I guess my question is, given that there 

22 is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one 

23 would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting 

24 as law enforcement officers? Why wouldn't one use just 

the conduct-based limitation that's already there?

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kagan, I don't think 

it's a substitution. I think it's an addition if it's 

anything. But really the reason is that under ordinary 

English usage, when there's a reference to somebody 

defined by their status, it's fair to assume that the 

reference to the person defined by their status is 

really just intended to cover things they do in that 

relevant status and not things they do in some other 

capacity. 

What we're asking the Court to do here is 

exactly what the Court did in Lane v. Pena. In Lane v. 

Pena, the statute at issue was the Rehabilitation Act. 

It waived sovereign immunity and provided a damages 

remedy against Federal providers of funding. The 

Department of Transportation clearly was a Federal 

provider of funding. It gave out all sorts of funding 

to all sorts of recipients. 

But that's not what the case was about. The 

case was about the Merchant Marine Academy and somebody 

who was dismissed from it. And what the Court said is 

the reference to Federal funding providers like the 

Department of Transportation had to be read as limited 

to Federal funding providers acting as such. Those were 

the Court's words, "acting as such." 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. And then -- then

take that theory and track through the statute to show 

me how that theory works, which is what your opening 

argument was going to do. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Kennedy, in the first 

sentence of the proviso, the operative provision, 

Congress referred to acts or omissions of investigative 

or law enforcement officers of the United States. 

Congress didn't say any acts or omissions of 

investigative or law enforcement officers were covered. 

It didn't say all were covered. It just said acts or 

omissions of law enforcement officers in the same way 

that the statute at issue in Lane referred to conduct of 

a Federal funding provider. 

And so what this Court should do, we submit, 

is construe acts or omissions of investigative or law 

enforcement officers of the United States as limited to 

acts or omissions of those defined -- that defined class 

of persons in the relevant capacity, when they're acting 

as law enforcement officers. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But again, it's not just any 

acts of law enforcement officers. It's acts of law 

enforcement officers acting within the scope of their 

authority. And now you're saying acting as a law 

enforcement officer. I mean, one question I suppose I 

have, which is the same question that I gave to Mr.

Yang, is what's the difference between those two things? 

And I guess the second question is: Why would we 

substitute one phrase about how they have to be acting 

for the phrase that Congress actually used? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Congress didn't, in the 

proviso, Justice Kagan, Congress did not actually use 

the phrase "scope of employment." It did not actually 

incorporate scope of employment as a limitation 

explicitly in the proviso. It -- it incorporated 

1346(b), which contains the scope requirement. But the 

proviso -- in the proviso, Congress did not actually 

speak in terms of scope of employment as the operative 

limitation. So I don't think we'd be substituting the 

acting as such limitation for anything that actually 

appears in the proviso. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a limitation? Is 

scope a limitation? I thought that you -- you didn't 

question that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct 

that's covered, right? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg, we 

certainly agree that -- that the conduct that's covered 

has to be within the scope of the Federal officer's 

employment. The only point I was trying to make a 

moment ago in response to Justice Kagan is that 

requirement exists in 1346, not in the proviso by its

terms. We certainly agree with that, and as we've 

argued in our brief, we think that one way the Court 

could affirm the judgment below is to hold that the 

officers here were not acting within the scope of their 

employment, taking the allegations as true, as they have 

to be at this stage of the case. 

But to return to Justice Kagan, to your 

question about why Congress would have wanted to -- the 

Court to -- to interpret "acts or omissions of law 

enforcement officers" as acting as such, it's because --

in part the answer is because scope turns on State law. 

So Congress doesn't know when it enacts the proviso 

what's going to be covered if the only limitation is 

scope, because that turns on 50 different States' laws. 

And -- and I think that it's fair to say that there are 

actual meaningful differences between different States' 

laws as to scope as we -- as we point out in our brief. 

But the other past of the answer is the --

is the second part of this Court's analysis in Lane v. 

Pena, which is it's entirely possible literally to read 

the Rehabilitation Act in Lane, and I would grant that 

it's possible literally to read the words in the 

proviso, as covering everything that a defined law 

enforcement officer does within the scope of employment. 

But the Court said in Lane: We can't read the statute

that way, because we're talking about a waiver of 

immunity, and waivers of immunity, even if you don't 

have to put a heavy thumb on the scales and even if you 

don't have to require that it be unequivocal -- we're 

not going that far here -- you can't interpret it more 

broadly than there's any reason to think Congress meant. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What does it leave out? 

What does it leave out, your theory? A policeman's a 

law enforcement officer. What does he do on his job 

that isn't in a law enforcement role? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, there may be certain 

types of law enforcement officers, Justice Breyer, who 

generally aren't engaged in law enforcement activity 

when they're within the scope of employment. But that's 

not the case with respect to correctional officers like 

are at issue here. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I see. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: And the reason for that is --

and other types of officers, which hopefully I'll be 

able to get to, but correctional officers first since 

that's what this case is about. 18 U.S.C. 3050 is what 

makes correctional officers fall within the second 

sentence of the proviso, the definition that Congress 

provided of investigative or law enforcement officers.

JUSTICE BREYER: So your idea here is a park 

policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the 

time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time. 

You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged 

in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's 

engaged in the tour. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's right, because he 

meets the status-based definition that Congress 

provided, but there's no reason to think Congress 

intended that he be covered when he's not engaged in law 

enforcement activity. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What -- what 

is it about a corrections officer other than the act 

that was committed here, which was an alleged sexual act 

which nobody could, except by some definition of State 

law, think that that ever happens naturally in the 

course. But that's an intentional assault. The very 

definition of the crimes that are covered assumes that 

it's not an act that's licensed. So, why isn't the 

correction officer acting in a law enforcement capacity 

when he's restraining people and securing them? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Because the correctional 

officer essentially has two capacities. 18 U.S.C.

pointed to, to make correctional officers fall within

the definition of law enforcement officers in the first 

place, it has nothing to do with correctional officers' 

daily interaction with already incarcerated prisoners. 

It authorizes correctional officers to arrest escaped 

inmates and to arrest visitors to prisons. It has no 

application to their daily interaction with 

prisoners who are already incarcerated. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the takedown 

that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon. The --

your definition includes three things, arrest, search, 

seizure. And correctional officers do engage in 

searches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in 

seizures. Those are not -- this isn't like arrest, 

which you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an 

escapee or a visitor. But that's not true of search and 

seizure. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Ginsburg, 

correctional officers do search prisoners' cells on a 

routine basis as part of their duty to maintain order 

and security within the prisons. That responsibility 

comes not from 18 U.S.C. 3050, but from 18 U.S.C. 4001 

and following, which is an entirely different set of 

legal authorities that has to do with the Attorney 

General's management of the Bureau of Prisons under his 

supervision and correctional officers -- and 28 C.F.R.

Part 552, which is where the correctional officers get 

their authority from to search prisoner cells, et 

cetera. 

We think that when -- when correctional 

officers are engaged in that kind of activity, they're 

acting in a security capacity to maintain order and 

security within the prison. They're not acting in their 

very narrow law enforcement capacity conferred by 18 

U.S.C. 3050. This case doesn't have --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what happens --

what happens in the police precinct when police officers 

are holding pretrial detainees? Are they acting as 

police officers or as security people? Or even when a 

prisoner comes back to court for a court appearance and 

there are U.S. marshals who guard them rather than 

correction officers, what are they serving as in your 

mind? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, as I said before, 

Justice Sotomayor, I think there are certain types of 

law enforcement officers who generally when they're 

acting within the scope of employment are engaged in law 

enforcement activity. And deputy U.S. marshals would 

probably fall within that. But the important point 

about this case is it doesn't, Justice Ginsburg, involve 

an allegation about a search. So whatever the Court

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why isn't this -- why 

isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement? I 

6 mean, the law says these people are going to be locked 

7 up and he's enforcing that. 

8  MR. BUCHOLTZ: The law is already --

prison under these da, da, da, da, da. You know, all that

12 they're all regulations, rules, statutes. He's

course of those three things the way Pooler could 

possibly be read, but also conduct that's closely 

incident to those things. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't think the 

EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces 

statutes and regulations, do you? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: It depends, Justice Scalia, 

it depends --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would an officer of the EPA 

be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to 

a company saying, you know, you are violating section 

such-and-such of the statute? Is that a law enforcement 

officer? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, the person who writes 

the letter may qualify as a law enforcement officer 

under the definition, but that's a different question, I 

would submit, than whether that -- whether that act 

constitutes law enforcement activity. 

I think the answer to that question, 

Justice Scalia, is probably no, but the important 

follow-up is if that person meets the definition of law 

enforcement officer because he's an EPA agent, and after 

the letter he follows up and goes to the premises of the 

recipient of the letter, knocks down the door and 

conducts an illegal search, that's what Congress was

3 I'm thinking of, I don't think they are. I am thinking

to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and 

6 not seizing evidence. They are on patrol. That's 

7 basically what they do. All right? Is that a law 

8 enforcement activity? 

9  MR. BUCHOLTZ: If it's an FBI agent? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I 

11 mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand. So I'm 

12 sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to 

13 ordinary policemen. 

14  MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Breyer, the answer --

the answer -- well, it might not be so easy to find an 

16 analogy to an ordinary policeman --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But FBI agents, 

18 who are the federal police, they're people on Federal 

19 enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal 

enclaves, they act like policemen, okay.

22 engaged in patrols, I think it's fair to say that's

broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble 

when we consider real policemen. So if you have a broad 

one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it. 

If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots 

of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't 

doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside 

your narrow definition. I wish I could think of better 

examples, but I came up with the ones I did. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Then maybe I should try to 

return to some of the examples that other Justices have 

given. So there was talk earlier about an OSHA 

inspector. The Government's position -- and I think 

this is an important difference between our position and 

the Government's -- the Government would say that 

because OSHA isn't a criminal law in the traditional 

sense and an OSHA inspector or an OSHA agent isn't 

enforcing criminal law in the colloquial sense, that 

that shouldn't be covered. 

But if the OSHA inspector knocks down your 

door and conducts an illegal search and batters you, why 

shouldn't that be covered? We know that's a law 

enforcement abuse, and we know that law enforcement 

abuses is exactly what Congress is trying to get at. The 

Government, it's like it's trying to relitigate Marshall 

against Barlows where this Court held that OSHA

inspectors have to have a warrant even though you could 

think of OSHA as being administrative or civil as 

opposed to criminal. That's the argument that the 

Government made there a generation ago and they lost. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So how does that argument 

help your case? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Because, Justice Kennedy, the 

point in this case is that we agree that correctional 

officers fall within the plain language of the 

definition that Congress provided. Again, the structure 

of the proviso is there are two sentences, an operative 

provision and the definition. 

We are trying to get the Court to construe 

the operative provision, the first sentence, in the same 

way the Court did in Lane against Pena. The Government 

is trying to get the Court to construe the definition, 

the second sentence. What Congress said in the 

definition, what the term means, the Court has much less 

scope to construe that in some way other than the 

literal language that Congress provided where Congress 

said what the term means. 

So we agree under the plain language of the 

definition that correctional officers are investigative 

or law enforcement officers because of 18 U.S.C. 3050, 

which gives them the power under limited, and

inapplicable here, circumstances to arrest. 

We think that if you look at correctional 

officers under 18 U.S.C. 3050 or under the different 

authorities under 18 U.S.C. 4001 and following and the 

regulations, that they wear two hats. Sometimes they 

act in a law enforcement capacity, but not usually, 

because that only applies in the narrow context of 

escapes or visitors. When they are dealing with already 

incarcerated prisoners, like in the allegations here, 

they are really not acting in that capacity at all. 

They are wearing a different hat. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying that the 

Government is trying to minimize the consequences of 

coming out its way by providing a definition of the 

officers covered, which will not hold. You think it 

does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA 

inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not 

engaged in law enforcement activities. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Scalia, you have 

absolutely perfectly encapsulated our position. Thank 

you. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: The reason why we think that 

that difference between our position and the 

Government's is important is that the Government's 

42

Official 

1 position would render the proviso severely 

2 underinclusive. We know Congress was trying to get at 

3 law enforcement abuses and provide a remedy. And 

4 Congress -- the Government would say that if it's not a 

traditional law enforcement officer in the colloquial 

6 sense of like a constable, that it's not covered. But 

7 all sorts of agents of the United States from OSHA to 

8 FDA to all sorts of other agencies, to EPA, engage in 

9 law enforcement activity like the three things we know 

Congress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing 

11 searches, seizing evidence, making arrests for 

12 violations of Federal law. And I don't see any basis 

13 consistent with the text or our understanding of what 

14 Congress intended, to the extent it's different from the 

text, to say that that's not covered. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The one other advantage of 

17 your definition is that it takes us out of workplace 

18 fights between two employees, because presumably the 

19 officers who punch each other out, if that incident 

occurs, aren't acting in a law enforcement capacity. I 

21 am assuming that is part of your argument as well. 

22  MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's part of it, that's 

23 right.

which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly 

we define law enforcement activities. 

If we take it as broadly as the Government 

is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very 

well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement 

activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be. 

It would include securing or detaining people, or 

securing or detaining people. And it would include the 

Park Service person who stops a visitor and punches them 

out. It would include the military personnel who stops 

someone and does an intentional tort against them, even 

though they may just be walking on the grounds rather 

than serving as security that particular day. 

So the point is, why should we give it the 

narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader 

reading the Government seems to be suggesting? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, two parts to the 

answer, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the Government 

is trying to give the first sentence the broader 

reading, which it recognizes then creates a problem that 

it tries to solve by narrowing the second sentence in a 

way that we think won't hold. 

But the other part of the answer, 

Justice Sotomayor, is it's about congressional intent. 

Justice Kennedy asked earlier about whether the

Government's interpretation or the Petitioner's 

interpretation would unleash a flood of suits by 

prisoners and whether it's fair to think that Congress 

would have intended that. If you look at the 

legislative history of the proviso, there is absolutely 

no indication that anyone in Congress contemplated that 

the proviso would or could or should apply in the prison 

situation. All Congress was focused on was providing a 

remedy for the kinds of raids that had occurred in 

Collinsville. 

And so I think when somebody has two hats, 

like a prison guard has, because, again, there is two 

different sources of legal authority that they are 

exercising, 18 U.S.C. 3050 versus 4001, or a military 

policeman who has two hats, in the cases like Holian that 

we describe in our briefs where the Government made the 

argument that where a military policeman is engaged in a 

military function, not a law enforcement function, that 

they are not covered. 

We think where somebody who meets the 

definition that Congress provided of an investigative or 

law enforcement officer has two distinct hats, two 

distinct capacities. When they are not acting in the 

law enforcement one, they are not covered. There is no 

reason to think that Congress intended that military

police or prison guards be covered when they are 

maintaining order on a military base or within a prison. 

That's not what Congress was trying to get at. 

And we think again a severe disadvantage of 

the Government's position, they are trying to solve --

in a sense they are trying to solve the same problem 

that we are with our acting as such interpretation, but 

they are trying to solve it through the wrong part of 

the statute and in a way that -- in a way ends up with 

the worst of both worlds. 

You end up with broader coverage of the kind 

of conduct that's covered, broader than there is any 

reason to think Congress intended, conduct that doesn't 

involve law enforcement activity at all, but a narrower 

class of people whose conduct is covered. Where that 

excludes people like OSHA inspectors, FDA agents, EPA 

agents and in the rare circumstance where the Forest 

Service employee is acting as a law enforcement officer 

rather than as a botanist or an entomologist or 

something like that, we think Congress intended to cover 

them. 

We know from the definition that there were 

three exercises of law enforcement authority that 

Congress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing 

searches, seizing evidence and making arrests. Where

We think it's better to interpret the first 

sentence of the proviso the same way the Court did in 

Lane against Pena as limited to acts or omissions of 

investigative or law enforcement officers acting as 

such, and keep the definition that Congress provided the 

way Congress provided it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then scope becomes kind 

of a surplusage. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Not surpluses necessarily, 

Justice Ginsburg, because it varies among States. There 

could be States where scope is narrower or broader, and 

there could always be situations where State law is such 

that the easiest way to resolve a case is under scope, 

and not under the concept of acting as a law enforcement 

officer. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a law 

enforcement function. Give -- give me an example of a 

case where -- where scope would also be relevant, would 

also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law 

enforcement function, then it fits. So what does scope 

add?

a relatively narrow conception of scope so that you have 

to be trying to serve your employer, which is the 

traditional rule, and not just sort of on the job in a 

loose sense, which is what the D.C. rule has come to be, 

an officer who is engaged in a search or making --

is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the 

evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's 

somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to 

the cell block. Is that an arrest? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: No, Justice Kennedy, it's not 

an arrest, for, among other reasons, the reason that 

prison guards don't have any legal authority to make an 

arrest in that circumstance. 

The prisoner's already been arrested.

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Yes. And 28 CFR part 552 

sets out the authorities that prison guards have to 

enforce prison regulations to maintain security and 

order within the prison, like in that circumstance. 

That's not making an arrest. The prison guards have the 

authority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's not a law 

enforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in 

your view? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: That's correct, 

Justice Kennedy. That -- that may involve the use of 

force and I -- you know, you can make an argument that 

-- that when you pick somebody up like in your 

hypothetical, that that's like an arrest at common law. 

There's no reason to think Congress was getting at that, 

was trying to cover that in the proviso. 

Where somebody has two different distinct 

capacities as a matter of law, the way Bureau of Prisons 

guards do, and they're acting in the one and not the 

other, then I think that's the simple answer, is that --

on the ground and pick him up? Would it apply to the 

officer who files an arrest complaint against the 

prisoner, and not to the security officer who just 

merely carries him back to his cell? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Justice Sotomayor, the 

hypothetical is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or does some physical 

injury that's substantial. So the intentional assault 

gets treated as an exception to this only when the 

security officer actually files an arrest complaint? Or 

would it at all? 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Are you talking about a 

Bureau of Prison guard filing the arrest complaint? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I think -- one thing to 

point out is the government informs the Court in its 

reply brief that in a situation where there has been a 

violation of prison rules that may also be a violation 

of Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you 

know, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the 

prison guard as conducting an investigation for 

violation of a Federal crime. 

What happens is the BOP guards don't do that 

themselves. They call in the FBI. That's what the 

government says in its reply brief. So I think that

1 itself is an indication of the distinction between 

2 prison guards who are law enforcement officers as 

3 Congress has defined the term, but who are not 

4 traditional law enforcement officers, as the government 

seeks to define -- redefine the term, and in that 

6 capacity are not acting as law enforcement officers. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bucholtz, I'm sure you 

8 have done this already, so I apologize, but could you 

9 just state your definition of what it means to be acting 

as a law enforcement officer? What activities other 

11 than the three listed get included? 

12  MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, Justice Kagan, it's 

13 hard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies 

14 to all different types of law enforcement officers. Let 

me start by saying that the three things that have to be 

16 included are the three things that Congress specified, 

17 and that's one of the problems with the government's 

18 definition, is that it reads out cases involves those 

19 three activities, involving, in the government's view --

kinds of officers. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't want to limit it 

22 to those -- so what else gets in the mix? How would you 

23 define it generally? 

24  MR. BUCHOLTZ: So -- in a case that involves 

one of those three things but also something else that's

2 it would probably be artificial. And you can imagine 

3 all sorts of hypos, but it might well be artificial to 

4 separate the writing of the -- of the report about the 

arrest from the arrest itself. So conduct incident to 

6 one of these three specified activities we think is 

7 probably covered. We also think that maybe when you are 

8 talking about a type of law enforcement officer like an 

9 FBI agent who is wearing his law enforcement hat all the 

time, doesn't have a second distinct capacity as a 

11 matter of law, like a military policeman or correctional 

12 officer, that maybe a broader definition is appropriate, 

13 that maybe the FBI agent who is --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Maybe? I mean, yes or no or 

when or --

16  MR. BUCHOLTZ: Well, I mean, Justice Kagan, 

17 in fairness, this case doesn't present that question, 

18 because it doesn't involve any law enforcement activity at all. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But if we're going to adopt 

your definition, we have to have some understanding of 

21 where it's taking us. 

22  MR. BUCHOLTZ: Of course. Of course. And 

23 where I think it would be taking the Court is that as 

24 always, there could be hard cases that could arise that 

the lower courts would have to grapple with, but I think

the important concept is, that where somebody has two 

hats, a law enforcement capacity and some other 

capacity, then it's easy to draw that line, in concept. 

Again, there could be hard cases, but as a concept, it's 

easy to draw that line. 

Where somebody doesn't have two hats, they 

only have one hat, like an FBI agent, and they are on 

the job and they are engaged in what normal people would 

think of as law enforcement activity, maybe that's 

covered. I don't really have a -- have a problem with 

that. 

I think -- I think that's probably 

consistent with what Congress was getting at. And maybe 

the way to think about it is, Congress defined "law 

enforcement officer" with reference to the three 

specified kinds of exercises of law enforcement 

authority, but when the FBI agent is interviewing a 

witness or potential suspect but hasn't yet gotten to 

the point of arresting a person or conducting a search, 

you can think of that as preliminary to an exercise of 

one of the three specified authorities, because after 

all, that's what the FBI agent has the authority to do, 

it's what his job entails. 

And depending on how the initial questioning 

goes, that might be the next step. And so it's never

far from the scene, when an FBI agent is engaged in what 

you would normally think of as law enforcement activity, 

that one of the three specified law enforcement 

activities could be in the offing. 

That's very different when you're talking 

about Forest Service employees who technically meet the 

definition but who usually are not doing anything within 

a million miles of what normal people would think of as 

law enforcement activity. 

So I think it's important to distinguish 

between different kinds of people who fall within the 

definition. And -- I understand the Court wants to try 

to figure out what the implications of this 

interpretation would be. I think that in the prison 

context, the answer is clear, because there are two 

distinct capacities. And that's a hugely important 

context as a practical matter, given the point that 

Justice Kennedy made about the likelihood of an enormous 

number of claims that Congress probably didn't intend. 

In the military police context, where there 

are also two distinct capacities, it's probably pretty 

easy to draw the line. In other cases, it will be 

case-by-case whether something that the Plaintiff 

alleges should be thought of as law enforcement activity 

or law enforcement officer acting as such. We don't

traditional law enforcement officer in a context that 

it's clear Congress intended.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. PAOLELLA, 

FOR PETITIONER, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

MR. PAOLELLA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Let me begin by addressing Justice Kennedy's 

point, his question regarding the possibility of a flood 

of lawsuits from prisoners. I think it's important to 

keep in mind that right now, Pooler and Orsay are the 

minority rules. Most Federal courts have adopted a 

broad interpretation of the law enforcement proviso. 

So if adopting a broader interpretation here 

would open the flood gates, the flood gates are already 

open, and they have been for 40 years in most of the 

country. And we haven't seen a flood of FTCA suits 

brought by prisoners, especially since the passage of 

the PLRA --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Have they also adopted the

government's view of what counts as an officer, or have 

they not? 

MR. PAOLELLA: I -- I don't think that the 

issue has really been litigated in the Federal courts. 

It simply hasn't come up. And I think that that's an 

indication that it's -- it's a workable test. It's --

it's not something -- that there are many, many cases, 

the vast majority of cases, involve individuals who will 

be by any reasonable definition core law enforcement 

officers. As far as I am aware, every Federal court to 

address the issue has defined correctional officers as 

law enforcement officers. You know -- as officers, as 

that term is used. 

So I think that these things are really 

ultimately noncontroversial. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you support the 

government's position on who's an officer, right? So it 

wouldn't include EPA. Is that --

MR. PAOLELLA: I think that the word 

"officer" carries some water in this statute, and it 

means something other than "employee." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a yes or a no? 

MR. PAOLELLA: Yes. 

Justice Scalia, let me return to your 

earlier point about inferring congressional intent from,

for example, from the list of enumerated torts. And I 

think it's important to keep in mind that the best 

evidence of Congress's intent is the text of the 

statute. And the fundamental problem with amicus's 

position is that he very ably uses tools for construing 

ambiguous statutes to construe a statute that at its 

core is not ambiguous, it's precise and it's definite. 

Now, the coverage that is created by the 

literal words of the statute may be debatable as a 

policy matter. Maybe it makes sense to include 

correctional officers, maybe it doesn't. But it's not 

absurd. And this Court's rule is when you were 

construing a non-ambiguous statute, Congress gets to 

draw that policy line, not the Court, as long as the 

result is not absurd. 

And we would argue that Congress drew that 

policy line here. It very specifically provided that 

any claim based on enumerated tort by a federal law 

enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or 

her employment, is where it drew that line, that's what 

the statute literally says. There is no argument about 

that. And I think that all of the results, the parade 

of horribles that amicus has raised, again, may be 

debatable as a policy matter, but not one of them is an 

absurd exercise of Congress's responsibility. And as a
