 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Jones versus Bock, and Williams versus Overton. 

Mr. Andre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ANDRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In these three cases, each of the three 

petitioners filed administrative grievances with the 

Michigan Department of Corrections. The Michigan 

Department of Corrections conducted investigations and 

issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's 

grievances. Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each 

of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal 

court without leave to amend because petitioners failed 

to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made 

corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement. None 

of those three corollaries find any meaningful support 

in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they 

contradict the federal rules. Nor do they find any 

support in administrative law or habeas law, the two 

areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in 

interpreting administrative litigation and format.

Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that 

have considered these questions have rejected them all.

 I'd like to begin with the heightened 

pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here. The 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to 

simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on 

which his or her claim will lie. The Federal Rules of 

Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of 

allegations that a plaintiff must plead with 

specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of 

Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them. 

Accordingly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district court 

finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims 

are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that. And 

the district court said, the only way I can figure out 

the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going 

to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a 

more definite, an order for a more definite statement, 

because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think. Can 

the district court do that?

 MR. GRANT: I think that would be correct, 

and that would be consistent with the Court's habeas 

jurisprudence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The court could ask for a

pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?

 MR. ANDRE: I believe that's true.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why isn't this --

this is just the same if the court has said, you know, 

in order to make our screening function efficient, we 

just have to know about exhaustion.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, when 

Congress created the various screening provisions in the 

PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion. It clearly had 

exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA. The term 

"exhaustion" appears in 42 U.S.C. 1997 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How about, what, if you 

concede the district court could do it in individual 

cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do 

it? That's my question.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, what sets the Sixth 

Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you 

propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence 

is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the 

prisoner, is given a chance to respond. In the Sixth 

Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened 

pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial 

complaint, they are out. There is no leave to amend, 

and that's what happened in this case.

 In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the

complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted 

his administrative remedies. He said: I exhausted my 

administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance 

on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he 

went down the list through all three steps.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The briefs point out that a 

number of district courts have form complaints that are 

often used in these cases and that these forms call on 

the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of 

exhaustion. Now, do you think there's something wrong 

with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form 

and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not 

exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the 

screening stage to dismiss the case?

 MR. ANDRE: With respect to the form, I 

don't think that the form is improper, but I think it 

would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's 

case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of 

the form that asks him about exhaustion because 

exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both 

administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication 

in this statute that Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO: If it's an affirmative 

defense, then why is it -- why is it proper for a 

district court, for a district court, to have a form

that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative 

defense?

 MR. ANDRE: I think the district court can 

ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district 

court likes. But whether the district court could, 

could dismiss a case for failure to comply, failure to 

respond to that question, that's another matter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know under 

the statue they can dismiss a case because it's 

frivolous, right?

 MR. ANDRE: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Regardless of the 

substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that 

you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't 

that a frivolous claim?

 MR. ANDRE: We would certainly concede that 

if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a 

prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative 

remedies then that claim can be dismissed. I guess the 

way it would operate -- and I haven't seen a case like 

this -- but it would be where a prisoner says, I didn't 

exhaust my administrative remedies and I have no excuse 

for failing to do so, but please, district court, please 

take mercy on me. And in that situation the district 

court could say, there's absolutely no way you can

possibly prevail on the merits, so your claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: Probably the reason they do 

this is that there are lots and lots of claims by 

prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher. 

They don't know what it's about. They don't want to put 

the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single 

complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about 

nothing. That's the kind of reasoning that would lead 

to a rule like this. So -- and then you have the 

statute and the statute says indeed there's a special 

power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't 

state a claim or malicious.

 So why isn't this just an exercise of the 

Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary 

rulemaking powers? They're trying to figure out how to 

manage their docket.

 MR. ANDRE: The problem is that it conflicts 

with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8. And as 

this Court this repeatedly said, including as recently 

as last term in Hill v. McDonough, the Court will not 

impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an 

amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So your point would be that 

they can do this if we amend the Federal Rules. If it's 

a problem take it to the Rules Committee?

MR. ANDRE: I think that's correct. I think 

that's correct, but if it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If we amended the rules 

that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative 

defense. I mean, by definition an affirmative defense 

gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended 

the Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like 

adding an element to the claim.

 MR. ANDRE: Right. Or if the Court were to 

add PLRA exhaustion to the Rule 9(c).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Rule 8 and the 

normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation 

under the PLRA where the district court has an 

affirmative obligation screen on its own before the 

defendant even gets involved. So if in fact, just to 

follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of 

the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a 

reasonable means of facilitating the screening 

obligation?

 MR. ANDRE: It may be a reasonable means, 

but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible, 

because Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted 

the PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA 

screening provisions is the term "exhaustion."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you just

told me earlier that if it was a case in which 

exhaustion is required and not done that would be a 

frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous 

claims. So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has 

just said, we know that in a large number of cases they 

are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the 

exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find 

out which those cases are to fulfill the screening 

obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8 

type of case.

 MR. ANDRE: Right, I think I understand. I 

think it goes back still to the fact that there's not a 

clear Congressional expression to take these cases out 

of the Federal Rules. In Califano v. Yamasaki we 

believe is instructive on that point. In in that case 

the Secretary of the Department of Health Education and 

Welfare had argued that Section 205(g) of the Social 

Security Act, which used the term "individual," somehow 

took those, those judicial review procedures, out of the 

operation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. This 

Court said: No, we cannot read the word "individual" as 

such a clear expression. It may have been Congress's 

policy to have individual claims be addressed one by 

one, but you have to find that clear expression in the 

statute and that clear expression is not here.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about 1997(e) and 

(g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from 

getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer 

unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a 

reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits. 

Doesn't this clearly take this out of the normal 

pleading procedures?

 MR. ANDRE: I don't think so, Justice Alito. 

We have exhaustively researched that language, the 

reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits 1997(g), 

and the only courts that construe that language are 

courts construing 1997(e) and (g), and they have 

universally found that that provision simply summarizes 

the other screening provisions' terms, so, frivolous, 

malicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks -- from an 

immune defendant. And we can't really think of what, 

what else Congress would have had in mind because while 

it's like the preliminary injunction standard it makes 

no sense that Congress wanted a prisoner to satisfy a 

preliminary injunction standard before requiring prison 

officials to respond.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would your answer be 

different if amendment were allowed? I mean isn't the 

problem in substance here, and I don't mean to dismiss 

your arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument

from the text of the rules aside, it wouldn't be a real 

problem here in substance if the circuit bar allowed 

amendment, would it?

 MR. ANDRE: I think if the circuit were to, 

Sixth Circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly 

mitigate the situation. It's our position that the 

screening provisions can't overrule Federal Rule of 

Procedure 15 either, but the problem we see with even 

doing away with the no amendment rule, but keeping in 

place the heightened pleading rule, is that we are 

talking about prisoners. Prisoners who don't have a lot 

of access to materials. They may have -- legal 

materials. They may have great difficulty holding on to 

their, their formally filed grievances.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Andre, didn't you 

have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was 

spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that 

alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail. 

Then the answer attached every piece of paper that came 

up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and 

then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm 

going to copy all those documents and make them my own. 

And nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to 

allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the 

record made it plain that there had been exhaustion.

The rule that you are opposing would operate that way. 

If you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't 

matter that the deficiency has been made up by the 

answer. You go out. Wasn't that the decision in one of 

these cases?

 MR. GRANT: Yes. That was in Petitioner 

Jones's case, and that -- Petitioner Jones's case is a 

great example of how the heightened pleading rule and 

the no amendment rule work together to result in a 

prisoner being unable to cure any problem with his or 

her initial complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You talk about the 

lack of statutory direction on the first two points but 

there is a very explicit statute on the third question. 

It says no action shall be brought until administrative 

remedies are exhausted. And yet you say the action 

should be allowed to be brought even if there are 

unexhausted claims in the complaint.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, I -- we concede that an 

action that contains unexhausted claims or a mixed 

action shouldn't have been brought in the first place, 

but it's there. And the question then becomes what to 

do about it. And the language no action shall be 

brought; it's very common in administrative exhaustion 

schemes, the Americans with Disabilities Act uses almost

identical language, the Immigration Nationality Act uses 

very similar language, Title VII --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a very 

different statutory scheme. This is designed to address 

the problem of an overwhelming number of frivolous 

complaints that result in the fact that meritorious 

complaints can be overlooked. We've got a haystack in a 

needle problem here. And if you allow the action to 

continue, that doesn't do anything to reduce the number 

of filing of claims that as you say should not have been 

brought.

 MR. ANDRE: I guess I should be clear at the 

outset that we are by no means advocating that a 

prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with 

exhausted claims. So the unexhausted claims must go.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well right, but you 

provide under your approach no incentive for the 

prisoner to leave those claims out. Instead what, a 

screening function turns into an editing function. The 

district court is supposed to just excise out the 

unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to 

continue.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, it's been our experience 

and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners 

don't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted

claims with their exhausted claims. It's typically 

based on innocent mistake, a simple failure to 

understand either the particular circuit within which 

they are housed, a difficulty in understanding that 

circuit's exhaustion law, difficulty in understanding 

the prison grievance procedures that they attempted to 

comply with, and perhaps even being further confused by 

the fact that prison grievance administrators seem to 

apply prison grievance regulations, I don't want to say 

in an ad hoc manner, but inconsistently. And so when 

they bring these complaints that are mixed they actually 

are intending to bring a fully exhausted complaint but 

then after a little built of judicial review, it becomes 

clear that they didn't exhaust.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why does it hurt if you 

dismiss the whole thing? They could just refile.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, it hurts for a couple of 

reasons. Well -- and -- it hurts under the Sixth 

Circuit's rule because they did not allow prisoners to 

amend. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. What would happen 

is you just dismiss the complaint.

 So -- I guess again the reason they have 

these things is they get a certain number of complaints, 

they have no idea what it sys, to tell you the truth,

they don't know what the claim is, they don't understand 

it, there are a lot of things written here; the person 

wasn't represented; it's hard to make out. And for, the 

judge thinks I have to go through all these papers; I 

have to figure out if there is something here that was 

exhausted, we know something happened; it was something 

exhausted -- so the simplest thing is just dismiss it.

 Now the prisoner can always refile it with 

the parts that he has to now figure out were exhausted. 

Now is -- and it doesn't hurt because, just refile it.

 MR. ANDRE: It doesn't hurt if the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true? Or what 

happens?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, I guess there is two 

different versions of the total exhaustion rule as it's 

termed. There is the Eighth Circuit's rule with is with 

leave to amend. So the complaint is dismissed, and 

prisoner can file a new complaint without the 

unexhausted claims.

 Then there is the Sixth Circuit's rule, 

which is the most draconian of all the versions. And 

that says the entire action is dismissed, prisoner must 

institute a new action.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that draconian?

 MR. ANDRE: It's draconian because by the

time the prisoner refiles his or her action there could 

be a statute of limitations problem. The prisoner may 

not be able to bring those claims any more. In fact the 

Fifth Circuit in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does he have to file a new 

filing fee?

 MR. ANDRE: Not in the Sixth Circuit 

anymore, and not in the Fourth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many prisoners 

pay the filing fee in the first place?

 MR. ANDRE: I believe they all do. If they 

qualify --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They are not 

entitled to IFP status?

 MR. ANDRE: If they get IFP status, all that 

means -- well, first of all, they only get to do that 

three times. Or to have three actions dismissed before 

they lose their IP status.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a draconian 

rule, do you think? You have to have three actions 

dismissed before you have to pay the filing fee?

 MR. ANDRE: No, no, no. I mean -- but 

that's not really at issue in this case. But even if 

they qualify for IFP status they still have to pay the 

$350 filing fee. It's just taken out in installments.

And so for a prisoner who makes $2.50 a day or $2.50 a 

week it -- it is costly for them to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess this is 

probably not a question for you, but a question for your 

friend on the other side. You can ask, why does it 

hurt? You can also ask why does it help? What good 

does it do to bounce the whole thing back when you're 

just going to have them filed again?

 MR. ANDRE: I think that's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, well, the reason it 

would hurt is because it's difficult for the judge to go 

though this complaint that he can't quite make sense out 

of. And it puts the burden of the prisoner to go 

through and figure out what he really wants to say. 

That's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just 

to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be 

many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out 

if there is anything here that was exhausted.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the other 

incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on 

the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if 

it is not exhausted because maybe it will get through, 

maybe it won't. And if it doesn't get through, no harm. 

He doesn't even have to pay another $50.

MR. ANDRE: But I think at least, at least 

under that scenario, the district court still only has 

to take one look at the case and then it can move 

forward, it deletes the unexhausted claims. So from a 

judicial efficiency standpoint I think the Ortiz V. 

McBride rule out of the Second Circuit, which is the 

rule that we are advocating, is -- is the cleanest 

approach. It takes the choice away from the prisoner; 

it puts the choice with the district court, and it 

allows the district court to delete off any unexhausted 

claims. And in most instances --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any argument that 

if the state does not insist on exhaustion or plead 

exhaustion, that it just drops out of the case? If the 

state resolves the case on the merits even though there 

is no exhaustion, can the Federal court hear it, that 

there is general agreement about that?

 MR. ANDRE: I think there is. The circuit 

-- the four circuits that we know were unanimous that 

PLRA exhaustion is not jurisdictional, and in Woodford 

we know this Court confirmed that. And so to the extent 

that the PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative defense, then 

it would operate like other exhaustion schemes in 

administrative -- administrative law, and habeas, where 

it is waivable by the other side.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if we accept your 

first two arguments, then if there is no heightened 

pleading rule and you don't have to name the specific 

defendants in the administrative grievance that you end 

up naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of 

those, then isn't the third question, have you, what 

happens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really 

not alive anymore in this case, because you will have 

properly exhausted. So why should the Court go on to 

answer what would happen if you hadn't properly 

exhausted?

 MR. GRANT: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, 

it's unfortunately more complicated than that. If the 

first question in the Jones case, the ID pleading rule 

question, is resolved in favor of Petitioner Jones, then 

total exhaustion is a live issue. Because the Sixth 

Circuit as an alternative holding justified the 

dismissal of Jones's complaint on the total exhaustion 

ground. And I guess on the other side if the Court were 

to resolve the identifying the defendant's issue against 

Petitioner --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Sixth Circuit 

obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally 

exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative 

grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he

has exhausted. That's the end of it.

 MR. GRANT: The Sixth Circuit -- and it's 

not really clear from this opinion, because it's an 

unpublished opinion, but the Sixth Circuit appears to 

have adopted the magistrate judge's finding which is 

based on respondent's motion to dismiss that Jones 

substantively, for lack of a better word, didn't exhaust 

all of his claims, so -- I'm sorry. I'm not being 

clear.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the case where 

the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case 

where they put in all the papers from the administrative 

record?

 MR. ANDRE: Yes. But they also argued that 

Jones failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on 

everything but his First Amendment retaliation claim. 

Or what they termed his negative work --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but they were wrong 

about that. If, if there was exhaustion in the case, 

and if there is no rule that you must name everything 

the defendant that you end up suing, if those two are 

established, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot 

question? Moot in this case?

 MR. ANDRE: I don't think so, Justice 

Ginsburg. I think in order for the total exhaustion

issue to be moot, the heightened pleading requirement 

would have to be resolved against Petitioner Jones, and 

the naming the defendants issue would have to be 

resolved in favor of Williams and Walton. I charted out 

on a matrix and verified it a couple of times.

 Turning to the naming issue if I could, 

since we haven't addressed that, the Prison Litigation 

Reform Act simply sets a floor of how much specificity a 

prisoner must provide in his or her grievance. It does 

not require what the Sixth Circuit held here which is 

that as a matter of Federal statutory law a prisoner 

must have identified every individual who he or she 

later sues in Federal court. This is a kind of endemic, 

or flows logically from the Court's decision in Woodford 

V. Ngo. Woodford v. Ngo says that prisoners must comply 

with grievance procedures.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would have no problem, 

I assume, if the state simply requires that you name the 

individuals?

 MR. ANDRE: I guess broadly speaking no; in 

certain cases yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent possible, I 

suppose.

 MR. ANDRE: Right. Exactly. If -- in 

Michigan they have a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then, then there would not 

be exhaustion unless he had named the individuals.

 MR. ANDRE: I believe that's correct. I 

mean, although I guess --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So we may not be, may not 

be litigating about a whole lot here.

 MR. ANDRE: No, right. I think really the 

question is an X or not X question. It's does the PLRA 

as a matter of statutory law required individuals to be 

named in the underlying grievances, and the PLRA is 

entirely silent on that question, and this Court's 

decision in Sims v. Apfel lends further lends further 

support to the proposition that a Federal court cannot 

go beyond what the particular administrative agency's 

rules require. I realize that was a plurality decision 

but I think the petitioners win under either the 

plurality opinion or under Justice O'Connor's 

concurrence. And so yes, Justice Scalia we agree with 

you that it's simply an X or Y question that down the 

road perhaps the Court could address the scenario where 

a prison system amends its rules to require individual 

defendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner can't 

comply with that based on the short previous filing 

deadlines, and then there is a question of whether the 

administrative remedies were actually ever available to

that particular prisoner.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you have in one of 

these cases, the person has said: I didn't know who was 

the person who said I couldn't have the operation until 

the prison identified him.

 MR. ANDRE: That's correct. I believe 

you're referring to either the Williams or the Walker --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. So even if you had 

a rule, a reasonable rule, that named the people that 

you know, if you have it, that would not encompass 

someone? In two of these cases, the defendants -- the 

plaintiff, the prisoner, said, I didn't know who those 

guys were until they were identified.

 MR. ANDRE: Right. And to that extent the 

prison grievance system worked, because the prisoners 

provided as much detail as they possibly could and then 

the prison grievance system went out, conducted its 

investigation, broadened the universe of relevant facts, 

and then made a determination. They happened to 

determine that grievances were not meritorious. 

Obviously, petitioners disagree with that assessment. 

That's why they sued in Federal court.

 But the prison grievance system worked. To 

borrow from the Third Circuit's decision in Spur v. 

Gillis, a cooperative ethos between inmate and jailer

was achieved, because so long as the prisoner provides 

sufficient information for the grievance system to go 

out and answer any unresolved questions and so long as 

the prison grievance system avails itself of that 

opportunity then the claim is exhausted.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA M. OLIVIERI

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MS. OLIVIERI: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress enacted the Prison Litigation 

Reform Act to deal with the flood of prisoner litigation 

that was coming into the Federal courts, obscuring the 

treatment for meritorious claims brought by all 

litigants. The purpose of the act was to unburden the 

courts from dealing with this flood of litigation that 

largely was without merit. The purposes for the act 

were to increase the quality of the litigation, decrease 

the quantity of the litigation, allow the states to 

address first the issues that the prisoners have 

problems with and to develop an administrative record to

facilitate judicial screening. And all of this would 

result in increased judicial resources for all 

litigation that has potential merit.

 The invigorated exhaustion requirement does 

require total exhaustion. The statute, the words of the 

statute itself confirm this. The statute states: "No 

action shall be brought until" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what is a 

typical administrative record that is developed in these 

proceedings? There's never a transcript, is there?

 MS. OLIVIERI: I've never seen a transcript. 

Typically it's one sheet of paper. The inmate states 

what the problem is, states what he did to try to 

resolve the problem before filing a grievance. And then 

there's space at the bottom for response. Frequently 

the response is right on that page. Sometimes the 

response indicates "See attached." If there's a 

lengthier response there may be a separate page.

 Similarly, if the prisoner can't put all of 

his --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there normally a 

statement of reasons for the denial of relief or are 

they just denied in many cases?

 MS. OLIVIERI: For the most part they 

attempt to address the issue.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Typically they are --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering how, 

how much help that will give the judge later on in 

processing the case.

 MS. OLIVIERI: In the last 12 months there 

have been 13,000 grievances processed by the Michigan 

Department of Corrections at the third step, and that's 

for people who appeal all the way through to the third 

step. So there are many more than that before that. 

Some of the responses can be very detailed. They can go 

on for a full page typewritten single spaced. Some of 

the responses --

JUSTICE STEVENS: How many of the 13,000 are 

of that variety?

 MS. OLIVIERI: I haven't read all 13,000, 

but typically the response would be about a half a dozen 

lines.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. And the other 

question: Of the 13,000 grievances, how many did result 

in litigation?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Last -- in the last year that 

ended June 30th, 12 months, we had approximately 200 

cases.

JUSTICE STEVENS: 200 out of 13,000?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Correct. In the previous 

years we had somewhat fewer, so it's sort of going up. 

But you know, it's between 160, 180, 200. This year 

we're on that same pace, approximately 200.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you explain what the 

disincentive or other reasons for there being just 200 

lawsuits out of the 13,000?

 MS. OLIVIERI: These 200 are ones that we 

were served with. That doesn't include the ones that 

may have been screened out by the courts and we were 

never served with them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.

 MS. OLIVIERI: This only includes ones where 

a defendant was actually served with process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Basically, I mean you've 

heard the question and so forth. It seems to me that my 

questions and certainly others were based on certain 

empirical premises that might be true, might not be 

true. So why isn't this a question for the Rules 

Committee? Why not go to the Rules Committee if this 

really is a burden and so forth, rather than doing 

something unusual, which is to make exhaustion something 

other than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole 

complaint, which appear to be rules that reached

draconian results in a few cases anyway.

 MS. OLIVIERI: When it's a dismissal without 

prejudice, it's improper to characterize it as 

draconian.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It could be, because the 

statute of limitations could have run. So it depends. 

Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. But my basic 

question here, isn't this a matter for the Rules 

Committees rather than for the Sixth Circuit to go off 

on its own?

 MS. OLIVIERI: This Court in Neitzke versus 

Williams took a look at the previous version of the in 

forma pauperis statute and that statute allowed sua 

sponte dismissals for only two reasons, frivolous and 

malicious cases. Under that, in that opinion, the Court 

indicated that when it's a sua sponte review for those 

two issues you don't get the benefit of the adversary 

process that's embodied in the Federal Rules of Civil 

Procedure. Congress, recognizing that even in Neitzke 

the Court indicated that the Federal courts were being 

flooded with prison litigation, much of it meritless, 

expanded the categories that are now subject to sua 

sponte dismissal, and those include suing someone who is 

immune from liability or failing to state a claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't include

failure to exhaust.

 MS. OLIVIERI: It didn't specifically 

include failure to exhaust.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you follow the 

normal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then, 

then the burden would be on the prison to do just what 

it did in the Jones case. Why, why would we say, depart 

from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an 

affirmative defense when we know that the party best 

equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is 

the prison, as the Jones case showed so well? They, the 

prison, had all of the grievances. They had all of the 

responses and they presented that to the court. So the 

prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers 

than the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional 

to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes 

the most sense because the one most likely to have the 

information is the prison?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Congress dealt with that in 

1997e(g), the waiver of reply provision, which confirmed 

what the 1997e(c) dismissal provision provides. This is 

all a screening situation for the Federal district 

courts, designed to move these cases that have been 

proven largely meritless quickly through the system 

rather than bogging the courts down --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If Congress meant to 

reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why 

didn't it put that in? It was expanding the categories 

and it included failure to state a claim, which had not 

been there before, and it included if you sue somebody 

who has got immunity. But it didn't include exhaustion, 

so why should we read that in?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Well, exhaustion is the very 

first provision and it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not in the 

screening. It doesn't say you screen out for failure to 

exhaust.

 MS. OLIVIERI: It's not specifically there, 

but the exhaustion provision is a precursor. It's a 

precondition. You can't even get into court until 

you've exhausted because it says no action shall be 

brought.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are other 

provisions than "no action shall be brought." Take a 

statute of limitations that reads "No action shall be 

brought after two years" or something like that. There 

is no action shall be brought. Does that make it no 

longer an affirmative defense?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The courts have interpreted 

statutes of limitations consistently to be in the

category of an affirmative defense. The problem with 

that is this statute, the PLRA, is the new regime for 

prison litigation, not for all the litigation across the 

board. And in the waiver of reply, the Congress 

specifically took the defendant out of the equation, 

requiring the court to determine whether or not the case 

has been exhausted, whether or not the plaintiff has 

failed to state a claim and the other criteria that are 

all in that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, all the criteria 

are there, but failure to exhaust is not.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Not specifically, but failure 

to exhaust could be construed as a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But last time -- and you 

said before the statute was there were only frivolous 

and malicious. And the court says, we can see from the 

face of this complaint that it fails to state a claim, 

too bad it's not a ground for automatic dismissal. So 

Congress said, yes, it should be, and put that one in.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Congress put the screening 

provision as number one, where you cannot even bring a 

case to court unless you have exhausted administrative 

remedies. So it's unimaginable that that would not be a 

ground for sua sponte dismissal when you can't even 

bring your case until you've exhausted.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Miss Olivieri, you also 

rely on the "no action shall be brought" language to 

justify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even 

though only some of them have not been exhausted. Do 

you have any, even a single example of the many other 

instances where that language is used in the Federal 

statutes? And there are many of them. Do you know any 

other case where it's been interpreted that way, so that 

claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained, 

but rather the whole action will be dismissed?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Habeas corpus is another 

situation where there is a provision that says no relief 

shall be granted, no writ shall be granted, absent 

exhaustion of -- exhaustion of state court remedies. 

There in the habeas situation, it is a little bit 

different than in the PLRA -- pardon me -- because there 

is a stay in abeyance provision in habeas --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. OLIVIERI: -- which was in the statute 

before Congress passed the PLRA, and Congress actually 

took out the stay in abeyance provision.

 It all serves the purpose that Congress 

intended, which was to allow the courts to quickly 

screen these cases. If you look at e(a)(C)(1) --

(C)(2), they give the court many options for doing what

is most judicially prudent in that particular case to 

preserve resources.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the basis in the 

habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas 

application despite the fact that some of the claims 

have been exhausted? Is there any statutory basis for 

that or is it just, just judicial efficiency?

 MS. OLIVIERI: There is -- I believe it's 

under the exhaustion requirement. The court has the 

option of dismissing the entire action -- actually, I 

believe there the petitioner gets the option, do they 

want to proceed on the exhausted claims or do they want 

to drop out the unexhausted claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's not -- the 

statute doesn't settle that. Our decisions settle that, 

right? So why should we deal with that, the two, any 

differently? It's not as though Congress wrote the 

statute differently. We said you can't proceed with 

unexhausted claims, so you have a choice. Either you go 

out of the Federal court and exhaust everything -- or 

even you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in 

abeyance -- or you just lob off the unexhausted claims, 

stay in the Federal court on the ones that you have 

exhausted.

 That's all made up by this Court. So why

should the Court react differently in the PLRA than it 

did? Why should it fill those gaps differently than it 

did in habeas?

revoke the stay in abeyance provision in the PLRA.

shouldn't, I think. I think she's making your argument 

for you.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Pardon me?

we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas, 

so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than 

just the individual claims, which is what I think you

yes.

it.

the whole case dismissed. I will amend my petition so 

that the court will have, will retain the exhausted 

claims. You are saying not like habeas, I don't want it

 MS. OLIVIERI: I don't want the prisoner to 

be allowed to choose to lop off the unexhausted claims, 

that is true, or to amend, to delete them, because then 

there is absolutely no incentive for the prisoner to 

improve the quality of the litigation by stopping and 

thinking, being careful to exhaust all his claims, and 

being careful to plead only claims that are exhaustive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same arguments apply in 

habeas, don't they?

 MS. OLIVIERI: But in habeas you have the 

stay and abeyance provision that was specifically 

removed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if you had your way.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Remove -- well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're making an 

argument that it would preclude that too.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it seems to me that if 

we accept your response to Justice Ginsburg, we've got 

to go back and to the extent that we can do anything 

about it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these

things get thrown out more readily.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Habeas does deal with a 

person's liberty whereas the PLRA is simply dealing with 

people basically for the most part trying to get some 

sort of relief, either injunctive or monetary relief, 

that does not deal with their basic freedom. So in that 

respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One reason to 

require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the 

prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are 

exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward 

with litigation. But I guess that's only true if the 

exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when 

we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those 

typically claims that are not going to be available or 

are they claims that may generate relief once there is 

exhaustion?

 MS. OLIVIERI: It could be -- I mean, it's 

obviously both. I mean, there are claims that are 

partially exhausted when the inmate files the lawsuit. 

He may finish exhausting and get the relief that he's 

looking for without ever pursuing the case in federal 

court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then sometimes it's 

impossible to complete the exhaustion. I assume in some

cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have 

expired, right?

 MS. OLIVIERI: That can also be the case, 

and under Woodford versus Ngo, now that they have to do 

proper exhaustion, there will be more of those cases 

where it probably, there wouldn't be anything left to do 

after it's dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the 

one to go through the maybe 20 claimed complaints and 

call out the claims that are not exhausted, rather than 

putting that burden on the court, which is contrary to 

Congress's purpose, to streamline this system.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about, 

there's another question you haven't really touched on 

yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every 

defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in 

the internal procedure. I'd just like a little help on 

just exactly what happens. The prisoner doesn't get the 

kind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he 

only knows it because either the low level person says 

no, the doctors said you can't have it. And he brings a 

proceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and 

they deny relief. And then later on when he wants to 

sue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the 

doctor who was involved, and there are several levels of 

authority making the decision. Does he have to start

all over again to name those people, or what does he do?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Medical care is -- well, for 

one thing, prisoners do have counselors, and so if 

they're not sure who is responsible for something, 

that's one of the things that they're supposed to do is 

talk to their counselor to find out. You know, I'm 

having this problem, I'm not getting surgery, why am I 

not getting surgery, who do I talk to, who do I complain 

to. So that's one way to resolve the problem.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what if he does talk 

to the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I 

don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's 

in the warden's office, or something like that. What 

is the prisoner supposed to do?

 MS. OLIVIERI: If the prisoner makes inquiry 

and just simply can't find out who it is, then he should 

state that in his grievance and indicate that somebody 

in the medical department is denying me the surgery. 

You know, I talked to Dr. So and So, he's recommended 

that I get it, somebody is saying no, I haven't been 

able to find out who that is. And likely during the 

grievance process, he will find out who it is, because 

one of the responses will probably say that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if he doesn't? One 

of his grievances is nobody told me. Is he out of luck

there? And I think there may well be situations in 

which prisoners don't have complete access to all the 

facts that go into a decision denying them medical care, 

for example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem 

and can't get the diet he wants, or something like that. 

But before he can sue, under your view if I understand 

it, he has to find out so he can name the people in his 

administrative complaint.

 MS. OLIVIERI: He has to make a good faith 

attempt to find out. And if he really, you know, if he 

says I've asked my counselor, he is not able to provide 

me with that information, then he will get a response on 

the grievance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the purpose of 

that requirement? As long as he has made known in the 

administrative proceeding what his problem it, and they 

have had a chance to investigate it and determine 

whether it has merit or not, why should he have to name 

the individuals who made the decision in order, before 

he can sue them when he later finds out who they are?

 MS. OLIVIERI: That goes back to 1997e(g), 

the waiver of reply, where it says that no defendant can 

be made to respond to the complaint unless the court can 

certify that the prisoner has a reasonable opportunity 

to prevail on the merits. It talks about defendants

there. Also, you get a case like Mr. --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, it's standard 

law of agency. It doesn't make any difference. The 

prisoner is denied his rights. As Justice Stevens said, 

there may be three or four different people who 

concurred. Do your rules say that if he can't find out 

with reasonable efforts that he doesn't need to, or does 

the Sixth Circuit rules say that the delegation of the 

names is not required?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit rule 

basically says name or identify. And for instance, here 

with respect to Mr. Jones, he didn't name the 

classification director. He used the title. Nobody had 

anything negative to say about that. We know you're 

talking about the classification director. It's 

Mr. Morrison. We've only got one, not a problem. The 

Sixth Circuit rule is basically name or identify, so if 

you're going to identify --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is it that the Sixth 

Circuit rule requires the identification, for complete 

exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the 

first stage?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit rule does 

require that.

understand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he 

names Dr. X. And for whatever reason in the course of 

the response perhaps, he learned that not only was Dr. X 

involved but Dr. Y was involved in that decision. So if 

he is denied relief at stage two, he says X and Y, and 

he identifies X and why all the way through. He gets 

nothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to Federal 

court. Is it correct that under the Sixth Circuit rule 

they would say you have not completely exhausted because 

at stage one you did not mention Y? Is that correct?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit probably 

would say that that he would be out of luck with respect 

to Y.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What justification is there 

for that? I mean, for two stages through the prison 

administrative process, Y has been identified. The 

prison has taken action on the merits on the assumption 

that Y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible 

party. What reason is there in a Federal court to say 

that the exhaustion is incomplete because he didn't 

mention Y back at stage one?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The Sixth Circuit adopted 

that rule probably in a case like the Walton case here, 

where Mr. Walton had a problem with his slot restriction 

and said, you know, Deputy Warden Bobo put this

restriction on me. It goes through the grievance 

process and they say Bobo didn't put that on you, Gearin 

put it on you. That's at step one. They give that 

response. He goes then into court after exhausting two 

or three steps, still saying, you know, they're 

discriminating against me based on race with the slot 

restrictions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but that wasn't my 

hypo. As I understand it, in that case he keeps going 

after Bobo, period. And in my case at stage two, having 

learned something, he identifies Y. And I -- so I don't 

see the justification, what is the justification?

 MS. OLIVIERI: I think I was probably giving 

too much explanation, but I think from my understanding 

of how this should operate, he is all right in that case 

to sue Mr. Gearin, who actually did put the slot 

restriction on him, and he had the wrong name at step 

one. No problem. We got the right name at step two or, 

excuse me, at the end of step one. And he pursues it? 

I think he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin. The 

Sixth Circuit may not think that's true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In my case, you said you 

understood that the Sixth Circuit would say that 

although he identified X and Y in stage two and at stage 

three, and there had been merit for adjudication at

those stages, understanding who the named respondents 

were, the Sixth Circuit would nonetheless say you had 

failed to exhaust because back at stage A you mentioned 

X but not Y.  What is the justification, if that is 

still your answer, what could the justification for that 

be?

 MS. OLIVIERI: I don't think the Sixth 

Circuit had that type of case in front of them when they 

issued --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that apparently, if I 

understand your answer, is what the result would be. 

And is there -- and I don't want to, you know, make it 

hard for you. I think you're having a hard time finding 

a justification for that result and I certainly can't 

find one. Can you think of any?

 MS. OLIVIERI: I'm saying there is none. 

I'm saying he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about Y in my 

example?

against Y?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even though the Sixth 

Circuit would throw it out for failure to exhaust.

 MS. OLIVIERI: I disagree with the Sixth 

Circuit on that, but I don't disagree with the Sixth 

Circuit in that when he actually got to court, he sued 

four other people who were never mentioned in any 

grievance by anybody.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about Jones, who 

really did not know who was the doctor who said no 

surgery? He didn't know and then the prison told him. 

And he comes to the court, he says thanks, prison, for 

telling me, and so he names that person in his 

complaint. The Sixth Circuit said that's no good, he 

didn't put it in his initial complaint. He had only 15 

days to find out and he didn't find out.

 MS. OLIVIERI: I'm agreeing with you that 

the Sixth Circuit, both that the Sixth Circuit would say 

that that won't fly, and that in fact it should fly.

exhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then 

Jones properly exhausted?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Jones properly exhausted 

against the doctor who actually denied the medical 

treatment, denied the surgery. Yes. But Jones never 

served, unfortunately, that particular doctor, 

Dr. Cranstall.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you've 

mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in 

the Michigan grievance policy with respect to naming 

individuals. What is the consequence of that change for 

our ability to address that claim?

 MS. OLIVIERI: It will, it will be the same 

basic philosophy that I've been stating here. I mean, 

it's going to be a name or identify. Tell us who you've 

got a problem with. Don't tell us you have a problem 

with one person and then go into court and sue six other 

people who may be the people who actually responded to 

the grievance, because MDOC didn't know that you had a 

problem with this person.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the 

objections to the Sixth Circuit rule from your friend 

was that this requirement of naming the individuals came 

out of thin air. And now we have that requirement 

articulated in the grievance policy. Does that make a

difference?

 MS. OLIVIERI: It does make a difference in 

proper exhaustion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not an absolute 

policy, though. It isn't that if you haven't named him 

in the first administrative step, you can't name him in 

the complaint. That's not Michigan's new policy.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Michigan doesn't say you have 

to name him at the first step. It says when you file 

your grievance, you know, name --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there an exception 

when you couldn't find out?

 MS. OLIVIERI: And if they say they can't 

find out, and they've made reasonable inquiry, you know, 

there's somebody at the top of the chain of the medical, 

that's understandable that they may not know, because 

they may have never seen Dr. Pramstaller.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did the Sixth 

Circuit have the current Michigan policy before them 

when they made their decision?

 MS. OLIVIERI: Not on these three cases, no. 

It was the previous policy which indicated that the 

inmate had to be as specific, basically be as specific 

as possible, something along those lines.

to Justice Ginsburg that back in my Dr. X, Dr. Y case, 

under the new policy if they got to stage 2 and Y was 

identified, that Michigan would process the complaint?

 MS. OLIVIERI: We would process the 

grievance, absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The grievance.

 MS. OLIVIER: Yes. Yes. Finally, I would 

ask the Court to keep in mind that the entire purpose of 

the Prison Litigation Reform Act is to relieve the 

courts of the burden and the screening process that's 

set in place by this statute allows the Court many 

options.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now you say the primary 

purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather 

than determine whether there is merits to the 

grievances?

 MS. OLIVIERI: The, the purpose of the 

Prison Litigation Reform Act was to relieve --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was to reduce the volume 

of litigation, period?

 MS. OLIVIERI: To reduce the volume to 

provide more --

11,000 complaints and reducing them down to 200. I 

would think that's more important than saving the court 

some time. There must be, you must have some interest 

in determining whether the complaints have merit.

 MS. OLIVIERI: Well, we do have an interest. 

We respond to every one of those in three steps, and we 

never end up in litigation for the most part so the 

grievance process works totally outside of what 

litigation goes on. It does resolve complaints. But 

the Prison Litigation Reform Act allows the court to 

either --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But these rules that are 

challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not 

the profits-- the process.

 MS. OLIVIERI: They are to, to benefit the 

courts by taking resources that had previously been 

spent on meritless cases and spending those instead on 

cases with merit, to efficiently screen these cases so 

that the courts are not spending a lot of time asking us 

for responses and so forth. If it's a failure to state 

a claim the case can be dismissed right, there all 

without prejudice. There is nothing draconian here. 

They can be rebrought.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Andre, you have 

five minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. ANDRE: Justice Ginsburg, you asked 

earlier about who is better equipped to plead and show 

exhaustion. It's certainly our position that the 

Michigan Department of Corrections or prison grievance 

administrators are absolutely better equipped to do so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that? The 

prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or 

not he filed a grievance or not.

 MR. ANDRE: The prisoner may know best 

whether or not he or she filed a grievance and whether 

or not he appealed. The prisoner may not know precise 

dates on which he or she did so or have copies of the 

grievances anymore. This really kind of brings the 

heightened pleading rule, not just whether it's just 

affirmative defense or a general pleading rule, to the 

fore. Prisoners are prisoners. They get moved around, 

they get put in administrative segregation; they are 

subject to repeat searches; they have great difficulty 

in maintaining possession of their belongings. On the 

other hand the Michigan Department of Corrections keeps 

copies of all the grievances, denials and appeals.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This seems to me to 

be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many 

prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better 

position to know in individual cases, an individual 

prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with 

respect to the grievance process. Surely the prisoner 

is in the best position. He knows what he did or at 

least what he is going to allege.

 MR. ANDRE: He may be able to aver generally 

but with specificity there are many cases in which he 

won't be able to. But the Michigan Department of 

Corrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to 

maintain these records for future FOIA requests, and in 

many institutions it has to track them in a computer. 

And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in the Jones case, 

they were quite able to bring forward the proof of 

exhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied 

the court that Jones had exhausted his administrative 

remedies.

 Jones gets, just got thrown out of court, 

essentially, in a game of "gotcha," because he hadn't 

attached his complaint in the first instance. I think 

most importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint, 

making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense. 

That means that the lawyers in the state attorney's

general, in the state, in the office of the state's 

attorneys general, are going to be able to put forward 

the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not 

exhausted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It requires, it requires 

response in all the cases, and as this subsection G 

indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to 

eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous 

complaints. Why -- why, you know, you have to go 

through the requesting a response from the government, 

when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because 

there has never been any exhaustion.

 MR. ANDRE: But to go back to Justice 

Ginsburg's point earlier Congress could have included 

unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the 

court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims 

for which a court could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different 

argument. But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more 

efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether 

it's exhausted or not. It certainly is.

 MR. ANDRE: Or again, it may be more 

efficient to have them aver generally, but as far as 

having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading 

requirement, we don't think that that makes sense. We

are talking, again we are talking about prisoners here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If it's an affirmative 

defense doesn't that mean that the prisoner is going to 

have to file, and the individuals defendants are going 

to have to file an answer in every case and assert all 

of their defenses?

 MR. ANDRE: Either --

JUSTICE ALITO: Just respond, even if there 

is nonfrivolous, nonexhaustion argument that can be 

made, they are going to have to go through all of that 

in every instance?

 MS. OLIVIERI: They would have to file an 

answer and motion to dismiss raising whatever 

affirmative defense they want to raise, but at least it 

gives them a choice and gives them the opportunity to 

frame this argument as opposed to putting it on, putting 

that burden on the court. Moreover if the court were to 

adopt respondents' reading of the screening provisions, 

those screening provisions would swallow up every single 

affirmative defense enumerated in the Federal rules, and 

also those not enumerated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect, with 

respect to the naming of the individuals, is that claim 

moot because of the change in the policy?

 MR. ANDRE: Oh, not at all. I mean, I can't

see how, how respondents could argue that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your main 

argument before was they invented this requirement 

without any basis, but now it's an actual requirement in 

the grievance procedure.

 MR. ANDRE: Right, but it wasn't when these 

claims were decided. And that's where I think Sims v. 

Apfel comes into play. Under Justice Thomas' plurality 

opinion, the key is looking at kind of the nature of the 

proceedings and if it's informal and accusatorial as 

opposed to adversarial, then a court cannot impose a 

requirement beyond that which the agency itself required 

at the time that the claims were before the agency.

 Under Justice O'Connor's concurrence, she 

was concerned about fair notice, and certainly here in 

these cases petitioners Williams and Walton didn't have 

fair notice that a year and a half later the State of 

Michigan, after going through the entire grievance 

procedure and never relying on their failure to be 

sufficiently specific, can then come into Federal court 

and say, aha --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Future prisoners now 

do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says 

name the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all 

those all involved.

MR. ANDRE: Yes, they would, they would. 

And again, there would certainly be constraints to too 

rigid enforcement of that particular provision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the no leeway built 

into the rule itself, that if you don't know --

MR. ANDRE: I'm sorry. I didn't --

JUSTICE GINSBERG: Isn't there -- the 

current rule, isn't there some leeway for cases where 

the prisoner simply doesn't know the names?

 MR. ANDRE: I'm not aware of any, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
