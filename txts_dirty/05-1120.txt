 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus 

Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Milkey.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MILKEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very 

quickly and then turn immediately to standing. Although 

the case before you arises in an important policy area, 

it turns on ordinary principles of statutory 

interpretation and administrative law. EPA made a 

decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute 

plain errors of law reviewable under any standard. 

EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority 

over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even 

if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. 

That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law.

 As a fallback position, EPA declined to 

consider if these substances are endangering public 

health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made 

more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in 

section 1202 of the Clean Air Act. Although EPA

possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the 

statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling 

on impermissible grounds as it did here.

 We are not asking the Court to pass judgment 

on the science of climate change or to order EPA to set 

emission standards. We simply want EPA to visit the 

rulemaking petition based upon permissible 

considerations.

 And now, Your Honor, I'd like to turn to 

standing. Petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in 

fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute 

was aimed at preventing. For example, our uncontested 

affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the 

more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more 

temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and 

the seas rise. And of course as the seas expand, they 

rise everywhere around the world. Some areas such as 

Massachusetts will be hit particularly hard because 

we're also subject to a land subsidence, but that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the standing 

requires imminent harm. If you haven't been harmed 

already, you have to show the harm is imminent. Is this 

harm imminent?

 MR. MILKEY: It is, Your Honor. We have 

shown that the sea levels are already occurring from the

current amounts of greenhouse gases in the air, and that 

means it is only going to get worse as the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When? I mean, when is the 

predicted cataclysm?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it's not so much a 

cataclysm as ongoing harm. The harm does not suddenly 

spring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously 

over time. And even to the extent you focus on harms 

that occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural 

about that. Once these gases are emitted into the area, 

and they stay a long time, the laws of physics take 

over.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's a lot of 

conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's 

something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus 

on how much of that is attributable to human activity. 

And I gather that -- what is it? Something like seven 

percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are 

attributable to automobiles in the United States?

 MR. MILKEY: It's actually about 6 percent, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 6 percent? Thank you.

 MR. MILKEY: But it's important to point out 

as well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA 

has disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of

emissions, which constitute about 20 percent of 

global --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that doesn't go to 

the harm that you're claiming. I mean, we're talking 

about the, you know, the standing issue right now. And 

if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of 

carbon dioxide emissions, right?

 MR. MILKEY: Agreed, Your Honor. But my 

point was that they disclaimed authority over all 

sources of carbon --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but that has 

nothing to do with whether you have standing. That has 

to do with the merits of the case. But on the standing 

point, only new cars would be affected, right? So even 

the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years, 

wouldn't it?

 MR. MILKEY: It would take a few years, Your 

Honor, but it is a basic premise of the Clean Air Act 

that vehicle fleets regularly turn over --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But it goes 

to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the 

imminent harm is. If, in fact, the 6 percent will only 

be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few 

years, your --

the record that a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide 

from cars is currently feasible. And since those 

emissions account for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not in the first year.

 MR. MILKEY: No, no. We agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean ultimately, when all 

the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars 

with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce 

the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent 

would be the figure.

 MR. MILKEY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But whatever position 

holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power 

plants, and has there been any application to EPA with 

respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?

 MR. MILKEY: There has, Your Honor. In 

fact, EPA has turned down a rulemaking petition to 

regulate them under the new source performance standard 

section of the Clean Air Act, and that is currently on 

appeal in the D.C. Circuit, but it is currently stayed 

pending the outcome of this case, and it just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you get the 

benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your 

standard? In other words, if you've challenged EPA's 

refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse

regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, 

well, they're following the same approach to a coal 

powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to 

establish a broader injury? Or, aren't you limited to 

the specific legal challenge you're raising here?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I think it's 

actually more direct in the sense that in the decision 

we challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not 

air pollutants under any regulatory provision of the 

act. So at least on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have to 

show injury from their decision here? The fact that 

other people, or you presumably as well might be injured 

by their decisions that you are not challenging here, 

that doesn't help your standing here, does it?

 MR. MILKEY: I believe it does, Your Honor, 

because we cannot win that other case unless we win this 

case here in terms of the authority question. And in 

any event, it is important to point out that because of 

the scale of the problem, relatively small percentage 

deductions in global emissions can lead to real world 

results.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But at the outset, you 

made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement 

that we need not decide about global warming in this

case. But don't we have to do that in order to decide 

the standing argument, because there's no injury if 

there's not global warming? Or, can you show standing 

simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived 

would show that there's an injury?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, especially in this 

case where none of our affidavits were challenged, I 

don't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on 

the merits because we showed through our uncontested 

affidavits that these harms will occur. There was no 

evidence put in to the contrary, and I would add that 

the reports on which EPA itself relies conclude that 

climate change is occurring in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those affidavits 

talked about the fact that if the government starts to 

regulate, the technology is going to change, if the 

technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and 

all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out 

conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved 

of.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, although we believe 

we have shown other governments will follow suit, we are 

not in any sense relying on that. We can easily show 

our standing without relying on that. And that's 

because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same argument if the 

automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?

 MR. MILKEY: It would be the same argument. 

And I would add that EPA in other contexts has 

determined on several occasions that a 1 percent 

contribution is significant under the Clean Air Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the 

argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to 

challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter 

simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's 

claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it is different 

because here there is particularized injury that we have 

shown. The injury doesn't get any more particular than 

states losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign 

territory and property we actually own, to rising seas.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If you look ahead, I don't 

know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but 

let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what 

particularized harm does the record show that 

Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of 

suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that 

you want to produce through these regulations?

 MR. MILKEY: Well, Your Honor, if I can deal

with the traceability part of that question first, 

traceability is easy to show here because the extent of 

our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in 

the air. And being focused on the 20 percent of all 

U.S. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still 

a sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or 

20 percent is there.

 In terms of the particular harms, similarly 

we have shown --

JUSTICE ALITO: 6 percent is the total 

emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in 

the United States, right?

 MR. MILKEY: To the global carbon dioxide 

emission.

 JUSTICE ALITO: To the global. And so, the 

reduction that you could achieve under the best of 

circumstances with these regulations would be a small 

portion of that, would it not?

 MR. MILKEY: It would be, we have shown in 

the record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent 

over the time it takes to turn the fleet over. But it's 

important that given the nature of the harms, even small 

reductions can be significant. For example, if we're 

able to save only a small fraction of the hundreds of 

millions of dollars that Massachusetts parks agencies

are projected to lose, that reduction is itself 

significant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That assumes 

everything else is going to remain constant, though, 

right? It assumes there isn't going to be a greater 

contribution of greenhouse gases from economic 

development in China and other places that's going to 

displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.

 MR. MILKEY: Yes, Your Honor. But reducing 

domestic emissions will reduce our harm, the harm we 

would otherwise face regardless of what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not if your harm is 

the alleged loss of coastline. Not necessarily. It 

depends upon what happens across the globe with respect 

to greenhouse emissions.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, we would still lose 

coastline but we would not lose as much because these 

harms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions 

will not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce 

the harm that these emissions are causing.

 So it will necessarily reduce our harm and 

satisfy redressibility.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, do we know that 

that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of 

two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two

and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of 

your coastline? Is that how it works? I'm not a 

scientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I don't believe 

it's established it's necessarily a straight line. But 

I want to emphasize that small vertical rises cause a 

large loss of horizontal land. For example, where the 

slope is less than 2 percent, which is true of much of 

the Massachusetts coastline, every foot rise will create 

a loss of more than 50 feet of horizontal land. And for 

example, in the State of New York, the Oppenheimer 

affidavit projects that New York could well lose 

thousands of acres of its sovereign territory by the 

year 2020. So the harm is already occurring. It is 

ongoing and it will happen well into the future.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your 

strongest case from this Court to support your standing 

allegation?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, what I would say to 

that is our standing here is so much more direct and 

particularized than, for example, the harm this Court 

found sufficient in Laidlaw, which was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Laidlaw was a 

specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?

 MR. MILKEY: It was, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So doesn't that make 

it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?

 MR. MILKEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

Here I think the fact that the States are showing harm 

not only to them in a property sense, but in their 

sovereign capacity --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your authority for 

that? I have the same question as the Chief Justice. I 

was looking at your brief for the strongest case. 

Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of 

coastline. Would he have the same standing that you do 

or do you have some special standing as a State, and if 

so what is the case which would demonstrate that?

 MR. MILKEY: Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

we agree that a large landowner would himself or herself 

have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What of a small landowner?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I'm asking 

whether you have some special standing --

MR. MILKEY: Yes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as a State and, if so, 

what's the authority for that?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, first of all, I do 

think we have special standing. For example, here it's 

uncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make

ozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to 

comply with our existing Clean Air Act responsibilities.

 And the -- in the West Virginia case, which 

is a D.C. Circuit case, the Court found that that itself 

provided an independent source of standing. In terms of 

Supreme Court cases, the -- it's been -- for 200 years, 

this Court has recognized loss of state sovereign 

property as a traditional --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know. 1907 

was Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was 

pre-Massachusetts versus Mellon. That seems to me your 

best case.

 What about a small landowner? I asked the 

question about a big landowner. Suppose you have a 

small landowner and he owned a lot?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I think if someone 

is losing property because of this problem, then that 

person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de 

minimis threshold here. We have shown we own property, 

200 miles of coastline which we're losing, and we think 

the standing is straightforward.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not sure -- I think 

our opinions have even said it, but certainly 

commentators have often said it, that really the far 

margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the

famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the 

added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal 

waste which would -- which couldn't be transported by 

rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high, 

that added pollution interfered with the students' --

they were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the 

George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge.

 That seems to me a much more immediate kind 

of damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far 

margin of our standing cases. You're talking not about 

their being affected by ambient air but being affected 

by a stratospheric effect which then has another 

consequence that you allege.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, once these are 

emitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is 

imminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is 

imminent harm. It may take --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Milkey, does it make 

a difference that you're not representing a group of law 

students, but a number of States who are claiming that 

they are disarmed from regulating and that the 

regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal 

Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising 

it? I thought you had a discrete claim based on the 

sovereignty of States and their inability to regulate

dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that 

authority to the EPA. I thought that was --

MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, you are correct 

that we are saying that provides us also an independent 

source of our standing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand 

that. You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts 

State action? You can complain about the implementation 

of that law because it has preempted your State action? 

Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?

 MR. MILKEY: In short, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any case that 

has ever held that?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, I would cite you to 

the amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which 

cites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that 

stand for that principle.

 Your Honor, if I may turn to the merits 

quickly, section 202(a)(1) provides EPA jurisdiction 

over any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit. It's 

not restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to 

air pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm. And 

not only does the act define air pollutant with 

comprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances 

are air pollutants from other evidence.

For example, Congress itself expressly 

referred to carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in 

section 103(g). And since by definition all air 

pollutants are air pollution agents, we know that 

Congress understood carbon dioxide to be an agent of air 

pollution. And if air pollution --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving from your 

authority argument to the exercise of authority, the 

clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards 

which in their judgment cause or contribute to air 

pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public 

health. And they say they haven't made that judgment 

yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory 

command.

 MR. MILKEY: That is correct, Your Honor; 

but they have said that they have put off making a 

judgment based on impermissible grounds. While EPA's 

explanation is difficult even to follow, one overarching 

point shines through and that is the agency does not 

agree with taking a regulatory approach regardless of 

how it might otherwise come out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say the first 

day this law is passed, there are a lot of air 

pollutants that come out of motor vehicles. I mean, is 

EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they

don't issue emissions regulations for every one those 

air pollutants on day one?

 MR. MILKEY: No, Your Honor. EPA has a lot 

of room to move based both on the endangerment standard 

itself and on background principles of administrative 

law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably the 

principle that they want to deal with what they regard 

as the more serious threats sooner. They want to deal 

with lead first and then they want to deal with other 

stuff. I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I 

guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not 

exercising a judgment with respect to a particular 

pollutant?

 MR. MILKEY: The answer to that, Your Honor, 

is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds, 

they do not rely on lack of information, they did not 

rely on background principles of administrative law. 

What though said here is -- and -- that they did not, in 

fact, contest the seriousness of the problem. But note, 

in two back to back sentences on page A-82 of the third 

petition they say: We must address the, issue but we 

disagree with the regulatory approach.

 The very section in which they explained why 

they weren't going to regulate is entitled "Different

Policy Approach." Rejecting mandatory motor vehicle 

regulation as a bad idea is simply not a policy choice 

that Congress left to EPA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you are right and 

then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an 

obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, 

we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress 

-- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has 

authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though 

we have the authority to do this, we think that we 

should spend our resources on other things.

 Suppose they said that? You said they 

didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get 

if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then 

EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not 

going to spend the money?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, while background 

administrative law principles provide EPA at least some 

room to move, we think it's important that EPA say that. 

If they -- it's a very different opinion if they say, we 

are not going to regular here because we just don't want 

to spend the resources on this problem and we want to 

look elsewhere.

 If they want to say that, they can say that 

and then, if at all, there'd be a narrow arbitrary and

capricious challenge on that. But the point is here 

they relied on the impermissible consideration that they 

simply disagreed with the policy behind the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not all they 

said. I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing 

emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and 

technical judgments without the benefit of studies that 

are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the 

area. That's different than saying they disagree with 

the regulatory approach.

 MR. MILKEY: It is and it isn't, Your Honor, 

because that statement will alleges be true. There will 

always be scientific uncertainty. Agencies will always 

have an understandable interest in seeing more 

information. They never --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a difference 

between the scientific status of the harm from lead 

emissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in 

the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific 

knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming 

today? Those are two very different levels of 

uncertainty.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, when EPA regulated 

lead back in the ethyl days, as the Court court itself 

took note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at

that time. And EPA has a lot of discretion in 

evaluating that, that uncertainty.

 And if the EPA determined that the level of 

uncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to 

anticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate. 

It would also be appropriate if the agency determined 

that there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't 

even form a judgment on that. That would be applying 

the endangerment statute at the same time it put off. 

But the point is they did not say any of that. They 

instead relied on impermissible grounds.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Milkey, I had -- my 

problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds. To 

be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an 

air pollutant. If we fill this room with carbon 

dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers 

health. But I always thought an air pollutant was 

something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and 

your claim here is not that the pollution of what we 

normally call "air" is endangering health. That isn't, 

that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant 

leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is 

contributing to global warming.

 MR. MILKEY: Respectfully, Your Honor, it is 

not the stratosphere. It's the troposphere.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Troposphere, whatever. I 

told you before I'm not a scientist.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's why I don't want to 

have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.

 MR. MILKEY: Under the express words of the 

statute -- and this is 302(g) -- for something to be an 

air pollutant it has to be emitted into the ambient air 

or otherwise entered there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, and I agree with that. 

It is when it comes out an air pollutant. But is it an 

air pollutant that endangers health? I think it has to 

endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this 

does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air 

at all.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, respectfully, I 

disagree, and there is nothing in the act that actually 

requires the harm to occur in the ambient air. In fact, 

some of the harm here does occur there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it talks about air 

pollution all the time. That's what the, that's what 

the thing is about, air pollution. It's not about 

global warming and it's not about the troposphere.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, we are not saying, 

first of all that global warming is air pollution, any

more than we're saying that asthma is air pollution. 

They're both effects. I would point you to the example 

of acid rain, where the pollutant there, sulfur dioxide, 

the problem is it causes its harm after it leaves the 

air, after it gets washed out. Air pollutants do not 

need to cause harm in the ambient air.

 Your Honor, I would add that our 

interpretation satisfies common sense because, while EPA 

has plenary authority over substances that motor 

vehicles emit, those substances are regulated only if 

EPA determines that they cause endangerment. By 

defining the term "air pollutant" comprehensively, 

Congress has not prejudged what may cause endangerment, 

but it has allowed other pollutants to be regulated as 

their harms become appreciated. It is EPA's 

interpretation that fails the common sense test. They 

have suggested that the term "air pollutant agent" 

creates an independent test so important that it may 

prevent some harmful compounds from being regulated 

without providing any hint of what the term means or how 

it applies in this case. And they cannot explain any 

number of anomalies such as the fact that methane is 

already a regulated air pollutant, yet they claim they 

can't look at its climate effects.

 Your Honor, if there are no more questions

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. GARRE: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 After carefully considering the issue the 

nation's expert agency in environmental matters 

concluded that Congress has not authorized it to embark 

on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address 

global climate change. And that even if it has, now is 

not the time to exercise such authority, in light of the 

substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding global 

climate change and the ongoing studies designed to 

address those uncertainties. Plaintiffs have provide no 

reason to override that quintessential administrative 

judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, doesn't the 

EPA's decision on the first, "we don't have any 

authority," doesn't that infect its subsequent decision, 

"well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it." But 

they've already decided they don't have authority.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't think that

it does. In the sense, I think EPA made clear in its 

decisional document that it considered as an alternative 

matter, that if it, even assuming it did have the 

authority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise 

it at this time.

 And importantly, too, I mean, just to be 

clear on this, EPA has never made an endangerment 

finding with respect to global climate change. That was 

true in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different 

position on authority to regulate. Even then the 

agency's position was clear. Even assuming we have the 

authority, now is not the time to exercise it. So I 

don't think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I take it that on that 

question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one 

way, but at least it is debatable because as you just 

said, the predecessors of the current people said we do 

have the authority.

 MR. GARRE: Well, to that degree, Your 

Honor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the 

Brand X case that even where agencies change positions, 

where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new 

interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to 

Chevron deference. We think that that is true in this 

case.

JUSTICE BREYER: On this particular issue, 

the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 

pages. Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with 

whether they have statutory authority. And of the 10 

that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five 

of them give as their reason that they think that the 

President has a different policy. Of the remaining 

five, two more consider international aspects of the 

problem and how you have to get other countries to 

cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in 

light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise 

our power.

 Now their claim with respect to that, is 

that at least three of the four considerations are not 

proper things for the agency to take into account: 

namely whether the President wants to do something 

different, whether we're running foreign policy 

properly, whether cooperation with other countries are 

relevant to this particular issue.

 So what they've asked us to do is send it 

back so they can get the right reasons. Now -- if they 

want not to do it. What's your response to that?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

that it depends on how many pages that the agency 

devoted to the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The reason it depended on 

that is whether or not these other, improper 

considerations might have influenced the ultimate 

decision not to go ahead.

 MR. GARRE: I think it depends on the 

reasons that the agency gave. And one of the reasons 

that the agency gave was the substantial scientific 

uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate 

change. Petitioners acknowledge that that was an 

appropriate consideration for the agency. So even if 

you think the other considerations were inappropriate, 

and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are, 

the agency gave an appropriate reason. And that reasons 

JUSTICE BREYER: When I write an opinion --

when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words: 

"We decide this matter in light of the following three 

factors taken together." And I guess a lawyer who said, 

"one of those factors alone the Court has held justified 

the result all by itself" -- in saying the Court has 

held that, I guess that wouldn't be so. That would be a 

bad lawyer, wouldn't it?

 MR. GARRE: But Your Honor --

these considerations justify our result, again, one of

them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have 

been sufficient.

 MR. GARRE: I -- I don't think that that is 

a fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your 

Honor. Certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way 

to say, "and reading these considerations together and 

not any of them individually." And with respect to the 

scientific uncertainty, Your Honor, you also have to 

take into account that the EPA had before it and pointed 

to the report of the National Research Council on global 

climate change.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I find it interesting that 

the scientists whose worked on that report said there 

were a good many omissions that would have indicated 

that there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency 

described.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, if you are referring 

to the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are -- assuming 

there are amicus briefs on the other side. The Ballunas 

amicus brief -- I think it is fair for the Court to look 

at, to look at the document that the agency had before 

it. That -- that document produced by the National 

Research -- Research Council, that's the research arm of 

the National Academy of Sciences. And it's one of the 

gold standards of research.

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in their selective 

quotations, they left out parts that indicated there was 

far less uncertainty than the agency purported to find.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think one 

thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is 

that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of 

global climate change. I think the debate is on which 

areas are more uncertain than the others. But certainly 

I think the agency was entitled to conclude, 

particularly if you take into account the deference this 

Court should give to that kind of determination, that 

the scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of 

global climate change, surrounding issues of the extent 

of natural variability in climate, surrounding the 

issues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean 

circulation, and low cloud cover, are permissible 

considerations for the agency to take into -- -

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there uncertainty on 

the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases 

contribute to global warming.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, the report says that 

it is likely that there is a -- a connection, but that 

it cannot unequivocally be established. I think that --

if I could use that to go back to the standing question, 

Your Honor, which is the fundamental question of whether

they've showed not just a connection between greenhouse 

gas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global 

climate change, but the particular class of greenhouse 

gas emissions at issue in this case. Six percent of 

global greenhouse gas emissions, at most. That assumes 

you put all U.S. vehicles off the road or that they are 

all zero emission cars. So you're talking about 

emissions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it is not a 

mathematical question, right? I mean, you would -- it's 

that you would -- what is the number? What's enough? 

10 percent? 15 percent? Presumably, there's more to it 

than the percentage of emissions attributable to be this 

particular --

MR. GARRE: I think that's true, Your Honor. 

But what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden 

in order to establish standing under this case, is that 

regulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in 

this case will make a difference to them.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it is not 

greenhouse gas. Suppose it was Agent Orange. Suppose 

there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out 

Agent Orange. And I come into the Court and I say, you 

know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with

here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent 

Orange is only 1 in 30. Maybe 1 in 50. Maybe 1 in a 

thousand. Maybe 1 in 10,000. And therefore, you have 

no standing to require the EPA to regulate this 

pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all 

over the city.

 Now, would you say that the person who's 

made that claim has no standing?

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that that is 

a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason 

that global climate change is a global phenomenon. I 

mean one --

JUSTICE BREYER: I was only addressing, 

using that to -- to address your problem that the 

chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual 

will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the 

material that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.

case, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have 

to show specific facts demonstrating injury, 

redressibility and traceability. Now in this case --

alleged harms. And again, looking at the --

likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point

to do more than they have done here. And they're 

granted their standing --

they need, be more specific about what they need to do.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I will be more specific.

their case on here. They grounded their case on here, 

in the declarations, on the notion if the United States

regulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then 

other countries will follow suit with respect to the 

emissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas 

emissions. That's clear from the McCracken declaration 

on page 239, paragraph 32 of the JA, as well as the 

Walsh declaration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it can be argued 

that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that 

here.

is enough.

 MR. GARRE: That, that's true, Your Honor, 

but I still think you have to look at the basis that 

they've relied upon on standing. And they haven't shown 

specific facts which should provide any comfort to this 

Court that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer 

greenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on 

their alleged injuries.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is there -- why is 

there reason to assume that it will have no effect?

 MR. GARRE: Well --

assumption you're making. You are saying unless they

and effect, let's say in coastline loss, they have not 

shown either causation or a sufficient likelihood of 

redressibility.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But why do they have to 

show a precise correlation as opposed simply to 

establishing what I think is not really contested, that 

there is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the 

kind of loss that they're talking about; and it is 

reasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases 

will result in some reduction in future loss.

 Why is that insufficient?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Souter, one fundamental 

reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world 

is going to do, whether or not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume the rest --

let's assume that the rest of the world does nothing. I 

don't think that's a very reasonable assumption, but 

let's make that assumption. So that the only thing 

we're talking is the 6 percent. If the 6 percent can be 

reduced -- I think the suggestion was over a reasonable 

period of time, by two and a half percent of the 6, 

there is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will 

be, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline 

lost, but some degree of less coastline lost because

there is a correlation between the gas and the loss of 

the coastline. Why is that an unreasonable assumption 

to make in order to show causation and redressibility, 

bearing in mind that redressibility is a question of 

more or less, not a question of either/or.

 They don't have to show that it will stop 

global warming. Their point is that will reduce the 

degree of global warming and likely reduce the degree of 

loss, if it is only by two and a half percent. What's 

wrong with that?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Souter, their burden is 

to show that if the Court grants their requested relief 

it will redress their injuries. I'm not aware --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Not redress their injury in 

the sense that it will prevent any global warming or 

stop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their 

argument is a different one. It will reduce the degree 

of global warming and reduce the degree of coastal loss.

 MR. GARRE: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's their argument. Not 

all or nothing. But a part. That's what they're trying

 MR. GARRE: And that's fine, Justice Souter, 

I grant you that. But they still have to show that 

there is reason that it is likely to believe, that the

reduction in that tiny fraction of United States 

emissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95 

percent in the rest of the world and what they do, and 

the evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in 

those countries are increasing, they have to show the 

regulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on 

their alleged injuries, not to completely redress them, 

Your Honor. We don't say that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't they have to show 

that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?

 MR. GARRE: They have to show that it is 

likely, Your Honor. And they haven't even tried to make 

that showing. The one thing that they've --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that showing -- and 

I agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a 

moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as 

to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and 

a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a 

half percent reduction from the 6 percent.

 But isn't it intuitively reasonable to 

suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse 

gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing 

damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the 

damage? Isn't that fair?

 MR. GARRE: I don't think that it is fair,

Your Honor. I don't want to pretend to be an expert on 

global climate change. But the one thing I can say is 

from the materials I looked at is that this an 

extraordinarily complex area of science. I'm not aware 

of any studies available that would suggest that the 

regulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas 

emissions would have any effect whatsoever on the 

global -- -

JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you have any --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose others cooperate? 

Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you 

know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power 

plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol 

might be a good idea, and before you know it, they 

decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an 

impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved. Now why 

is it unreasonable? Why is it unreasonable to go to an 

agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, 

and now we're going to go to a different agency like 

NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going 

to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal. 

And there are like not a million things that have to be 

done, maybe there are only seven. But by the time we 

get those seven things done, we'll make a big 

difference. Now what is it in the law that says that

somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want 

you to do your part? Would you be up here saying the 

same thing if we're trying to regulate child 

pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a 

computer can get pornography elsewhere? I don't think 

so.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, what I would point 

you to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of 

Wildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus 

Kadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot 

establish standing based on predictions of the actions 

of independent actors not before it. That's true about 

other agencies that aren't here today. That's true 

about other countries whom this Court does not have 

jurisdiction over.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they couldn't have gone 

in and asked for ozone regulations, because that 

requires other countries? Or what about dumping heavy 

metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because 

of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate 

that. Acid rain they tried to regulate. You're 

saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.

 MR. GARRE: Well, first of all, Congress has 

specifically addressed two of the areas that you 

mentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that

categorically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just because there's 

no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't 

mean the agency can't regulate that particular area, 

right?

 MR. GARRE: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor. That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you are saying if 

Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 

right in this statute under ambient air, and they say 

anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're 

saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do 

that, because it's Article III we're talking about?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, we're saying 

two things. First, every plaintiff has the obligation 

to establish that he has Article III standing under this 

Constitution. And secondly, there are members of this 

Court, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring 

opinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that 

perhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue, 

that could inform the standing analysis. For example --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can't 

compromise the requirements of Article III.

 MR. GARRE: It cannot, Your Honor. Congress 

could make findings with respect to causation or other

issues that this Court would have to give deference to 

and seriously consider, but you're right. It would not 

override the requirements of Article III. And there may 

be some global phenomenon that create more difficult 

challenges to establish standing but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand the 

government's position, you're not merely questioning 

standing but you also take the position you do not have 

the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do; 

is that correct?

 MR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor, moving 

to the merits, that's true. And with respect to that, 

the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that 

this Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you on that 

question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201, 

there's reference to "shall regulate" if in the judgment 

of the administrator there is a for real danger and so 

forth. In your view, is there a duty to make a 

judgment?

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, our view is that 

agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to 

make that judgment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could they have a 

discretion never to make the judgment?

MR. GARRE: I think that gets to the 

question of whether there is, what judicial review is 

available. We have assumed in this case that there's 

some measure of judicial review. So I think at some 

point you got to the point where the agency either has 

provided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound 

basis for the agency not to take that step. Then 

assuming that there is a role for the courts here, a 

court could come in and say that that was inappropriate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But as I read your brief, 

you didn't really confront the question, s I understand 

it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a 

judgment at all. And I'm interested in what your 

position on that is.

 MR. GARRE: Well, again, I think it goes to 

the question -- we think the statute does not put a 

deadline on when the agency has to have, and that 

therefore --

JUSTICE STEVENS: To me, just reading the 

text of the statute is a little ambiguous. I'm not 

entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading 

that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought 

that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment 

when there was enough evidence out there that people 

were concerned about it and so forth, that there would

be a duty there, but you think not?

 MR. GARRE: That's not the agency's 

interpretation. In fact in its decisional document 

under the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains 

why that's not its interpretation and we think that 

that's a reasonable interpretation. Congress knows how 

to constrain the exercise of discretion. We point in 

footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where 

Congress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on 

the exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in 

Section 203.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would agree that 

if they did make a judgment, then you would have 

authority to regulate?

 MR. GARRE: That's right. And then I think 

it's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl 

Corporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because 

the statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment 

finding is made, the agency has discretion to determine 

when to make the endangerment finding.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Norton versus Utah 

Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of 

off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was 

whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its 

action.

MR. GARRE: That's a separate sort of 

action, Your Honor. There are cases where people have 

said that this is unreasonable delay. That's not the 

claim that the petitioners in this case brought.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me understand 

your answer to Justice Stevens' question. If EPA made 

the judgment under the statute, you think they would 

have had the authority?

 MR. GARRE: Under the statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you had a 

Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.

 MR. GARRE: No, I was assuming -- in 

answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down 

in the exercise of discretion part. But you're right, 

Your Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this 

is that it lacks the authority to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about that? I 

found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in 

the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms 

health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant 

after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain. Is 

there anything wrong with that response? It seems to 

me --

MR. GARRE: I think there is, Your Honor. 

The way that the agency looked at this is to look at the

question of whether Congress intended it to regulate 

greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate 

change, and it looked to the factors that this Court 

laid out in Brown and Williamson. The statute as a 

whole is specific legislation addressing global climate 

change, and it concluded that the agency had not 

authorized it to embark on that regulatory --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You concede that it's an 

air pollutant that affects health?

 MR. GARRE: No. The agency -- what the 

agency found, Your Honor, was that because global 

climate change is not air pollution within the meaning 

of the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not 

authorize it to regulate it as air pollution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then why isn't it air 

pollution within the meaning of the statute, although 

whatever it is that causes acid rain is?

 MR. GARRE: I think, Your Honor, that the 

key to the agency was that Congress did not give it 

regulatory authority over this. And I think on the 

question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions 

qualify --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't give me any 

text in this statute itself. It isn't the phrase "air 

pollution" or any other phrase?

MR. GARRE: The agency pointed to the term 

"air pollution agent" in the statute, and concluded that 

because global climate change was not air pollution that 

Congress intended to address --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that gets us back to 

acid rain.

 MR. GARRE: And with respect to acid rain, 

it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a 

whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address 

acid rain.

 The other thing I want to mention on the 

interpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson 

case, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis 

that nicotine would be within the general terms of the 

definition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 

and that cigarettes would fall within the general term 

of drug --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that's the position 

you're taking, that it is within the general term?

 MR. GARRE: I think it's largely the 

position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it 

reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything. We 

conclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate 

global climate change as air pollution. And so 

therefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases

are air pollution agents.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is why there's a 

significant difference between the agency saying that 

for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in 

its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the 

agency's position was. And here where it's a newly 

minted position, because the agency's position not too 

long ago was that they did have the authority.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was 

30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in 

1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant. And 

again, even when it reached that conclusion, it made 

clear that it didn't think that the agency would 

exercise its authority to regulate it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a different 

question. I'm just focusing on, did it have authority 

to deal with this issue?

 MR. GARRE: And I think -- I mean, I grant 

you that there are differences between Brown and 

Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion 

that the agency reached is the same. Which was, to 

borrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did 

not intend to hide elephants in mouse holes. Here we 

are talking about an issue of the magnitude of 

regulating global climate change and greenhouse gas

emissions, which are fundamentally an important part of 

the nation's economy. Nearly 85 percent of the economy 

is a direct or indirect source of greenhouse gas 

emissions.

 And when we look at when Congress did 

mention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the 

1990 amendments, Section 103(g), that was the first time 

that Congress mentioned CO2. And when it did that, it 

went out of its way to say that it was giving 

non-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover, 

that nothing in this section shall provide any basis for 

any air pollution control requirements. That's a 

strange thing for Congress to say if it believed that 

the agency already had this far-reaching authority to 

regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

 There are other aspects of the statute that 

we think lead to the same conclusion in Brown & 

Williamson. There's a fundamental inconsistency, the 

agency concluded, between attempting to regulate 

greenhouse gas emissions under the national air ambient 

quality system, and that inconsistency is similar to the 

inconsistency that the Court pointed out in the Brown 

and Williamson case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like you to address 

that. You said there was a lot of legislation in

Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with 

serious regulation by the FDA. And in this case, I 

don't think Congress is opposing the notion. I don't 

know anybody there who's in favor of global warming. 

And it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is 

actually, that would be significantly interfered with by 

the EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem. 

Or am I wrong?

 MR. GARRE: I think you're wrong in the 

following respect, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What articles would be --

MR. GARRE: Congress has passed at least six 

separate statutes to specifically address the issue of 

global warming, and all of them share two common 

features. One, we want you to research this issue and 

learn more about it. And two, we want you to work on an 

international framework for addressing global climate 

change. The agency reasonably concluded that unilateral 

U.S. regulation of greenhouse gases --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything in the 

statute that prevents them from consulting with other 

nations or prevents the government from doing that when 

they determine how best to work out whatever standards 

or other forms of regulation they want?

Act, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I presume the problem that 

they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in 

international negotiations. If we have done everything 

we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make 

with foreign nations? What incentive do they have to go 

along with us?

 MR. GARRE: That's right, Your Honor. We've 

got a unique collective action problem, and yet, the 

reaction experience of the agency in dealing with the 

issue of stratospheric ozone depletion rate had 

precisely that situation, where the U.S. initially took 

steps. The stratospheric ozone depletion worsened, and 

it was only after international agreement was reached in 

the Montreal Protocol that a global solution to the 

problem was reached.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think they have a 

good reason, yes or no? Because I'm not an expert in 

foreign affairs. The EPA probably is more than I am. 

But do you think that if they do rest their decision on 

their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper 

basis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?

 MR. GARRE: I think it's a proper basis 

within its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least 

two reasons. One, the agency is a part of the executive

branch and it had unique experience with the issue of 

stratospheric ozone depletion. And two, Congress has 

made clear, for example in the Global Climate Protection 

Act of 1987, that the EPA has a role in at least 

reporting to Congress on international cooperation and 

efforts in that realm.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But Congress has not 

directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of 

global warming.

 MR. GARRE: That's true, Your Honor, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I have 

with your reference to this very -- these various pieces 

of legislation that suggest that Congress has a 

different modus operandi in mind is that Congress 

certainly is aware that EPA has authority over 

pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, again, I think 

in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the 

conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently 

reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to 

embark on this regulatory endeavor. And I think the 

closest statute that comes to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that a 

misstatement? Isn't the conclusion that they're trying 

to draw that Congress doesn't want them to exercise the

authority they have for this purpose? And isn't that 

something quite different? And doesn't that raise the 

question whether that is a legitimate concern for them 

under the statute that does give them the authority?

 MR. GARRE: May I answer the question? No, 

Your Honor. I think the agency's conclusion was 

Congress had not authorized it to undertake the 

regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global 

climate change and that, even if it had, that authority 

should not be exercised.

 Thank you very much.

existing uncertainty mattered. To the contrary, they 

emphasized the need to act in the face of current 

uncertainty, but never explained why that principle 

applies to a nonregulatory approach but not to a

until more is understood about causes, extent and 

significance of climate change and the potential options 

for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to 

regulate these emissions.

to act.

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, they did not say 

there is too much uncertainty for them to form a 

judgment, which is the key issue. They said they 

preferred more certainty, but because of the nature of 

the endangerment standard, which emphasizes the 

important of regulating in the face of uncertainty, they 

have to at least explain why the uncertainty matters. 

And that is -- what they did here is particularly 

troubling in the fact that they ignored all of the

indications pointing toward endangerment. They looked 

at what we don't know without ever looking at what we do 

know.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the EPA concludes that 

regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health 

and welfare, can it decline to regulate?

 MR. MILKEY: Not under section 202, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It has to regulate even if 

it concludes that regulation would make things worse?

 MR. MILKEY: Would make things worse?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. MILKEY: I'm sorry, I didn't understand 

that.

 No.

 MR. MILKEY: No, Your Honor. If they 

thought there would be more endangerment that way they 

would not have to regulate.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Then why can't they -- what 

is wrong with their view that for the United States to 

proceed unilaterally would make things worse and 

therefore they're going to decline to regular for that 

reason?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, first of all, I 

don't believe they actually said that, and there is

nothing in the statute that even hints that they can 

take foreign policy considerations into account. To the 

contrary, the statute is very specific in other sections 

about when they're supposed to look at foreign emissions 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the definition of 

public welfare extremely broad?

 MR. MILKEY: Your Honor, it is certainly 

extremely broad, and it does include climate.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
