 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 08-192, Abuelhawa v. United States.

 Mr. Srinivasan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 A person who purchases a small quantity of 

drugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor, 

not a felony. The language of section 843(b) does not 

transform that person into a felon if he uses a phone in 

obtaining his drugs, rather than doing so strictly face 

to face.

 I would like to begin with the text of the 

statute before turning to the textual history and the 

statutory context. The language of section 843(b) 

covers the use of the phone in committing, in 

facilitating, or in causing a drug felony. That 

language presupposes someone who is causing, 

facilitating, or committing a drug felony, and with 

respect to such a person, it makes them guilty of an 

additional offense in the nature of an aggravated 

offense if they use a phone in their committing,

facilitating, or causing a drug felony.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you be specific about 

who those persons would be? You say not a misdemeanant 

drug user. So who would be caught in the 843(b)?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would depend on which 

prong you're referring to, Justice Ginsburg. The -- the 

committing prong refers to persons who are committing 

the underlying drug felony.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: And the facilitating prong 

would refer to persons who are aiding or abetting the 

underlying drug felony.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you had the 

girlfriend phone and say: My boyfriend needs drugs; 

meet him at the corner of 3rd and Main. What crime does 

the girlfriend commit? It seems to me that it's pretty 

clear that she's under 843(b) facilitating.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: She -- she may --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that she 

may then have committed a felony, and yet it seems to me 

that her culpability is certainly no -- no greater, if 

you're talking about your -- the polity of your statute, 

than the man who uses the drugs.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think I'm speaking 

first and foremost about the terms of the statute,

Justice Kennedy. And to the extent she fits within the 

terms of the statute, it would be because she doesn't 

benefit from the buyer-seller rule. The buyer-seller 

rule establishes that buyers of drugs aren't aiders or 

abettors of the distribution of drugs, and equivalently 

they wouldn't be treated as facilitators of the 

distribution of drugs. Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe Justice Ginsburg 

would like some further illustration, but I thought that 

that was one illustration in answer to her question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I would like to --

who does this target? The girlfriend is a good law 

school exam type question, but in the real world who is 

covered?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the classic 

case of somebody under the facilitating prong would be 

the classic aider and abettor, for example a lookout. 

If there were a lookout on the scene of a drug 

transaction, and they used the communication facility to 

communicate with the distributor to let them know that 

buyers were arriving or that law enforcement was in the 

neighborhood and the person ought to refrain from 

engaging in the transaction for the time being. That 

would be the sort of person that comes within 18 U.S.C. 

2 as an aider or abettor of drug distribution and would

come within 843(b) as a facilitator of drug 

distribution.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The buyer -- seller rule 

would prohibit the prosecution of a buyer on the theory 

that the buyer aided and abetted, aided and abetted the 

seller. But I don't see why it applies here. This is 

not a situation like that. This is a different crime, 

using a communications facility in facilitating the 

commission of a felony.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it deals with the use 

of a communication facility only with respect to persons 

that are committing, facilitating or causing a drug 

felony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the purpose -- what 

is the purpose of saying who uses a communications 

facility? Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think it's a 

jurisdictional hook. There would already be Federal 

jurisdiction by virtue of the underlying felony, and so 

what Congress was concerned with in penalizing the use 

of a phone as in the nature of an aggravated offense is 

that I think Congress thought that phones were being 

used to make detection of drug trafficking more 

difficult, and in particular at the level of someone who 

was at top of the food chain in the architecture of a

drug distribution chain, that person was able to avoid 

detection because they never came into physical contact 

with drugs and they didn't come into physical contact 

with the persons who were engaging in the transaction on 

the street.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You keep talking 

about phones and you began by saying this covers phones, 

but this was -- language was added in 1970?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there weren't 

cell phones of the kind you have now. I think this was 

directed at the beepers, right, when those were around 

then, or land-based phones or something like that. And 

the technology has so expanded that the reach of the 

statute has so expanded in a way that brings in a lot 

more casual users than was the case before, and I just 

don't know how that issue of statutory interpretation is 

supposed to be resolved. Assuming I'm right that the 

technology has dramatically expanded the reach of the 

statute, even if you think it's covered by its terms, 

how is that issue addressed? What's the right answer 

there? Is it because the terms still cover it, the 

breadth has expanded, or because this is something new 

technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed 

that broadly?

MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't -- our argument 

doesn't depend on assuming that cell phone usage was 

significant in the 1970s. Even in 1970 the statute 

would exclude from its sweep buyers of drugs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 

let's assume I don't agree -- let's assume I agree with 

that only in the context of the 1970s technology.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Uh-huh.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the answer 

then?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if you agree with it 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It reminds me of 

these old hypotheticals. You know, before you had 

automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk 

in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law 

and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving 

your car and it doesn't make any sense.

 Is there a case of ours that says what to do 

in that case, in such a situation of statutory 

construction?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm not aware of a case 

that speaks directly to that question, Mr. Chief 

Justice. But our argument doesn't depend on that logic, 

because even in 1970 certainly land lines were well in

use, and in fact the indications are that that's what 

Congress was principally concerned with in this statute. 

And at that time we would make the argument, just as 

now, a person who used the telephone in buying drugs for 

personal use wouldn't come within the ambit of the 

provision because the text of the provision goes to 

someone who uses a phone in committing, in facilitating, 

or in causing the commission of a drug felony. And so 

if you're not someone who's facilitating the commission 

of a drug felony in the first place, then you can't be 

charged as using a phone in facilitating a drug felony. 

The reason that a buyer for personal use, whether we're 

talking about 1970 or now, wouldn't be considered a 

person who is using a phone in facilitating a drug 

felony is because of the buyer-seller rule. Buyers 

aren't aiders and abetters of the felony distribution, 

and by the same token they shouldn't be considered 

facilitators of felony distribution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your argument sort of 

assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that 

facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting. If 

they meant aiding and abetting, it's a classic criminal 

law term, they could have said aiding and abetting. 

They didn't. They used a different term, facilitating. 

Why should I think facilitating means aiding and

abetting?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: For several reasons, Your 

Honor. First, their definitional equivalence. Black's 

Law Dictionary defines "facilitating" as "an act of 

aiding or helping or making easier," and it in turn 

defines "aiding and abetting" as "to facilitate the 

commission of the crime." So they mean the very same 

thing.

 And I don't think there's anything 

talismanic about the particular formulation "aiding and 

abetting" and in fact the Court established that in its 

opinion in Gebardi. That dealt with the Mann Act, which 

barred transporting a woman for purposes of engaging in 

immoral acts or aiding or assisting in that 

transportation or causing the transportation. So that 

statute uses a different formulation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean 

it's natural to view the woman in that situation more as 

a victim than as someone facilitating the crime.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure that 

would extend to your case.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know -- the 

opinion doesn't stand on the rationale that the woman 

would be a victim. It stands on the rationale that

Congress when it defined the primary offense, which is 

transporting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was the 

same word. That was "transporting" in both instances. 

Here you have "purchase," one, "facilitating" with a 

telephone, two. That's different.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it doesn't use the 

word "purchase," with respect, Justice Kennedy. It uses 

the words "commit, facilitate or cause." Those are the 

three persons who come within section 843(b). And in 

precisely parallel fashion, under 18 U.S.C. 2, a general 

aider or abettor provision, that provision applies to 

persons who commit the underlying offense, who aid or 

abet the underlying offense or who cause the underlying 

offense. And that precisely parallel structure 

reinforces that facilitating in 843(b) serves the same 

purpose and means the same thing as aiding or abetting 

and the other words that apply in section --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll think about it, 

but I think Gebardi does involve one statute, one act, 

transportation. This involves two. The underlying 

felony is the purchase or possession, and the second 

statute is use of the telephone. So I don't -- I'll 

think about it, but I don't think Gebardi works.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think that's a

distinction that ultimately makes a difference, Justice 

Kennedy, for the following reason. This statute does 

deal both with someone who is involved in the underlying 

felony and use of the phone on top of that, but it's in 

the nature of an aggravated offense. It presupposes 

somebody who is committing, causing or facilitating the 

underlying drug offense, and then it makes them guilty 

of an aggravated offense if they use a phone in the 

course of doing so. So the first question you'd have to 

ask is whether the person is committing, facilitating or 

causing the drug felony in the first place.

 And if I could use one hypothetical statute 

to illustrate that. If this statute, instead of saying 

facilitating, dealt by terms with use of a phone in 

aiding or abetting a drug felony, you would still have 

use of the phone in addition to the underlying drug 

felony. But the first question I think one would ask in 

looking at that provision is whether the person who's 

accused of violating the law were aiding or abetting a 

drug felony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- this statute does 

not just apply to facilitating a drug offense. It 

applies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2 

of the relevant chapter. I agree, it seems a little 

strange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer

converted into a -- into a felony just by use of the 

phone. What other situations under other felony 

provisions would arise that create a similar oddity? Do 

you have any in mind?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know that there are 

other provisions that would create a similar oddity. I 

think this one is particularly anomalous, the use of a 

statute to penalize somebody who otherwise would be a 

misdemeanant, except that they use a phone in the course 

of the purchase for personal use.

 The classic situations in which the statute 

does apply which aren't anomalous because they make 

sense given what Congress had in mind, would be the use 

of a phone to facilitate drug distribution, if someone 

were a lookout again or if someone were a trafficker and 

they instructed, for example, retail sellers where to go 

to pick up stock, a stock house of drugs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This really isn't 

the transformation of a misdemeanor into a felony. It's 

a separate, separate activity and an activity that 

facilitates the commission of a crime. It's much easier 

to carry out your drug distribution business if people 

are calling you on their cell phones than if they have 

to meet you in person or call from a land line.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two steps to respond

to that question, Mr. Chief Justice. First, in terms of 

whether it makes it easier, I think one could say the 

very same thing in an aiding or abetting prosecution. 

Aiding or abetting means the same thing as facilitating, 

and so you could make the argument, I think, that buying 

drugs and engaging in the sorts of actions that 

naturally accompany the purchasing enterprise make the 

sale easier, including directing where the sale is going 

to occur and things like that. But we know already that 

buyers of drugs aren't considered aiders and abettors of 

drugs for purposes of liability under 18 U.S.C. 2. And 

I think by the same token they shouldn't be considered 

facilitators of drugs for purposes of section 843(b), 

and with respect -- I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the -- the defendant 

-- what if the defendant who is a buyer of -- of a 

quantity for personal use does more than simply purchase 

the drugs? What if information is communicated in the 

telephone conversation that makes it easier for the 

transaction to take place or less likely -- less likely 

that there is -- that the person is going to be 

apprehended? Would that person fall within the statute?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice 

Alito. I probably would have to know more about exactly 

what they did, but if it is a -- if what they did is a

normal incident of purchasing, then I think it would 

fall within the buyer-seller rule.

 Otherwise, I think the government under an 

18 U.S.C. 2 prosecution for aider and abettor liability 

could make precisely the same sorts of arguments. The 

government could argue, for example, that this person 

didn't just buy drugs. They instigated the purchase 

because they made the first phone call. They didn't 

accept the first phone call. They made the first phone 

call, and so that takes them outside the buyer-seller 

rule.

 But I don't that argument would work under 

18 U.S.C. 2 because making the first phone call is a 

normal incident of purchasing. And, of course, someone 

who purchases drugs for personal use is going to want to 

take measures to make sure that the purchase goes 

through. Their ultimate objective is to get their hands 

on the drugs. And so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This statute doesn't --

it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in 

terms of who makes the call. I gather the purchaser for 

his or her own use would be just as susceptible to this 

statute if the dealer called and said: I've got a gram 

of cocaine; I know you're interested in having it.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's -- that's right,

Justice Ginsburg. It would apply equally in that 

situation, and from our perspective that points up even 

more of the anomaly in applying it to this factual 

context. And that would equally be the case under 18 

U.S.C. 2.

 One could draw distinctions between who 

makes the initial phone call and other sorts of normal 

incidents of the purchasing enterprise. But I don't 

think, Justice Alito, that because someone engages in a 

drug -- in -- in a transaction in a way that makes it 

particularly likely that the purchase is going to be 

successful, that that alone would take you outside the 

buyer-seller rule.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen in the 

situation where the person who buys the drug is guilty 

of -- of a felony? It's an instance of felony 

possession. Wouldn't the application of your 

understanding of the buyer-seller rule in that situation 

lead to the conclusion that even that person could not 

be convicted under this statute for facilitating the 

commission of the felony of sale?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think so, 

because the buyer-seller rule deals with the 

circumstance in which the way the person is -- is 

associated with a felony is they're associated with the

distributor's felony. And so what the buyer-seller rule 

says is that a buyer isn't an aider and abettor of the 

seller's distribution, and I think by the same token 

shouldn't be associated with the seller's facilitation.

 But in your hypothetical, where the buyer 

himself is committing a felony because his possession 

because of certain characteristics associated with it 

make it a felony, the buyer himself would be committing 

a felony.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may -- that may 

be true, but the buyer there still could not under your 

theory be convicted of facilitating the seller's felony 

of selling the drugs.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, couldn't be 

convicted of facilitating the seller's felony, but would 

fall within the ambit of section 843(b) in any event 

because they would have used the phone in connection 

with their own felony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your gloss on this 

statute makes -- gives rise to some difficult questions 

of proof. What if it's -- I don't know -- ten pounds of 

something, and the guy says, well, I was just buying in 

bulk for personal use, like a Costco dealer.

that, but -- but I think what I do know is it doesn't 

create any greater problems of application than already 

exist under Federal drug laws. Because the Federal drug 

laws bar both possession for personal use under the 

civil possession statute, section 844, and possession 

with intent to distribute under 841.

 And so courts and juries and the government 

already have to make those sorts of decisions, and I 

don't know that they've been particularly difficult to 

make. They have to draw a distinction between the sorts 

of quantities and other aspects of the offense that 

bring it within the possession with intent to distribute 

plan or whether the possession is of such a small 

quantity, and there aren't other associated 

characteristics of the offense that make it possession 

for purposes of personal use.

 That distinction is one that's already 

embedded in the fabric of the drug laws, and we're just 

applying the same distinction for purposes of this 

statute. I don't think we're making it any more 

complicated than it already is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the government were to 

prevail here, I assume that it would then as a result 

have a much larger, more expansive discretion in 

charging and plea bargaining and -- and et cetera.

Other than the rule of lenity, is there anything in our 

cases that indicates that we should be cautious about 

giving the government that authority so that that's an 

aid in our interpretation or is that just all within the 

rule of lenity?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -- it's 

definitely within the rule of lenity, and I think that's 

the principal place that it's found.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than --

MR. SRINIVASAN: And I don't -- I don't -- I 

don't know of any background principle that one would 

bring to bear on that other than the -- the normal tools 

of statutory construction that I've already talked about 

in the first place, which is you look at the text, and 

you look at the statutory history, and you look at the 

statutory context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No background principles 

either way on granting the prosecutors vast discretion 

in charging --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as it applies to 

statutory interpretation?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think as a general 

rule we ought to be circumspect about doing that. My --

my understanding is that circumspection is given voice

through the rule of lenity. But a background principle 

of particular applicability here is the statutory 

history, is the statutory history. And I'm speaking now 

in terms of the enacted statutory text; not legislative 

history, but the history of the enacted statutory text.

 And what that bears on is not the word 

"facilitating," which is what the buyer-seller rule 

particularly pertains to, but the word "felony," which 

is another word in the text of the statute. And so 

Congress could have barred the use of a phone in 

connection with any drug offense, including a drug 

misdemeanor, but Congress pointedly didn't do so. It 

barred the use of a phone in connection only with a drug 

felony. And because it chose to limit the offense to 

the use of a phone in connection with a drug felony, the 

effect is to exclude from the purview of the statute use 

of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor. Now, 

Petitioners --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was changed in 1970, 

wasn't it? Wasn't the text "offense" originally, and 

then Congress changed it to "felony"?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice 

Ginsburg. Before the Controlled Substances Act, the 

communication facility provision barred the use of a 

phone in connection with any drug offense. And in 1970

in the Controlled Substances Act Congress narrowed its 

reach to encompass only use of a phone in connection 

with a drug felony.

 So it excluded use of a phone in connection 

with a drug misdemeanor, and that's significant in two 

respects. One is, even without reference to the 

statutory context of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, 

it's significant because Congress excluded use of a 

phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor.

 Petitioner used a phone in connection with 

his misdemeanor simple possession. But under the 

government's argument, the very same conduct by the very 

same person would be brought back into the fold of the 

statute. Even though Congress excluded it, it would be 

brought back into the fold of the statute by recasting 

it as facilitating the dealer's felony.

 And the mode of analysis the Court used in 

Gebardi and the mode of analysis that underlies the 

buyer-seller rule to begin with would -- would lead us 

not to infer that Congress would have intended that 

result.

 But in terms of the history and the 

statutory context which you were alluding to, Justice 

Ginsburg, it is significant for that reason, as well, 

because the context in which Congress narrowed the reach

of section 843(b) so that it only encompasses 

facilitation of a felony and not facilitation of a 

misdemeanor is one in which Congress in the 1970 act 

sought to extend leniency and afford a chance at 

rehabilitation to drug users.

 And that's manifested not in legislative 

history but in the statutory text itself, because 

Congress penalized simple possession for personal use as 

a misdemeanor, whereas, the receipt of drugs previously 

was a felony, regardless of the purpose of the 

possession, whether it was for use or for distribution.

 But Congress did more than that, because in 

immediately adjacent provisions to the one in which it 

narrowed simple possession to a misdemeanor, it also 

enacted a provision which is now found in 18 U.S.C. 

3607, which allowed a simple possessor who is a 

first-time offender to avoid any conviction at all if 

they successfully complete a period of probation.

 And Congress went further still because it 

also enacted in another adjacent provision further 

relief for first-time simple possessors under the age of 

21. With respect to that person, it allowed the person 

to obtain a complete expungement of the criminal records 

associated with the arrest.

lost this case before 1970 because the incongruity on 

which you rely --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the basis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- didn't exist 

then?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. Before 1970 it would 

have been a very difficult climb because -- not only 

because the communication facility applied to any drug 

offense, but because simple possession wasn't a 

misdemeanor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the scope 

of this language was changed sub silentio?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it wasn't sub 

silentio. It was explicit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but this 

language, "facilitating," covered purchasers using a 

telephone in the period before 1970, but not after 1970, 

because of the changes in some other sections?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, well, it's in part 

because of the changes in this section. This section 

changed from "any offense" to "felony," so it's the text 

of this section itself. And the buyer-seller rule 

equally applied in -- before 1970. It's just that 

before 1970 you wouldn't have had to show that the buyer 

was associated with the seller's felony, because the

buyer was associated with his own offense and that was 

enough, because at that point the buyer's offense was a 

felony. And then the law, section 843(b), didn't care 

whether it was a felony because it applied to any drug 

offense.

 It's only after 1970 that this distinction 

becomes important, because after 1970 it's clear that 

the buyer for personal use doesn't use a phone in 

committing a drug felony. What he's committing is a 

drug misdemeanor. So you have to find some way, if 

you're the government, to make him associated with the 

drug felony. And to say that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That question goes 

to whether or not the distribution was a felony.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, which is the only 

avenue available after 1970. There was a different 

avenue available before 1970, because before 1970 a 

purchaser of drugs would, if they used a phone in 

connection with their purchase, would have used a phone 

in connection with a drug offense, and now the statute 

is different in two respects. One, it only covers use 

of a phone in connection with a drug felony; and two, in 

another provision, Congress narrowed the simple 

possession offense from a mis -- from a felony to a 

misdemeanor.

And Congress did so with respect to the 

historical context in immediately adjacent provision. 

It narrowed 843(b) in an immediately adjacent provision 

to the one in which it provided that the simple 

possessor could avoid any conviction at all and the one 

in which it provided that a youthful offender could 

obtain a complete expungement of its records. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't -- I haven't 

heard you question so far the government's rationale, 

the reason Congress did this is it's more difficult to 

detect a drug deal when it's by telephone than if it 

were an encounter on the street or in an apartment. You 

have not questioned that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, we don't question that, 

Your Honor, but I would like to make two points with 

respect to that. First of all, it may be more 

difficult -- the use of the telephone may be more 

difficult, and that may be the animating purpose that 

Congress sought to address through this provision. But 

that purpose is substantially served even in the context 

of this case, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 

you're saying. The use of a phone may be more 

difficult?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Use of a phone may make

detection more difficult, and that may be the animating 

purpose -- excuse me. That may have been the animating 

purpose behind the enactment of this provision. But 

that purpose is substantially served, even if you accept 

our understanding of the statute on the facts of this 

case, because the seller comes squarely within the terms 

of section 843(b). So because the seller comes within 

the terms of section 843(b), the statute is already 

operating against the seller's use of a telephone.

 The question in our case is whether the 

buyer also comes within the ambit of section 843(b). 

And because section 843(b) presupposes someone who is 

committing, facilitating or committing a drug felony, 

the buyer doesn't come within the reach of section 

843(b) because he's not committing, causing or 

facilitating a drug felony in the first place. The 

seller may be, but the buyer is not. The statutory 

purposes are still served by virtue of penalizing the 

seller.

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

would like to reserve the balance of my time for 

rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Miller.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 843(b) prohibits the use of a 

communication facility in causing or facilitating the 

commission of any act constituting a felony under the 

Controlled Substances Act. The court of appeals 

correctly held that the statute is violated when a 

person uses a communication facility such as a telephone 

to purchase controlled substances unlawfully. A call to 

order drugs both causes and facilitates a felony 

distribution of drugs.

 There's no basis in the statute for creating 

an exemption for people who facilitate or cause felony 

distributions by purchasing drugs for their own personal 

use.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So two people across 

the park, they know there's a drug dealer on the other 

side, the one waves and the dealer comes over, the other 

calls on the cell phone and the dealer comes over; the 

other gets four more years? The phone user gets four 

more years?

 MR. MILLER: The phone -- the phone user is 

exposed to four more years. There's no mandatory 

minimum --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose he calls 

three times. He's exposed to 12 more years, right?

 MR. MILLER: That's right. Congress -- I 

mean, those two cases are different and Congress made 

the judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just that, he gets a 

felony on his record. Before that he would have had 

just a misdemeanor; right?

 MR. MILLER: That's right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The call -- does the call 

have to be completed -- I mean, if he gets an answer 

saying "Your call is important to us, but we're serving 

someone else"?

requires that the communication facility be used. And 

if the call doesn't actually go through, it would be 

difficult to see how you would use the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if he leaves a 

message?

 MR. MILLER: If he leaves the message and 

the message in some way causes or facilitates a felony 

drug distribution, then, yes, he has used the 

communication facility.

separate episodes, each involving one gram of cocaine?

 MR. MILLER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there were a total of 

seven phone calls?

 MR. MILLER: There were six. The government 

dismissed one of the counts. It was six counts that 

went to trial, six phone calls.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would be an 

exposure --

MR. MILLER: Of 24 years.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 24 years for the one gram 

of cocaine on two occasions.

 Do you agree that it doesn't make any 

difference who initiates the call? That is, if the 

seller says -- seller calls the buyer, and says, I 

understand that you are in the market for one gram of 

cocaine, I'll sell it to you, is the buyer similarly 

subject to this statute?

 MR. MILLER: Just getting that call by 

itself wouldn't subject someone to the statute. But if 

you get the call and then engage in a conversation --

JUDGE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. MILLER: -- with the dealer where you 

are using the telephone to cause --

purchase is made in either case.

 MR. MILLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what you're saying is 

it doesn't matter who initiates the call?

 MR. MILLER: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what do you do --

this case that I find pretty close to what we have here 

is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that 

prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote, 

"promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate" 

certain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would 

have been gambling.

 And we said the ordinary meaning of this 

language suggests that the traveler's purpose must 

involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal 

activity. So it wouldn't have been facilitating a 

gambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate 

travel for the purpose of playing the tables.

 MR. MILLER: I think there are a couple 

answers to that, Your Honor. First, Rewis, as you say, 

was construing the Travel Act. It didn't focus on the 

word "facilitate," and it certainly didn't set out a 

general --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it certainly focused on 

the word "facilitate." That was the whole purpose of

that passage. It said -- it quoted "promote, manage, 

establish, carry on or facilitate," and the ordinary 

meaning of this language suggests the traveler's purpose 

must involve more than the desire to patronize the 

illegal activity.

 MR. MILLER: That's right, and -- and as --

as indicated by the passage you've just quoted, the 

focus of the Court there was on the traveler's purpose. 

The Travel Act requires intent. Section 843(b) is 

different in that it's satisfied by knowingly or 

intentionally using the phone.

 So the Court in Rewis said, quite 

reasonably, that someone whose only purpose is to be a 

customer of an unlawful enterprise doesn't have the 

intent to facilitate -- and significantly, although the 

Court's quotation of the statute ends at "facilitate," 

it's not just to facilitate any unlawful activity; it's 

to facilitate the promotion, management --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that the 

"knowingly" in this statute also requires that you are 

knowingly facilitating?

 MR. MILLER: It does require.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So this is the same 

thing here.

 MR. MILLER: But it doesn't have to be -- it

doesn't have to be that you have the purpose of 

facilitating the seller. It's sufficient that you know 

that the seller's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this didn't 

mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either, 

did it?

 MR. MILLER: It -- it said "intent." It 

does not include the word "knowledge," and the Court in 

the passage you just read construed that to require an 

inquiry into the traveler's purpose.

 It's also significant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it pretty close, I 

really do.

 MR. MILLER: Well, one other difference, 

then, Your Honor, is that the facilitation that has to 

take place under the Travel Act is facilitation of the 

promotion, management, establishment or carrying on of 

unlawful activity, which is defined not as a discrete 

crime but as a business enterprise involving gambling. 

So you have a statute that's focused on sort of 

management or direction of an ongoing enterprise, 

whereas here under 843(b), it's sufficient to facilitate 

a discrete act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why are you going through 

all this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the

legislative history as well as the statute in 1970? 

What is your answer to the last point that they made, 

that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple 

possession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the 

word, which -- "offense" to "felony." That's why they 

changed the word "felony" to "misdemeanor."

 And I can't imagine why else they amended 

the statute, and just because I was curious I looked it 

up, and that's why they amended it, right. So -- so the 

legislative history makes that clear.

 So what you've done is figure out a way --

the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of 

what they want, to take people who simply possess and 

transform it into a felony. Now, what justification is 

there in the law for doing that?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I think there are a 

couple of answers to that. First is that section 843(b) 

doesn't apply to people who simply possess. It applies 

to people who possess by using a phone to facilitate a 

felony distribution. And Congress -- I mean, the very 

existence of the statute demonstrates that Congress 

thought that the use of a phone is a separate element 

that introduces a distinct evil that Congress wanted to 

combat. And as to the change in the felony language --

JUSTICE BREYER: As to the first, I said

subset. I didn't say you undermined the entire statute. 

I said you took a subset of people who simply possessed 

and that subset you transformed into felons. Now, your 

response I guess is just what you said.

 MR. MILLER: Well, yes --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- second.

 MR. MILLER: -- and also that the reason for 

the -- as you know, as you know, the predecessor to 

843(b), which was section 1403, referred to causing or 

facilitating any offense. All of the enumerated 

offenses were felonies. In 1970 they changed the word 

"offense" to the word "felony." But that's part of the 

reason for that. There is no legislative history 

specifically addressing the reason for that change. But 

part of the reason we can infer is that the 1970 statute 

created a whole host of misdemeanors, of misdemeanor 

regulatory offenses under the Controlled Substances Act. 

So one good example is section 829, which prohibits 

distributing a controlled substance without a 

prescription, and that's an offense -- that's a 

misdemeanor, and that could easily be caused or 

facilitated over the phone, if somebody called a 

pharmacist.

 And so, where both parties to the 

transaction are only engaging in a misdemeanor, that's

something that 843(b) would not apply to.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know that --

that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between 

the own-purpose users and people who were in the 

trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for 

the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency.

 But the difference between the 

classification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms 

of consequences for a person's life. So let's take the 

defendant in this case. If he becomes a felon rather 

than a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and 

it's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't 

he?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, that's right. But I 

-- and I think -- but one other change that Congress 

made to 843(b) in 1970 that's significant is that it 

eliminated the mandatory minimum. There was under the 

predecessor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm speaking 

about the post consequences.

 MR. MILLER: Yes. Yes. It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it may be that in 

certain States voting rights are removed, and there is 

on this person's record forever that he is a felon. It 

just seems odd that Congress would have at one and the 

same time, the same statute, say, we want these -- to 

give these people a chance and if they are in a 

rehabilitation program and they make it they won't even 

get any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then 

say, but a whole group of them are going to be treated 

just like traffickers if they use a telephone.

 It's hard -- these two would seem to be 

working at odds with each other. So mustn't the Court 

then try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization 

of these two provisions? And it's suggested that we do 

that by saying facilitation, causing in this context 

means the same thing as aiding and abetting, then we 

have the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor, 

and then we have made these two provisions harmonious.

 MR. MILLER: I think the buyer-seller 

principle and the limitation on aiding and abetting and 

accessory liability, as this Court recognized in 

Gebardi, doesn't apply here; because the principle that 

the Court set out in that case, and it has been 

recognized in subsequent cases, is that -- is that when 

Congress criminalizes or punishes one party to a

transaction, that inevitably involves a second party. 

The second party who is left unpunished by the statute 

doesn't get swept back in under section 2 as an aider 

and abettor.

 That principle doesn't apply here because 

although the existence of a purchaser or a receiver of 

drugs is an inevitable incident of a distribution, the 

existence of a purchaser who uses a phone is not. The 

whole point of this statute is that the use of a phone 

is a separate and distinct element that introduces a 

different evil and that Congress wanted to combat that. 

The other -- the other reason that aiding and 

abetting --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the use of a 

phone in this statute is applied to the seller as well 

as to the buyer. I mean, it seems to me it is parallel: 

use of a phone to commit the offense by the seller, and 

you want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of 

the offense by the use of the phone by the buyer. It 

seems to me pretty parallel to what we've done in the 

buyer-seller rule.

 MR. MILLER: The -- the statute -- but by 

its terms makes clear that the person using the phone 

and the person committing the felony don't have to be 

the same person, and I think -- I understood Petitioner

to acknowledge that. The statute doesn't say knowingly 

or intentionally use a communication facility in causing 

or facilitating his or her commission of a felony.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there another example in 

the law, anywhere in the law, where -- and there may be, 

I'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an 

illegal business and there is a customer; and all the 

customer does is be a customer; and is there an example 

where just because he's a customer in a statutory 

provision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all 

right; imagine those circumstances -- you still can 

punish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?

 MR. MILLER: I'm not aware of any, and I 

don't think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not aware, and why 

should this be the first?

 MR. MILLER: But this -- this isn't one, 

Because this isn't a case that punishes people just for 

being a customer. It's a case -- it's a statute that 

punishes people for being a customer -- and using a 

phone.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The way they're a customer 

-- the way they're a customer is they use the telephone, 

and I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and 

the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what

Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because 

Congress was really worried about telephones. Okay, 

that's possible.

 So can you get a parallel that's like that?

 MR. MILLER: There are -- there's a whole 

host of statutes that punish --

JUSTICE BREYER: What one comes to mind?

 MR. MILLER: I mean, the wire fraud statute 

punishes conduct that might not be a Federal offense at 

all, but for the fact that somebody used --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's jurisdictional. 

What I'm looking for is there's a business and a 

customer, the statute punishes the business worse than 

the customer. Now, we get the customer as if he were a 

business participant. That's what I'm looking for, 

where it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a 

telephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore 

signals or -- where the -- where the means of 

communication here or something like that suddenly 

transform him?

 Anything else that comes to mind? I didn't 

expect there to be, but I just thought maybe you would 

think of an analogy, which would be helpful.

where the use of a communication facility is an element 

of the offense, and the conduct covered by those 

statutes in many cases might not be a Federal offense at 

all.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Carry -- carrying a 

weapon. A lot of statutes punish more severely for 

carrying weapons.

 MR. MILLER: Right. And I think, to be 

clear, this is not -- this is not a statute that 

punishes people, punishes customers as if they were 

distributors or that aggravates an underlying felony. 

This is a separate offense; it has its own penalty; it 

put the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- can you tell me, 

how does it work? The district -- the United States 

Attorney in one State, one district, has a case like 

this where there are four different phone calls; and he 

doesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some 

reason he can charge him, and in the neighboring 

jurisdiction the United States Attorney does not. Are 

there guidelines? Does the Department of Justice 

control this in each case? Is there some manual where 

we could see what the rules are for charging? Is it all 

at the discretion of the United States Attorney?

anything in the U.S. Attorney's Manual that specifically 

addresses this statute, but of course the Court 

recognized in Batchelder that prosecutors legitimately 

have discretion when there are different criminal 

statutes that cover the conduct, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the 

statement that in the manual -- maybe this is 

incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the 

Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge 

the most serious offense supported by the facts? And if 

that's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have 

no choice. The most serious offense is not misdemeanor 

simple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).

 MR. MILLER: That's if they bring charges at 

all, and of course that policy doesn't require 

prosecutors to -- to bring charges.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ordinarily --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think we know from this 

case they're likely to bring charges.

 MR. MILLER: Well, I mean --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that the policy, first 

of all? It says that they're supposed to charge the 

most serious offense supported by the facts?

one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the 

phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction 

for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice 

but to indict under 843(b)?

 MR. MILLER: Well, again, if -- if there is 

to be an indictment at all. There's no requirement that 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the 

choice between misdemeanor, simple possession 

misdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b). The 

prosecutor -- if what I read is correct -- has no 

discretion, has to if he makes the charge. He cannot 

make a simple misdemeanor charge. He has to charge the 

felony.

 MR. MILLER: That's my understanding of the 

policy, but, you know, this Court has recognized that, 

you know, that sort of charging decision is a legitimate 

aspect of the system as long as it's not exercised for 

unconstitutional reasons.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but there's -- there's 

a difference here, and that is, as these cases 

illustrate, three phone calls for one trifling sale, two 

for another, this gives a kind of multiplier effect 

which it's -- it's hard to find a parallel for in the 

law. We go from a misdemeanor to 12 years, depending on

the fact that there were -- there were a couple of cell

 That is -- maybe -- maybe that is exactly 

what Congress intended, and maybe that's good law 

enforcement policy, but those are not sort of two 

intuitively obvious positions.

 MR. MILLER: I think the -- the text of the 

statute and the fact that it covers any act constituting 

a felony does demonstrate that that's what Congress 

intended as well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the 

question?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's feel sorry for this 

-- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too. I 

mean, the same thing is true of him, isn't it? Every 

time he makes another phone call he gets socked with 

another how many years?

four, but again --

times four every time he makes a phone call.

that -- he knows that he's committing a felony, and the 

possessor of a gram or less doesn't.

 MR. MILLER: The possessor who purchases the 

drugs using his phone knows that he is causing the 

felony. The reason he calls the drug dealer is because 

he wants to cause the dealer to send him drugs.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the 

legislative history? Because I would read it -- and in 

fact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when 

you read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because 

Justice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I 

was thinking of. If the buyer sits there with a gun, 

well, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and 

it's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence. And 

you're saying by reading the text you've discovered 

Congress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns. 

Okay. I grant you somebody might have thought that. 

Justice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but 

is there any legislative history that suggests that that 

indeed is what people in Congress thought when they 

passed this statute? I'll read it if there is.

 MR. MILLER: Yes, and it --

the -- the Congress has a traditional interest in 

keeping the channels of commerce and communication free 

from --

JUSTICE BREYER: Normally, where that is 

involved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia 

called it "a jurisdictional hook." They don't think the 

underlying behavior is worse, but they believe there has 

to be a basis and should be a basis for federal 

prosecution. I started out where he was. I thought 

this is just a jurisdictional hook, but now you say no, 

it isn't; it's much worse than that. It's like carrying 

a gun, not quite as bad as that, but on that -- in that 

direction. So I'm asking you what would I read in this 

history to show that what you're claiming is right?

 MR. MILLER: The legislative history of the 

1956 act, which is the -- where the predecessor statute, 

1403, was enacted, shows that Congress was concerned 

with the ability of drug traffickers and people engaging 

in drug transactions to avoid detection by using the 

phone --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what -- you've 

cited that in the brief so I can find it?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. And the initial proposal 

in the initial Senate bill would have allowed 

wiretapping in connection with drug investigations of

certain enumerated offenses that covered both purchasers 

and sellers. That was replaced with the provision that 

became 1403, which also -- which applied "causing or 

facilitating" enumerated offenses, and again applied to 

both buyers and sellers. And that statute was applied 

to buyers in a number of reported decisions before 1970, 

and there is nothing in the 1970 legislative history 

that Congress intended to change that aspect.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work? I 

mean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of 

detection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on 

the streets. But here, I mean, we know that the 

government tapped the dealer's phone, and that's how the 

government got the list of the people who bought from 

the dealer. How common is it that -- the either the 

buyer or the seller is the subject of a telephone tap?

 MR. MILLER: I don't -- I don't know the 

statistics on that, but certainly a wiretap is only 

possible when demanding standards under Title III are 

met, and -- whereas a face-to-face meeting can be 

observed by anybody who happens to be there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what had to be met in 

this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's 

phone?

believe the statute requires some showing that it's not 

possible to obtain evidence in some other less intrusive 

way. So in this case there was a wiretap on the 

dealer's phone, but in a lot of cases there's not going 

to be that. And certainly Congress, when it enacted the 

statute, viewed keeping people from using the phones to 

conceal their drug transactions as one way of minimizing 

the need for more intrusive measures like wiretapping.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would interpret 

Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple 

possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession 

becomes a misdemeanor. And you're saying that Congress 

meant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor 

status, but only if the encounter was face to face. So 

you're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply 

distinguish between traffickers and users, and say but 

that was only taking 843(b) into account. That benefit 

-- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to 

be a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face 

transactions.

 MR. MILLER: For -- it's -- I mean, it 

doesn't apply when -- when a communication facility is 

used. It also doesn't apply, I mean, in a number of 

other contexts that Petitioner acknowledges. But --

this context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one 

occasion, nothing more.

 MR. MILLER: As a first offense. I mean, 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So Congress's design was 

we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own 

use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter. 

That's what -- what you would have to read -- you would 

have to limit the line Congress drew between 

traffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their 

own use, on the other, that it applies only to drugs 

purchased in face-to-face encounters.

 MR. MILLER: Yes, although I wouldn't 

describe it as an issue of a less grave offense or a 

more grave offense in the sense that the use of the 

phone aggravates the offense of possession.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I mean, practically 

MR. MILLER: But the use of a phone is the 

difference --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the difference between 

being labeled a misdemeanant and being labeled a felon 

is an enormous difference.

range of levels of culpability associated with the 

843(b) offense, which is part of the reason that it 

eliminated the mandatory minimum when it amended the 

statute in 1970, suggesting that there could be 

different kinds of conduct that would satisfy it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Miller, in answer to 

one of Justice Breyer's earlier questions, he -- the 

premise of his question was the effect of the twin 

amendments from offense to felony and from felony to 

misdemeanor for possession of small quantities. And he 

said, well, in effect, is that combination of amendments 

really being rendered nugatory by the view that you take 

of the statute? And you said not necessarily, and you 

said there may be some drug transactions in which it is 

a misdemeanor on both sides, so that the statute would 

apply there.

 Are there any other -- are there many 

examples of that? I thought not. And are there any 

other examples of misdemeanor-misdemeanor cases that the 

-- that the statute would apply to so that -- so that 

the anomaly wouldn't be quite so obvious?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, if you're asking 

other misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled 

Substances Act --

important is this? It looks to us -- I mean, I think it 

was the premise of the question and it was -- it was my 

assumption coming in that your view of the statute 

largely renders those two amendments, or the combined 

effect of those two amendments, virtually nugatory.

 And you said, well, not necessarily because 

there may be misdemeanor cases. And I want to know how 

many of them there are. Is that really a significant 

area for the application or nonapplication of this 

statute?

 MR. MILLER: I -- I don't know how many 

prosecutions are brought under those statutes. I 

imagine that, in part because they are misdemeanors, not 

a lot of prosecutions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How many separate -- how 

many misdemeanor-misdemeanor combined offenses are there 

under the -- under the code?

 MR. MILLER: 842, section 842, enumerates I 

think it is on the order of a dozen or so, and then we 

cite a couple of them in our brief. So distributing a 

-- a controlled -- a prescription drug without a 

prescription would probably be one of the most common 

that someone would engage in.

cases?

 MR. MILLER: No. I mean, again, because --

because they're misdemeanors and prosecutorial resources 

are probably concentrated on the more serious felony 

violations of the Controlled Substances Act, I suspect 

there aren't a lot of prosecutions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- well, then, I guess 

that leads to my last question, and that is: Isn't it 

probably true that if we accept your view of the 

statute, then the effect of those two combined 

amendments, offense to -- to felony, felony to 

misdemeanor for small quantities, the -- the combined 

effect of -- of those two statutes is, in effect, 

rendered worthless in -- in most cases? In a 

substantial number of cases to which the -- the 

communication facility statute would be applied, it --

it would render those -- those two amendments, in 

effect, worthless?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I think the -- the 

relevant inquiry is: What -- what did Congress intend 

in 1970 when it changed the statute?

inquiry, but what about my irrelevant inquiry?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's going to -- your --

your view of the statute is going to render those two 

amendments virtually dead letters?

 MR. MILLER: I mean I -- I think -- I think 

from the perspective of -- of Congress, that there was 

no -- they wouldn't have anticipated that the amendment 

would not have any consequence. I mean the fact that --

that they created this whole set of misdemeanors, the 

fact that they aren't violated very often --

JUSTICE SOUTER: As you said, you -- you 

don't have figures on the number of prosecutions. And 

the number of prosecutions under those misdemeanors, as 

distinct from the number of applications of the 

communications statute to conventional buyer/seller 

transactions is probably the difference between a very 

small set and a very large set of cases. And in the 

very large set of cases the two amendments are being 

rendered, in effect, worthless; isn't that true?

 MR. MILLER: If I -- if I may answer, my 

understanding is that the number of prosecutions under 

843(b) is -- is also relatively small, but I don't have 

precise figures on -- on the comparative numbers.

Four minutes, Mr. Srinivasan.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 The only point I would make in closing, 

unless the Court has further questions for us, is that 

we think the statutory text, the statutory history, and 

the context all weigh in favor of our reading. But even 

if there is any ambiguity on the matter, principles of 

lenity would squarely apply in foreclosing an 

interpretation that converts someone who is a 

misdemeanant into someone who is exposed to multiple 

felony counts carrying substantial criminal 

consequences.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question as 

just a matter of history? Is it perfectly clear? I 

think you said that the -- the presence of the use of 

the telephone was not just a jurisdictional hook. 

Because back in 1970 the Federal Government really 

wasn't in the criminal law business the way it has 

become in the last 30 or 40 years.

 At that time there was a lot of concern, the 

Travel Act and other statutes, about exactly what the

Federal justification for -- justification for Federal 

participation existed. And I -- I always had the 

impression that that was really what was behind the 

telephone aspect of this statute.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think so, Justice 

Stevens, because as of 1970 there were already 

underlying drug laws that barred distribution, that 

barred receipt of drugs, and that barred most of the 

activities that are now prohibited under the drug laws. 

And the telephone law presupposes that one of those 

underlying acts is already going on.

 And so to the extent that there was 

jurisdiction over those underlying acts, which 

presumably there was since the statutes are on the 

books, the Telephone Act wasn't necessary to create 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this 

question? I -- I understand your argument regarding 

statutory history and the harsh consequences of this. 

But as far as the buyer/seller rule -- Gebardi and Rewis 

are concerned, what if the statute said -- made it a 

crime for -- for a person to use a machine gun in 

facilitating the commission of a felony? Would you say 

-- you would have to say that the buyer/seller rule and 

those authorities would mean that that person could not

be prosecuted if they were using the machine gun to 

facilitate a -- a purchase for personal use; would you 

not?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the -- the 

use of the machine gun wouldn't come within the 

buyer/seller rule because what the buyer/seller rule 

deals with is a substantive prohibition on distribution. 

And the -- the presumption is that when Congress 

prohibits distribution, it knows that there is also a 

receiver of the banned substance. And by virtue of 

excluding that receiver from the distribution 

prohibition, it wouldn't have wanted to bring that 

receiver back within the fold of the statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Right, but --

MR. SRINIVASAN: That wouldn't apply --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. Go ahead.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I was just going to say I 

don't think that would apply with somebody who is using 

a machine gun because the person who is using a machine 

gun isn't necessarily part of the distribution offense 

to begin with. And so the buyer/seller principle would 

apply with respect to the underlying purchase of drugs 

if that were at issue. But if you tack on use of a 

machine gun, I don't think the buyer/seller principle 

would speak directly to that.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't -- I don't see 

the difference between use of a phone to facilitate --

use of a phone in facilitating, use of -- of a firearm 

in facilitating, unless you can say that the -- the use 

of a communication facility in effecting the purchase is 

such a -- a virtually indispensable element of the 

purchase that it -- it -- it's swept up within it.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Oh, no, I'm sorry, Justice 

Alito. If the hypothetical statute barred use of a 

phone in facilitating a drug felony, if it was precisely 

parallel to this one, then we make the same argument. 

But it's not because the use of a machine gun falls 

within the buyer/seller principle. It's because the 

underlying act of purchasing drugs falls within the 

buyer/seller principle. And if the prohibition is on 

use of a machine gun in some underlying act, then you 

have to look at the underlying act. And the underlying 

act is governed by the buyer/ seller principle, and 

buyers fall outside of it. And so the use of a machine 

gun by someone who is already outside of the act 

wouldn't bring the buyer back into the fold of the 

statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is that this 

-- it would be the same.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It would be the same --

JUSTICE ALITO: The buyer/seller rule would 

apply in your view in exactly the same way.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: If the -- if the statute --

if I understand your hypothetical correctly, if the 

statute were use of a phone in facilitating a drug 

felony, then the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it could be a -- a 

separate crime, the use of a machine gun in facilitating 

-- in facilitating a crime, any crime. That could be --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. If that were the 

case, then it would be different. My -- if I could just 

finish for a minute, Mr. Chief Justice.

 My -- my only point is that if the theory of 

prosecution were that a person comes within the fold of 

the statute because they're buying drugs and that buying 

of drugs facilitates the sale of drugs and, therefore, 

they are someone who uses a machine gun in facilitating 

the sale of drugs, well, then the buyer/seller rule 

would kick in. Because the initial predicate of that 

theory, which is that the person is facilitating the 

sale by buying, wouldn't work. They would fall outside 

of the statute at that stage.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
