 (11:06 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1314, Williamson v. Mazda. 

Mr. Buchanan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The issue here is whether a common law claim 

that Mazda should have equipped Mrs. Williamson's 

seating position with a lap/shoulder belt is impliedly 

preempted under the rationale of Geier v. American 

Honda. The claim is not preempted, because it is 

perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the 

objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208 

governing Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats.

 One point that is clear from this Court's 

express preemption holding in Geier is that Congress 

intended common law to play a complementary role in 

achieving the objectives of the Motor Vehicle Safety 

Act.

 Based on the savings clause, the Court 

decided that Congress intended to preserve a significant 

role for State tort law to operate in compensating

accident victims and promoting greater safety in vehicle 

design. And, on the issue of implied obstacle 

preemption, the majority also agreed with the dissent 

that State common law will not be preempted unless there 

is clear evidence of a conflict with Federal objectives.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would -- why would the 

Federal Government do that? I mean, trust juries to 

supplement whatever -- whatever the Federal rules are, 

but not permit State agencies who -- who studied the 

matter with experts, to supplement what the Federal 

rules are?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Justice Scalia -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that make any 

sense, to just say, oh, you know, we -- we don't want 

the State mucking around in this area, but of course 

juries can do so? Why does that make any sense?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Justice Scalia, I think the 

Court answered the question in Sprietsma when it said 

common law has an important role to play in providing 

compensation to victims. And therefore the Court found 

it rational in Sprietsma to make that distinction; and 

ultimately it's a -- it's a judgment call for Congress 

to make.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't doubt 

they made it. I'm just curious as to why it could

 MR. BUCHANAN: Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless I -- unless lawyers 

bring suits before -- before juries, maybe.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

believe common law has an important role to play, not 

only in compensating victims but also in providing 

manufacturers with an incentive to develop safer 

vehicles, even safer than the Federal minimum standards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the reason 

that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA 

did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is 

because the costs would have been higher. Is that your 

understanding?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, for the 

aisle seating position that we are talking about in this 

case, the reason NHTSA decided not to mandate it 

immediately was, A, a concern about obstructing the 

aisleway with the shoulder belt; and B, a concern, yes, 

about the cost of a possible alternative design.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How come allowing -­

or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State 

law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's 

objective in not making those mandatory?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Well, Your Honor, any time

NHTSA creates a safety standard it necessarily takes 

into account costs and benefits and the safety 

attributes. So -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a State tort 

action does not?

 MR. BUCHANAN: A State tort action does. 

What I'm trying to -- the point I'm trying to make, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is that if that were sufficient to 

preempt, then any minimum standard that NHTSA creates 

would therefore preempt State law and it would nullify 

the savings clause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I 

understand the argument. I'm not sure it's right, 

though, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make 

particular standards mandatory for reasons other than 

cost. It may decide it doesn't think the technology is 

adequately developed. It may decide that it doesn't 

think there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared 

or involved.

 But here it's because of the cost, and the 

relief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes 

the costs that NHTSA decided not to require.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Well, NHTSA made a decision 

as of 1989 that the technology -- it obviously had 

concerns about the technology and costs. But any type

of -- of consideration of technology and costs is as of 

that moment in time, and the agency specifically 

encouraged manufacturers to install Type 2 lap/shoulder 

belts in these types of seating positions. And our 

lawsuit is perfectly consistent with the agency's 

objective of encouraging lap/shoulder belts in these 

seating positions. By 1993 -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, every -- there 

is no objective that the government pursues regardless 

of cost. I understand that their objective was to 

encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it, 

because it thought at that time that the costs were too 

great. So to simply say their objective was to get 

these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit 

analysis.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Well, I think what the agency 

did with respect to these seating positions in 1989 is 

it, A, it recognized that there were tremendous safety 

benefits for Type 2 lap/shoulder belts. And yes, it 

found enough countervailing considerations in terms of 

cost and feasibility not to mandate that as part of the 

Federal minimum standard. And so from the Federal 

Government's perspective, for these seating positions, 

the government was neutral as between Type 1 and Type 2 

belts.

Either one of those belts would have 

sufficed to satisfy the Federal agency's objectives. 

And therefore a State law claim that eliminates 

effectively one of those options does not in any way 

frustrate the agency's objectives. The government has 

explained in its brief that its objectives would have 

been fully satisfied if all car manufacturers had 

installed Type 2 lap/shoulder belts immediately.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that different from 

Geier? Didn't the automobile manufacturer in Geier -­

wasn't -- weren't the manufacturers similarly left to 

do, choose for themselves whether to have one type of 

constraint or another?

 MR. BUCHANAN: They were, Justice Scalia, 

but the Court's decision in Geier did not turn on the 

mere fact that the manufacturers had a choice, and Mazda 

is not asserting that claim here either. The 

determinative agency policy at issue in Geier was that 

the agency deliberately sought a variety of different 

passive restraint types. It was concerned about a 

public backlash against airbags, and it wanted to 

encourage the development of alternative passive 

restraint systems.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are saying that 

once the government gives the manufacturer a choice,

then the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess 

it; and that is not consistent with a likely government 

intent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the 

technical advances to that date.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Justice Kennedy, I don't 

think that the government gave manufacturers a choice. 

It gave them two different options for complying with a 

minimum standard; but it didn't suggest that foreclosing 

one of those options would in any way frustrate its 

objectives. It didn't suggest that it thought State -­

that there should be some -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose the 

government says you have a choice and the State of Iowa 

passes a law and says you don't have a choice. No 

frustration of the governmental purpose there?

 MR. BUCHANAN: It depends what the reason 

for the choice is, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, there's just -- just 

the statutes as I have given them to you. That there -­

is there preemption just on the face of the statute?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Not if it's a -- not if it's 

just simply creating a minimum standard. There is no 

preemption.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what the statute 

calls for, minimum.

MR. BUCHANAN: Yes, that's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That the agency is to set 

minimum standards. And then I take it that the Court in 

Geier says it wasn't -- it wasn't a minimum standard, 

because if a State deviated from it, it would detract; 

it would be an obstacle to the realization of the 

Federal standard.

 But here the -- a minimum standard was 

adopted, minimal standard, and I think the agency is 

telling us just the opposite of what it said in Geier; 

right?

 MR. BUCHANAN: Exactly correct, Justice 

Ginsberg. In Geier the agency was the entity putting 

forward the theory of exemption, that this claim by 

Geier that all Honda vehicles should have been equipped 

with airbags, frustrated its intent to accomplish a 

whole variety or mix of passive restraint devices.

 It was a direct conflict with the agency's 

objectives. Here, the agency is telling us the exact 

opposite. It was not trying to further choice or 

variety. It was not trying to maintain a diversity of 

Type 1 and Type 2 seatbelts in rear seating positions. 

Its objective was to obtain the greater safety benefits 

of Type 2 seatbelts.

 The agency found that Type 2 seatbelts were

more effective in preventing fatalities and serious 

injuries, that they offered greater overall protection 

for children, and, most fundamentally, that they 

actually increased seatbelt usage in rear seating 

positions.

 Our common law theory seeks to obtain all 

those exact same safety benefits for aisle seating 

positions. And we know by 1993, when this vehicle was 

manufactured, at least one major manufacturer, GM, was 

in fact installing Type 2 lap/shoulder belts in aisle 

seating positions. Our complaint alleges that it was 

perfectly feasible for Mazda to do so in 1993 when it 

manufactured this vehicle, and that it was unreasonable 

not to do so, and that's the important -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, your theory is, 

if I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong -­

if GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on 

the theory that Type 1 was better and there would have 

been no preemption.

 MR. BUCHANAN: I think that would be a much 

more difficult case, Justice Kennedy, but -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under the theory of 

your case, that suit could go forward.

 MR. BUCHANAN: That's correct. 

Theoretically, that suit could move forward. But the

question that the Supremacy Clause asks is not whether 

hypothetically, there might be future conflicting jury 

verdicts. The question is: Does our claim here that we 

are asserting under California State law conflict with 

the Federal objectives? It does not. The agency has 

told us it does not.

 There is nothing in the contemporaneous 

regulatory history of the Type 2 seatbelt rule that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the rule 

here had another provision that said you must have 

Type 1? You can have Type 2 -­

MR. BUCHANAN: Cannot?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can have Type 2, 

right? But we are not requiring Type 2, because we 

think the costs on manufacturers would be too great. We 

may require it in the future, but not now.

 Is it the same? Is your position the same?

 MR. BUCHANAN: My position would be the 

same. There is no preemption there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't the -­

doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort 

liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my 

hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because 

of the cost?

agency considers costs, it is at a particular moment in 

time. It is not necessarily a determination that for 

all the future, this should never be done and no State 

law should ever mandate that it be done.

 And that's -- what we have here is not only 

a determination that there were cost issues, but an 

affirmative encouragement to manufacturers to do what

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, if the 

regulation comes out July 1, you say there is a 

preemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there 

could be a suit?

 MR. BUCHANAN: I think there was never 

preemption under this regulation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think what you are 

saying -- the statute says "minimal standards" and the 

agency says "no obstacle," and that's it, that if there 

is a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards, 

that it is for the government to say that.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

And not only does it say "minimum standards," it 

explicitly says in the savings clause that mere 

compliance with a motor vehicle safety standard shall 

not exempt the manufacturer from common law liability.

those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?

 MR. BUCHANAN: It did. But again, the key 

dispositive fact in Geier was the agency's desire to 

achieve a variety of different passive restraint 

devices, and a claim that the entire Honda fleet should 

have had airbags would directly conflict with that. 

That was the dispositive fact in this Court's decision 

in Geier, and that is what is lacking here. And what we 

have here is much more -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your judgment here doesn't 

apply to the entire Mazda fleet, supposedly, right? 

Just to the car that caused harm to the plaintiff?

 MR. BUCHANAN: No, that's not correct, 

Justice Scalia. It's not a matter of whether it's the 

entire fleet or not. It's a matter of whether the 

common law claim conflicts with the Federal objective. 

And in Geier, it conflicted, because the objective was 

variety.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the next case? 

Let's assume a similar case. Is that jury bound to come 

out the same way as to whether there should have been a 

shoulder constraint or not?

 MR. BUCHANAN: No, Justice Scalia, and 

that's something that the Court in Geier contemplated

certainly on the express preemption issue, the Court 

acknowledged the possibility that there could be 

conflicting results, inconsistent jury verdicts, which 

is always -­

Geier when you have a statute that says common law 

remedies are safe? I mean, as long as it says that -­

maybe it didn't make a whole lot of sense, but they did 

it.

 MR. BUCHANAN: I agree with you, Justice 

Ginsburg. But I think Geier also says that. Geier 

relies on the savings clause to say that there's a 

significant role for common law actions to play. And 

specifically with regard to the possibility of 

inconsistent jury verdicts, the Court in Geier said the 

possible -- the possibility of nonuniformity, the 

Savings Clause reflects a congressional determination 

that that's a small price to pay for a system where 

juries create and enforce safety standards and 

simultaneously provide compensation to victims. So I 

think that's something the Court considered in Geier.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondents chose to comply with the Federal 

minimum safety standard by installing a Type 1 seatbelt, 

but the savings clause makes clear that they are not 

exempted from the consequences of that choice under 

State common law when that choice results in injury. 

They must show that, as Geier makes clear, that the 

State law rule of decision would pose a conflict with an 

articulable Federal policy. They haven't shown that 

here.

 I would like to go first to the question the 

Chief Justice asked my friend Mr. Buchanan about cost­

benefit analysis and the Federal judgment that at the 

time the imposition of a national uniform Federal 

minimum standard of Type 2 seatbelts wasn't warranted at 

these seating positions.

 Simply saying that, and I -- simply saying

that is not enough to establish that the Federal agency 

wished for the adoption of Type 2 seatbelts not to 

happen. As Mr. Buchanan said, every Federal 

rulemaker -- certainly every NHTSA safety standard 

adoption must include -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- I agree with 

you, it doesn't require. It doesn't support the 

inference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to 

happen, to be used.

 It does, in my hypothetical view, support 

the inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2 

seatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your 

brief at page 9, about the cost. And yet its worries 

about the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the 

position that State tort suits can go on for the absence 

of Type 2 seatbelts.

 MR. JAY: Well, of course the baseline is 

that State tort suits can always go forward. And in 

this case, the agency decided not to impose this 

nationwide mandate because of the tradeoff between costs 

and benefits.

 The benefits were significant. Everyone 

recognizes that. Everyone recognizes that Type 2 

seatbelts were better for -- better or at least 

equivalent for all categories of passengers, and I will

come back to that. But as far as the imposition of 

costs go, NHTSA decided that it was not worth it at that 

time for NHTSA to require that. That doesn't mean that 

NHTSA wanted to adopt the policy of freeing 

manufacturers of -- of any obligation to incur those 

costs, let alone that it wanted -- for example, if NHTSA 

had thought that it would harm safety for manufacturers 

to spend that money on Type 2 seatbelts instead of 

something else, it could have said that.

not preempted by '89?

did in their application of Geier?

 MR. JAY: The contrast between this case and 

Geier is that this case, like Geier, involves options, 

but it does not involve a Federal policy that the 

manufacturer must remain free to choose among those 

options as it sees fit. In Geier -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Jay -- I'm sorry.

 MR. JAY: I was going to say in Geier the 

manufacturer -- the agency concluded that it would 

disserve safety if automatic seatbelts and airbags were 

not both on the market. There has been no such 

determination here either in 1984 or at any other time.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true that for a 

period of 10 years the lower courts uniformly held that 

there wasn't any preemption here? And if that's the 

case, why didn't the Federal Government come forward at 

any point during that time and say that this is 

preempted?

 MR. JAY: Two responses, Justice Alito. 

First, the question presented here about Type 1 versus 

Type 2 seatbelts has only been by decided by a couple of 

federal courts of appeals, no states courts at last 

resort.

 Second, on the more general question, why 

doesn't NHTSA participate in these cases, NHTSA as a

matter of course does not usually participate in private 

party litigation under State common law, even when that 

litigation might touch on a State -- the interpretation 

of a Federal safety standard. And when the courts asked 

for NHTSA's views, NHTSA generally responds, as this 

Court asks for the government's views in this case and 

the government responded. And I think if the Court were 

to look back to the first brief in a string of briefs 

that the government has filed about these issues under 

this act, the brief in Wood versus General Motors filed 

in 1990, you could predict the position that the 

government would take in this case from that brief. The 

government said in that case that options don't preempt, 

merely because they are options. In most cases there 

will be no federal policy that presents a conflict.

 That case presented the case of the passive 

restraint phase-in and there it was the rare 

circumstance, as the Court later held in Geier, where 

there was frustration of the Federal policy, but that's 

because the Federal policy was to encourage variety, not 

just for its own sake, but because variety would serve 

safety. The roads would be measurably less safe if 

airbags were rushed into service.

 By contrast, in this case NHTSA would have 

been perfectly happy if every manufacturer had installed

Type 2 seatbelts the day after the 1989 rulemaking. So 

there was no conflict.

 As far as the child safety concern to which 

Justice Sotomayor alluded, it is referred to in the 1984 

denial of a request to impose the rule that later was 

imposed in 1989. The agency said that it had concerns 

about how particular child seats, which at the time were 

anchored with a form of tether. And it said that it 

thought the continued use of tethered car seats was 

something that it chose to encourage rather than 

anchoring them with Type 2 seats.

 The agency did not speak at all to whether 

Type 2 versus Type 1 was better for child safety and the 

agency then answered that in the 1989 rulemaking. So 

for adults Type 2 seatbelts are safer and they encourage 

seatbelt use because they are more popular. For 

infants, the agency specifically asked whether Type 2 

seatbelts could be as efficacious as Type 1 seatbelts in 

holding an infant car seat in place. It concluded that 

they could. That's set out at page 25 of our brief. 

And for toddlers, children who are too small to sit in a 

Type 2 seatbelt without assistance, the agency 

recommended booster seats. And if there was no booster 

seat the agency recommended that they not use the 

shoulder belt. Not that they detached the shoulder

belt. The agency indeed specifically rejected the idea 

that the shoulder belt should be removed at page 47990 

of the notice of proposed rulemaking.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the child were injured by 

a Type 2 belt, would a suit based on that be preempted?

 MR. JAY: If the child were injured by the 

Type 2 belt and the suit would be on the theory that a 

Type 1 belt should have been installed?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. JAY: At the time, no, that lawsuit 

would not have been preempted. Mr. Buchanan said that 

that would be harder case and I think he said that 

because the agency was specifically encouraging Type 2 

seatbelts, and in this case Respondents can't show 

anything suggesting that the agency was encouraging Type 

1 seatbelts. So it might be a harder case for that 

reason, but at that time there were two ways of 

complying with the Federal minimum standard and the 

savings clause provides that simply complying with the 

Federal standard does not preempt the operation of State 

common law.

 So we discussed the child safety, the 

alleged child safety rationale. I want to say a word 

about the idea that aisle seats were unsafe for the 

installation of these seatbelts. As Mr. Buchanan

mentioned, the agency specifically encouraged the 

installation of those seats where it was feasible. It 

was found to be feasible in 1991 by General Motors, 

which installed them. But another word about that, 

because Respondents have suggested that the chief 

counsel of NHTSA has said in 1994 in a letter something 

favorable to their position, and that letter is 

reproduced in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply 

brief.

 I urge the Court to look at the entire 

letter and not the sentence that was excerpted several 

times in Respondents' brief. Because what the agency 

said was that, in response to someone who complained 

that manufacturers were installing Type 2 seatbelts and 

they said, the complainant said that makes these 

minivans unsafe because people will be trapped in the 

back seat. The agency said it disagreed, that people 

could go under the safety belt, that they could detach 

the safety belt, that the safety benefits of a Type 2 

seatbelt outweighed any convenience concern about access 

to or egress from the rear seat.

 And I think that is perfectly consistent 

with the policy NHTSA has taken all along. Type 2 

seatbelts are safer, more effective and to be 

encouraged. When NHTSA decided not to mandate that

based on its understanding at the time of who used 

seatbelts, who used seatbelts in the rear center seats 

and what the -- how many fatalities and injuries would 

be prevented and whether the dollar cost would be 

justified by -- by the dollar equivalent of injuries and 

fatalities prevented, it wasn't making a preemptive 

judgment that Type 2 seatbelts, therefore, should not be 

installed. And for that reason there is no frustration 

of anything that NHTSA had in mind in the 1989 

rulemaking by allowing this tort suit to proceed as 

saved by the Savings Clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If we adopt your view, would 

Geier apply to any other regulation?

 MR. JAY: I don't think that Geier is good 

for that day only. I do think, as we said in Geier and 

the brief in Wood to which we alluded and so on, that 

Geier is the exceptional circumstance. That was, of 

course, an exceptionally difficult and unusual 

rulemaking. The phase-in concern in Geier one can 

easily envision being replicated in another safety 

standard issue where the agency were to conclude that 

it's going to impose a new requirement, but it does not 

want it rushed into service in the entire fleet right 

away and so it affirmatively discourages hurried 

installation. But that's not the case here because the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In 1984 and again in 1989 the agency 

specifically determined that the statutory safety and 

practicability objectives would be best served by giving 

manufacturers the flexibility to install a lap-only or 

lap/shoulder seatbelt.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a 

question? How is this case different from a situation 

where the agency looks at a request for a minimum 

standard, says: Require that a certain light be added 

to the lights in a car. The agency comes back and says, 

you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some 

cars, particularly sedans, the light is an added safety 

feature; in vans it may not be because of the size of 

vans. And so we are not going to require it. We are 

going to let manufacturers, depending on what design 

their car has, to choose between the two, so that we're 

not going to set a minimum standard for every one 

because there are too many different designs.

Despite that ruling, the manufacturer says it costs 

two pennies more to put this light in a sedan. I know 

the agency has said it's safer, but I don't want to do 

it. I don't have a van, I don't have any reason except 

the two pennies that I don't want to do it. Is that 

case preempted? Because you were just merely given the 

option?

 MR. GARRE: The typical case where a Federal 

motor vehicle safety standard establishes only a 

minimum, like the standard for braking performance or 

roof structure is not going to be preempted. Geier says 

that and we're not challenging that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is this different 

from the hypothetical where the agency said there could 

be an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who 

can design it without the obstruction should really do 

it. How is this, this case, different than the one 

hypothetical?

 MR. GARRE: This case is different because 

the agency specifically recognized in 1984 and 1989 that 

there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs 

between these two different design options and 

specifically gave manufacturers the option of installing 

one type of seatbelt or the other.

I can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of 

options. I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer. 

But in Geier which I think all of this could be just 

avoided.

 MR. GARRE: I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And the agency would simply 

say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just 

the minimum. It's so easy to say that, but I haven't 

found agencies saying it. I don't know why.

 MR. GARRE: We are not here -­

JUSTICE BREYER: We are forced to deal with 

the situation we have; and the situation we have in 

Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted 

a mix because of the unusual circumstances present 

there.

 MR. GARRE: What the agency -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You have to point to 

something here that shows that.

 MR. GARRE: What the agency wanted here was 

flexibility. It wanted flexibility because it 

recognized that there were safety tradeoffs and that the 

safety and practicability objectives were best served by 

leaving -­

ensure that a manufacturer imposes or thinks about 

safety and chooses the option that is safest.

 MR. GARRE: And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the inducement 

for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to 

put a seatbelt 2, when it can, without causing an added 

safety risk? If it's preempted, there is no inducement.

 MR. GARRE: The agency recognized here that 

Type 1 seatbelts, the lap-only seatbelts, themselves 

posed unique safety risks. It did so to children. If 

you look at the 1984 rulemaking, the agency couldn't 

have been more clear that we are not going to impose a 

Type 2 mandate for rear seats, because that's going to 

be harmful to children.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre -­

MR. GARRE: The agency preserved that very 

status quo in 1989. Petitioners recognize that in note 

1 of their brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, in -- in Geier 

I think it was Justice Breyer who called attention to 

the agency having informed the Court that if tort suits 

were to go on, at -- in -- in contradiction to the 

government's view that there should be both of these -­

that the safety standards that were set there, it would 

be disturbed. It would be impeded.

And the opinion said we assign weight to the 

Department of Transportation there, to their view that a 

tort suit there would stand as an obstacle to the 

accomplishment of the Federal safety standards. And if 

the Court gives weight to what the agency says in Geier, 

shouldn't it equally give weight here when NHTSA is 

telling us there is no conflict? It says its rule sets 

out what the statute calls for, a minimum standard.

 MR. GARRE: We don't think the Court should 

defer to the agency's position. We don't think the 

Court should adopt it. In Geier the Court found that 

the regulatory record was clear enough that it didn't 

have to rely on the agency position. So we think -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then the Court -­

what was the Court doing in saying that? Was it -- just 

wanted the agency to feel good?

 MR. GARRE: Well, I think what it said, and 

obviously Justice Breyer can correct me; he wrote the 

opinion for the Court -- was that it thought the 

regulatory record was clear enough, but it did 

ultimately say that it did agree with the agency, 

although it didn't make a difference to the Court's 

opinion.

as a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal

thing. Who is most likely to know what 40,000 pages of 

agency record actually mean and say? People in the 

agency. And the second most likely is the SG's office, 

because they will have to go tell them.

 MR. GARRE: But if -­

JUSTICE BREYER: So if the government 

continuously says, this is what the agency means and the 

agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the 

chances are they will come to a better, correct 

conclusion than I will with my law clerks -­

do. All right.

 MR. GARRE: Of course, from -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the practical. I'm 

sorry, but that is the practical idea that I think 

underlies what was said in Geier.

 MR. GARRE: And from the Wyeth case we know 

that the Court isn't always going to agree with the 

agency. Here I think what's different from Geier is 

that you have no contemporaneous interpretation of the 

agency. The agency is looking at a cold record going 

back 20 years, and it's not taking into account 

everything that's in the record.

dealing with 1989 primarily.

 MR. GARRE: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in 1989, I think -- we 

are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency 

said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are 

actually more effective. Now, we are reluctant to 

recommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because 

people might get caught in the spools. On the other 

hand, manufacturers may be able to work out that 

problem. Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to 

try to figure out a way around it.

 And the SG, looking at all that stuff, says, 

you see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put 

under another legal obligation to do it, because they'd 

have no objection to making the manufacturers do it, 

they are just not certain yet.

 MR. GARRE: And -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Now that's -- that's how I 

read what was said.

says and we think that -- that the SG is wrong.

the Petitioners want to mandate through this State law 

tort action. They didn't want to do it because they 

were concerned about child safety, they were concerned 

about aisle safety, they were concerned about 

practicability.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's always the 

case when the agency sets a minimum. By setting a 

minimum, it's basically saying we don't want to mandate 

more.

 MR. GARRE: That's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but you are not 

disagreeing that the statute by its term says that a 

minimum doesn't preempt State common law.

 MR. GARRE: The statute says that and from 

Geier we know that that doesn't resolve the preemption 

question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I'm still not sure 

why creating an option is any different than the 

minimum.

 MR. GARRE: Where the option is designed to 

protect flexibility that serves the statutory safety and 

practicability objectives -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the default is 

always that the manufacturers have an option. A minimum 

by definition gives manufacturers options.

MR. GARRE: It's not that. As a practical

Federal braking standards is fundamentally different 

than the kind of option is Geier and the kind of option 

here.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you haven't 

explained why.

 MR. GARRE: The reason why is because -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the minimum by its 

own definition gives freedom to the manufacturer to 

impose more if it chooses, or not, why does the option 

to tell a manufacturer, pick what you think is safest, 

why does that do more?

 MR. GARRE: Because the agency determined 

here that the flexibility was necessary to advance 

Federal safety and practicability objectives, and that 

that -- those objectives would be frustrated by a Type 2 

mandate. And flexibility -- this Court has 

recognized -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no such 

statement. I mean there was a statement we don't want 

to impose those costs, but we have the agency in

telling us, the statute says minimum, the statute says 

the common law isn't displaced, and we are telling the

Court that we think this is a situation where it is 

minimum and so the common law isn't displaced.

 Shouldn't we assume that the standard that 

the agency set, that as the agency said is a minimum 

standard unless the agency tells us that it should be 

preemptive of tort suits?

 MR. GARRE: Not when you have the kind of 

unique standard here. Granted, this is going to be the 

rare situation. But if you look at, for example, take 

child safety. The agency couldn't have been clearer in 

1984. Look at 49 Federal Register 15241, the final 

rule, that it was not going to mandate Type 2 seatbelts 

because they found that that would harm child safety. 

The agency specifically carried forward that rule in 

1989 for the rear inboard seats at issue in this case.

 Note 1 of Petitioner's reply brief said that 

the law is exactly the same in 1989 as to these seats as 

in 1984. It -- hasn't been preempted in 1984, 

notwithstanding what my friend said here from the 

government today; and if it was preempted in 1984 it has 

to be preempted in 1989.

 The tradeoffs here, we have talked about the 

lawsuit involving a -- a child who was -- who was 

restrained by a shoulder belt and harmed as a -- as a 

result of that belt, which is a concern that NHTSA has

recognized throughout its history.

 Under their position, the manufacturer could 

be sued for having a Type 2 belt by the child who was 

harmed or by the person in the back row that had 

difficulty getting out of the car in the event of an 

accident, just as they could be sued under Petitioner's 

theory for having a Type 1 belt. This -- the agency 

recognized, this was a unique situation where there were 

serious safety and practicability tradeoffs; they wanted 

to give the -- the manufacturers the flexibility to make 

this decision, and that flexibility served, the agency 

concluded, the Federal safety and -- and practicability 

objectives.

 If you look at this Court's decision -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm sorry, you still 

haven't responded to me. Manufacturers are always at 

risk for common law claims under this statute, because 

this statute expressly says they are. Every design 

choice a manufacturer makes under almost any situation 

where the common law is in effect puts it at risk that a 

jury will decide whether it did enough or not, under 

cost/ benefit analysis and technology.

 So I don't know why when the agency creates 

a minimum by choice or not, it should be implicitly 

preempted in -- from the application of State law.

MR. GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, there are 

hundreds of Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and 

I would agree with you for virtually all of them, except 

you have the rare standards -- and they are rare, like 

the one in Geier and like the one here -- where the 

agency quite obviously is doing something much 

different. It's expressly granting options and it's 

making clear in the record that the reason it is doing 

that is to serve Federal objectives that would be 

frustrated by the imposition of a particular rule.

 I think you have to look at this from the 

standpoint of the manufacturers who are told that they 

can manufacture this car with this design or that 

design, and you can go look at the Federal Register and 

see that the reason the agency is doing that is to 

advance safety and practicability objectives.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you tell -­

in response to Justice Sotomayor, how do you tell 

whether the agency is giving options or simply setting a 

minimum?

 MR. GARRE: Well, first you would look -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because a minimum, 

of course, always gives you options.

 MR. GARRE: In a very generalized sense. 

But we know from Geier that that doesn't resolve the

preemption question, because the same could have been 

said with respect to the rule in Geier.

 First you look at the rule, and you are just 

not going to find very many rules at all in the 

Federal -- in the Code of Federal Regulations that 

provide this kind of express option for equipment 

design. And then second, you go look and you -- and you 

see what the agency said about that in its final rules 

and the commentary accompanying the final rules.

 And here, if you look, not only would you 

find that the agency granted this flexibility to serve 

Federal safety and practicability objectives, you would 

find that it specifically rejected the very rule that 

Petitioners want to impose on State tort law, because it 

concluded that that rule would be counterproductive from 

the standpoint of safety and practicability. So there

created the compatibility issue that the agency 

recognized in the 1989 rulemaking and 1984.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is it?

 MR. GARRE: You have three rows in the car. 

In the front row, you've got the driver's side and the 

front row driver on the right-hand side. And then you 

have the middle row of seat, and then have you a back 

row.

 The middle row seat had a seat on the side, 

which was the outboard seat, a seat in the middle, which 

is where the descendent in this case was sitting, and 

then it had an aisle next to it. So it was a center 

seat -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: The aisle was not between 

the two seats?

 MR. GARRE: No, it was on the side of the 

vehicle. So it was the center seat in every practical 

sense, and therefore provided the same structural 

concerns that NHTSA recognized.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They wrote: "Of course, in 

those cases where manufacturers are able to design and 

install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent 

to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway's 

purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating 

positions, NHTSA encourages the manufacturers to do so."

 It doesn't sound like they are against a 

tort suit that would require you to do so, because, in

principle at least, all of those things should be taken 

into account.

 MR. GARRE: If I could make three points in 

response to that.

 First, as the language you just read 

indicates, it didn't require -- they didn't encourage at 

all costs. They encouraged where this specific safety 

concern could be addressed.

 Second, there is a world of difference 

between saying, we encourage manufacturers to do what's 

appropriate when they can practically do so, and a world 

in which a jury could have decided the day after -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Those arguments are what I 

think Justice Sotomayor was saying: It is a huge 

problem for manufacturers. It's called tort suits in 

different places and different juries and different 

States. But that is beyond the scope of this case.

 If the agency wants to displace those tort 

suits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose 

is something like you are saying and that they are 

intended to be displaced.

 MR. GARRE: We know from Geier that the 

agency doesn't have to make a formal statement to 

justify its intent.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have to. That's

why I am only making this comment, rather than in the 

form of this question that maybe I don't understand why 

they don't. It would make our job simpler.

 MR. GARRE: I think the record -- we 

certainly think the record here -- the agency really 

couldn't have been clearer in saying: We don't want the 

Type 2 mandate, the lap/shoulder mandate the Petitioners 

are trying to impose here. It said it unambiguously -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the government doesn't 

mean what it says the way you do -- we are being told 

here that far from encouraging Type 1, all along, the 

government says: Yes, Type 2 is a better seatbelt.

 MR. GARRE: Well, that's just not true. And 

with respect to the government, I don't think that the 

regulatory record supports that generalized statement 

that it was Type 2 at all -- at all costs. It was clear 

that the agency recognized -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, they did say that the 

reason that we are not making it mandatory is because of 

some cost benefit analysis. We don't think we should 

impose that as a minimum then.

 MR. GARRE: And gave the very unique kind of 

option here. The agency identified several costs with 

imposing a Type 2 mandate here. It recognized the 

unique safety concerns present when you are trying to

stretch a Type 2 belt across the aisle, which is going 

to block access, which is a clear safety concern. It 

identified the child safety concerns which were the 

basis for this very same option in 1984 and which were 

carried forward when the agency preserved the status quo 

for the rear inboard seats at issue here. It recognized 

other safety concerns, including obstructing the 

rearward vision of drivers when you install the Type 2 

belt in the center seat, because -­

JUSTICE ALITO: By 1989, hadn't the agency 

decided that the child safety concerns were no longer 

applicable?

 MR. GARRE: No, and the portion of the 

notice of proposed rulemaking that's cited refers to the 

no positive or negative effects. And that language, it 

does not lead to the conclusion that the government and 

Petitioner suggests, for a few reasons.

 First, the agency was referring only to rear 

outboard seats, not rear inboard seats, the kind of seat 

at issue. And that's important because NHTSA was 

telling parents: Put your children in the rear center 

seat, the inboard seat, because that -- that seat also 

was the seat that was most likely to have the lap belt, 

which is how NHTSA was telling child seat manufacturers 

to install their child seats, that you could install

them with a lap belt because it was more compatible with 

that.

 Second of all, that, the reference to the no 

positive or negative, was a tentative assessment. If 

you look in the Federal Register where that language 

appears -- it's on 53 Federal Register 47988 to 47989 -­

the agency said: This is a tentative assessment; we 

want your comments on this. Comments came back and the 

agency backed off from that and said, we have to examine 

this more.

 And secondly, that positive -- no positive 

or negative statement -- could only apply when child -­

when children were using the boosters which would help 

with the Type 2 shoulder belt so the belt wasn't going 

over the neck. But NHTSA knew at that time that very 

few, less than 1 percent, of parents were actually 

putting their kids in the booster seats. This was 

20 years ago. This was at a time when many children 

weren't in any car seats at all, no matter what NHTSA 

was saying.

 So they recognized that they were at real 

risk here, that children -- children with a Type 2 belt, 

just to be clear -- and NHTSA recognized this during the 

1989 rulemaking -- that belt is going to pose an obvious 

safety risk to children, because the shoulder belt that

is terrific for adults is going to take -- is going to 

create unique chest loads on children. And if the 

children is not on a booster, as virtually all were not, 

the belt is going to appear too high on the head -- on 

the neck or head, which is a safety problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't they prohibit 

it, if they were so sure about that? They allowed it, 

didn't they?

 MR. GARRE: Well, because this -- this was 

something, Justice Scalia, that the agency struggled 

with for almost a decade until it ultimately adopted the 

latch system, which resolved the compatibility issue of 

the lap belt versus the lap/shoulder belt for installing 

the child car seat. I mean, anyone who has tried to 

install a child car seat with a Type 2 belt, the 

lap/shoulder belt, knows how difficult it was. And the 

agency went back and forth on this and ultimately went 

in a completely different direction in 1999 and 

installed the lap system.

 And another thing that happened is over 

time, booster seats became more accepted. More parents 

were putting children in booster seats. And we solved 

that safety concern as well. But 20 years ago, at the 

time that this rule was adopted, the agency clearly 

appreciated the child safety risk. Again, in 1984 -­

 MR. GARRE: Because it would -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, as you say, the 

agency's rule only spoke of the situation at that time.

 MR. GARRE: This was an area that NHTSA was 

carefully monitoring. You had rulemakings in '84 and 

'89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving 

the safety issue, which was to expressly give 

manufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and 

practicability objectives. We haven't talked as much 

about the practicability objectives, but that is one of 

the statutory objectives of the act.

 Congress couldn't have been more clear on 

that and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more 

clear in the final notice, saying we are not going to 

require manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the 

rear center and aisle seats because that's just too 

costly. It's substantially expensive and the agency 

well knew based on its history that imposing this sort 

of overly costly safety measures that the Type 2 belt 

would have been for these seats at that time could have 

proved counterproductive with the agency's long-term 

safety mission.

this case at 52 Federal Register 22819 where it said 

that requiring these kind of overly costly measures 

created a lost opportunity to improve safety through 

other means.

 This is something that Congress gave the 

agency the expert judgment to make on these matters and 

the practicability objectives, which was just as much a 

statutory objective as a safety objective, would have 

been directly frustrated if, as could have happened 

under the Petitioners position in this case, on the very 

day after the agency passed this rule in 1989 and said 

we are not going to require rear inboard seats to have 

Type 2 lap/shoulder belts. A jury in California hit my 

client with a multimillion dollar punitive damages award 

because they did not install a Type 2 belt in that seat.

 That would have been directly contrary to 

the Federal objectives. It would have undermined the 

safety objectives that the agency recognized and it 

would have undermined the practicability objectives that 

the agency recognized, and then you have this world in 

which manufacturers like my client could be hit with 

multimillion dollar punitive damages award in one state 

for installing the Type 2 belt where a child was injured 

or someone was in the back seat and couldn't get out.

that there was one manufacturer, I think General Motors 

was mentioned, that was doing this Type 2 belt 

uniformly?

 MR. GARRE: I think that was later in time. 

It wasn't in 1989. Truthfully, if you look at late as 

2004 when the agency adopted so-called Anton's law rule, 

which eventually did mandate Type 2 belts in these kinds 

of seats. Even then the agency recognized that there 

were still technical feasibility concerns with 

installing the Type 2 belts in these seats.

 And just to be clear, the problem is, is 

finding the anchor to install the shoulder belt in rear 

center or aisle seats. You have got to anchor it 

somewhere. If you put it in the side wall you are going 

to have straps crossing across the aisle and obstructing 

access. If you put it in the roof you are going to have 

something -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that is not the 

issue here. The issue is whether it was feasible in 

this car, not whether or not it was not feasible 

elsewhere.

conclusively that it was not practical in 1989. Was it 

theoretically possible? Eventually manufacturers -­

the light in the sedan versus the van. It's letting the 

manufacturers decide what's the best choice.

 MR. GARRE: It gave them that flexibility, 

the agency determined in the 1994 chief counsel letter 

and we hope the Court does read it, makes it clear that 

the agency concluded that in this situation, and it's a 

rare situation, the manufacturer was in the best 

position to decide what was most appropriate for its 

vehicles. And, again, there is this flexibility 

objective.

 If you look at Fidelity Federal Savings & 

Loan v. A. la Cuesta, the decision cited on page 19 of 

our brief, you have this Court recognizing that a 

Federal law that gave flexibility where you have a state 

mandate that interferes with that flexibility, that is 

an actual conflict. Ultimately under Geier, this Court 

is looking for the existence of an actual conflict. We 

think a rule that says manufacturers, you are free to 

choose between this type of seatbelt and that type of 

seatbelt, and the reason we are giving you that 

flexibility is to advance federal safety and 

practicability objectives.

 We are not going to require you to put a 

lap/shoulder belt in there because that would frustrate 

those Federal objectives, the state law tort suit that

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BUCHANAN: First of all, I would like to 

clear up the child safety issue and I know Mr. Jay has 

addressed this to some extent, but let me be perfectly 

clear, there is absolutely nothing in the '87 to '89 

regulatory history that mentions anything about child 

safety being a consideration in the agency's decision 

not to mandate Type 2 shoulder belts for aisle and 

center seating positions.

 Specifically, Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. 

Garre about whether there is anything about the rear 

center seat being the safest place for children in that 

regulatory history. There is no mention whatsoever in 

that regulatory history about that issue, and the reason 

for that is this: The reason the rear center seat was 

considered safer for children had nothing to do with the 

type of seatbelt that was installed in that seat.

 It's considered safest for children because 

it's farthest from the potential point of impact in a

side impact collision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk about 

safety to children, are you also addressing the strap 

going across the aisle or the strap interfering with 

vision? I know that is not directly related to 

children, but it affects what type of belt might be the 

safest overall.

 MR. BUCHANAN: You are right, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in 

terms of a child safety concern. I would also, minor 

correction, the interference with rear vision was a 

comment that a commenter made in the regulatory history 

and the agency never really expressed an opinion one way 

or the other about whether that was a concern.

 I think what's really important here is that 

state tort law provides an incentive for manufacturers 

to exercise their options reasonably. And whether that 

option is to exceed a minimum standard that doesn't have 

options, or to choose between two different options that 

a minimum standard provides, state tort law ensures that 

manufacturers act reasonably. Our contention -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But state tort law 

doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the 

fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand 

from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that

Type 2 was not mandated, because of the overall costs. 

You have a jury with an injured plaintiff, they are not 

likely to weigh heavily the fact that this would cost 3 

extra cents per car fleet wide. I think that is the 

sort of thing NHTSA considers.

 MR. BUCHANAN: Mr. Chief Justice, under any 

state's tort law, I think cost and feasibility would be 

practical considerations for the jury under the jury 

instructions given. Those are liability issues, cost 

and feasibility in any tort system. And so that's a 

liability issue down the road.

 Here it's important to preserve state tort 

law because Congress said state tort law shall be 

preserved. And again, whether it's a choice between 

options, Type 1 or Type 2, or whether it's potential 

liability for not going beyond the minimum braking 

standard, either way manufacturers should be held 

accountable according to Congress in its enactment of 

the statute for the design choices they make. There is 

nothing different about a design standard option 1 

versus option 2.

 The final point I want to make before I sit 

down is that I think in some respects this case with 

regard to the question about whether Congress intended 

for the agency to be the exclusive authority for

weighing these types of considerations, in some respects 

Wyeth versus Levine is instructive here.

 Because I think that was the same argument 

that was made in Wyeth versus Levine, that a jury should 

not be allowed to second-guess the FDA's labeling issues 

and to allow the jury to do so would subvert the 

exclusive authority of a Federal agency, and the Court 

rejected that argument in Wyeth, and as the dissent 

pointed out in Wyeth, that statute did not even have a 

Savings Clause. And it did not define the labeling 

standards as minimum standards.

 Here we have a much more clear expression of 

congressional intent. They intended these to be minimum 

standards. They have a savings clause that says common 

law liability shall be preserved. Obviously Congress 

did not intend NHTSA to be the exclusive safety standard 

cook. They deliberately preserved state court juries as 

also providing for additional vehicle safety and for an 

incentive to manufacture safer vehicles.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
