3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next in Case 09-834, Kasten v. Saint-Gobain 

Performance Plastics Corporation. 

6  Mr. Kaster. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KASTER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. KASTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  When Kevin Kasten told his employer that the 

12 location of the time clocks was illegal and that if they 

13 were taken to the court they would lose, he filed any 

14 complaint within the meaning of the 215(a)(3) under the 

Fair Labor Standards Act, because filing includes an 

16 oral communication, because "any" means any, which 

17 includes formal or informal, written or unwritten 

18 communications. And the words in the statute were 

19 designed to have a broad construction under section 2 of 

the statute 202 and under Mitchell v. DeMario and the 

21 Tennessee Coal case. 

22  I would like to begin with the Tennessee 

23 Coal case, Tennessee Coal v. Muscoda. The Court 

24 interpreted "work" in a broad fashion to include the 

time in a mine when workers were moving from one place

1 to another, not actually engaged in physical labor. 

2  In interpreting work that way, the Court 

3 said that the act is not to be interpreted in a narrow, 

4 grudging fashion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this 

6 example. Suppose a company has an established policy 

7 that if you want to make a complaint, there's a 

8 particular supervisor you should go to. And let's say 

9 they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can 

make it orally. 

11  Now, there's -- something's going on in the 

12 workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by, 

13 maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt, 

14 and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is 

walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder 

16 and says the company is violating the Fair Labor 

17 Standards Act because of the placement of a clock. You 

18 said that filing has no formality requirement. Would 

19 that be the filing of a complaint?

 MR. KASTER: I think it would, Your Honor. 

21 I don't think that the fact that the employer has a 

22 policy that says you do it on Tuesday morning would 

23 control what the statute says one way or the other, so I 

24 think it would constitute a filing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you mean that if the

1 Government says you've got to file a complaint with us 

2 by either calling us or submitting something in writing, 

3 and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government 

4 employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company 

is violating the law. That that's enough? 

6  MR. KASTER: I don't -- you know, I don't 

7 believe that that's -- in the context of a non-work 

8 environment, Your Honor, I would note that, I don't know 

9 exactly the answer to the Court's question, to be 

honest. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The reason I'm asking 

12 that question is related to Justice Alito's question, 

13 which is, what does filing a complaint mean? Does it 

14 have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the 

person that you are reporting this to? 

16  MR. KASTER: Filing means directing it to 

17 somebody who can do something about it. And it doesn't 

18 necessarily have to be. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, at a cocktail 

party that employee may be there on personal time, but 

21 when he goes back to work the next morning he could do 

22 something. Is that enough? 

23  MR. KASTER: Well, it may be. If it's 

24 directed towards the responsible party, then it would be 

filing a complaint. So it could occur outside of

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are doing is 

3 he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way 

4 that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in 

writing. We are now forcing the Government to adopt an 

6 oral procedure even if it chose not to? Even if it 

7 thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera, 

8 et cetera? 

9  MR. KASTER: If the person is directing the 

complaint to the Government and communicates that to the 

11 responsible party who can do something about it, I think 

12 that they are filing a complaint, Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: It's one thing to say that 

14 filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is 

written, although that's usually what the word means, 

16 isn't it? 

17  MR. KASTER: It can often mean a written 

18 communication. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Are you filing your comments 

right now? 

21  MR. KASTER: I think I am, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: You are? Really? 

23  MR. KASTER: I am directing them to the 

24 Court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's the ordinary usage of

1 the word. But to say that it includes no degree of 

2 formality, that's your argument? 

3  MR. KASTER: Well, Your Honor, I would say 

4 there are no formal requirements for the filing.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's the law and the 

6 employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this 

7 was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA 

8 complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what 

9 complaint? We have no record of any such complaint and 

the employee says, oh, yes, I said it orally to a 

11 supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there 

12 and he's going to corroborate this. So now we have a 

13 trial about whether a complaint was filed? 

14  MR. KASTER: You might have a trial, Your 

Honor, depending on the circumstances. There might be 

16 one. The thing is that that's no different from any 

17 other retaliation case. They are trying to establish an 

18 exception to the rule that retaliation occurs in verbal 

19 forms. The communication, the underlying protective 

conduct occurs in verbal forms all the time. They are 

21 trying to establish the exception here. And I would 

22 note that even under the National Labor Relations Act in 

23 Scrivener, filing charges includes the verbal 

24 communications that are antecedents, the predicates to 

filing a charge.

2  MR. KASTER: With the responsible party who 

3 can do something about it. I would note also, Your 

4 Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­

6  MR. KASTER: -- that Kevin Kasten doesn't 

7 have an office. In terms of the formality of 

8 communication, there is discussion about the fact that 

9 this occurred in a hallway outside of the place where 

they walked in and out of the factory. He doesn't have 

11 an office. That's where he communicates with people. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you feel the need to 

13 go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal 

14 oral failing -- filing? They use language like, at the 

initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is 

16 confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the 

17 dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or 

18 supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss, 

19 and hopefully to resolve a problem.

 Now that's a formal kind of relationship. 

21 It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done 

22 orally. And there is a tradition as to how that works. 

23 But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well 

24 beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps 

not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder

1 would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally 

2 be sufficient in the grievance process. 

3  MR. KASTER: The grievance process, Your 

4 Honor, a grievance process is a formal process, and so I 

wouldn't compare the average workplace -­

6  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I think 

7 that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral 

8 filings. What happens then? What am I supposed to do 

9 in your case?

 MR. KASTER: Your Honor, in the general 

11 proposition we would be accepting of the Scrivener rule 

12 that the Court adopted in the '70s, that is that the 

13 filing of a charge includes those things that happened 

14 orally prior to and around the time of the filing of the 

charge. That's what this is about. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, we are talking about a 

17 filing. In the grievance process -- I don't want to 

18 repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief 

19 that filing takes place without writing, provided that 

there are these other safeguards which are described. 

21  Now, I want to know in your opinion, is 

22 there a reason for not importing that into this system? 

23 I take it you win the case -- or maybe you lose it, I 

24 don't know how it works on the fact. I don't know what 

the filing was.

1  MR. KASTER: In terms of the formality of 

2 requirements, the Court may adopt formal requirements. 

3 The employer certainly did, Mr. Kasten followed those. 

4 What I am looking at are the words of the statute that 

cover normally -­

6  JUSTICE BREYER: There is a word "filing" in 

7 the AFL-CIO statute as well. So I am looking for a way 

8 of interpreting the one in light of the other. Do you 

9 favor that? Are you against that? If so, why or why 

not? 

11  MR. KASTER: In terms of the procedure that 

12 they adopt, Your Honor, that may be an acceptable 

13 procedure. The thing that I am looking at is the 

14 statutory language in the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there wasn't -- he 

16 didn't invoke the grievance procedure. 

17  MR. KASTEN: He didn't -­

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case, he didn't 

19 invoke the grievance procedure.

 MR. KASTER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would keep you 

22 out, if that were the test, that you have to formally 

23 invoke the grievance procedure. But we are told that 

24 every other time the word "file" is used in this Act, 

Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing. And

1 so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the 

2 standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue. 

3  MR. KASTER: I don't think I am doing that, 

4 Your Honor, with all due respect.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there another 

6 provision where the word file is used to mean something 

7 other than a writing. 

8  MR. KASTER: It means, according to the 

9 first enforcement action back in 1961, it means submit 

or lodge, Your Honor. I would note that the defendant's 

11 own policies use it to describe a verbal communication 

12 by protecting against retaliation for somebody who has 

13 filed a complaint for sexual harassment. They have used 

14 it in a manner that -- as an example to obviously 

include both verbal and written communications. 

16  I would note there was a procedure in place 

17 here, Your Honor, that was the policy manual. This -­

18 there was no grievance procedure for Mr. Kasten. He did 

19 not have a -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's the 

21 problem. I mean, you can talk about a grievance 

22 procedure. I suppose there's always one in -- in 

23 companies that -- that are unionized, but an awful lot 

24 of companies aren't.

1 to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private 

2 filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to 

3 the filing of a complaint with the government. And 

4 that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and 

normally I would not be disposed to consider it. 

6  My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the 

7 question of whether filing means filing only in writing 

8 or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that 

9 other question. That is to say, if indeed the complaint 

has to be quote, "filed" with the government, I'm 

11 inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to 

12 procedures established by the agency which permit an 

13 oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would 

14 be okay.

 But my goodness, if it applies to private 

16 employers as well including employers that have no 

17 grievance procedures, including employers who have 

18 employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very 

19 disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an 

oral complaint in -- in that context. 

21  MR. KASTER: Your Honor, I'm just looking at 

22 the statutory language -- file "any complaint." It's 

23 important -- the word "any" has a particular meaning. I 

24 would not that if -­

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are filing your 

argument right now. Now come on, people don't talk like 

6 that. 

7  MR. KASTEN: I think -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that -- that is 

9 absurd. You are not filing an argument right now. 

Nobody uses the language that way. 

11  MR. KASTER: If I submit or lodge, that is 

12 the -- and it's directed at a particular -- I have to be 

13 asserting a statutory right.

16  MR. KASTEN: I am not asserting -­

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to go back to 

18 the question Justice Scalia filed just earlier. 

19  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what would you say 

21 about his point that it seems to me had substantial 

22 merit? It - it's really our determination -- our 

23 interpretation of what filing means might well depend on 

24 whether filing in -- or a complaint includes 

intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee

1 and so forth; and I recognize this -- this argument 

2 comes up late. Has it been addressed in any of the 

3 other circuits? 

4  MR. KASTER: Yes, Your Honor. There has 

been -- a number of the circuits have interpreted this 

6 statute and included -- the Ninth Circuit, the First 

7 Circuit, the Tenth Circuit have all -­

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All have said that 

9 intracompany complaints -­

MR. KASTER: Intracompany complaints; that 

11 is true as well in the Sixth Circuit. And it's easier 

12 to talk about the cases where that hasn't been true -­

13 in Memphis Barbecue, the Fourth Circuit; in Genesee 

14 Hospital, the Second Circuit. Memphis --the Memphis 

Barbecue case really addresses the testimonial clause. 

16  Genesee Hospital is the only case in the 

17 Second Circuit where they have held that all complaints 

18 need to go to the Department of Labor. The one thing I 

19 would say about that particular argument, Your Honor. 

Is it makes superfluous instituted proceeding. It makes 

21 superfluous instituted proceeding which -- or cause to 

22 be instituted. 

23  If you file a complaint -- it - then -- with 

24 the Department of Labor, their argument is, and I think 

it's true, that you institute a proceeding. So the

1 statute would be redundant, and "file any complaint" 

2 would cover a null set. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that's true. 

4 You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor 

Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious 

6 enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding. I 

7 mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to 

8 begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else. 

9 But you can file a complaint orally without -- without 

doing that, it seems to me. 

11  MR. KASTER: Well, Your Honor, if you have 

12 made the phone call and started the process I think you 

13 have instituted a proceeding. Now whether it gets -- at 

14 what stage of formality it gets to, I'm not sure, Your 

Honor, but I think you have begun the process of 

16 instituting a proceeding or causing it to be instituted. 

17 That's one. The other thing I -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if it's never 

19 instituted. Not if it's never instituted. If no 

proceeding is ever instituted, you can hardly be accused 

21 of having caused a proceeding to be instituted.

4  That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's 

filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing

 AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER 

16  MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

17 please the Court: 

18  A number of the Court's questions are 

19 focusing on some of the practical difficulties here. 

The Government wants to start by pointing out there are 

21 a number of statutes, 20 or more, that have similar 

22 anti-retaliation provisions. Most of those statutes 

23 cover all the complaints, either because Congress has 

24 said so in administering, agencies have said so or the 

courts have said so. And the kind of practical 

16

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 difficulties that the court is raising have not proven 

2 unworkable under any statutory schemes. 

3  The Respondent can't point to a single other 

4 statute addressing these kinds -- this labor context 

that has been narrowed -- excuse me -- to cover only 

6 oral complaints. What we're -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: This is one of the oldest, 

8 though, isn't it. 

9  MR. WALL: Yes. I mean, it -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it the very oldest? It 

11 may well be the very oldest. You are talking about a 

12 really old fogey Congress that -- that passed this 

13 thing. 

14  MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it's not the 

older. It was model on the NLRA, which is even older. 

16 For instance, the NLRB has found that if, you know, 

17 employees are complaining to each other, that they can't 

18 be discharged under the NLRA's anti-retaliation 

19 provision, or if an employee orally says to his 

employer, I'm about to go to the Board and tell them you 

21 are doing something unlawful, the Board has said you 

22 can't be discharged. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the 

24 language in those statutes? All those statutes use the 

language "file a complaint"? 

17

1  MR. WALL: The language in the NLRA is "file 

2 charges" or "give testimony." So, instead of filing a 

3 complaint, it says "file charges." But the language in 

4 many of these statutes, and they are cited in all of the 

briefs, is extremely similar. They refer to filing 

6 complaints or charges, instituting proceedings. As you 

7 pointed -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- you -- are you 

9 urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's 

enough? I thought the whole idea is to give the 

11 employer notice that something is amiss. So, how would 

12 telling a coworker serve that purpose? 

13  MR. WALL: It wouldn't under this particular 

14 statute, Justice Ginsburg. I didn't mean to imply under 

the FLSA. The FLSA anti-retaliation provision does not 

16 have an opposing any practice clause in the way that 

17 some civil rights statutes do like Title VII. So, it 

18 does require submission of a complaint to an employer, 

19 but that could take many forms.

 And as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, in 

21 this particular context, filing something orally makes 

22 perfect sense. We are not -- we are talking about the 

23 kinds of industries, truck drivers, coal miners and 

24 migrant workers where that's a perfectly normal use of 

speech. Oral communication -­

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Fine. It's a 

2 perfectly normal use of speech, I accept that. But what 

3 is it that would surround this use of speech on a 

4 particular occasion with enough formality that we know 

it isn't something that could pass unnoticed and bring 

6 in a whole lot of things like the cocktail party 

7 example, et cetera? 

8  I noticed there was a paragraph in the 

9 AFL-CIO -- that's why I brought it up. Is that the 

right standard? What we say here may take effect or 

11 have influence, so -- so I want to say it correctly. 

12 What kinds of oral complaints count as filing a 

13 complaint? 

14  MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I don't think the 

Government has any objection to that standard. Although 

16 I do think -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: But I would like more than 

18 that. The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so 

19 I would like the Government's assistance on what words 

to write to be able to get this right so it will not be 

21 too formal, it will not be too informal, it will do the 

22 job. 

23  MR. WALL: I -- I think the kind of indicia 

24 or formality you are talking about are signs that the 

employer has submitted to his employer an assertion of

2 two things that the lower courts have consistently 

3 looked to. And I think those indicia of formality are a 

4 good sign that the employer has, but they are not the 

only sign.

8 promulgates and I hand it off to my supervisor -­

9  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, fill in 

this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral 

11 complaint sufficient elements of formality such that -­

12  MR. WALL: That the employer has -- the 

13 employee has indicated to his employer, someone in 

14 supervisory authority, that he is asserting statutory 

rights under the FLSA. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he just says 

17 to the employer, "You know, I think we ought to have a 

18 little more time to put on our gear," is that an 

19 assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA?

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's 

21 a difficult question. I don't think it is presented 

22 here, because this isn't a content case.

1 particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under 

2 the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed, 

3 unlike the situation where you had have a government 

4 agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint; 

and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the 

6 employer to know that he's being charged with a 

7 violation of the FLSA. 

8  MR. WALL: But that question comes up in 

9 every case, whether the complaint is written or oral to 

the Government or an employer. If I write down -­

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's 

12 written -- if it's written, you have got a document that 

13 people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB 

14 or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes, 

this is a -- an assertion of a violation.

17 promulgated by my employer I don't like where the time 

18 clocks are or I think the time -­

19  JUSTICE BREYER: But it's on a form. So we 

have got that -- that helps a lot. Also an employer 

21 could have a notice. Notice, if you really are upset 

22 because you think there is a violation going here, go to

All right. What kind of thing, if you can help, maybe 

6 you can't -- which is dangerous, but then we just try to

 MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I'm sorry if -­

11 if -- if it the formulation I have given you is not 

12 helpful, but in -- in these statutes where either by 

13 expressed language or regulation, so for instance, the 

14 Surface Transportation Assistance Act, and ADA or OSHA, 

the -- the language varies from regulation to 

16 regulation. In some of them it says lodge complaints, 

17 and some of them it says make a complaint. But what the 

18 courts have -­

because in about 2 minutes you are going to hear, I

3  JUSTICE ALITO: It would really be helpful 

4 if you could just give us the rule that you think should 

apply. Is the rule -- your -- your -- Mr. Kaster's 

6 argument seems to be anything goes, any oral 

7 communication to a supervisor goes. 

8  MR. WALL: I think -­

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Let me go back to the 

example I started out with. A worker has been hurt, a 

11 supervisor is going to attend to the hurt worker, and an 

12 employee says, the company is violating the FLSA. And 

13 the supervisor says, don't tell me, and don't tell me 

14 about it now. I'm doing something else. That's enough?

 MR. WALL: I think the test, Justice Alito, 

16 is whether the employee has submitted a complaint to his 

17 employer that has put the employer on notice that that 

18 employee is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA, 

19 claiming that he is legally entitled to something he is 

not receiving. 

21  If the supervisor walks in the next morning 

22 and says to his boss, yesterday morning while I was 

23 attending to the plant accident, Joe told me that the 

24 time clocks are in the wrong place. He's about to file.

there. 

6  MR. WALL: Again -­

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the boss supposed 

8 to know, well, he is asserting statutory rights under 

9 the FLSA?

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I think there 

11 probably not. The employee -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would not be 

13 filing a complaint? 

14  MR. WALL: I mean, I think as a content 

case, which it is not, it's unlikely that that is. 

16 Saying that you don't like something or you think it is 

17 unsafe is not actually saying you have are asserting a 

18 right to have it differently. But those are content 

19 cases. And here there is no question the Petitioner 

asserted his statutory rights to a number of different 

21 people at the company. 

22  What Respondent is saying is he didn't do it 

23 the right way. If he had done exactly what he did in 

24 exactly the same words, but he had done it some other 

way, then it would be covered. So, this is a form case.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did he do? What did 

2 he do specifically? I mean, you are saying that -- that 

3 the employer has to know that he is making a complaint 

4 under the Act. So what -- and you said here are the 

facts that was clear that he did. 

6  MR. WALL: If you credit his allegations, 

7 which you have to at this point, because the district 

8 court granted summary judgment on a legal ground, what 

9 Petitioner says he did is he went to his supervisor. He 

said the time clocks are in the wrong place. We are not 

11 getting paid for all of our time. And then he went up 

12 the ladder to human resources personnel at the company, 

13 and he said exactly the same thing, and he said I 

14 thinking about challenging you on it in court, and if I 

challenge you, you will lose. 

16  Now, whatever the test is, that clearly 

17 meets the bar for asserting statutory rights under the 

18 FLSA. And I think what is important to not is that this 

19 Court has consistently, from the 1940s on, both with 

respect to the FLSA and anti-retaliation provisions more 

21 generally in Title VII and other statutes, it has always 

22 given them a broader reading to effectuate their 

23 purposes.

is just a factual. Were you saying that the employee

1 has to know that he is submitting a claim of statutory 

2 violation or the employer? 

3  MR. WALL: I think what the lower courts 

4 have said, and I think this makes sense, is that the 

question of whether a reasonable, objective person would 

6 have understood the employee to have submitted a claim 

7 complaint. So if the employee does everything he can to 

8 put the employer on notice, it's not a defense for the 

9 employer to say that subjectively he didn't understand 

it to be a complaint.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is it inherently

12  MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it is 

13 necessarily any worse in this particular context. I do

at this problem, which as Justice Scalia pointed out was 

16 the 1938 Congress, and what that Congress was saying is

1 to file any complaint, which as it would have been 

2 understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file 

3 a complaint that usually entails some notion of 

4 formality and when you put it in the context of a 

specific provision where it is not only filing a 

6 complaint, but institute any proceeding, caused any 

7 proceeding to be instituted, justify any proceeding. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What grievance -- would 

9 the bringing of a grievance, the example that 

Justice Breyer suggested, an employee goes to his union 

11 and says, they are violating the statute. Let's grieve 

12 it. And according to the proceedings established by the 

13 employer, they meet with the employer, and the employee 

14 does everything in the grievance and they now fire that 

employee. Under your reading, that's not instituting a 

16 proceeding? 

17  MR. PHILLIPS: No, because a proceeding is 

18 understood and it's used consistently in the FLSA as an 

19 official action by a government agency. So no, I don't 

believe that is instituting a proceeding. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then we have to address 

22 your second question, not the first. You are saying the 

23 oral wouldn't work in there?

in that particular context.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would it work if they 

2 instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding 

3 required itself to start orally? 

4  MR. PHILLIPS: I don't -- the truth is, if 

the employer envisions in its mind that it is 

6 instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding 

7 within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938. It 

8 had in mind an official action by a government agency. 

9 And no private employer is ever going to institute a 

proceeding within the meaning of that particular scheme. 

11  You know, it's extremely important in the 

12 context of this particular statute, and the one thing I 

13 should have answered, Justice Sotomayor, to your 

14 question is, what's different about this statute than 

any other? This statute carries a criminal penalty with 

16 it. And no other retaliation statute except for one -­

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a protection 

18 built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability 

19 only if it's willful. And on the civil side, the civil 

liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you 

21 certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a 

22 violation. 

23  MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the reality is 

24 that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court 

would not construe this statute broadly in order to

1 expose people to potential criminal liabilities. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't any retaliatory 

3 action be willful? I mean, to say it's in retaliation 

4 means you are firing this person because of the 

complaint. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is whether 

7 the violation is willful. The willful qualification in 

8 the criminal context is are you willfully denying your 

9 workers the wages and hours the statute requires?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing to do with 

12 retaliation. 

13  MR. PHILLIPS: No, I -- well, it does have 

14 something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg, 

it seems to me it's all of a piece, though. Because the 

16 reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness 

17 standard even which extends to conscious disregard 

18 beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be 

19 comfortable with that is if you look at the way the 

statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision 

21 itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that 

22 are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of 

23 a proceeding. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, how common 

is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section

2  MR. PHILLIPS: I don't believe -- I mean, 

3 it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a 

4 particularly, I don't think it's a large number of 

proceedings. But it seems to me, though, in trying to 

6 understand what the Congress of 1938 would have done and 

7 trying to understand why it would have approached this 

8 in a narrow way, and why this provision is aimed not 

9 generally to protect workers, but is aimed really to 

make sure that information gets to the Federal 

11 Government. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the whole 

13 idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I 

14 would like you to address particularly the amici's 

point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many 

16 were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many 

17 were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, 

18 for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have 

19 meant that all complaints are okay?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Let me start by saying, first 

21 of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee 

22 protective purpose, it's still important to recognize 

23 that the retaliation provision we are talking about here 

24 specifically did not provide a cause of action, a 

private cause of action until 1977. So that when

1 Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo 

2 about allowing the employees to show up in court and to 

3 assert their rights. This is not part of that 

4 expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of 

this legislation. 

6  And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with 

7 respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in 

8 mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is 

9 not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate 

employees or not, but what language did Congress use in 

11 trying to formulate the specific provision that gives 

12 rise to the protections against retaliation. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your case would be a lot 

14 easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say, 

number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with 

16 the Government. And number two, you say, it also only 

17 applies to written complaints to the Government. I 

18 mean, why don't you -­

19  MR. PHILLIPS: I will take the former 

argument, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you give a break 

22 to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with 

23 the Government?

is they will be able to file oral complaints with the

1 Government because, the only thing that is left open is 

2 the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where 

3 you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted 

4 in those circumstances. And it seems to me, clearly, in 

the Federal Government's authority to simply adopt a 

6 rule that says any time anybody makes an oral complaint 

7 to us we will institute a proceeding. And if the agency 

8 adopted that view, I don't think there is anything we 

9 could do about it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it says we won't 

11 necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard 

12 it as a complaint? 

13  MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I mean, my own view is 

14 the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case, 

I will concede that, Justice Scalia. My own view is 

16 that when you talking about file a complaint, that is 

17 just not the way Congress ordinarily thinks about file a 

18 complaint. File always has in mind written -- I'm 

19 sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Scalia's 

21 hypothetical, unless I am misremembering, I think, is 

22 very common. For example, the EEOC, people often file 

23 complaints and then the EEOC considers whether it's 

24 going to institute a proceeding or not.

1 quarrelling with that. I mean, I understand that. And 

2 the truth is, you know, I think for another day the 

3 issue will arise and the Court can decide whether or not 

4 a mere oral complaint to a government agency is 

sufficient to file a complaint within the meaning of 

6 this statute. 

7  I do think it is fundamentally important for 

8 this Court to decide the underlying question of whether 

9 oral complaints are sufficient only in the context in 

the first instance of deciding whether or not it has to 

11 go to a government agency as opposed to any kind of 

12 private or intracorporate activity. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work with 

14 respect to the more recent statutes? Title VII, The Age 

Discrimination Act, Disabilities Act? 

16  MR. PHILLIPS: In terms of retaliation, 

17 Justice Ginsburg? 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. If you have not 

19 filed anything with the Government, but you have to your 

supervisor opposed a practice. 

21  MR. PHILLIPS: No, the vast majority of 

22 those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a 

23 practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of 

24 intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point 

there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's

1 intent is and how far it got up the ladder -­

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- so in those 

3 cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate 

4 complaints count as opposing any practice. Has there 

been any huge problems about people saying, oh, I made 

6 an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said 

7 I never heard of it? 

8  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I suspect that issue 

9 comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's 

a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would 

11 rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated; 

12 and language that is very expansive in protecting 

13 employees from retaliation. And while I -- I may chafe 

14 at that at times as a managing partner of a law firm, I 

recognize that that is the judgment that Congress made. 

16  Here we are talking about a Congress that 

17 made a very different judgment about how it wanted to 

18 protect retaliation. And it was a judgment that was 

19 made, it seems to me, very much in the context of 1938. 

Justice Sotomayor, you are very right; they were not 

21 sure they even had constitutional authority to be 

22 adopting this approach; and they are attaching to it 

23 criminal sanctions, and they are not providing a private 

24 right of action; and in that context it seems to me that 

this Court should comfortably say that this is a much

11 reasonable to think that they would have included in

sanctions on somebody, you're going to say we are not

2 where the Court has said, where these minor matters of 

3 how you work out the actual application of the word are

the context of reasonable view. 

6  MR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Breyer, that 

7 would strike me as a more persuasive argument if 

8 Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of 

9 Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to 

specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and 

11 does not have a similar provision in connection with 

12 section 215(a).

14 be done through formal rules. There -- there are many, 

many ways of agencies determining practice.

17 decisionmaking, but we don't have that either. All we 

18 have here are certain enforcement actions that are being 

19 brought by the agency and indeed, if you look at the 

enforcement actions, they all ultimately tie to some 

21 official action by some government entity. None of the

13 there anything in the legislative history of the statute

16 back to the legislative history there is a colloquy 

17 between the two Senators, and I recognize some members 

18 of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know, 

19 in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints, 

and it seems to me malicious in that context is talking 

21 about where you have essentially defamed your employer

3  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think if you are 

4 going back and trying to figure out what the Congress of 

1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at 

6 the language chosen and the company that that language 

7 keeps. And when you take about filing a complaint and 

8 you file a -- you talk about instituting a proceeding or 

9 causing a proceeding to be instituted, or testifying at 

a proceeding that's formal, or belonging to a -- to a

a retaliation claim.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Since the Federal Arbitration

9  MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, it would have been back 

around the same period of time, in the 1930s. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that when 

12 Congress wrote or caused to be instituted any proceeding 

13 under or related to this chapter, that they intended to 

14 exclude that proceeding and intended to exclude people 

who testified in that proceeding about a violation of

1 words "proceedings related to this chapter," as limited 

2 only to Government proceedings? 

3  MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, that -- in the 

4 brief we identified a number of places where Congress 

uses the word "proceedings," and every place where they 

6 use the word "proceedings" they have in mind an official 

7 Government activity. And so I think it is the most 

8 reasonable -- logical way to read this particular 

9 language as incorporating that.

 Of course, even if that were true, even if 

11 you would preserve that, that still wouldn't be a basis 

12 for going forward with this case, because there was no 

13 proceeding that was instituted pursuant to the informal 

14 actions that were taken.

1 because of the fact that the way this is all set up is 

2 the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair 

3 Labor Standards Act. 

4  And, Justice Ginsburg, to your question 

about the subsequent legislation that has all been 

6 enacted, it seems to me in a lot of ways that that 

7 reinforces the core interpretive approach that I have 

8 taken in this case, because if it were absolutely clear 

9 that the language about filing a complaint and 

instituting a proceeding were as broad as -- certainly 

11 as the Petitioner proposes in this case, where any kind 

12 of oral grumbling is sufficient, Congress never would 

13 have needed to deviate from that template and all the 

14 legislation that came afterwards.

 And there are tons of statutes that say: 

16 File a complaint, institute a proceeding, and otherwise 

17 oppose. And there would have been no reason for 

18 Congress to do that if this language would have 

19 accomplished precisely the same thing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's more of a question 

21 for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware 

22 of any cases in any other jurisdictions where there have 

23 been proceedings, actions for retaliation, based on 

24 complaints to third parties, like complaining to the 

press?

2 cases, Your Honor. I mean, I doubt -- it probably 

3 wouldn't come up so much in the Fair Labor Standards Act 

4 process. And that's the problem: This has got a fairly 

narrow sweep to it. 

6  Obviously, wage and hours is not a 

7 significant activity, but it doesn't tend to generate 

8 the same kind of intensity that you might expect out of 

9 Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or 

some of the other provisions. 

11  If there are no further questions, Your

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me you are 

16 saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the 

17 Government. 

18  Isn't -- in the work setting that's being 

19 regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the 

employee to complain first to the employer rather than 

21 making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a 

22 Government agency? 

23  MR. PHILLIPS: Intuitively, I don't disagree 

24 with that, Justice Ginsburg, but we have to go, again: 

What was the purpose of this particular statute? And

1 this statute was not intended as a protection to the 

2 employer or to the employee -- or to the employer. This 

3 was a provision that was designed to give information to 

4 the Federal Government.

 And we know that because there's no private 

6 right of action to the employee that it is enforceable 

7 as a criminal sanction. And if you go back to the 

8 precursors of the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and 

9 somebody asked; this was the first one. I gathered 

there was a third one. There was the Railway Labor Act, 

11 the NLRA, and then there was this particular provision. 

12  But if you go back to these precursors, you 

13 see that it's, again, a very narrow approach that was 

14 taken under those statutes as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you are an 

16 employee of the Treasury Department and there is an oral 

17 complaint to your superior? Is that filing a complaint 

18 with the Government? 

19  MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, part of it depends on 

whether the Fair Labor Standards Act applies to Federal 

21 employees. There is a whole separate regime that deals 

22 with Federal employees. And I can't -- I'm not 

23 100 percent sure whether this provision applies under 

24 those circumstances.

7 counsel wants to suggest that all of this is a throwback

1 provisions, Your Honor. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a big difference. 

3  MR. KASTER: Well, I respectfully disagree, 

4 Your Honor.

 I also suggest that what we are talking 

6 about in the very first case that this Court dealt with 

7 after the act was passed were coal miners. Nobody is 

8 taking -- I don't think it would be plausible to suggest 

9 that Congress thought that coal miners -- coal miners, 

factory workers, line workers -- they don't write memos. 

11 With all due respect, Your Honor, lawyers write memos. 

12 People who this act was intended to cover, the poorest 

13 and the least educated people in the country. 

14  That's why under Mitchell v. DeMario and 

that's why under Tennessee Coal the Court has taken the 

16 position that this deserves, has to have, a broad 

17 interpretation. Employees are the engine that actually 

18 enforces this act. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That goes to your 

adversary's first argument or second argument where he 

21 says when this act was passed for all of those people, 

22 they would never have thought of going to their employer 

23 because the work ethos at the time was that those 

24 employees couldn't complain to their employers. They 

would always naturally go to the Government.

1  How do you answer that? How do you disprove 

2 that point: That historically at the time this was 

3 passed in 1938, that there was a number of those 

4 employees who as a regular course of their business, 

filed complaints with their employers as opposed to the 

6 Government? 

7  MR. KASTER: Any complaints, Your Honor. 

8 Filed charges was the -- was the previous language in 

9 the National Labor Relations Act. Congress adopted a 

different phrase here, "any" -- "filed any complaint" -­

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. 

12  MR. KASTER: "Filed any complaint." In 

13 Rosenwasser, this Court said that the criminal liability 

14 concerns of the employer were addressed by the word 

"any." In other words, when they suggested under the 

16 act that there was criminal liability and they didn't 

17 know the piecework employees were covered, the Court 

18 responded in 1945, the word "any" resolves any kind of 

19 ambiguity that the employer should have had.

 In this case "any" means any and all, and 

21 that is without limitation. That is the kind of 

22 complaint that is protected under the act. On 

23 December 11 -- there is no question in this case Kevin 

24 Kasten asserted his statutory rights. This is a case 

about form over substance. Form over substance. That's

they weren't properly legally being paid before that. 

6 They changed the clocks the same day. If -- now, there 

7 were a half a million complaints last year in the 

8 Department of Labor. 

9  If the Court should find that every 

complaint needs to go to the Department of Labor, then
