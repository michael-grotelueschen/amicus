 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 06-1431, CBOCS West v. Humphries.

 Mr. Hawkins.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HAWKINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Based on the plain terms of section 1981, 

this Court's interpretation of that statute under 

Runyon, Patterson, and Domino's Pizza, as well as 

Congress' recognition of the distinction between 

discrimination and retaliation and this Court's decision 

in Burlington Northern, section 1981 does not contain a 

separate cause of action for retaliation.

 The Court starts with a review of the text 

of the statute. Section 1981(a) says that all persons 

shall have the right, the same right as is enjoyed by 

white citizens to make and enforce contracts. Words 

like "the same," "equal," and "like" are all in 1981(a), 

and those words all have normal, plain, ordinary 

meaning, that is identical. So what section 1981 says 

is in the making and enforcing of contracts all persons 

shall have identical rights as white citizens.

As we move into this issue --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you see any meaningful 

difference between the language of 1981 and 1982 in this 

regard?

 MR. HAWKINS: Justice Alito, I do, and in 

that context section 1981 was amended in 1991, and with 

a lot of this Court's precedent in terms of how statutes 

are viewed, they all have a life. This section 1981 has 

a new life when it was amended in 1981.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that it was 

narrowed in 1981?

 MR. HAWKINS: I think with respect to this 

issue, Your Honor, of retaliation, that it was. And I 

say it because of this. In 1991, Congress passed the 

1991 Civil Rights Act and in that act they also included 

retaliation for 2 U.S.C. 1212. So Congress was 

consciously thinking about this issue of retaliation. 

They had Patterson that had come before it, they had 

West Virginia Hospital that had come before it, saying 

you have to have specific terms, you have to deal with 

specific issues.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wasn't the purpose of 

the 1991 act to broaden the scope of 1981 rather than 

narrow it?

 MR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, with respect to

the '91 act, it was supposed to specifically pick up the 

post-formation contract issues under Patterson.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is to say it was 

designed to overrule Patterson.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not overrule. They can't 

overrule it, but change the law --

MR. HAWKINS: Well, it didn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so that Patterson would 

no longer be right.

 MR. HAWKINS: It didn't change Patterson. I 

believe as Chief Judge Easterbrook said, Patterson has 

been cited some 27 times by this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "EES-ter-brook."

 MR. HAWKINS: Or "EAS-ter-brook." I'm 

sorry. Thank you, Your Honor.

 By this Court, and in that context it is 

still good law. What it did was to clarify the issue of 

post-formation contracts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you mean Patterson 

would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the 

1991 act.

 MR. HAWKINS: Yes. I think Patterson would 

come out the same, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think Congress would

have been quite amazed at that rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that they would be 

astounded.

 MR. HAWKINS: No. In the context of the new 

post-formation -- excuse me. I understood your question 

a little differently, Your Honor.  Yes, it would come 

out differently if you were dealing with the precise 

issue in Patterson.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that 

before the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?

 MR. HAWKINS: No. I would say, Justice 

Ginsburg, that before the 1991 amendment retaliation 

wasn't included and it wasn't included after the 1991 

amendment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What change did the 1991 

amendment make then?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, it wasn't included --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it was intended to 

change the outcome of Patterson. In what respect? You 

say not in the respect of whether retaliation is 

included but in what respect then?

 MR. HAWKINS: In respect to the 

post-formation. Patterson was dealing with those 

aspects of just the initial making and enforcing of a 

contract, not once you've got the contract established

and in this case employment, what happens, promotions, 

demotions, actions of that nature, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand you. 

Patterson said that post-formation actions were not 

covered, right?

 MR. HAWKINS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Retaliation is one, but 

just one of many post-formation actions, right?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What other post-formation 

actions were there that --

MR. HAWKINS: What other post-formation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the post-formation 

action that was in action in Patterson?

 MR. HAWKINS: Patterson was dealing with the 

issue about after you had the relationship could an 

employer take an adverse discriminatory action against 

the individual, and the Court said no. It was dealing 

with a harassment situation. Afterwards you could not 

have a cause of action in the post-formation situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And Congress changed that 

and the case we have is also post-formation.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, but Congress changed it 

to say that it would include, in subsection 1981(b), 

that it would include certain specified post-formation

conduct with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't specify them. I 

think your point is probably that it includes the same 

post-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation, 

which is to say discrimination on the basis of race, 

which is not retaliation; right?

 MR. HAWKINS: It did not change that, that's 

correct, Your Honor. It did not add retaliation. 

And so what has taken place with respect to this issue 

of discrimination and retaliation and the reason that we 

say that it does not exist in section 1981 is Congress 

in some 30 statutes we've been able to run across has 

specifically included retaliation in provisions where 

they so applauded appropriate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your view, would 

harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?

 MR. HAWKINS: If it is racial harassment, 

meaning the treating of someone differently than a white 

citizen because of their race, then it would be. That's 

the status issue and that's what was addressed in 

Burlington Northern in terms of the distinction that 

exists between discrimination and retaliation, one being 

based on the individual status, which is really what 

section 1981 is focused on.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the term "harassment"

is not included in 1981(b).

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, if it's just harassment, 

Justice Kennedy, in the abstract -- I'm harassing 

somebody because I don't like them -- whether they're 

black or white, that wouldn't be actionable under 

section 1981. You have to have a focus of "I'm taking 

this action against the individual because of the color 

of their skin, because of their race."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that true here? 

Because we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum; 

we're talking about retaliation for complaining about 

race discrimination.

 MR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, if you have a 

situation where -- and I think it's even addressed in 

some of the Respondent's brief. And many of the cases 

going back in the '70s and '80s that were even cited by 

the Seventh Circuit, all deal with situations even where 

they were, if you want to call them retaliation, they 

were retaliation based on directly the person's color of 

their skin. They were this particular supervisor or 

this employer is taking this or that action against 

somebody because they're a black person. They're not 

taking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of -- what kind 

of right to be free from discrimination would there be

if once one complains one can be fired, demoted? That 

would not be a very effective right, would it be?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, I mean there 

are alternatives for that particular issue. In this 

particular case, there was Title VII that fully 

protected the Respondent from any form of discrimination 

or retaliation. In addition, in the State of Illinois 

there are state statutes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one can say the same 

thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act. There 

are a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws. That 

doesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.

 MR. HAWKINS: No, but there is precedent for 

the fact that where one law does cover a particular 

situation, we don't go about removing that impact. So 

Title VII clearly does cover this particular situation 

of a retaliation, a pure retaliation claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they -- why did 

they proceed under Title VII then? What -- what help --

MR. HAWKINS: Well, they did proceed under 

Title VII, and that was dismissed by the Federal court 

because he did not pay his proper filing fee on time in 

compliance with Title VII requirements.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- that's 

often the case, isn't it? I mean, the argument you just

made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to 

complain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to 

use Title VII because he filed too late. That's a 

typical use of 1981; is it not?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, it can be a use, yes, 

Your Honor, that people do use it for that very purpose.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is the difference 

between this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII 

and this would erode Title VII. Doesn't it erode Title 

VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?

 MR. HAWKINS: No, because they can coexist 

with respect to those particular issues, and this Court 

has recognized that those two statutes can coexist.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does the person who 

is retaliated against, that is the person who complained 

and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was 

discriminated against?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, based on a 

reading of Domino's, it would certainly appear that the 

individual who is making the complaint to have 

protection must be the individual who has the 

contractual right, as opposed to complaining about a 

third person.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, is your 

position that in that situation a retaliation is not

covered by 1981?

 MR. HAWKINS: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that you could argue that it's direct discrimination. 

In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the 

retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, 

that that would be on the basis -- basis of race. And I 

thought your position, or at least your position could 

be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against 

whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual 

complaining of the direct discrimination that your 

position would be pertinent.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, we take the 

position that in order to have a retaliation claim under 

section 1981, it really has to be a discrimination 

claim. You have to be able to show that you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right. 

That's why I thought the person directly discriminated 

against would be able to phrase the retaliation claim 

certainly as a discrimination claim.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, they can 

make -- phrase it however they want to in terms of their 

particular complaint, but the issue in terms of the 

analysis under the plain text of section 1981 is whether 

or not a white person in this situation is being treated

differently with respect to making a similar complaint.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely -- surely, you don't 

mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to 

have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination 

claim.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it's your position 

that even when you have a discrimination claim, you 

don't have a retaliation claim. I thought it was your 

position there are no retaliation claims under this 

statute.

 MR. HAWKINS: There is no retaliation claim 

in the abstract under this statute, period, correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You practice in this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in this area --

MR. HAWKINS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps you can maybe just 

tell me based on your experience: After 1981 was 

amended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in 

run-of-the-mill termination and harassment cases?

 MR. HAWKINS: No, Your Honor. In my 32 

years of experience of doing labor and employment law, 

and particularly in employment law, individuals are not

typically bringing 1981 retaliation claims, where most 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, not retaliation. 

I mean harassment, discharge, et cetera.

 MR. HAWKINS: Did we see a big spurt in 

those?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. HAWKINS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why not? There's a longer 

statute of limitation. There's no cap on damages.

 MR. HAWKINS: From our experience, more and 

more people -- there's been a trend to go to State court 

because more and more States --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then I have to 

refine the hypothetical. I don't want to take too much, 

but in Federal court --

MR. HAWKINS: In Federal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because it does seem to 

me that Congress told us: We don't care if there's an 

overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if 

there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care 

if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work. And 

that's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of 

employment discrimination cases.

 MR. HAWKINS: In the Federal system.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that's true, then 

why do we worry about retaliation? If Congress is not 

concerned about it, why should we be?

 MR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, in answer to your 

question, yes, we've seen more adding on section 1981 

claims with Title VII claims in Federal court. So the 

answer to that question is yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, it's just for 

race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.

 MR. HAWKINS: Title VII covers race and 

retaliation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My point is that 1981 

would not be available to other categories. It's only 

race, right?

 MR. HAWKINS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any other advantages to 

1981? You get attorney's fees in 1981?

 MR. HAWKINS: Longer statute of limitations, 

similar attorney's fees, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you get that under 

Title VII?

 MR. HAWKINS: Yes, you do, but it's a longer 

statute of limitations, and it's uncapped damages 

because of the caps under Title VII that exists.

basic employment case? I'm trying to remember from law 

school. Somebody's contract with another man, he's the 

employee, and he says -- the employer says: I'm firing 

you because you won't help me rob the bank. Or the 

employee goes and he finds some money in a wallet or 

something on the street, and he says, I'm going to 

return it to the rightful owner, and the employer says, 

I hate rightful owners, so I'm firing you.  Now, when 

the employee goes to court, I take it -- my vague 

recollection is the employer can't do that.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, it's going to depend 

upon the State and --

JUSTICE BREYER: The State law, is there 

some kind of policy against that from the State law, he 

couldn't do it?

 MR. HAWKINS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here we have a 

Federal statute that says that a black person shall have 

the same right to make a contract as a white person. 

But if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not, 

it's not going to be the same right; it's going to be 

zero right. So, why by parity of reasoning wouldn't 

this provide for the same kind of thing?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Justice Breyer, if white 

individuals are also terminated for making complaints --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It would make no 

difference whether you're a thief in my example, whether 

you're good-hearted. It doesn't matter who you are. 

You could even be somebody from another country. You 

don't have to be American. You could be anything. But 

the State law tries to follow out that -- that policy of 

not having bank robberies and of returning money to 

rightful owners.

 Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the 

Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the 

same as white in respect to making a contract. But were 

the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained 

about it, then black people wouldn't have that right. 

And therefore the policy is that you can't do it under 

this statute because otherwise the written policy is 

ineffective.

 I'm just remembering that from my written --

from my policy arguments that were in contract law.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, I would go 

back to the plain, clear terms with their ordinary 

meaning, and it says equal rights as white citizens and 

it talks about the same and that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Does it say anywhere, by 

the way, in that statute that a black person who is 

discriminated against can go to court and file a

lawsuit?

 MR. HAWKINS: If they have --

 MR. HAWKINS: If they are not being treated 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Does it say is in

 MR. HAWKINS: Does it have the words "you 

may go into court for lawsuit"?

 MR. HAWKINS: No, it does not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a Federal common 

law? Are we sitting here trying to write a Federal 

common law?

 MR. HAWKINS: No, we're here dealing dealing 

with Federal statutes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So State courts can do 

that. They can make it up; can't they?

 MR. HAWKINS: State courts develop public 

policy. They do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And have we developed a 

policy here in creating a right of action under this 

1981?

 MR. HAWKINS: Rights of action have existed

under Federal statute, that's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is the statute that 

does -- is there a statute that specifically gives you a 

right to sue under 1981? Is there a statute?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, this Court has 

established that, particularly with respect to section 

1981, that an individual does have a right of action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It has established it. 

Yes, that's my point: That the Federal court implied 

from the statute a right of action.

 Now, if they're implying a right of action 

from the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those 

rights of action necessary to make the statute 

effective?

 MR. HAWKINS: Because this Court in a 

variety of cases such as Russello, West Virginia, 

University Hospital, Arlington Public School, has said 

that we look at the text and we examine the text of the 

statute, and unless it is ambiguous -- and I would 

certainly submit that words like "same," "like," "equal" 

are not ambiguous terms -- that we leave it alone; that 

that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the word I was 

looking for. The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is 

the word "and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court." I

don't see that written there.

 MR. HAWKINS: It's not in there, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, correct. So we've 

implied that. And therefore, if I can imply that, why 

can't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the 

lawsuit to make the right effective?

 MR. HAWKINS: Because --

JUSTICE BREYER: That was my basic question.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, in response to it, I 

would simply say that you have to look to the text as to 

how you're trying to apply it, and what you're applying 

it to, and this particular statute protects against 

different treatment, not specifically with respect to 

some other --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hawkins, don't we have 

a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our 

face against implying causes of action?

 MR. HAWKINS: Yes.

cases saying we're not going to do that any more.

those?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, I -- we -- we do invoke 

those in our brief, and those are all part of what I'm 

getting at in terms of -- I mean Arlington School Board 

was one of those cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We do have those 

recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case 

interpreting -- interpreting 1982, which arose under the 

prior approach to these questions. And my question for 

you is: Under principles of stare decisis, which body 

do we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under 

the more freewheeling approach to statutory 

interpretation or this later body of law that says we're 

not going to do that any more?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

particularly since this Court has Runyon, Patterson, and 

Domino's interpreting Section 1981, that's what to look 

at to interpret section 1981, not Sullivan, which 

interprets a different statute. They all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's a statute that 

has the same derivation. They're both from the 1866 

Civil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way. 

1982 also says "same" as 1981 does. So wouldn't it be 

odd to take these twin measures and say one includes 

retaliation and the other doesn't?

Wouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in 

1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to 

interpret those twin statutes the same way?

 MR. HAWKINS: Justice Ginsburg, with all due 

respect, I would think not; and the reason is this 

Court, when it acted in 1991, had in front of it to look 

at Patterson, which was saying, we're going to interpret 

Section 1981 in a straightforward, plain-text situation. 

In fact, Patterson says in it if the right is not 

specifically set forth in section 1981, there is no 

relief.

 Then after that, you had West Virginia, 

which was decided in March of 1991, again taking that 

same sort of approach with respect to if it's not in the 

statute, we're not going to make it. It may be that 

it's a job left for Congress. So they act on those and 

pass the law in November of '91.

 That's the context. And even in the Jackson 

case, in looking back, Justice O'Connor ended up saying 

that what we are looking back at is 1972 following 1969. 

So in 1991 we're looking at Section 1981 being amended, 

and we're looking at Patterson and West Virginia to give 

the context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't you look at what 

Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments? That

is, Congress changed the law that this Court had 

declared; and the message, the essential message, was 

this Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of 

Title -- of 1981, so we're going to change it.

 MR. HAWKINS: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it seems to me that 

we wouldn't be hearing -- we wouldn't be grasping that 

message.

 MR. HAWKINS: But, Your Honor, in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you agree with that? 

I don't understand why you agree with that.

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, I think that there was 

some perspective. I don't personally agree with it, But 

I think there was some --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then don't say "yes." I 

mean, it may well be that Congress thought our 

interpretation of 1981 was perfectly reasonable, or it 

had no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was. But 

they know what they wanted to do in -- in 1991. Okay?

 MR. HAWKINS: I agree, Justice Scalia.

sure.

prior decision. Is there anything in the statute which 

said the Supreme Court made a bad decision, and we're 

going to fix it?

 MR. HAWKINS: No. There's nothing in that 

at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something to 

that effect in the legislative history that explains why 

Congress made the amendments it did in 1991.

 MR. HAWKINS: And we could have a whole 

debate about the legislative history and what --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Because the 

legislative history does say, when they passed this, 

that the new law will involve a claim, allow them to 

make a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion, 

transfer, retaliation, and hiring.

 MR. HAWKINS: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: So when they write that in 

the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did 

look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in 

1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981 

there is one? Isn't there at least evidence that there 

were people in Congress thinking that?

 MR. HAWKINS: Yes, that's evidence that 

somebody in Congress was thinking that.

contract --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the committee vote on 

that committee report?

 MR. HAWKINS: No, they did not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you know if 

anybody in Congress thought that?

 MR. HAWKINS: Well, somebody wrote it in a 

report.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have been a 

teenager who wrote the report.

 MR. HAWKINS: It doesn't have any 

significance with respect to this legislation. What I'm 

saying is I think it works against -- that argument 

works against what ended up being in the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think we're 

familiar with that debate. But if we can look -- look 

at the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment 

of a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the 

contract, is your answer that this was an at-will 

contract?

 MR. HAWKINS: I think the Seventh Circuit is 

saying we're not making the at-will argument in this 

case, and that's not where we are going.

JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. HAWKINS: It could be made and it could

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, because I don't 

think that's is a good argument. Why isn't this a 

benefit or a privilege that's been denied?

 MR. HAWKINS: Whether it -- it may well be a 

benefit or a privilege, Your Honor, but it isn't shown 

that there's different treatment than a white employee. 

I mean just to say, I exercised this benefit and 

something happened to me negatively, therefore, I have a 

claim under section 1981, that's not where it's going.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hawkins, is it at all 

relevant on the issue that the several courts of appeals 

have come out the same way both before the 1991 

amendment and since the 1991 amendment, and opinions to 

the contrary are pretty scarce? Does that have any 

weight in a sort of a stare decisis sense?

 MR. HAWKINS: No. Stare decisis applies 

when it's the same facts and the same set of law And 

this is not the same facts and the same set of law. 

This is section 1991, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, but even under the 

1991 the courts of appeals have been fairly uniform on 

the answer to the very issue we're confronting here.

entitled to give any stare decisis weight to a consensus 

among all the courts of appeals both before and after 

the 1991 amendment.

 MR. HAWKINS: I don't believe the Supreme 

Court has to give stare decisis --

law generally?

not, Your Honor.

effectiveness of section 1981 if there is no right to 

bring an action for retaliation. Section 1981 doesn't 

provide any specific remedies or any type of enforcement 

mechanism. It can only be enforced through a private 

lawsuit. Petitioner's basically asking this Court to 

allow an employer to be able to fire an employee who 

brought a private lawsuit to enforce his section 1981 

rights.

 If the Court were to allow employers to do 

that, then any employer or contracting party would have 

the ability to exempt themselves from section 1981 

liability. Take the example of a person who complains 

that he was not promoted because of his race in 

violation of section 1981. His employer fires him for 

making that complaint. If he did not have protection 

under section 1981 against retaliation, he would never 

have the opportunity to remedy that discriminatory 

promotion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good argument to 

Congress. Congress should enact a retaliatory 

provision. But the statute says what it says, and what 

it says is that there has to be discrimination on the 

basis of race. And firing somebody for -- in 

retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on 

the basis of race. Indeed, the person making the

complaint may not have been the person who was racially 

discriminated against. You would acknowledge that you 

couldn't fire -- if retaliations claims lie, you 

couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this 

employer has been discriminating against blacks. 

Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action 

for being fired?

 MS. HYNDMAN: They would in fact have a 

cause of action, Justice Scalia. But this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: On your theory, but that 

has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which 

requires discrimination on the basis of race. I agree 

with you entirely that it would make sense to provide a 

cause of action for retaliation, but we don't write 

statutes. We read them. And there's nothing in this 

statute that says that.

 MS. HYNDMAN: This Court held in the Jackson 

case that discrimination on the basis -- that 

retaliation when there was a complaint about sex 

discrimination constituted discrimination on the basis 

of sex. So it follows that here under section 1981 if 

someone makes a complaint about race discrimination and 

they are retaliated against that they are being 

discriminated against on the basis of race.

it doesn't make any sense.

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well, that's what the Court 

held in Jackson, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't make any sense 

then, either.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we rule 

in your favor, why would anyone ever bring a Title VII 

action if they could bring a 1981 action?

 MS. HYNDMAN: There's a lot of reasons to 

bring a Title VII action, Your Honor. Title VII allows 

an employee to go to the EEOC, and the EEOC has a lot of 

advantages. And so you can bring both a Title VII and a 

section 1981 claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. So if 

you bring -- you'd at least bring them both, right, 

because --

MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 1981 allows you 

to get out of the Title VII cap on damages?

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or isn't that 

rendering Congress' careful -- I mean the 1991 

legislation was a careful compromise. In exchange for 

the expansions of Title VII, they put caps on the

damages. You would allow them to keep the expansion,

 MS. HYNDMAN: Congress said specifically 

in -- in the 1991 Civil Rights Act that the damage caps 

do not apply if an employee has a right under section 

1981 and so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're just 

begging the question. You're assuming you have the 

right that's at issue here today.

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well -- and we do have the 

right that's at issue here today, because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When were -- when there 

damages, as opposed to back pay, added as a remedy for 

Title VII?

 MS. HYNDMAN: Title VII damages were added, 

compensatory and punitive damages were added, in the 

1991 Civil Rights Act.

cut back, as the Chief suggested.

Title VII plaintiffs were entitled to get money damages 

as distinguished from simply back pay?

they put the caps in? I mean, I do think that is a 

limitation on the remedy they provided. They provided a 

damage remedy with a very clear cap and it's not a 

particularly generous cap, either.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you would allow 

them to completely obliterate that cap under any case 

that could be brought under 1981.

 MS. HYNDMAN: And Congress clearly made 

that -- made that choice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's clear, 

but neither you or the government seems to tell me any 

words in this statute. Your argument is that we should 

create a cause of action in order to make this 

effective. I understand that argument. I think the 

Court's cases stand against it, and if you want to --

but it seems to me that you're admitting that nothing in 

the words of the statute as amended help you. And the 

government -- which as well is an impairment, which I 

think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c} 

intended for. But that's almost an admission on the 

government's part that it can't find any words in 

section (b) either.

entitled to the same rights to make and enforce 

contracts as white citizens. And this Court has 

consistently interpreted that to mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was there 

before -- but that was there as of the time of 

Patterson.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then Congress did 

nothing by the amendment to help your case.

 MS. HYNDMAN: What the Court did to help our 

case was that after Patterson was decided and before the 

section -- before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was 

passed, the lower courts had interpreted Patterson to 

restrict retaliation claims because they generally 

involve post formation conduct. And what Congress made 

clear in the -- in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is that 

they wanted to have protection throughout the entire 

contractual relationship.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Patterson was not a 

retaliation case.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Patterson was a discharge 

and harassment case.

cover that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But your point is 

that Patterson made a number of lower courts think that 

retaliation was no longer a viable cause of action.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's absolutely right, 

Justice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Before Patterson they had 

all thought retaliation was a cause of action.

 MS. HYNDMAN: They consistently thought 

there was a cause of action for retaliation based upon 

Sullivan.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But nothing that you 

argued so far shows that the words of the statute as 

amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your 

case.

 MS. HYNDMAN: The words of the statute that 

help us establish the cause of action are that it 

made -- that Congress made clear that the entire 

contractual relationship would be covered from the 

beginning of the contractual relationship through the 

end, through termination. And coupling that with the 

original words of the statute that lower courts had 

interpreted to allow a cause of action for retaliation 

and with subsection (c), which uses broader language, it 

says "impairment by discrimination" -- under this

Court's holding in Jackson --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I do not read subsection 

(c) as giving substantive rights. I mean, you can argue 

about that. I think you have to talk about (b), and I 

think you have a valid point when they say that they're 

extending the protection for the life of the contract. 

But I still want to know what particular words in 

section (b) you rely on? "Benefit"? "Privilege"?

 MS. HYNDMAN: Any of those could apply, 

Justice Kennedy. But the -- what Congress was 

legislating against was this Court's restriction in 

Patterson and saying that the rights that are protected 

are only those rights at the making of the contract and 

the enforcement of the contract. And they expanded the 

language to cover the entire contractual relationship. 

So that, for example, here where you have a termination 

caused by retaliation, then you would have a cause of 

action for retaliation under the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess those court of 

appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a 

retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as 

to whether there was any post-contract claim? Right? I 

mean, they were wrong about that. Patterson, in effect, 

said you're wrong.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why we should 

give deference to them on the one point when they've 

been proven wrong on the other one.

 MS. HYNDMAN: They based that on -- on this 

Court's reading in Sullivan. And Sullivan interpreted 

the companion statute to section 1981, which was section 

1982.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's ironic to say 

all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with 

them and disagreed with Patterson.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But is the rationale of 

those cases -- and it's important to get the right 

rationale. If I say this and I'm wrong tell me I'm 

wrong. And I thought that the heart of it is not that 

the retaliated -- the act of retaliation is 

discrimination. It isn't. What they say is when the 

white man helps the black man from being discriminated 

against, it falls within the statute, not because you've 

discriminated against the black man, but because if it 

didn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode 

or destroy the black man's right. That's what it seemed

to me Douglas said in Sullivan.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so then we're looking 

very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.

 MS. HYNDMAN: I would agree with that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was true in 

Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is 

in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the 

rights of the buyer. It's part of his own contract. 

And to extend it to the situation we have here is quite 

an extension of Sullivan in my view.

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well, I would disagree with 

that respectfully, Justice Kennedy. I would say here, 

when you have the person who was the victim of the 

discrimination, who was also, who was complaining about 

the discrimination and then gets fired, he's in actually 

a better position than the white homeowner was in 

Sullivan.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you agreed with 

Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that 

couldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a 

word that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?

 MS. HYNDMAN: Those statutes --

there. I'm not saying whether it has to be there or 

not. But it certainly could be there, and it's not 

here.

 MS. HYNDMAN: The word "retaliation."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. HYNDMAN: -- does not appear in -- in 

those. There's actually very few Federal statutes where 

the actual word "retaliation" appears. But the other 

statutes that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they provide a 

specific cause of action for retaliation, correct?

 MS. HYNDMAN: They do, but there is no 

specific cause of action provided in section 1981 at 

all. And this Court has already held that there is a 

private cause of action under section 1981, and what 

we're asking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this -- the 

question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well. 

I think you have a case under Sullivan, which 

recognized, although it's 1982, this type of action. 

But Sullivan would not come out the same way today given 

Alexander against Sandoval and our new approach to 

statutory interpretation. So if you're concerned about 

stare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to, 

the Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to

read statutes?

 MS. HYNDMAN: I think you give effect to 

Sullivan in this situation, and the reason is because at 

the time that Congress was legislating and amending 

section 1981, and it was acting against the backdrop of 

this Court's jurisprudence, it had Patterson in front of 

it, it had -- it knew that Sullivan was still good law. 

It knew that this Court had repeatedly directed that 

section 1981 and section 1982 be construed similarly; 

and Patterson did not address the specific situation 

that was in Sullivan, that is whether you could bring a 

cause of action for retaliation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, by 1991 

our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly 

established.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress were 

looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't 

the normal care be for it to put in a retaliation 

provision?

 MS. HYNDMAN: If they were legislating on a 

clean slate I might agree with that Justice -- Chief 

Justice Roberts. But in this situation they were not 

legislating on a clean slate. What they were doing was 

amended one of the oldest civil rights acts in this

country, the Civil Rights Act of 1866. And given that 

they were going to amend that law and they amended it 

based upon what this Court had said in Patterson, and I 

think under those circumstances it -- they wouldn't 

necessarily go and create and write a reticulated 

statute such as the modern antidiscrimination statutes 

are.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying they would 

have -- you're saying they would have added an express 

retaliation provision in 1981 in 1991 if they had 

thought that the mode of reasoning in Sullivan was no 

longer sound? Is that what this comes down to?

 MS. HYNDMAN: I don't know that that's 

necessarily true. I think they -- they legislated 

against the backdrop both of Sullivan and the lower 

courts' consistent recognition of a cause of action.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When you say they legislated 

against the backdrop, you're -- are you not relying on 

something they didn't do, rather than anything that they 

did?

 MS. HYNDMAN: I wouldn't necessarily agree 

with that, Justice Alito. I would --

consistent with this -- was it 2005, long after those 

other new approach statutes, decisions were on the

books. Jackson was in 2005.

 MS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg; and at that time this Court said that you look 

to the language of the statute, and there in Title IX 

the language was broad. It was a general ban on 

discrimination, such as we have in section 1981 and 

section 1982, and in fact the Jackson court relied on 

Sullivan and relied on this Court's interpretation of 

Sullivan to find that there was a cause of action for 

retaliation under Title IX.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I'm -- what I'm 

taking away from the argument is that if I were to write 

this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that 

it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting 

retaliation in order to make these other words 

effective. And that seems to me a very limited argument 

and a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon, 

given the authorities and the approach of the Court that 

we've discussed.

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well, the Court has already 

implied a cause of action and the question is whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that, and --

and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the 

terms in the contract, but you want to add -- for me to 

add a new term. You can't use the existing terms to say

that there is a cause of action other -- that helps your 

client, other than that there is a general approach that 

there is protection post-contract formation. I would 

have to agree with that; and I don't think you can get 

out of it impairment.

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well, the language in this 

statute that guarantees the same rights to make and 

enforce contracts by citizens provides that basis, based 

on this Court's decision in Jackson.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're making 

enforcement, as with Patterson.

 MS. HYNDMAN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear --

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're just talking 

about make or enforce and that brings us right back to 

where we started.

 MS. HYNDMAN: But -- subsection (b) defines 

make and enforce more broadly. And that was the purpose 

of the language in section 1981(d), that was to make 

clear that the terms make and enforce contracts cover 

the entire contractual relationship, from the beginning 

of the relationship to the end of it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To the extent your 

argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and 

read it, and rather than an implied right of action case

it looked to me like a third party standing case.

 MS. HYNDMAN: And I know there is some 

disagreement about that, but the Court in Jackson found 

that -- it did find that Sullivan did stand for the 

proposition that there was a cause of action for 

retaliation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think --

that's right. Now I get back to another stare decisis 

question. Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or 

I do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?

 MS. HYNDMAN: Well, if you look at what 

Sullivan actually said, Chief Justice Roberts, I think 

you would find that you could read it more expansively 

that just a third party standing case. In that case the 

white lessor, Mr. Sullivan, had been expelled from the 

corporation after he advocated the rights of his black 

lessee, Mr. Freeman; and he was allowed under -- the 

Court allowed him to bring his action to recover damages 

and get injunctive relief, because he himself was 

expelled from that corporation. So he was the person 

that had an had injury in that circumstance. So I think 

that it's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, though, 

that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a 

third party standing question.

MS. HYNDMAN: The -- the Court says that 

Mr. Sullivan does have standing to bring the action. I 

do agree with that, but if you read the entire opinion, 

you would see that they also say that Mr. Sullivan had 

the right to bring his action for damages and injunctive 

relief.

 Just to sum up, because this Court in 

Sullivan and Jackson has recognized that persons who 

themselves were not victims of discrimination must be 

protected against retaliation when they advocate the 

rights of those victims; otherwise the underlying 

discrimination would go unchecked -- we are not asking 

the Court to do anything here that they haven't already 

done. We are just asking that the victim of the 

discrimination here, Mr. Humphries, have the same 

protection against retaliation that this Court has 

already recognized that his advocate would have. Thank 

you.

it please the Court:

 This Court has already inferred a private 

cause of action under section 1981. So the question 

before the Court now is simply the scope of the basic 

guarantee in section 1981 and particularly whether it 

prohibits retaliation against someone who exercised 

their undoubted right to complain about racial 

discrimination in a contractual process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a little more 

complicated than that. We inferred that cause of action 

in the bad old days, when we were inferring causes of 

action all over the place.

 Now, the position the Government takes here 

is that we should infer this new cause of action to 

assist the one that's already on the books. Is the 

Government going to be consistent in this position? And 

you want us to in the future go back to our prior 

practice of readily inferring causes of action that are 

not set forth in the -- in the text of this statute?

 Is the Government willing to live with that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, we're 

not asking to you to go back to the bad old days. But I 

think it's important to recognize that we are simply 

asking you to interpret the scope of the cause of action 

you've already inferred. And I think that's consistent

with the way this Court has approached 1981 cases. 

Patterson would be a great example. This Court in 

Patterson didn't say, are we going to infer a new cause 

of action for harassment? No. This Court interpreted 

the basic prohibition of 1981 and said it didn't cover 

harassment. We think if you interpret the basic 

prohibitions in 1981, it covers retaliation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Patterson was still the bad 

old days. When do you think the bad old days ended?

 (Laughter.)

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Patterson was 1989. I 

don't think anybody thinks Patterson was the bad old 

days.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I'm sorry. I was 

thinking of Sullivan.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The bad old days ended 

when you got on the Court, Mr. Justice Scalia.

 (Laughter.)

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Now, I think the 

considerations of precedent as well speak very loudly 

here. And Justice Alito asked the question, what would 

cause the Court to interpret 1981 and 1982 differently? 

And the answer is absolutely nothing. These are two --

these aren't just two closely related statutes that were 

codified together.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you asking us to

against retaliation?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No. We're asking to you 

interpret the cause of action that exists --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What words --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to include 

retaliation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What words in the statute? 

And not "impairment" because I don't agree with the 

government on that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Okay, Justice Kennedy. I 

think part of the disconnect may be, if I could try to 

address this, is there are two reasons you might think 

that retaliation isn't covered. One reason you might 

think retaliation isn't covered is because it's not 

discrimination on the basis of race. The other reason 

that you might think retaliation is not covered and the 

reason that the court of appeals, post-Patterson, 

pre-1991, thought that retaliation wasn't covered was 

simply that it was post-formation conduct. And as to 

that, what is clear is that 1981(b) provides a textual 

answer to that. A --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: A third reason is that the 

word isn't in the statute.

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- but neither is the 

word "harassment," Justice Kennedy. Neither, frankly, 

is the words "discrimination on the basis of race."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a benefit, 

privilege, and term of the contract --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to me fairly obvious to 

me to include harassment. That was the situation in 

Patterson. That's what Congress sought to address. 

Retaliation is something quite different.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, but I don't think 

there's any doubt since Mr. Humphries was fired that he 

no longer enjoys the benefits and privileges of his 

contractual relationship. They were clearly interfered 

with. His rights under 1981 are clearly implicated. It 

would seem to me the only argument that he's not covered 

is that he was retaliated -- he was fired, he lost his 

contractual relationships not because he was 

African-American --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why were you --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- but he claimed -- -

impairment in your brief?

different point, Justice Kennedy, which is we think this

case is a fortiori from the Jackson case in a couple of 

respects. First and foremost, we think that a 1982 

precedent, if it governs Title IX, ought to a fortiorari 

govern 1981.

 But the second way we think this case is a 

fortiori from Jackson is that the same textual obstacles 

are not present here that the Jackson -- that the 

Jackson dissenters identified. You know, the Jackson 

dissenters didn't say that retaliation isn't a form of 

discrimination. They said it's not discrimination on 

the basis of sex. And if you look at the text of 

1981(a), (b), and (c), you find that it's actually more 

capacious language, and you don't have the same problem. 

It doesn't say "discrimination on the basis of race."

 Now, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981 

isn't a race statute; of course it is. But those exact 

words don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block. 

And if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't 

take the form of an express prohibition of 

discrimination on the basis of race; it actually 

textually takes the form of a guarantee of equal 

treatment. And it seems to me that a guarantee of equal 

treatment quite naturally is violated not just by the 

basic discrimination but is also violated by retaliating

exercising their rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have an 

employer who fires everybody who complains about 

practices at work, that would not be covered 

retaliation?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, you're 

right. Judge Easterbrook's hypothetical of the equal 

opportunity retaliator I think as a theoretical matter 

would not be covered by this statute. But of course I 

think it's only an interesting theoretical possibility, 

because I rather doubt that employer would have many 

employees in practice. I mean, in practice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's 

unusual for employers to have a practice that anybody 

who alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal 

law, I want to get rid of them?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I actually do 

think that's unusual, and I do think if an employer -- I 

mean, just in looking at the cases that are actually 

decided, you don't see that as the nondiscriminatory 

defense that many employers resort to. And I think as a 

practical matter that's just not the position that 

they're taking. And I think as a practical matter

you're going to see that those are covered by the 

statute.

 You -- Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked 

about stare decisis and which cases that this Court 

should point to. I think there are a couple reasons why 

Sullivan is the precedent that this Court should follow 

in this case. First of all, this Court followed it in a 

less analogous context just a few terms ago in Jackson.

 Second, this Court has a whole line of 

cases, including Tillman and Runyon, that treat 1982 

cases as binding authority for section 1981 purposes. 

So if this Court were to turn its back on Sullivan, I 

think it would also be turning its back on cases like --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any 

doubt that Sullivan would come out differently today 

under our current analysis?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It -- I mean, it's hard to 

say. I mean, you know, Jackson was just three terms 

ago, Mr. Chief Justice, so -- and I don't know how 

Jackson would have been decided without the benefit of 

Sullivan. I certainly think that the current Court 

would be a tougher Court to make the arguments that 

carried the day in Sullivan than the Court at the time, 

but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It would be a tougher Court

to make the argument on inferring a cause of action, 

period. But I don't know whether it would be a tougher 

Court to make the argument that, if there is a cause of 

action, it's got to include this, which was your point a 

moment ago.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And I think that's a very 

fair point, Justice Souter. And I guess I would say 

that, just to amplify something my co-counsel said, I 

really do think -- I mean, the Jackson Court took the --

the Sullivan case to be something other than a 

third-party standing case and to be a case about 

retaliation. I really think that that is the correct 

reading of the opinion. If you look at the critical 

paragraph on page --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The correct reading 

of Jackson or of Sullivan?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Of both, but more to the 

point, of Sullivan. If you go to page 237 of the 

Sullivan opinion, after the Court's disposed of 

Freeman's claim the whole discussion of Sullivan's claim 

is prefaced with the observation "we turn now to 

Sullivan's claim for" expulsion -- "for advocacy on 

Freeman's behalf."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, and you 

in your brief bracketed that and just made that

equivalent to retaliation. I don't think it is because 

he was arguing that he didn't -- he was himself injured 

because he couldn't sell his own property. He has an 

interest in his own property. And that just isn't true 

in the standard retaliation case of the type we're 

discussing.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But, Justice Kennedy, if 

that were the only claim that Sullivan could bring, 

i.e., if he could only bring the second half of the 

leasehold claim that Freeman had, I would agree with 

your reading of Sullivan. But what the Court is focused 

on is not Sullivan's ability to sue for his inability to 

sell to Freeman. They allow him to sue because he was 

expelled from the property owner's association after the 

fact. Now, why was he expelled from the property 

owner's association? Not because of his race; but 

because he had advocated on Freeman's behalf. The point 

about Sullivan getting to sue for his expulsion from --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But a seller is -- or a 

would-be seller is always a built-in advocate for a 

buyer if some third person interferes with the contract.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree with that, but I 

think what's critical is that he was allowed to recover 

not just for that injury but for his expulsion from the 

property owner's association. And that's not an injury

that was an obvious injury to Freeman at all. But more 

to the point, it doesn't really matter if Freeman and 

Sullivan can sue for that or just Sullivan. The point 

is somebody could sue for Sullivan's expulsion from the 

property owner's association. And I don't understand 

how that's anything other than a retaliation holding. 

And as I said, this Court on a number of occasions has 

given 1982 holdings even stare decisis effect, using 

those words in Runyon in the 1981 context. And so I 

think that's also something that this Court would have 

to confront.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If we thought --

GENERAL CLEMENT: When --

JUSTICE ALITO: If we thought Sullivan was 

incorrectly decided, what should we do? Should we say 

we accept it insofar as it interpreted section 1982, but 

we don't necessarily have to extend it to 1981, to take 

an approach similar to what we did in the recent John R. 

Sand & Gravel case? Or do we have to apply the 

reasoning in the 1981 case because of the close 

relationship between the two provisions?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you have to apply 

its reasoning. That would be consistent with decisions 

like Runyon and Tillman that say that you apply 1982 

cases and 1981.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HAWKINS: Respondent and the government 

and its amicus arguments are more appropriate on the 

floor of Congress debating whether or not to amend 

section 1981 to include retaliation.

 Instead of giving the clear and plain 

meaning of the terms and the ordinary and natural 

definitions, the Seventh Circuit relied on extrinsic 

issues to reach its decision in violation of Article 1 

Section 1 of the Constitution. It exercised its will 

instead of its judgment in violation of the principles 

set forth in Jones versus Bock, where this Court had 

said the judge's job is to construe the statute, not to 

make it better.

 George Washington said in 1790 "I've always 

been persuaded that the success of our nation and our 

government depends upon the acceptance its people and 

that that would depend upon the interpretation and 

execution of its laws. Therefore, it is important that 

the judicial system should not only be independent in

Court's interpretations of section 1981 and the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is no longer 

Washington, right?

 MR. HAWKINS: I understand, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't know where 

he stopped and you began.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HAWKINS: The Seventh Circuit's decision 

should be reversed. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:20 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
