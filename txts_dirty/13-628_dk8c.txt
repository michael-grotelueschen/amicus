9 please the Court: 

10 How an American is identified in his or her 

11 passport or U.S. Consular Report of Birth Abroad, 

12 including the place of birth designation, does not 

13 amount to formal recognition by the United States of 

14 that designated location's sovereign status. This is 

15 the principal reason why Congress's law authorizing 

16 Jerusalem­born citizens to carry passports that say they 

17 were born in Israel is a legitimate congressional 

18 exercise of Congress's power to regulate foreign 

19 commerce, naturaliza ­­

1 MS. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. In ­­

2 in 1898, Congress passed a joint resolution for the 

3 recognition of the independence of the people of Cuba 

4 over the initial opposition of President McKinley, and 

5 that ended up recognizing the independence of Cuba. 

6 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you were careful to say 

7 at the outset that this is not recognition, the court of 

8 appeals decision, I think it was in the Judge Tabor 

9 concurrence, said that both parties urge upon us that 

10 they ­­ that the power of recognition is involved here 

11 and Congress has done it. And then, of course, the 

12 Attorney General takes ­­ takes the opposite position 

13 that the ­­ that this, A, this is recognition and, B, 

14 that's why it's void. 

15 Did you change your position here, or am I 

16 just misinterpreting the way this ­­ the court of 

17 appeals discussed it? 

18 MS. LEWIN: We've provided to the Court 

19 alternative options for resolving this issue. Our 

20 primary position, as I said at the outset, is that what 

21 is written in this statute does not amount to a formal 

22 recognition of sovereignty because the language of the 

23 statute itself is very narrow. 

24 It begins by saying that, for the purposes 

25 of, for the narrow purposes of recording a place of

1 birth on a passport or a Consular Report of Birth 

2 Abroad, that is where ­­ what this statute provides for. 

3 It also does not state that in all circumstances you 

4 have to list Israel as the place of birth. It is merely 

5 giving the individual choice. 

6 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The ­­ the ­­ does ­­ the 

7 provision is part of a section, Section 214. And I 

8 think you're trying to read G, and so it is 

9 disassociated from the purpose that's expressed 

10 throughout 214, that is, that Jerusalem is the capital 

11 of Israel. Congress said that, and you ­­ you are 

12 trying to deal with a piece of one section without 

13 regard to the ­­ to the thrust of the whole provision, 

14 that Congress has said we think Jerusalem is the capital 

15 of Israel. 

16 MS. LEWIN: Justice Ginsburg, the ­­ that is 

17 correct. This section of the statute should be reviewed 

18 and the constitutionality of it be determined on its 

19 own. But the Court should look not at what Congress may 

20 have intended by the entire section but, rather, what 

21 this section actually did. And this section, as I said, 

22 gives the individuals a choice and does not confer 

23 formal recognition. There are benefits that come with 

24 formal recognition. 

25 JUSTICE BREYER: You say that. But the ­­

1 you say ­­ I've heard exactly what you said. And I 

2 think that's certainly a reasonable position. You could 

3 read this and say it doesn't really say anything about 

4 recognizing anything. 

5 But the Solicitor General of the United 

6 States, after conferring with the State Department, 

7 says, "Since Israel's founding, every President has 

8 adhered to the position that the status of Jerusalem 

9 should not be unilaterally determined by a party," and 

10 he adds, "by requiring the President to contradict his 

11 recognition position regarding Jerusalem in official 

12 communications with foreign sovereigns, the section 

13 unconstitutionally encroaches on the President's core 

14 recognition authority." 

15 So he has a different view. He thinks it is 

16 our policy not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital, 

17 which you apparently agree with, and he thinks that this 

18 does have some tendency at least to suggest the 

19 contrary. 

20 Now, I'm a judge. I'm not a foreign affairs 

21 expert. And when he tells me that, and they are foreign 

22 affairs experts in the State Department, how can I say 

23 that I'm right even if I agree with you, and they, who 

24 are in charge of foreign affairs, are wrong when they 

25 make those two statements, which certainly sound

2 MS. LEWIN: Two points, Justice Breyer. The 

3 first is that what goes on a ­­ on a passport as a place 

4 of birth is not tantamount to recognizing foreign 

5 sovereignty. Taiwan is a perfect example. The State 

6 Department puts ­­

7 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I want ­­ and I must 

8 interject at this point because you emphasize the Taiwan 

9 example and it seems to me it's most distinguishable. 

10 Taiwan and China maintained from the beginning there is 

11 only one China, and so Taiwan is a place name. It's a 

12 region. It's in no way recognizing, no ­­ there's no 

13 question of recognition in the Taiwan example. 

14 MS. LEWIN: That's correct, Justice 

15 Ginsburg. So what you put on the passport does not 

16 automatically confer recognition ­­

17 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, to go back to my 

18 question ­­

19 MS. LEWIN: But the question ­­

20 JUSTICE BREYER: ­­ which I'd like an answer 

21 to. I don't think that Taiwan is a counterexample since 

22 the policy of the State Department in that thing that's 

23 FAM, which is the Foreign Affairs Manual, says pretty 

24 clearly that if there's a dispute about the larger 

25 power, i.e., China, you always can put in your passport

3 I'm saying the experts saying that the Taiwan example 

4 conflicted with their policy.

19 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like the first point. 

20 What am I supposed to do in respect to that?

1 JUSTICE BREYER: If you take that position, 

2 which explains it, then what do you think of Justice 

3 Story who writes in 1833 that, "The exercise of the 

4 prerogative of acknowledging new nations and 

5 ministers" ­­ and he makes clear that involves whether a 

6 city or a region is part of a country, et cetera, he 

7 says, it's an executive function. Some argue, as we ­­

8 I think we've just heard, that Congress could make that 

9 decision, too, but that hasn't been decided. And he 

10 concludes that, "A power so extensive in its reach over 

11 our foreign relations could not properly be conferred on 

12 any other than the Executive Department will admit of 

13 little doubt." 

14 MS. LEWIN: Justice ­­

15 JUSTICE BREYER: So he is saying, of course, 

16 you have to have one person deciding such a thing, and 

17 that has to be the Executive. That's 1833, pretty 

18 knowledgeable about the founders' intent. 

19 MS. LEWIN: But that is a rather extreme 

20 position, number one, to suggest that the Executive 

21 Branch would have not only the authority to recognize a 

22 foreign government, but also at the State Department's 

23 say­so, that automatically would end the question or any

4 There ­­ there is review in a variety of alternative 

5 ways by Congress. It just may not be the way you 

6 prefer, that they could pass a resolution contradicting 

7 that that would have any legal course. 

8 MS. LEWIN: There ­­ well, there is review, 

9 and even ­­ both to respond to Justice Sotomayor and 

10 Justice Breyer, Justice Story and William Rawle both 

11 recognize that authority of Congress to review. 

12 Justice Story also said that, "If such 

13 recognition is made, it's conclusive upon the nation 

14 unless, indeed, it can be reversed by an act of Congress 

15 repudiating it." And then he went further to say that, 

16 "If the President refuses to recognize, then he said 

17 Congress may, notwithstanding, solemnly acknowledge the 

18 sovereignty of the nation or party."

12 the Palestinians, and your position is Congress has 

13 no ­­ no compulsion to ­­ to follow that, assuming it 

14 can't recognize. 

15 MS. LEWIN: That is correct.

17 is recognition.

20 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you ask ­­ one factual 

21 matter I'd like. I see in the record that your 

22 application for the passport asked for "Jerusalem, 

23 Israel," but that was changed. Was it changed in 

24 litigation? Was there an actual official request to 

25 change it in your application?

3 initially required. And it was a common ­­

4 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Answer my question. Did 

5 you apply formally to have it changed or did you just 

6 take this ­­ that position in litigation? 

7 MS. LEWIN: The position was then 

8 subsequently taken in litigation. But in subsequent 

9 renewals of the passport, too, it has been just the 

10 request of "Israel" be put on the passport, and it has 

11 come back with "Jerusalem." 

12 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you another ­­

13 another factual question? When Menachem was born, was 

14 he issued a birth certificate by the Israeli 

15 authorities? 

16 MS. LEWIN: Yes. 

17 JUSTICE ALITO: And the United States 

18 recognizes that as ­­ as a lawful exercise of Israeli 

19 authority, to issue a birth certificate for a child born 

20 in Jerusalem? 

21 MS. LEWIN: I believe they do, Your Honor. 

22 JUSTICE ALITO: So what ­­ this is a 

23 question I would ask the Solicitor General, but I don't 

24 completely understand what the position of the United 

25 States is regarding Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.

1 I understand it is the position of the United States 

2 that Israel does not exercise full sovereignty over 

3 Jerusalem, but in that ­­ in this instance, the issuance 

4 of a birth certificate, and others I can think of, I 

5 suspect the United States recognizes that Israel is 

6 lawfully exercising attributes of sovereignty over the 

7 territory of Jerusalem. Is that correct? 

8 So if someone ­­ let's say an American 

9 citizen committed a crime in Jerusalem, would the United 

10 States take the position that the Israeli government has 

11 no lawful authority to prosecute that person for the 

12 crime? 

13 MS. LEWIN: I do not believe so, Your Honor. 

14 I believe that they would feel that the Israeli 

15 government has the authority to prosecute that crime. 

16 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you, 

17 if your primary position is that this is not a 

18 recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what 

19 it is? I mean, why ­­ what ­­ what is the design, what 

20 is the effect of this statute other than as something 

21 that goes to recognition? 

22 MS. LEWIN: This statute is a statute that 

23 was created to give individuals the right to 

24 self­identify as they choose that they were born in 

25 Israel.

1 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the United States 

2 Government does not usually give people that right to 

3 self­identify in this way. In other words, I think this 

4 was the Chief Justice's question in the first argument, 

5 if you're an American citizen born in Northern Ireland, 

6 you can't get the right to say Ireland. For that 

7 matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem 

8 today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine. 

9 This is a very selective vanity plate law, 

10 if we might call it that. And ­­ and it's selective 

11 because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's 

12 consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice 

13 Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the 

14 self­identification it wanted. In other words, the 

15 ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in 

16 Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel. That 

17 and only that self­identification is allowed. 

18 MS. LEWIN: This statute was rectifying a 

19 misguided policy of the State Department which enabled 

20 individuals born in Israel proper, whether in Tel Aviv 

21 or in Haifa, who were opposed politically to the State 

22 of Israel to remove that sovereign, to remove reference 

23 to Israel from their passport, but it did not allow the 

24 flip. It did not allow those who are born in Jerusalem 

25 and who live under the sovereign government of Israel,

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about Palestinians 

4 who were born in Jerusalem and want to have Palestine as 

5 their place of birth? That ­­ that existed until 1948, 

6 that option. 

7 MS. LEWIN: Correct, Justice Ginsburg,

9 Palestine. So the ­­ the law was not going so far ­­

10 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, people can ­­

11 Palestinians cannot ­­ American­born Palestinians cannot 

12 do that. And that suggests that Congress had a view, 

13 and the view was that Jerusalem was properly part of 

14 Israel. 

15 MS. LEWIN: And that is because this statute 

16 was dealing with an existing sovereign that you either 

17 remove from the passport or put on the passport. They 

18 weren't complicating the situation by putting in 

19 non­recognized sovereigns or other entities. They said

9 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, your 

10 argument ­­ and you're consistent on this, your first 

11 argument is that this is not recognition. Now, suppose 

12 the State Department, and I think this is its position, 

13 says this is recognition. If we defer to the State 

14 Department's judgment, to the government's executive 

15 judgment on that point, and the government said this is 

16 recognition, and you say it isn't recognition, why 

17 doesn't the government trump? If the government ­­ if 

18 the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass 

19 a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the 

20 legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done 

21 that. And since it has not done that, it seems to me 

22 the government's argument trumps. 

23 MS. LEWIN: Justice Kennedy, you are 

24 correct. The way the balance of powers works is that

2 legislation, and that legislation is signed into law, 

3 then Congress's position trumps. 

4 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you ­­ but you say 

5 that this isn't recognition. So the ultimate conflict 

6 is not before us and ­­ and, therefore, the government's 

7 policy, which says that this is recognition, should be 

8 given deference and it trumps. 

9 MS. LEWIN: Well, Your Honor, if it does not 

10 amount to recognition, then Congress had the authority 

11 to pass this legislation pursuant to its passport 

12 authority. 

13 JUSTICE SCALIA: I ­­ I guess there are 

14 competing canons here. I mean, one is, I suppose, that 

15 we listen to the State Department on matters of foreign 

16 affairs, but I suppose another one is that we do not 

17 hold a ­­ an act of Congress to be unconstitutional and 

18 thereby ineffective. So that seems to me a draw, 

19 doesn't it? 

20 MS. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Scalia.

3 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ­­ can I give you a 

4 hypothetical, Ms. Lewin? Suppose that Congress passed a

7 whenever a U.S. citizen was born in Jerusalem, and that 

8 official letter from the Secretary of State said ­­ says 

9 just ­­ it announces that a new American has been born 

10 in Israel. Would that be constitutional? 

11 MS. LEWIN: Excuse me, this would be a law 

12 passed? 

13 JUSTICE KAGAN: This is a law passed by 

14 Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born 

15 in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an 

16 official letter to every other foreign minister saying 

17 that a new American has been born in Israel. 

18 MS. LEWIN: Yes, that would be 

19 constitutional. 

20 JUSTICE KAGAN: That would be 

21 constitutional, even though the ­­ the Congress is 

22 basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a 

23 certain kind of diplomatic communication with other

1 you provide seems to be very similar to what a passport 

2 does. A passport recognizes an individual as an 

3 American citizen for purposes of communicating that 

4 information to the foreign government. 

5 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, exactly right. That 

6 was going to be my point, that it was ­­

7 (Laughter). 

8 JUSTICE KAGAN: ­­ that it was extremely 

9 similar to what a passport does, that both are forms of 

10 diplomatic communication, and that what we usually say 

11 about diplomatic communication is that whatever 

12 Congress's other foreign affairs powers are, the power 

13 of diplomatic communication belongs to the President and 

14 the President alone; that in that realm we only speak 

15 with one voice. 

16 And so I guess I have to sort of say that 

17 that answer that you gave me, that this could ­­ that 

18 Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the 

19 diplomatic communication that you have to send to other 

20 foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking. 

21 MS. LEWIN: But recognizing an individual as 

22 an American citizen facilitates the transfer and the 

23 movement of American citizens across borders. This ­­

24 this passport, if it were to list Israel pursuant to 

25 this law, would be indistinguishable from all the other

4 would merely be identifying the individual by their 

5 name, date of birth, place of birth, as all American 

6 passports of individuals identify them. 

7 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would say in 

8 Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's 

9 required to be sent to every foreign head of state would 

10 be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the 

11 passport is, because the passport is used primarily for

5 the ­­ you know, the Secretary of State requests all of

7 And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a 

8 passport as a letter of introduction in which the

10 other sovereigns to aid the bearer. So this is, this

12 what we've said about it, it's like a letter from the

1 Let me get to the heart of the problem with 

2 Section 214(d). Even if Section 214(d) does not 

3 officially change or formally change the recognition 

4 position of the United States, it tries to deny the 

5 President the power to give effect to our official 

6 recognition position by forcing Executive Branch 

7 officials to issue official diplomatic communications 

8 that contradict that position. 

9 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What ­­ what if

3 exactly what the Taiwan Relations Act says? What it 

4 says is, "The absence of diplomatic recognition shall 

5 not affect the application of the laws of the United 

6 States with respect to Taiwan." 

7 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Mr. Chief Justice, 

8 that's quite different. The Taiwan Relations Act was an 

9 act that was an exercise of the necessary and proper 

10 power to implement the President's foreign relations 

11 judgment about how Taiwan should be treated. 

12 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say the 

13 President ­­ let's say the President did not want to 

14 recognize Taiwan and Congress passes a law that says for 

15 every purpose under American law, we will treat Taiwan 

16 as if it had been recognized?

20 enacted, it's not the case now, and it's ­­ and it's

12 consequences. We have had policies in place for decades

7 GENERAL VERRILLI: No. The critical point, 

8 Your Honor, is that what this statute does that those

10 Branch, the President himself and the Executive Branch 

11 itself, to communicate a message that contradicts the

3 Now, how do we, who know little about it,

7 think we should always intervene, perhaps some never. 

8 What in your mind is the right standard? How do we 

9 decide? 

10 GENERAL VERRILLI: I do think this Court, 

11 the last time the case was here, said that ultimately it 

12 was up to the Court to judge the constitutionality of 

13 the statute. Of course, we accept that. But in doing 

14 so, we believe it is quite important that the Executive 

15 Branch get deference on judgments of precisely the kind 

16 that Your Honor has identified. This statute is a very 

17 rare passport statute. There really isn't any other 

18 passport statute like this one that purports to 

19 interject an issue of recognition policy into the 

20 content of passports.

1 question, right? So maybe you want to talk about it. 

2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, let me ­­ I'm 

3 delighted to talk about it, but before I do, let me 

4 actually address that. I don't think you necessarily 

5 have to address the question of exclusive power to rule 

6 for us, and here's why: I think that, given the 

7 petitioner's position that 214(d) does not change 

8 recognition, the official recognition position of the 

9 United States, and the Senate amicus brief saying it 

10 doesn't change official recognition position of the 

11 United States, then that's a given, that the official 

12 recognition position of the United States is that we are 

13 not recognizing any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem 

14 at this point until the parties work it out. 

15 With that as a given, the separation of 

16 powers problem with Section 214(d) is that it forces the 

17 Executive Branch to engage in diplomatic communications 

18 that contradict our official recognition position and 

19 undermine the President's credibility, and that ­­

20 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if it does, then their

5 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Couldn't you say that, at 

6 a minimum, the Petitioner has conceded that it is not 

7 clear that this is recognition? 

8 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's certainly the 

9 case and, therefore, we take as a given that the 

10 President's position on recognition, which is the same 

11 as the position every President going back to Truman, is 

12 the official position of the United States and the

1 of it was to identify the individual; isn't that right? 

2 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that is its primary 

3 purpose. But even though that's its primary function 

4 within the passport, it has the effect of raising 

5 diplomatic foreign policy issues about our recognition 

6 position, and that is why we have had in place official 

7 policies in the Foreign Affairs Manual going back to the 

8 early 1960s that align decisions of place of birth with 

9 our recognition policy. And in fact, before they were 

10 formalized in the manual, they stretch all the way back 

11 to World War II. It's just inevitable that foreign 

12 sovereigns are going to react to that, that the way in

2 them for two reasons. And the first is that very often 

3 foreign nations require place of birth information to 

4 let you travel to that nation, so it's going to be 

5 highly inconvenient if it's not in the passport. 

6 And second, law enforcement and 

7 counterterrorism officials were quite concerned that 

8 passports were going to become less effective in their 

9 efforts if you removed the place of birth designation. 

10 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you the question I 

11 asked Ms. Lewin. What exactly is the position of the 

12 executive regarding Israel's exercise of sovereign 

13 powers in Jerusalem? Is it the case that it is the 

14 position of the executive that Israel cannot lawfully 

15 exercise any sovereign powers within Jerusalem? 

16 GENERAL VERRILLI: The position of the 

17 executive is that we recognize, as a practical matter, 

18 the authority of Israel over West Jerusalem. With 

19 respect to the rest of Jerusalem, the issue is far more 

20 complicated. It might well be, as a practical matter, 

21 although I confess I don't specifically know the answer 

22 to the question you asked Ms. Lewin about the status of 

23 the birth certificate issued there, it might well be 

24 that, as a practical matter, we would accept it as 

25 evidence of birth. Of course we would also issue ­­

3 never have been issued. 

4 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we do have the 

5 consular notification of birth. 

6 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you had to provide 

7 a birth certificate ­­

8 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. 

9 JUSTICE ALITO: ­­ in order to get that. 

10 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that's right. But 

11 as a practical matter, I don't think one can infer 

12 anything about our recognition policy from that. We're 

13 recognizing practical reality. 

14 I do think, for example, Your Honor, if we 

15 were to start issuing passports to people born in the 

16 Crimea tomorrow that identified Russia as the country of 

17 birth, that would carry obvious implications for our 

18 foreign policy position, and it would contradict the

20 deleterious.

1 you should recognize Country A. Does that interfere

3 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I'm trying ­­ try 

4 to give you a precise answer to that. If the statute 

5 said they may not ­­ passports may not be printed in 

6 Country A because the United States does not recognize 

7 Country A, that would be ­­

8 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because Congress 

9 wished the President would not recognize Country A. So 

10 in response to that, we're directing that passports that 

11 are now printed in Country A be printed in Country B. 

12 GENERAL VERRILLI: That would be a harder 

13 case than this one, I think, because it doesn't as 

14 clearly implicate the President's ability to give effect 

15 to recognition power. And one reason it doesn't is 

16 because that doesn't affect the content of the 

17 diplomatic communication in the way that Section 214(d) 

18 does. 

19 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

20 position was that the President has the exclusive right 

21 to decide what interferes with his recognition power. 

22 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I think that the 

23 President has the right to give effect to his

2 that prevents the President from giving effect to that 

3 decision. And we do think, to go back to Your Honor's 

4 question, that it is an exclusive power with the 

5 President. 

6 It is ­­ after all, recognition is not 

7 lawmaking. It is an executive function. And one would, 

8 therefore, expect that it'd be assigned to the Executive 

9 by the Constitution and not to the Congress. And

16 the framers wanted the Congress to play a role and the 

17 Constitution envisions a role for the framers in those

20 the Senate a role in advice and consent for treaties. 

21 And there isn't anything in Article II as a structural

3 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, I think 

4 the answer to the question that Ms. Lewin gave was that 

5 she said yes, the Executive could put that on the 

6 passport. But she also said Congress could then pass a 

7 law saying, this is antithetical to our view, and that 

8 doesn't have to be put on the passport. On the passport 

9 is just birthplace, Israel, period. Congress could pass 

10 that into law and counter whatever the President does. 

11 GENERAL VERRILLI: And I do think that's the 

12 necessary implication of the Petitioner's argument here, 

13 not only that Congress could forbid a disclaimer, but 

14 Congress could require that the ­­

18 did recognize the sovereignty ­­

1 work very hard to try to get under control. The 

2 difference between then and now, there's two very 

3 important differences, and they lead to a very important 

4 conclusion. 

5 The first important difference is it won't 

6 be one branch of the United States Government saying 

7 that this should happen. It will be two branches of the 

8 United States Government saying it should happen. It 

9 won't be that we will ­­ that this statute will have 

10 been enacted, but it won't be enforced. It will be 

11 enforced. 

12 And the consequence of those two things 

13 together is that the credibility of the executive ­­ the 

14 credibility of the President on this fundamental 

15 question of where the United States stands on the status 

16 of Jerusalem until the parties work it out will 

17 inevitably and seriously be called into question and 

18 into doubt. 

19 Foreign governments, foreign peoples will 

20 not be able to have complete confidence that the 

21 position that the President announces on behalf of the 

22 United States is, in fact, the position of the United 

23 States. 

24 That is exactly why Section 214 violates the 

25 separation of powers, even if you conclude that Congress

1 might have some residual power, which we obviously 

2 strongly disagree with. The official position of the 

3 United States is that Jerusalem, we don't recognize any 

4 nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem until the parties 

5 have worked that issue out on their own. 

6 And what this ­­ what this statute does if 

7 it was enforced will undermine the credibility of our ­­

8 of the President's ability to maintain that critically 

9 important diplomatic position as we move forward.

12 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you tell me 

13 it's not a lie? You, the United States, are being asked 

14 to put on the passport that you believe the place of 

15 birth of this individual is Israel, and the 

16 government ­­ and the executive has said, no, we don't 

17 think it was Israel, we think it was Jerusalem.

19 the individual who has self­identified.

21 not the one issuing the passport. It's the government.

1 others. We're recognizing and allowing that speech. 

2 JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it, Ms. Lewin, when 

3 you say the West Bank, I take it you think that Congress 

4 could pass the identical statute with respect to a child 

5 born in Hebron, say. 

6 MS. LEWIN: Saying that ­­

7 JUSTICE KAGAN: That that, too, is Israel? 

8 MS. LEWIN: Correct. 

9 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Okay. 

10 MS. LEWIN: We are providing two alternative 

11 arguments, Justice Kagan: One saying that this is does 

12 not amount to recognition; or if the Court decides to 

13 reach the separation of powers question and views this 

14 as somehow implicating the recognition clause, that at 

15 this point the law passed by Congress would trump the 

16 President. Allowing the State Department's say­so to 

17 control because it's an expert in foreign relations 

18 would be abdicating an independent function and would 

19 turn the President into an autocrat whose word controls. 

20 We suggest that this is analogous, the 

21 recognition power, is analogous to the President's 

22 authority to enter into executive agreements to resolve 

23 foreign claims, and that just as though that is not an 

24 explicit authorization provided to the President, it's 

25 also not exclusive, and the agreements entered into by

1 the President cannot contradict or run counter to the 

2 express will of Congress. 

3 With regard to the international response to 

4 this, the consequences, first of all, described by the 

5 Solicitor General are grossly exaggerated. And what the 

6 world knows could be the ­­ first of all, the United 

7 States State Department could make clear in their 

8 statements, as they did with Taiwan, that this does not 

9 change the United States' policy with regard to the 

10 sovereignty over Jerusalem. 

11 And because the passports would be 

12 indistinguishable from those who are born elsewhere, 

13 there's no continuing statement. While this may 

14 initially have some impact, over time, and I propose a 

15 short time, particularly if the United States makes that 

16 statement, this will become a nonissue because there's 

17 no continuing ­­

18 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I say that this seems a 

19 particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of, 

20 "oh, it's no big deal" argument. I mean, history 

21 suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to 

22 the status of Jerusalem. And right now Jerusalem is a 

23 tinderbox because of issues about the status of and 

24 access to a particularly holy site there. And so sort 

25 of everything matters, doesn't it?
