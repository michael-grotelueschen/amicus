 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-1287, CSX Transportation 

v. the Georgia State Board of Equalization.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS:: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Congress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1) 

crafted what this Court described as a straightforward 

approach to determining whether a State is unlawfully 

taxing railroad property. Congress used a precise 

formula that is set out in a pictorial form on page 6 of 

the Petitioner's brief, and I think it's probably easier 

to kind of follow along on that. What basically 

Congress said is that the court in making a 

determination as to whether there's an illegal tax 

considers the assessed value of rail transportation 

property as the numerator on the left side of the 

fraction, compares that to the true market value of rail 

transportation property, and then compares that ratio to 

the ratio created by examining the assessed value of 

other commercial and industrial property over the true

market value. Fortunately, in this particular case 

three out of four of those variables are agreed to by 

the parties, so the only issue in this case is what 

constitutes the true market value of the rail 

transportation property within the meaning of that 

statute.

 This Court in Burlington Northern first 

evaluated the language of this statute and held, in what 

I think the Court later would describe as a 

straightforward fashion, that 10501(b)(1) declares that 

the district court -- for the district court, that it is 

necessary for that court to determine what the true 

market values of the respective properties are.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it realistic to think 

that you can calculate with any degree of precision what 

the true market value of CSX's property is? The range 

of values that were calculated by both of these experts 

are really astonishing, from 12.3 billion to 8.1 billion 

for Dickerson, from 9.3 to 5.9 for Tegarden. It's like 

$3 or $4 billion doesn't mean anything. What is the --

can this be done with any precision or is it more 

realistic just to say that what the district court would 

have to do is to figure out whether the State's 

calculation is within some reasonable range?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think it's pretty clear

that Congress did not adopt that particular formulation. 

What Congress tasked the district court with doing was 

determining the true market value. And if you look at 

footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, I think he 

does a fairly interesting job of explaining what that 

would normally mean. He says: In an ordinary valuation 

case I would take in all of the expert testimony from 

the railroad, I would take in all of the expert 

testimony of the State, I would evaluate them and I 

would come up with a conclusion as to what I think is 

the true market value.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want the 

district court to in addition determine which 

methodology most accurately reflects that true market 

value?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to be able 

to challenge the state's chosen methodology for 

determining market value?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think every facet of 

the question of, that goes into the determination of 

what is a true market value.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the, so if the 

district court says this methodology, Methodology A, 

most accurately yields true market value, that is giving

rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I think all it says is 

that in this particular case under these particular 

circumstances that methodology led to what was the true 

market value.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't see 

how it varies based on the particular circumstances. If 

he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted 

value approach is the best way for determining market 

value, he's not going to in the next case or the 

district court isn't going to be able to say, I think 

reproduction cost is the best method. You're going to 

establish a Federal rule for what is the best way of 

determining market value.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

that's not accurate. I think what will happen is that 

the circumstances change every day. Let's just take a 

pretty simple example. Let's assume that in year 1 the 

district court decides to use discounted cash flow. In 

year 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad 

property is sold, so that you have an actual direct 

sales comparison data available to you by which to make 

the market value.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That happens, that 

happens once every 25 years. If you prevail on a method

that you think is more favorable to railroads before a 

particular district court, you're going to cite that 

district court in the next case that you've got and you 

say: Look a district court's already looked at this and 

they said Method A is a better way of determining market 

value.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I'm sure that's true 

that we'll cite it, but the reality is that the district 

court in the second case is not bound by the decision of 

the district court in the first case. And the truth is 

every single one of these --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if a district 

court says in one case Method A is the best way to get 

market value and another district court says Method B 

and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to 

have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, at the end of the day 

the district court's going to make a valuation. It's 

going to say that this is the true market value. That 

determination is a question of fact and therefore, yes, 

the court of appeals will evaluate that to determine 

whether or not that fact is clearly erroneous.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I think you said that CSX 

has properties in 15 States that use the unit method of 

calculation.

MR. PHILLIPS: I believe that's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if you challenge all of 

those there could be 15 different district court 

findings on true market value, and so within each 

circuit the court of appeals would have to decide which 

district court was correct as a matter of fact?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure, Justice Alito, that's 

exactly what could happen. But the reality is is that 

that's exactly what's been going on since the statute 

was enacted in 1976. 48 of the 50 States have railroads 

that have to be evaluated and, as the AAR's amicus brief 

points out, there have been 12 cases on this particular 

issue. It is not as though it is cost-free for the 

railroads to challenge what the States are doing under 

these circumstances. There is no cost shifting or fee 

shifting arrangement. And second, you're suing the very 

person who's going to be making the decision next year 

as to the value of your property.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 

already been pointed out if the range is a variable of 

$4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to 

challenge what they think is a low valuation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, blissfully, more 

often than not it turns out that the overvaluation are 

not nearly that stark. But I think that goes to the

core point here, which is that if this Court concludes 

like the Eleventh Circuit did, which is that there is no 

basis for challenging the methodology, then it would 

have been completely within the province of the State of 

Georgia to say, we're going to adopt a stock and debt 

method, which virtually everybody recognizes is not an 

accurate way to determine true market value, that that 

number would have been $12.2 billion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if we were to 

adopt a different approach which said that you can 

challenge the methodology, methodology, when different 

methodologies are used, but if the State is using the 

same methodology that's their choice? It seems to me 

the only other alternative is to have the Federal 

judiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology 

has to be used.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think there's 

ever a reason why the Federal court has to adopt a 

single methodology and I don't think that's what 

Congress intended. I think what Congress intended is 

what happens in every run of the mine valuation case 

that comes up in either State or Federal court, which is 

that each side presents its best guess as to what the 

true market value is and the district court resolves 

those differences and comes out with a number that the

district court believes constitutes the true market 

value.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose there are a lot 

of valuation cases under the Takings Clause, aren't 

there?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Scalia, there 

are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a standard Federal 

rule for how you evaluate --

MR. PHILLIPS: If you read footnote 8 of the 

district court's opinion, the district judge says, if 

this were a typical valuation case what I would have 

done is I would have listened to the railroad, I would 

have listened to the State and I would have made a 

judgment as to what I think is the right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that how it 

works in utility rate regulation? Isn't there in fact a 

standard Federal method of determining what rates affect 

the taking of property --

MR. PHILLIPS: But that's because there's 

usually --which rates affect the taking of property?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, if it's 

challenged --

MR. PHILLIPS: Or what the rates ought to 

be?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The rate of return 

in a public utility.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But that's because that's 

regulated by a Federal agency that formulates a very 

precise approach typically. But there's nothing like 

that -- and that approach governs every utility subject 

to the jurisdiction of FERC.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask this 

question. Is it -- would it be permitted for a State to 

say that, with respect to utilities and certain 

industries, including railroads, we use valuation Method 

A, with respect to commercial rental real estate 

property we use valuation Method B? Is that permitted?

 MR. PHILLIPS: It's permitted for them to 

use different methodologies because typically they do. 

The reality is they almost never use the same 

methodology for determining railroad property as they do 

for other commercial and industrial property because the 

data that are available for the two are never the same.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So is a large part of the 

argument you would make that other utilities are 

comparable or not comparable to a railroad?

 MR. PHILLIPS: You would make that argument, 

but you'd also make an argument as to sort of what data 

are available in any particular case to allow a

particular methodology to be used.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an accounting 

journal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax 

appraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating 

railroad property and it was conceded by all to be 

highly accurate. Could they use just that for the 

railroad and different methodologies for all other 

utilities all over the country?

 MR. PHILLIPS: At the end of the day the 

test here is purely a results-driven test. It doesn't 

tell the State what methodologies to use on either side 

of the equation. What it says is at the end of the 

process you end up with a ratio between assessed and 

true market value for each that's within 5 percent.

 THE COURT: Mr. Phillips --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if had the 

Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could 

use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State can use 

any -- the State can assess any way it wants to in 

defense of its ultimate outcome.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the end it has to 

have the right ratio.

 MR. PHILLIPS: At the outcome it has to have 

the right ratio. That's clearly what Congress intended.

I mean, this language could not be more straightforward.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Congress uses the 

word "true market value" and under this hypothetical I 

come very close to true market value, and you say it 

doesn't work.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, my guess is that the 

district judge in that situation would probably say that 

that is the true market value. The problem is when you 

deviate from that methodology when you're evaluating 

commercial and industrial property what happens in that 

context? Does that end up with a true market value 

that's much higher or lower.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought your -- I 

thought your submission was that even if is true market 

value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in 

line if the methodology is different.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, at the end of 

the day that's right. The question here is the 

comparison of assessed to true market value on both 

sides of the equation. It doesn't dictate the 

methodology for get ting there in either situation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, could I come 

back to this question of whether or not there's going to 

be a uniform Federal rule or not. When the district 

court makes this finding of what the true market value

is that's a finding of fact, I assume.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I believe that is, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it would be reviewed 

under a clearly erroneous standard by the court of 

appeals?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if there were various 

methodologies that were possible and this was one of the 

ones that was ballpark at least reasonable, would the 

court of appeals have any basis for reversing the, how 

could you say it's --

MR. PHILLIPS: More often than not, my 

answer would be no, there wouldn't be any basis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, more often 

than not. But in fact it is an ultimate finding of 

fact, but it's based on valuation methodology and that's 

what's at issue here. No one doubts that the 

application of a methodology can be challenged. The 

question is whether or not if you start out -- I reached 

these facts because I used reproduction costs as my 

method of valuation, and your submission is going to be 

that vastly overvalues our property and you should use a 

different method. That's a legal question. That's not 

a method -- question of fact.

seeking, Justice, to answer Justice Scalia's question, 

is to have the independent de novo assessment by the 

district court. I mean, that's the real purpose of the 

statute, is to provide a Federal forum.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the district 

court -- what if there is one methodology that gets you 

an answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down, 

and there is another methodology that gives you an 

answer with a 5 percent margin of error, up or down? 

Can you challenge the application of one of those as 

opposed to the other.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on what 

you're asking me. Are you talking about how the 

district court, or the court of appeals? If it's in the 

district court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course you 

can challenge it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- because the question for 

the district court is not with deference to how the 

State is evaluating this issue. The question is for the 

district court, de novo, to make a determination of what 

the true market value is. But asking on the court of 

appeals side, that's a different question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question -- my 

question assumes that the methodology leads to a value

that is either 20 percent higher or lower in one case, 

and 5 percent higher or lower in the other case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: As I understand the way this 

statute applies, this is not a statute that worries 

about sort of how you get to the numbers. All this 

statute worries about is when you get to a number at the 

end of the day, is it within 5 percent of the same 

number that you -- the same ratio you would have gotten 

using whatever methodology you use on a commercial and 

industrial side. If the answer to that is it's more 

than 5 percent, then we are entitled to injunctive 

relief; and if it's not, then we are not entitled to 

injunctive relief. And that's why I think it doesn't 

make sense to think about this in the context of --

because you know, there's deference to the way the State 

analyzes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I approach the same 

issue this way? When a State board in this case 

determines what method of valuation it is going to use, 

what does it consider? What are the reasons that it 

chooses method A rather than method B?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in some ways it's 

difficult to know. In this particular case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what should the 

reasons be?

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they should be 

applying the professional standards of appraisal.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the professional 

standards, I take it, are not simply rules that one can 

grab out of thin air depending on one's mood. Doesn't 

MR. PHILLIPS: Trust me, having read them, 

you can't grab them out of thin air.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't one have to choose 

the methodology based on some factual determination on 

-- which would support a conclusion that this is a 

better methodology for this case and others --

MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- for this case than 

others?

 MR. PHILLIPS: And Justice Souter, that's 

driven largely by what data are available and what do we 

know about how these methods have been applied in the 

past to value this particular property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the end of the day, 

it's a determination which is based upon facts. There 

are good reasons in fact to choose method A rather than 

method B, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: There is also an element of 

judgment.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Would it make sense then 

for a reviewing court to review the basis upon which the 

methodology was chosen, and if in fact there is a 

reasonable basis for choosing methodology A rather than 

methodology B, accept it and defer it to that extent?

 MR. PHILLIPS: In a different world, that 

would make perfect sense. That's an approach Congress 

clearly could have embraced. The problem is Congress 

didn't do that. Congress said choose the true market 

value.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure what his 

question is. I think he is talking about reviewing the 

district court's judgment on that basis.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about reviewing 

the judgment of the State authority in choosing one 

method rather than another.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the answer to 

that is that Congress didn't intend to set this up as a 

review process of what the State does. Congress 

intended for the district court to do what this Court 

said in Burlington Northern, make the necessary 

determination of the true market value of that property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't 

know, there is no way of telling whether there is a 

variation, or there isn't a variation under the

congressional formula, unless we first have a formula 

for determining what the value -- what the true value of 

the railroad property is. We know that can vary. That 

can vary depending upon the methodology chosen. The 

methodology chosen is dependent upon good facts, to pick 

one or the other; and therefore, doesn't the very -- the 

very criterion that Congress chose ultimately depend 

upon the methodology?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so. I 

think what the Court said is that -- or what Congress 

has said is that the district court can take all of that 

into account; but at the end of the day, it is the 

district court serving as a check on what the State does 

that decides what the true market value. I'd like to 

reserve the balance of my time, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS

 AMICUS CURAIE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the court:

 Congress did not, in the 4-R Act, establish 

a right to obtain in Federal court administrative review

of State valuations. Rather, it established a Federal 

right against State discrimination in which the railroad 

could bring a de novo suit in Federal court to vindicate 

that right. Justice Alito pointed out the wide range of 

value that could be generated by generally accepted 

methodologies -- 6 billion to 12.4 billion, in this 

case. Clearly, if one were to accept the State's rule 

that any reasonable methodology, by which they mean any 

methodology that is reasonable in the abstract that may 

have been approved by this Court in the 1800's, a State 

could hide any variety of discriminations within that 

rubric. There would be very little, if any meat to 

Federal court review under the 4-R Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if you take my 

variation on it, and that is, we don't defer it to the 

State's choice in the abstract, i.e. if we -- if there 

are 10 methods, as long as it's one of the 10 it's okay? 

Rather, if we defer at all, we defer it to the choice 

that is made to -- to accept one or the other 

methodology, and we look to the reasons that the State 

gives for making that choice? Would that take all the 

teeth out of the Federal act?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that 

it would, to a large extent, undermine the right and 

protection that Congress intended. And partly, I think

that the -- Your Honor's question is based on a faulty 

premise, and that is that the State uses a single 

methodology in carrying out its valuation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Your point is well taken. 

It has a variety, and then it makes some kind of a 

judgmental choice as between the results it gets. But 

that I guess just makes my question more complicated. 

As long as it -- as long as it has good reasons for 

selecting, let's say the three competing methodologies 

that it uses, and as long as it has a rational -- gives 

a rational basis for the ultimate resolution, should we 

not or should a court not defer to the choices?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that 

to call the weighing of the three evidences of value 

that might be generated by cost income, sales methods, a 

choice of methodology to which the Federal court is 

required to defer is a misnomer, because it really is an 

exercise of judgment with respect to the facts of the 

case and the reliability of the data available.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't the judgment 

get exercised in determining what facts are good reasons 

for selecting this methodology, or this variant of 

methodology, for this particular case?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think Your Honor 

is correct, that the -- because you're pointing out that

really, the choice among methodologies is more a 

question of what are the facts on the ground, what is 

the reliable, available data that could be used in 

generating these different evidences of value. And the 

court's role, in our view, is to consider all of the 

evidences of value, not just the State's evidence. That 

would be the proper approach in a suit for 

administrative review -- of administrative determination 

by the State, but is a de novo proceeding in which the 

court is to consider all evidence of value to determine, 

to its own satisfaction, what the true market value of 

the railroad is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if you don't agree 

with Justice Souter's test for the district court review 

of the State, might you agree with it as applied to the 

court of appeals review of the district court's job?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I do believe that 

the court of appeals review is reviewing a determination 

of fact by the district court. There may be subsidiary 

questions of the law that the court of appeals would 

review. For example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, are you going to 

answer my question, yes or no?

yes, that the review of the appellate court of the

district court's finding is different than the review of

JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't ask whether it was 

different. I asked whether a reasonable basis for plain 

error -- for clearly erroneous review, by the court of 

appeals, begins with assessing whether the methodology 

used by the district court is reasonable.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, again, I 

don't think that it's fair to assume that the district 

court would have used a single methodology. Rather --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a combination of 

methodologies. I'm talking about -- when I say 

methodology, I mean even if it uses a combination of 

five different ones, okay.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it reasonable? How do 

you propose to have the court of appeals review the 

district court's selection of methodologies?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, it would be, 

as Justice Souter suggested, a question of whether those 

methodologies -- whether the evidence in the case 

indicated that those methodologies were reliable 

indications of value.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- were reasonable? Do 

they have to have been the very best?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clearly erroneous if 

it may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there 

is disagreement as to what the very best would be?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I do believe that's 

true, and that is in the nature of the appellate court's 

review of the factual finding by the district court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

I understood you to be arguing that the district court 

made an error of law in not receiving evidence of a 

different methodology offered by the railroads. And 

also, if they conceivably -- if I understood you 

correctly, you could send the case back, they could then 

receive the evidence and come to precisely the same 

conclusion that they already came to. That would be 

permissible, wouldn't it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It would be 

permissible. You're absolutely right, Justice Stephens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's something not 

quite right about that. Wasn't all the evidence 

submitted, but the district judge said, I have all the 

evidence, but I can't consider. It isn't a question of 

introducing new evidence when it goes back. It's a 

question of looking at the body of evidence that was

that Tegarden wasn't allowed to testify. It was 

excluded by the court in its consideration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were all of the 

values that were arrived at in this case within the 

ballpark?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- whether 

they are in the ballpark is not the test. Whether they 

are indications -- reliable indications of true market 

value. True market value is a fact that, as the Court 

recognized in Burlington Northern, must be determined by 

the Federal court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were all the 

valuations used here reliable indications of true market 

value?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, they were --

Respondent argues that they were all reasonable 

methodologies. But no, I don't think that it's true 

that the true market value of the railroad is either 6 

billion or 12 billion. The determination the Federal 

court has to decide is what is the true market value.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the district 

court has to engage in purely fictional enterprise, and 

say yes, all the methodologies give you a range of 6 to 

12 billion, but I think the answer is 8.2 billion.

distinguish the reliability of the stock and debt method 

in this case, and the income that the two parties used

side, and they engaged in this, that they would not all 

come to the same number, that there would be a range and 

probably a fairly significant range?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There would be a 

range. I don't know that it would be a range from 6 to

undertake complicated valuation questions, and they rely 

on the testimony of experts. Appointment of a master 

might well be permissible. But I want to go back to the 

textual indications, that this is a question for the 

Federal court. There is no question that the statute 

refers to the burden of proof in determining true market 

value. In Burlington Northern, the Court recognized 

that the allocation of burden of proof demonstrates that 

it is a fact to be proved to the Court. In fact, in se, 

with respect to true market value of the commercial and 

industrial properties, it specifically says that it is 

to be proved to the satisfaction of the Court. Now in 

Burlington Northern, the Court remarked that it would be 

unreasonable to construe the statute to lead to 

strikingly different approaches, whether the railroad's 

challenge was based on the alleged undervaluation of 

other properties or overvaluation of the railroad 

property. Now, we know from the statute that the court 

is not to defer to any methodology, or amalgam of 

methodologies, the State uses in valuing other 

commercial and industrial property. Rather, the court 

is to look to the best evidence of value, which is sales 

data. Now, if the court has sales data available to it 

in the case regarding the value of the railroad, 

certainly the court should rely on that reliable

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN R. CALVERT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. CALVERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the court.

 Subsection (b)(1) constitutes a narrow 

exception to the normal rule of Federal non-interference 

in State tax administration that is designed to prohibit 

a specific type of tax discrimination. What CSX 

contends here is that Congress meant this 

anti-discrimination provision to secure for the 

railroads what no other taxpayer to our knowledge 

currently has. And that is an -- an absolute right to 

come into Federal court, and to have a Federal judge 

redetermine the market value of its property for State 

property tax purposes in whatever manner the Federal 

court finds to be appropriate, without regard to the 

State's choice of a reasonable valuation method.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to be what it says 

though, isn't it?

that's what it plainly says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the language? 

What's the crucial language?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, it requires the 

comparison of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't require --

what it say the district court is supposed to find?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, it has to find the 

assessed value of the railroad, the true market value of 

the railroads --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's supposed to find the 

true market value of the railroads. It doesn't seem to 

me fuzzy language. District court is to find true 

market value.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I think in large part, 

the railroad's argument is it places on the one word 

"true" and the term "true market value" a weight that it 

cannot bear. The complaint that the railroads filed in 

this case, and this is confirmed by the legislative 

history, acknowledged that the word "true market value" 

meant the same as "fair market value" or "market value."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a very strange way of 

saying the district judge is to -- is to ask whether the 

State has used one of a number of reasonable methods of 

determining the market value. To say, go find the true

market value is a very strange way of saying that, and 

that's what you, that's what you're saying it means.

 MR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I think if 

Congress had said the district court is to find fair 

market value or the market value it would seem -- it 

would seem less strange. And we think there is going to 

be a range -- any case like this as evidenced by the 

appraisals -- the appraisal prepared by the railroad's 

appraiser, as evidenced by the State's appraiser. There 

is going to be a range of possible market values.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would your position be 

any stronger if it used fair market value?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor I think in 

the same way that CSX --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or any weaker?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, the way that 

the railroad says you have to look for the one value 

that's true, I would say that if the statute said "fair 

market value" the question is there could be many market 

values that are fair.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you mean, we have 

false "fair market value"? I never heard of such a 

thing.

 MR. CALVERT: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. But I think -- I think there is a range of

possible market values that can be considered fair.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the point not that 

anyone is denying that there can be a range, that there 

-- everybody agrees that there is not here, simply 

because there is not one methodology, there is not an 

exact science which is operating? But isn't the real 

point the point that Justice Scalia made, that when 

Congress uses the term "true market value," when it has 

a criterion of truth, the one thing that does seem to be 

clear is that, if you are looking for truth, you do not 

defer to a party in interest? And isn't that the one 

point? And if you accept that point, then doesn't it 

follow that methodology is up to the assessment of the 

district court.

 MR. CALVERT: I would say that's true, Your 

Honor, but I would say that the statute does not plainly 

lead to that result.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How could it say it more 

plainly than using the criterion of truth?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, again, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Truth -- whatever truth 

means, it doesn't mean deferring to a party in interest. 

Isn't that correct?

absolute certainty or precision that one --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We all accept that. The 

question is not whether we're talking about rocket 

science in valuation. The question is whether we are 

deferring to a choice made by the party in interest? 

And doesn't the criterion of truth imply that we do not?

 MR. CALVERT: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

that it does. Again, if the -- if the statute had said 

what it easily could have said and what the legislative 

history says it could have said and what CSX complaint 

in this case acknowledged it could have said, that what 

the district court had to find was the market value of 

the property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So Congress in effect was 

engaging in Pontius Pilate's exercise, what is truth?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I was expecting you to say, 

that what is truth?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I would say that 

the statute does not plainly require that if a State has 

determined the market value of the railroad by correctly 

applying a reasonable valuation method, that the statute 

an ambiguously allows the taxpayer to come in and 

challenge that -- not just the application of that 

method but the -- but the methodology itself.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you limit it to 

the application and not the methodology, then Congress's 

overriding goal was there was a problem with 

overevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress 

was responding to that problem of overevaluating the 

property. But if you limit the challenger to just the 

application, then you are not going to have as vigorous 

a check on over evaluation as you would have if you 

could -- if you could reach back to the methodology.

 MR. CALVERT: Your Honor, I think what CSX 

would like in this case is to turn the Federal district 

court, the judge into a board of equalization who has to 

-- who has to consider every -- each and every objection 

to each and every decision that the State that is made 

in valuing its property.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what you are saying is 

that the -- that the court is simply being turned into a 

grade school math teacher who looks to see whether the 

sums are added up correctly. That can't be what 

Congress had in mind.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, no, Your Honor. That's 

not our position. In fact, the objections that CSX had 

specifically to the State's application of the 

discounted cash flow were more than what could be fairly 

described as checking the math. It wasn't a situation

where one number had had the decimal point in the wrong 

place but there was -- there was days of expert 

testimony, for example, regarding whether the State's 

use of a 6.3 terminal growth rate in the discounted cash 

flow was an appropriate number for this railroad.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, there was 

-- there was a contest about the judgment used by the 

State in selecting one point of datum in its 

calculation, right?

 MR. CALVERT: That among other --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that kind of 

judgment -- if it makes sense under the statute to put 

that kind of judgment in question, why doesn't it 

equally make sense under the statute to put other 

questions of judgment such as the selection of the 

methodology to which the data point in fact is relevant? 

Where do you stop?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, we think it is -- the 

difference, Your Honor, is, while we believe that a 

State should have -- should have the right to choose 

among the various reasonable types of valuation methods 

that can be used in a case like this --

think. My question is, if you agree that it's

one issue of judgment, why isn't it equally appropriate 

to challenge other issues of judgment, i.e., selection

 MR. CALVERT: Well, because it's one thing 

to say that the State can choose the valuation formula; 

it's another thing that the State is able to dictate how 

you fill in the variables. If a State can say we're 

going to use the discounted cash flow analysis but 

here's the way we're going to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Each one, as I understand 

it, is a question of judgment about what is appropriate 

on the facts of this case, or these kinds of cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The trouble is you can't 

find a -- it is a line, but it's not a line you can 

derive from true market value. I mean, you can do it, 

but what in the statute suggests that that's what you 

should do?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, I believe 

what you have to find in the statute, because this is a 

limited exception to the rule that Federal courts will 

not interfere with the State's administration of its own 

tax system, is -- I think you need to find something in 

the statute which plainly allows the Federal courts to 

get into the minutia of not just the way in which the

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So they don't 

know, and they use all these different methods sort of 

as checks one on the other. Now, the railroad simply 

wants to say: Look, you had an expert here and he went 

and used a method, and it comes up with a certain 

number, but if you look at a few other methods, you'll 

see that's an outlier. Okay? Now, why shouldn't it be 

able to do that?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I guess -- Your Honor, I 

think it's specifically because there is that range of 

value, that if Congress had intended to -- that the 

district courts would examine each and every decision 

made by the States deciding it's going to use this 

method --

JUSTICE BREYER: They're not going to do 

that. The State has enormous leeway. Anyone who valued

a railroad running through the center of this city, of 

what it would be worth if the property were sold on the 

private market, you'd get an astronomical number. So 

the chances of this number being higher than the sales 

value of private property is not great.

 So, if you've come in with some method that 

puts it higher than that, well, why shouldn't they be 

able to come in and say: Look, look what they've got 

with this method, which in our opinion is not a fair 

method. Now, why not? Because after all, if you're 

going to say they can't, then there is no check on the 

State working out a method that discriminates, as 

Justice Ginsburg said, seriously against the railroads.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I think -- I think the 

result of that, Your Honor, is -- is you're going to 

have a Federal court setting a Federal standard of 

valuation for Georgia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What they're going to do is 

they're simply going to let people present the evidence 

as you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if 

they want, all serving each as checks on the other. 

There's no single method. So why would you end up with 

that result?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, Your Honor, that's what 

-- that's what CSX is -- is arguing here today, but

that's not what they argued in the district court. They 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought 

you conceded that that was what it would be, because you 

said that the Federal court would be turned into a board 

of equalization, and a board of equalization is not 

making grand law for setting precedent.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

what CSX asked in this case is that -- they have taken 

the position, and I believe they still take it for this 

Court, that a stock-and-debt method will never give a 

reliable estimate of the value of the railroad. So they 

want -- what they want to come out of this litigation is 

the State of Georgia cannot use that at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think what they want is 

to be able to attack the methodology and not be limited 

to the application of whatever methodology the State 

prefers.

 MR. CALVERT: That's correct, Your Honor, 

but the point I'm that trying to make is that what they 

-- what they want to see come out of this case is the 

State of Georgia -- not simply that the State of Georgia 

couldn't use the stock-and-debt methodology for this tax 

year; they want a ruling that basically says it can't 

use it for any year.

not going to get that from this Court, any more than 

they could get it from the Court of Appeals. All the 

Court of Appeals can say, it seems to me, is that the 

methodology that the district court used was not clearly 

erroneous.

 I think another district court in a later 

year could probably use a different methodology, which 

would again be affirmed by the Court of Appeals because 

it was not clearly erroneous. We're not -- I don't 

think either the Court of Appeals or this Court is 

placing any stamp on a particular methodology.

be able to defend that decision with precisely the same 

arguments that you're making today?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just wanted to be sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that would 

be part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had 

five different methodologies here and you chose the 

lowest one; and the question really is how many more 

methodologies do you have to look at if you're going to 

choose the lowest one in each case.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, and that is what we did 

in this case, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If it had been -- I'm 

sorry -- if it had been Dickerson's methodology at the 

last step to choose the highest value, would that be 

reasonable?

 MR. CALVERT: Again, Your Honor, I think --

I think a State could do that. You're still within the 

range of value. I will say this. If the State had done 

that in an effort to overvalue the railroads, or to 

discriminate against them or to treat them differently 

than other taxpayers, I think you might have a problem 

under the statute, but I don't think it's a problem 

under (b)(1). I think that would be a problem under

JUSTICE SCALIA: This State appraiser as I 

understand it had never done an appraisal before of --

of this magnitude, right?

 MR. CALVERT: No, Your Honor. He's done 

well over a thousand appraisals involving the 

application of the unit rule. What he had -- what he 

had not done before is provide a written narrative 

report much like the railroad's appraiser did, but the 

valuation work sheets that are attached as part of the 

joint exhibit basically set out the calculations. Then 

when he did his full appraisal report, it includes 

certain narrative materials, certain explanation of the 

various methods he used. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking for the

trial. And it seemed to me quite absurd to say we have 

to defer to -- to this novice in the field, and -- and 

not look at the -- at the testimony of -- of someone who 

has done a lot of it before.

thousand of these types of appraisals. He has taught in

comes down as it probably will in every case, to a 

battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other 

area where we say that a district court cannot look at 

the methodology used by an expert in determining whether 

or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?

special statute and again I think what CSX is asking for 

this -- for this Court to do is create a special rule 

for it which gives it, unique among taxpayers, as far as 

we are aware, the right to come into Federal court and 

challenge each and every decision that the State has 

made in valuing property for property taxes and have the 

Federal court redetermine that value.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- I take it to 

determine how far you could go with that, I take it 

though in your view if the State's appraiser had never 

done an appraisal before in his life, if he were plucked 

off the street by the State and said, you know, 

"appraise the railroad property; we are making you a 

State appraiser," on your view the district court could 

not look behind that?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, the district court could 

certainly thoroughly examine the way in which the -- the 

reasonable valuation methodologies that the State 

selected were applied.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. But the selection 

of the methodology by the guy off the street could not 

be examined.

 MR. CALVERT: Well -- well, Your Honor, we 

think the methodology has to at least be reasonable.

JUSTICE SOUTER: It happens to be the one 

that gives the highest number. But it's a recognized 

methodology and there are certain -- certainly examples 

in which that methodology has been used, and I take it 

that if the guy off the street picks one of those, and 

that's all we know about it, the district court on your 

view cannot look behind it.

 MR. CALVERT: I'd say that's correct. If 

it's a widely used accepted valuation methodology like 

the ones the State used in this case, that the question 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what you have 

here. I've looked -- I've looked at your footnote and I

experience including well over a thousand valuations --

method of evaluation, right?

 MR. CALVERT: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the whole issue here is 

that that method of valuation, however expert he is at 

it, is not proper here. It doesn't work. That there

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was one of the ones, yes; 

but that's not the only one. That's the only one he is 

an expert in.

 MR. CALVERT: Both sides agree that the unit 

rule is appropriate in this case. The question then is 

how to -- how to determine what the unit value of the 

company was; but there is no dispute in this case that 

the unit rule is appropriate. So the appraisals that 

the State's appraiser had performed under the unit rule 

are exactly the type of appraisals --

rule and the choice between the unit rule and what we 

refer to as the summation approach, the specific dispute 

in this case has been between the various methods for 

determining what the unit value of the company was for 

2002 under the unit rule -- but the argument that CSX is 

making in this case would also put -- put into play a 

State's most fundamental methodological choice between 

the unit rule and the summation approaches, and CSX's 

reply brief admits as such.

 The railroads had made -- had made such an 

argument in the Chesapeake Western case out of the 

Fourth Circuit where -- where Virginia's courts had held 

that the unit rule was not an appropriate valuation 

method under their statutes to arrive at fair market 

value, the railroads came in and said under the 4-R Act, 

we are entitled to put on proof under the unit rule as 

to what our fair market value, that the Federal statute 

makes all that open; the district court has to consider 

all that evidence. And what the -- and the Fourth 

Circuit rejected that argument, but that's the 

implication.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if what if the 

State elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation 

method, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates 

the value of the railroad?

to accurately account for obsolescence. My 

understanding of the objection --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there are 

problems with a particular methodology, the methodology 

can be challenged?

 MR. CALVERT: It's possible, Your Honor, 

that a reproduction cost methodology might -- might so 

inadequately deal with the issue of obsolescence that 

you just have to say that's not a reasonable 

methodology, as applied to railroads.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How could you say it on 

your theory?

 MR. CALVERT: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How could you say it 

consistently with your position here?

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I think, Your Honor, the 

court is allowed to examine whether you have a --

whether the State has used a reasonable methodology.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the court 

have an opportunity or the right to examine whether any 

particular methodology is reasonable as applied to this 

taxpayer and this kind of property at this time?

question of whether you have properly applied a

JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought -- I thought you 

were saying that the reproduction method had such severe 

problems associated with it that it simply would not be 

a fair methodology to use and at least a reviewing 

court, a district court could -- could draw that 

conclusion. I thought that was your answer.

 MR. CALVERT: Well, I think it depends, Your 

Honor, on if you have a reproduction cost method that 

you have applied to property that -- property that has 

only just recently been purchased, then I don't think 

you're going to have a problem with it at all, even --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We are talking about the 

railroads like CSX, and I thought your answer was that 

a -- a district court could conclude that as applied in 

a case like this, that there are so many problems that 

it simply would not be a reasonable valuation method.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then well then 

how do you draw a line?

argument they have made in this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's assume I'm 

making that argument now in my question. Why -- why can 

you draw the line that you want to draw?

 MR. CALVERT: Well again, I think that goes 

to whether the application is going to be -- is going to 

be reasonable in the particular situation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And your 

argument is that it's not reasonable because it must 

overstate the value by a particular percentage or 

number.

 And I think Justice Souter's question is: 

Well, where do you draw the line?

 If you say it's not reasonable because it 

overstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that 

overstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not --

MR. CALVERT: Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- keeping in mind 

all the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to 

12 billion.

of the appraisers had, you would have a variation, 

maybe, of about 20 percent either way. Again, I 

don't think that's going to be determinative as to 

whether you've got a reasonable methodology, whether 

it's been properly applied, and what that range is. I 

think that's the nature of the -- of the appraisal task 

that States have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Calvert, can you tell 

me how this thing works, or how it may work in the 

future?

 Does the State just whip up a number and lay 

it on the railroad, or -- or, in fact, is there some 

discussion each year between the railroad's experts and 

the -- and the State's experts as to what the right 

number should be?

 MR. CALVERT: What happens, Your Honor, is 

that the railroad returns are filed with the State; and 

there is a period of time during which the State 

examines those returns, takes the evaluation 

methodologies that it has selected, applies it to the 

data that it has for those particular companies, comes 

up with numbers. Those -- that information, typically, 

is shared with the railroads.

firmly and says: Cough up the money?

 MR. CALVERT: Typically, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I take it this question 

about the unit rule -- I take it Georgia is figuring out 

what the entire value of the railroad is throughout the 

country. Have other States had to make the same 

determination to apply their unit rules?

 MR. CALVERT: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let's say, do Tennessee 

and Mississippi have to also apply the unit rule to 

value the property of this particular railroad?

 MR. CALVERT: I think -- I think the 

majority of States that value railroad property use the 

unit rule.

to find out what other -- figures other States have come 

up with? Because you're all taking the same answer,

rule?

 MR. CALVERT: We are, Your Honor, though if 

a State is using a different methodology to determine 

the unit rule, I think you would probably expect --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the evidence shows 

that 49 States have come up with a valuation of $5 

billion, and you use a method that comes up with $8 

billion? Would that be admissible evidence?

 MR. CALVERT: I think it probably would be, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And does the record 

contain any such evidence in this case? Do we know what 

other States have found.

 MR. CALVERT: I think the evidence in this 

case was that the State of Georgia's unit value, at 

least within the southeast States, was -- was the 

largest number.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Was the highest?

 MR. CALVERT: That's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't that raise some 

suspicion about maybe they have a different approach 

than is commonly applied seeking precisely the same 

answer to precisely the same question?

State did was not only to make some changes in its 

valuation methodologies, but it also made a fairly 

significant change in the income numbers that the State 

was using to apply its discounted cash flow analysis.

 And specifically what it did: It started 

using -- instead of numbers from the regulatory report, 

the R-1 report that the railroads filed with the Surface 

Transportation Board, it began to use income numbers 

from the annual reports to shareholders.

 There is a significant difference in those 

numbers, and the testimony in this case was that the 47 

percent increase that CSX saw in its assessment from 

2001 to 2002 was attributable to the difference in the 

income numbers that were being used.

 I suspect that for many of the other States 

that have low numbers for CSX, that they still use 

numbers from the regulatory reports as opposed to the 

annual reports.

 So that's one reason that I believe we've 

got -- we had such a larger number for 2002 than many 

other States, because our appraiser was looking to the 

correct income numbers.

 If I could, just in the remaining time that 

I've got, I'd like to mention a couple of points. The 

CSX has contended that this line between method and

application is simply unworkable; and, therefore, the 

Court shouldn't recognize any -- any such distinction 

under the statute.

 We think there are a couple points where the 

lines are clear. One is between the unit rule and the 

summation approaches. The brief filed by the 

Association of American Railroads acknowledges that 

those are two different methods.

 It's not -- one could not say that a stock 

and debt method is just an application of discounted 

cash flow, so there are certain places where those lines 

are clear.

 We believe the fact that the line may not 

always be -- or the boundaries may not always be 

perfectly distinct, or that the test may not always be 

what it might be easy to describe in the abstract -- it 

doesn't mean that the distinction should not be 

recognized at all under the statute.

 Also, there is the way in which the Eleventh 

Circuit formulated the test where the Eleventh Circuit 

said a line bar between method and application was 

between nonfactual determinations used in constructing 

the valuation process, however broad or narrow they 

might be.

 The Court said that constitutes the method.

Everything else is an application.

 The suggestion has been made by the 

Solicitor General in their brief that -- that that means 

as long as the State can announce or can set out its 

valuation rule in general enough terms, make it general 

enough, then that will become part of the method and not 

part of the application.

 I think if the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is 

read in context, the Eleventh circuit didn't say that.

 Specifically, the Eleventh circuit was 

distinct -- was saying -- was rejecting the argument in 

that case that only the distinction between the unit 

rule and the summation approach is -- was the only 

methodological distinction. And the Court was saying: 

We think that differences in methodologies include the 

stock and debt, the discounted cash flow, and the market 

multiples approaches used in this case.

 So the Eleventh Circuit did go and consider 

the argument that the State had -- should not have used 

a 6.3 percent terminal growth rate in the discounted 

cash flow analysis even though that it used that in --

in all -- for all public utilities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Calvert. Mr. Phillips, you have three minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I will try to be brief. First of all, 

Justice Stevens, in response to your question on the 

comparisons between Georgia and other States, on page 22 

of our cert petition we pointed out that in the 2006 tax 

year Georgia and Florida had adopted unit values of 

$11.2 billion and $12.9 billion; whereas, every other 

State in those jurisdictions that used the unit value 

had an assessment value of $7.1 billion. And the 

Respondent State did not question that.

 So I mean the reality is there are wide 

swings, and it does make a difference what methodology 

you do, and it's part of the reason why it's absolutely 

critical that the Court should enforce the language of 

the statute. As Justice Scalia quite properly 

recognizes, it is the true market value.

 And this is not a statute like, for 

instance, 28 U.S.C. 1254(d)(1) in AEDPA, which says the 

Federal courts should defer to any reasonable 

determination by the State courts in a judgment Federal 

law.

 This is a statute that vests the district 

court with the exclusive authority to make the

determination of the true market value.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean I assume 

that's in the normal context of the adversary process. 

In other words, the district court does not necessarily 

have to come up with a number independent of what the 

parties present to it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It can decide which 

of the presentations is closer to true market value.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. And that's -- and 

that's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice. There 

isn't any single method that's out there. All we have 

are a series of evidences of value, and the district 

court needs to be able to evaluate them without regard 

to some kind of thumb on the scale of the State, in 

favor of the State. And as you asked the question, you 

know, is there any other valuation process that would 

work this way, the answer was no. And the problem is 

that there is nothing in this, in this statute that 

remotely suggests that Congress would have wanted to do 

anything other than the ordinary or typical valuation in 

this context.

 Justice Souter, I think you made the point, 

which is the one I wanted to make in my opening 

statement, which is how is it possible that Congress

recognizes decades of discrimination involving tens or 

hundreds of millions of dollars would have said and now 

when you get to the point of trying to correct that 

discrimination, what are you going to do? Defer to the 

entity that's been discriminating for all of those 

years. It is at least passing strange, if not 

incredible to think that that's what Congress meant.

 It is much more sensible to think that 

Congress wanted the district court to serve as a serious 

check on what the state did. That's what we didn't get 

in this case. That's what we are entitled to. I urge 

the Court to vacate and to revamp.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Phillips, the case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
