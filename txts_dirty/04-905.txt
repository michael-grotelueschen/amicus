 [10:04 a.m.]

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first 

today in Volvo Trucks North America versus Reeder-Simco GMC.

 Mr. Englert.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Sixty-six years elapsed between the passage of the 

Robinson-Patman Act and the judgment of the District Court in 

this case. In that time, there is no reported instance of a 

finding of a violation by a seller operating in an industry like 

this one in which a sale is made to the plaintiff distributor 

if, and only if, it has already secured a contract for resale to 

a particular end user. Courts have long understood that mere 

offers at different prices cannot violate the Act, because it 

requires two purchases, and that successful purchases in 

winner-take-all bidding cannot have the requisite effect on 

competition. To affirm the judgment below would open up new 

vistas for application of the Robinson-Patman Act where it has 

never been applied before.

 This case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You concede, though, don't 

you, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the

conduct here?

 MR. ENGLERT: Very much the opposite, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have a person 

who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price 

that they offer to different purchasers. Now, I know your 

argument about the structure, but the actual language does seem 

to encompass the activity.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, I don't agree, with respect, 

Your Honor. With respect to mere offers, offering a price to 

different purchasers is not covered by the statutory language. 

With respect to the sales-to-sales comparisons, there is not the 

requisite effect of such discrimination --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to --

MR. ENGLERT: -- on competition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- get to your first point, 

the statute talks about discrimination in price between 

different purchasers, and not different actual purchases.

 MR. ENGLERT: But this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't seem it's that 

much of a stretch to cover would-be purchasers, potential 

purchasers.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, except that, back in 1947, this 

Court, in the Bruce's Juices case, made clear, in the early days 

of the Act, that it takes two completed sales to violate the 

Act. No one sale can violate the Act. Even earlier than that,

the Third Circuit, in the Shaw's case, in 1939, laid down that 

rule, and it's been an accepted rule of Robinson-Patman Act 

jurisprudence for that entire time. And it is a natural reading 

of the statute, and in accordance with the general principle, 

that this statute should be construed consistently with the 

larger body of antitrust law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I not ask, Isn't it true 

that each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was a 

purchaser? I mean, the -- Reeder was a purchaser, was he not? 

They were a dealer.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So, they were a purchaser. And 

were not the other people who purchased from Volvo also 

purchasers?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. With respect to the sales- --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So there were --

MR. ENGLERT: -- -to-sales transactions --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- two purchasers. 

MR. ENGLERT: Well, with respect to the 

sales-to-sales transactions in which there were --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Over a --

MR. ENGLERT: -- two purchases --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- period of time, you had two 

purchasers.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. But the statutory language is

the effect of "such discrimination" must be to harm competition 

in one of these justified instances.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the discrimination occurred 

over a period of a couple of years, as I understand it.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. This case was tried 

on the basis of several discrete transaction comparisons. It 

was not tried on the basis of any systematic study of every 

offer to Reeder and every offer to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if --

MR. ENGLERT: -- another --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- these are ordinary automobile 

dealers who sold out of inventory, would you agree that they 

were -- you had two purchasers?

 MR. ENGLERT: Sure.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that the whole point of your 

case is they're negotiated transactions?

 MR. ENGLERT: The whole point of the case is the --

is twofold. Each transaction is one in which there is a 

purchase if, and only if, there is already a contract for 

resale, so that when there is an offer compared to a purchase, 

you don't have two purchases. And when you've already got the 

contract for resale --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- I mean, you say that, 

but the title goes to the dealer. The dealer makes the 

purchase. Aren't you -- as I understand your answer to Justice

Stevens, and also your answer to the Chief Justice, if these 

were automobile dealers that sold some inventory, there would be 

a cause of action if you extrapolate this -- these kind of 

facts. One dealer being discriminated against, vis-a-vis 

another dealer.

 MR. ENGLERT: If the requisite effect on competition 

is shown, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if there was a sale to 

the other dealer. You would say that there had to be a sale to 

the other dealer.

 MR. ENGLERT: There have to be two sales.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just an --

MR. ENGLERT: But there would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not just an offer to the other 

dealer --

MR. ENGLERT: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- of higher prices.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there would be sales if 

they were selling from inventory. I mean, there would have been 

a preceding sale, and the sale would have been at differential 

prices, as between two dealers.

 MR. ENGLERT: And that's the typical --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. ENGLERT: -- Robinson-Patman case. That's the 

case in which there is a potential violation. The case in which

there is a sale by the purchaser if, but only if -- I'm sorry, 

the case in which there is a purchase by the purchaser if, but 

only if, it already has the sale is the case in which it can't 

have lost that sale in competition with a favored dealer because 

of price discrimination, which is what the statutory language 

requires, which is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert --

MR. ENGLERT: -- why the Robinson-Patman Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suppose you had a case of 

two Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially 

ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial 

period of time, one dealer -- we'll call that dealer the 

"favored dealer" -- consistently gets higher concessions, and 

the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case, 

consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions. So, 

we don't have a picture of what you call "mix and match," but 

two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and 

one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on 

sales or making sales at a very low profit. That, too, would be 

out of Robinson-Patman, if I understand your view of the 

statute.

 MR. ENGLERT: It -- yes, I think that's correct. 

That's a closer case to what's the -- what the statute was 

designed to cover than this case, but, yes, that, too, would be 

out of Robinson-Patman.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, you go back to the language --

are you finished with that answer? Go ahead and finish, if you 

want.

 MR. ENGLERT: Enough for now, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. ENGLERT: -- yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In respect to the language, how do 

you read it? I think it's ambiguous. "To discriminate in price 

between different purchasers of commodities." Do you read it --

"different purchaser" -- "to discriminate in price in respect to 

that commodity that is purchased"? Do you read it "to 

discriminate in price between different purchasers of 

commodities -- i.e., the commodity, the particular item -- the 

commodity there refers to the particular item in respect to 

which there is the discrimination"? How do you want to read it, 

literally? I just want your --

MR. ENGLERT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- literal reading of the statute 

to -- I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it. I 

agree with you, policy reasons, very strongly on your side. I 

agree with you, at least hypothetically, but for the particular 

language. So, look at the phrase and read the language as you 

want me to read it.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, two different issues, Justice 

Breyer. With respect to the two-purchase rule, if the statutory

language is ambiguous, and if it can be read to say "purchaser 

status is enough," then I think the principle stated in all of 

this Court's cases, that the Robinson-Patman Act --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're giving --

MR. ENGLERT: -- should be construed --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- me a policy argument. I don't 

want a policy argument, for the moment. I want to know -- what 

you're saying is that the word "purchaser" means "purchaser in 

respect to the particular commodity -- this one that is 

purchased, there has to be a discrimination in price."

 MR. ENGLERT: And there's a textual reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: And what you're hearing, I think, 

is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect 

to which there was no discrimination in price. So, he is a 

purchaser of that commodity. You see, "commodity" could refer 

to the kind of thing -- Volvo trucks -- or it could refer to the 

particular thing -- this truck. And I want to know how you read 

the literal language.

 MR. ENGLERT: The textual answer to your question is 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's all I want --

MR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the textual answer.

 MR. ENGLERT: -- the phrase "the effect of such 

competition" ties --

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. I'm very --

MR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry, the effect of such --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- sorry. The effect of such 

competition --

MR. ENGLERT: -- discrimination.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- was conceded in this case, that 

there's the effect on the competition. There are two separate 

things. There is the truck that was purchased by the disfavored 

dealer. In respect to that, he wasn't hurt, in the sense of the 

statute, because, even though he got a lower profit margin, that 

doesn't count. I'm not focusing on that.

 I am focusing upon the truck that he did not 

purchase. The reason that the disfavored dealer did not 

purchase that truck is that he had a rival -- maybe there's only 

one case of it, but there's at least one -- he had a rival, the 

favored dealer, who got the purchase. He got the order from the 

customer, and then ordered the truck. Now, in that one, I take 

it, the problem is that there was no purchase by the disfavored 

dealer.

 MR. ENGLERT: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But what you're hearing 

is, "So what? He was a dealer whose line of business was to 

purchase Volvo trucks, and, therefore, he is a purchaser of a 

commodity -- namely, Volvo trucks."

 MR. ENGLERT: Well --

 JUSTICE BREYER: And there was a discrimination --

namely, the offer was discriminatory. And there was a harm to 

competition, in the -- in the Robinson-Patman sense -- his rival 

got the sale.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, I still question whether --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, I want the textual answer.

 MR. ENGLERT: Okay. I still question whether the --

under the text -- the effect of such discrimination was the 

requisite effect on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. ENGLERT: -- competition. But --

JUSTICE BREYER: The effect of such discrimination 

is that his next-door rival, in effect, "got the sale." Do you 

want to say that isn't enough?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes, I do want to say that isn't 

enough. And, Justice Breyer, first of all, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree with you 

about that. Now --

MR. ENGLERT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- what?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, I thought you were 

relying on the succeeding phrase, where "either or any of the 

purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce," 

which seems to require that -- "to discriminate in price between 

different purchasers where either or any of the purchases

involved in such discrimination" -- I thought that's what you 

were hanging your hat on, to say that there has to be a 

discrimination in particular sales.

 MR. ENGLERT: I think the statute, read as a whole, 

compels that conclusion. But if I'm wrong about that, and if 

there is enough ambiguity to admit of a different conclusion, 

then the principle comes into play that cases of ambiguity in 

the Robinson-Patman Act are construed to be more consistent with 

the overall --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, if we can go back 

to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities 

of "like grade and quality." And that seems to me to indicate 

that Volvo Trucks, generically, must be looked at -- the policy, 

with reference to Volvo trucks, generically. Suppose one dealer 

always got a 10 percent discount, the other dealer always got a 

20 percent discount over a period of time.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, I think everyone, 

including the lower courts in this case, agrees that you don't 

look at the goods generically. You have to look at their 

characteristics to determine like grade and quality. And I 

would actually think that the grade --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It has to be purchase-by-purchase 

to determine like grade or quality?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Every Robinson-Patman case 

there's ever been has been purchase-by-purchase at the level of

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. That's --

MR. ENGLERT: -- sale from the manufacturer to the 

dealer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You've put your finger right on it.

 My question is so obvious that you're not giving me an answer. 

Every case for 60 years has been on your side of it. Those 

judges, though, were -- must have been reading some language. 

And how did they interpret that language? That's all I'm asking 

you. A very literal question. It has nothing to do with policy 

or anything. And all I want you to do is take the statute and 

read the language so that it is possible for you to win this 

case.

 MR. ENGLERT: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. ENGLERT: I'm a manufacturer. I'm reading the 

statute. I have to give a price on a particular deal. I 

realize I can't discriminate in price between different 

purchasers of like grade and quality, where the effect of such 

discrimination may be one of the prohibited effects. I say, 

"Okay, can I give a different price to one dealer or to 

another?" Yes, I can, because it says "different purchasers of 

commodities of like grade and quality." It is a specific 

instance of a purchase, a specific instance of discrimination. 

The very words in the statute are what judges have read

consistently to compel that result.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, just to 

get it in the -- Supposing volvo had a policy of granting 

everybody a 20 percent concession, and they had -- except 

Reeder -- and they always granted Reeder just a 15 percent 

concession, and the -- you had the same sales pattern you have 

here. Would there be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, again --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Prima facie violation.

 MR. ENGLERT: I think the answer is no, Your Honor, 

although that -- although that would be a closer case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if there --

MR. ENGLERT: -- than this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- were dozens and dozens --

MR. ENGLERT: This case was tried on the basis of 

the same transactions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of sales to both.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes. That would be a closer 

case. But the -- it might fit the policy of the Act, but it's a 

very poor fit with the words of the statute. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it depends on how -- whether 

you regard the purchase as on a single -- each single 

transaction as a separate purchase or if you look at a course of 

dealing and say that, over a period of years, the favored dealer 

is one purchaser and the disfavored dealer is the other

purchaser. Why can't you look at the pattern of dealing by 

automobile dealers over a period of time?

 MR. ENGLERT: That would be the argument in favor of 

an expansive reading of the language in the hypothetical example 

to cover that case. But it would not be consistent with the 

general policies of antitrust law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be consistent with the 

literal language, wouldn't it? If you treat it, the purchaser, 

as a -- as -- look not at just individual transactions, but what 

they do over a period of years, just like any other -- any 

ordinary automobile dealer. Two dealers in this market, one in 

Arlington and one in Bethesda, are both purchasers, even though 

they may not compete on the same transactions, aren't they?

 MR. ENGLERT: No. The effect of such discrimination 

has to be to harm competition with the favored purchaser. And 

if all transactions are hermetically sealed from one another, 

yes, the buyer might like a better price, but it's not 

complaining about the effect of such discrimination on 

competition with the favored purchaser. 

To put this point in perspective, imagine that Volvo 

raised its price to every so-called favored purchaser --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But --

MR. ENGLERT: -- in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree, in my 

hypothetical, there's discrimination, but you'd say there's no

come and say, "Well, these two dealers are in the same relevant 

market, and there's a likelihood that customers go to the 

favored dealer," that would not be a prima facie --

MR. ENGLERT: Oh, if you have that evidence?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. ENGLERT: That there is a likelihood that, in a 

pattern, customers have gone to the favored dealer? That's --

that begins to come within the statutory language in a way this 

case does not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand --

MR. ENGLERT: There is no customer testimony, no 

evidence of diversion to any favored dealer in this case, no 

evidence that Reeder lost profits because of the price given to 

any favored dealer, only evidence that if Reeder had gotten a 

price, it would have -- better price -- it would have made more 

money. Well, every dealer can show that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your argument 

that there's no injury or impact in competition for resale of 

the trucks. What's wrong with looking at the statute as being 

concerned to protect competition to be the Volvo dealer? In 

other words, you know, they're competing -- if Volvo's 

restructuring its approach, they're competing to be the favored 

dealer, even though they don't compete with other Volvo dealers 

directly.

 MR. ENGLERT: The main problem with that 

interpretation of the statute is, it takes the last phrase of 

the statute and makes it no longer a limiting phrase. It 

essentially makes all price discrimination illegal. And this 

Court said, in Brooke Group, and has said in many other cases, 

that it is not -- not all price discrimination is made illegal 

by this statute. It does require the requisite effect on 

competition.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 Mr. Hungar.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

plaintiff who did not purchase goods for resale in competition 

with a favored purchaser can, nonetheless, establish all the 

elements of a Robinson-Patman Act claim by picking and choosing 

from among different aspects of unrelated transactions. The 

position of the United States is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But how can you say --

MR. HUNGAR: -- that the answer is no.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the dealer didn't purchase 

goods for resale in competition with other Volvo dealers? 

That's exactly what they do every day, isn't it?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. When they purchase the 

goods, they are not in competition with any other Volvo dealer. 

By definition, they have the sale. And so, if --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can't they be --

MR. HUNGAR: That's the point that I'm making.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in competition just from -- on 

a day-to-day basis over the years, over a period of time, trying 

to get business?

 MR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, they may be in 

competition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Assuming --

MR. HUNGAR: -- with other --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- they're in the same relevant 

market, of course.

 MR. HUNGAR: In a different sense, yes. But the

point is, the price discrimination does not occur when there is 

any competition. And, therefore, the requirements of the Act 

are not satisfied.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're assuming they're not in 

competition on a continuing basis, they're only in competition 

for one isolated transaction after another.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- they may be, in 

other senses, and in -- and in seeking other customers, in a --

in some sense, in competition with other Volvo dealers. But, at 

the point that the price discrimination occurs, they are not. 

And, therefore, even in the -- in the -- in the -- well, in any 

of the examples offered by the Respondents in this case, they 

don't show price discrimination between competing purchasers, 

which is what this Court, in the Morton Salt case and in other 

cases, have indicated the Act was aimed at. And as Mr. Englert 

indicated, that is why, in the 70 years since the 

Robinson-Patman Act was enacted, we haven't seen cases like 

this, because it is understood that the Act has no application 

in these circumstances, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Two --

MR. HUNGAR: -- I would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- two dealers within 10 miles of 

each other, customers frequently go to both dealers to check out 

-- to get the lowest price. Dealer A gets 10 percent discount 

routinely; Dealer B, 20 percent discount routinely. Over a

period of time, would there be a violation of the 

Robinson-Patman Act?

 MR. HUNGAR: And all the same structure as this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. HUNGAR: -- hypothetical? Well, the answer is 

no, but only for, I think, one of the several reasons why in 

this case the answer is no. That is, in your hypothetical they 

are, in a sense -- and I'm assuming that there might be direct 

head-to-head competition, but the offers are different -- or 

affected by the differing differentials. So, there is -- there 

is competition between the purchasers, and there is 

discrimination in offers, although not in purchases. So, there 

is still the two-purchaser requirement which is not satisfied in 

that circumstance. There is the -- Reeder is not purchasing in 

-- assuming it loses the sale to the other customer, it's not 

purchasing in competition with a favored customer, a favored 

dealer, because it's not purchasing at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so --

MR. HUNGAR: But I would point out that even if the 

Court is unwilling to go that far in this case, that you don't 

need to go that far to resolve this case and to reverse the 

judgment below for the other -- because of the other failings in 

the plaintiff's case here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the -- and the main 

failing there is that Volvo Trucks and Reeder-Simco do not

compete in the same market for sales of Volvo trucks. Is that a 

correct statement of the record?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think I would put it that 

way. I think, again, they don't compete at the point at which 

the price --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For any --


MR. HUNGAR: -- discrimination occurs.


 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- particular sales.


 MR. HUNGAR: Right. Yes. 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I see.


 MR. HUNGAR: And that's --


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.


 MR. HUNGAR: -- right. Other than -- there are the


-- the two examples of what have been called head-to-head 

competition, in one of which there was clearly no price 

discrimination, in the other of which our reading of the record 

is that a reasonable jury could not have found that there was 

price discrimination. And even if there were price 

discrimination, that one instance, standing alone, could not 

support a finding of a Robinson-Patman Act --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not?


 MR. HUNGAR: -- violation.

the one?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Hiland Dairy?

 MR. HUNGAR: -- because there's no substantial 

injury to competition.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, a -- I mean, you 

could go in -- I see that. But what -- is there any authority 

for that, that just one -- a head-to-head competition, he bought 

the truck. Let's -- keep that out of it, so imagine they bought 

the truck, they resold it, and the market structure is such 

there probably is quite a lot of competition, in fact, with 

other dealers, and they lost at least one sale. That's not 

enough to prove an injury to competition?

 MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. I mean, 

clearly --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the authority for that?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, certainly the Morton Salt 

inference wouldn't apply, because there's no substantial --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different matter. That's a 

-- what -- I'm saying, What authority is there -- have there 

been cases in which that was not viewed? After all, let's 

suppose the dealers are located geographically in about the same 

place, and it's logical to think they'd go for the same 

customers. They overlap. Their territories are close. Logical 

to think people shop around for trucks. And we have in the 

record one item where they -- one instance in which they found 

the customer, and he said, "Yeah, I did -- I did go and shop in

both. I lost" -- the disfavored dealer lost the sale.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Any authority?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, this Court's cases, and the lower 

courts', have understood the Act to require a likelihood of a 

substantial injury to competition --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say, "This is our 

evidence that it is likely." Just what I said.

 MR. HUNGAR: But one sale is not substantial, Your 

Honor, I would submit. And, moreover, in this case, of course, 

they don't have that evidence of the close dealer with whom they 

are in repeated competition for the same customers that -- and 

so, I don't think we have that case. We don't have a 

substantial injury, even if you assume -- even if you read the 

evidence the way they do with respect to the one head-to-head 

competition.

 And it's important to understand that this -- the 

two-purchaser rule is not the only flaw in the judgment below. 

The Act requires causation. That is, the price differential 

must cause the injury to competition. Here, it's not the price 

differential that causes the injury, in the sense that the 

Robinson-Patman Act addresses. The Act is addressed to the 

situation where they're competing head to head, the favored 

purchaser has a competitive -- a relative competitive advantage 

which allows them to offer a lower price and, thereby, either

get the sale or reduce the profits of the competing purchaser. 

But that's simply not the case here in these sales-to-sales or 

offers-to-sales competitions. The fact that some other dealer 

in some other transaction with some other customer got a better 

price has absolutely no relevance, no significance, and no 

effect on Reeder's ability to get a sale or make a profit in its 

transactions with an unrelated customer. So, there -- the 

causation element that's so crucial under the Act is absolutely 

missing here.

 And, in fact, Reeder's interpretation would simply 

read the injury requirement out of the statute. They would say, 

"Whenever there is a price differential, we've been injured, 

because if we had gotten the lower price instead of the higher 

price, we would have made more money." So, there's per se 

injury. The Morton Salt inference is converted into an 

irrebuttable presumption --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

MR. HUNGAR: -- contrary --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Mr. Hungar, do you agree with 

Mr. Englert that even if you had -- you could -- you had a case 

based on two dealers, one consistently gets higher concessions, 

one consistently gets lower concessions, and they're in roughly 

the same market -- that even that would not be covered by 

Robinson-Patman?

 MR. HUNGAR: And they're in repeated head-to-head

competition for the same customers -- one gets -- they're

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I --

MR. HUNGAR: -- differential offers? Is that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I'm not putting the 

head-to-head in. Just, one of his sales gets lower concessions; 

one, higher. That's --

MR. HUNGAR: I agree that that would not be 

actionable under the Robinson-Patman Act. The reasons why --

the reason, or reasons, why depend on whether they are in 

head-to-head competition or not. If they're never in 

head-to-head competition, then they're never in competition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just --

MR. HUNGAR: -- and they would fail to have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- modify Justice Ginsburg's 

question a little bit. Supposing, over a period of years, one 

dealer always got 15 percent off, and the other one always got 

20 percent, and there's testimony they're in the same relevant 

market, so presumably customers can go to either one. What more 

do they have to prove to establish a prima facie case?

 MR. HUNGAR: They have to prove at least what Morton 

Salt said, which is price differentials between competing 

purchasers. And the way the purchasers were competing in Morton 

Salt was that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand --

market in which customers patronize both of them from time to 

time, but they can't identify that Mr. Smith was here on this 

day, and the other dealer on the same day, but just an 

overlapping in the -- in the same competitive market. Would 

that not create a prima facie case? And if not, how much more 

would they have to prove?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in this market, they'd have to 

show that they were purchasers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

MR. HUNGAR: -- at --

They're dealers, in my hypothesis. Each of them buys a hundred 

cars a year, and one of them pays a higher price than the other,

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, right. But, as Justice Scalia 

pointed out, the Act clearly does not apply to offers. It 

requires purchases --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand.


 MR. HUNGAR: -- and it requires --


JUSTICE STEVENS: In my case --


MR. HUNGAR: -- sales.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- there are a hundred purchases


by each of them at different prices. What more do they have to 

prove, other than that they were in the same relevant market?

 MR. HUNGAR: They have to prove that they were in 

competition with each other and that competition was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, isn't the fact they're --

MR. HUNGAR: -- injured by --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the same --

MR. HUNGAR: -- the differential.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- relevant market enough to prove 

they're in competition with each other?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because -- it's not 

enough to prove they're in competition with each other. They 

have to prove that they are in -- that the price differential 

injured, or was likely to injure, substantially, that 

competition. And that is not true if they aren't competing in 

connection with the transactions --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if you're looking at --

MR. HUNGAR: -- in which the price discrimination 

occurs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if you're looking at broad 

market competition, you don't normally require them to identify 

competition on a customer -- on a per-customer basis. The only 

reason we get into the per-customer basis is that we have this 

odd -- not an odd situation, but the situation with Volvo trucks 

that no dealer ever buys unless he's already got a -- got a sale 

waiting. But in Justice Stevens' hypothetical, we -- as long as 

the market was identified, and as long as they were buying, we 

wouldn't require anything more to show competition, would we?

 MR. HUNGAR: May I answer?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, if -- I understood Justice 

Stevens' hypothetical to address the situation where, as in this 

circumstance, they are not competing at the point at which they 

actually purchase --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

 MR. HUNGAR: -- the product. If it were the 

traditional Robinson-Patman Act case, where they purchase for 

inventory and are both trying to sell the same goods to the same 

customers, then yes, the problems that we've identified here 

would not exist.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 It seems to me there are three issues that have been 

posed by the way both this case has been argued by the parties 

on the other side and as the questions have arisen. And the 

first one is whether or not there is competition in this 

particular case. And Justice Stevens' question, it seems to me, 

posed the issue about as starkly as it can be: Is it not the 

case that under traditional standards of Tampa Electric, this 

Court's decision there, and a host of other cases, that we 

define "competition" by reference to whether or not entities 

compete for the same -- with respect to the same product in the 

same market, same region, and if they're -- if that's what you 

have by way of competition, then you look to the next level, 

which is to see: Is there price discrimination, and is there 

injury to that competition?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What evidence was there of 

competition here? How -- did you bring forward instances where 

they both bid for sale of special trucks to a single 

repurchaser?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we clearly did that with the --

with the Hiland case. That was -- that was clear. But the 

testimony was uncontested on both sides. Both Reeder's --

Reeder testified, "We compete against other dealers every day." 

And Volvo's witness testified --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not other Volvo dealers.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, other Volvo dealers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Volvo policy 

was, if you had two dealers competing for the same sale, they 

gave the same discount to each dealer.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's not the competition. 

That's the question as whether there is discrimination. The 

question is, Do Volvo dealers compete against other Volvo 

dealers, in the first instance? And with respect to that, the 

testimony was absolutely clear, it's in the -- witnesses for 

Volvo -- are quoted in our brief at page 8 -- explicitly say, 

"We compete, on a daily basis, in the region and the district, 

Volvo dealer to Volvo dealer." 

Now, there's a separate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's never -- but, in 

those situations, there's never two purchases, there's always 

one -- there's only one completed purchase.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- again, there are lots of 

situations where there are two purchasers. Again, you go back 

to the -- to the four specific transactions that were 

identified. For the 102 sales, 55 percent of the sales between

1996 and 2000 involve -- I mean, 1998 -- involved 

direct-comparison sales, where we purchased from Volvo, and one 

of our competitors 200 miles down the road -- and on interstate 

highways, 200 miles down the road's the same as next door -- and 

we -- we purchased exactly the same product, and we got a 

significantly lower concession --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- under the circumstances.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that was for a resale to 

-- that was for resale to different purchasers.

 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, it was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nobody's buying two --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- for resale.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- nobody's buying two 

trucks from two different purchasers.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Anymore than anybody's buying 

two cars from two different purchasers in the -- in the classic 

inventory situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's very hard to compare 

those two sales, because they all depend upon the special 

features on the trucks that are ordered by the particular 

individual, and also how -- you know, how much of a hard bargain 

that individual is driving. I don't know how you can compare a 

sale to one -- one person with XYZ features on the truck with a 

sale to a totally different person with ABC features on the

truck.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, that was precisely 

the defense that Volvo made at trial. They put it to the jury, 

"Remember, it has to be like kind and quality. We are required 

to demonstrate that the truck that we are getting a 10 percent 

discount on and the truck that they're getting a 20 percent 

discount on is exactly the same like kind and quality of truck."

 And that was their defense. And our witness meticulously --

I'd commend the record to you if you want to read it -- but he 

meticulously examined each of those trucks and showed that, 

systematically, for 102 sales, they sold the exact same truck to 

a dealer down the road, with a significantly better price than 

the truck they sold to us, in order to implement the "Volvo 

Vision" and drive my client --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For resale --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- out of the dealership business.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a different purchaser, who 

may have been in a better position with regard to the 

negotiation than any of your customers were.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, he -- but whatever that 

person's position was, vis-a-vis its customer, doesn't affect 

the relationship between Reeder-Simco and Volvo, and that 

individual and Volvo. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it --

MR. PHILLIPS: There, it has to be a level playing

field.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it --

MR. PHILLIPS: That is precisely what 

Robinson-Patman is about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why is it unreasonable -- why 

does it violate the principle of Robinson-Patman, and why does 

it destroy competition, for Volvo to say, "We'll make whatever 

discount it takes to get the sale, and if this dealer needs a 20 

percent discount for this sale, but this other fellow over here 

only needs a 10 percent discount to make that sale, we're going 

to have a differential discount"? Why -- I don't see why that 

harms competition.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- it wouldn't 

necessarily, on an episodic basis. But what you have in this 

case is substantial price discrimination across time, which this 

Court held, under Morton Salt, triggers an inference of 

competitive injury.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the problem that I 

have with even accepting your theory is what the other side 

calls the "mix and match" quality of your evidence. That is, 

you say here's Reeder, disfavored, and here's someone else, 

favored. But it's not consistently the same someone else. And, 

for all we know, someone else could make a case saying, "We 

compare ourselves with Reeder, and we say, oh, there was that 

sale 7 months ago, where they got a whopping discount and we got

a much smaller one." You're not -- you don't have the same 

favored customer. You're picking from a series of sales, and we 

don't know how manipulative this proof is. And we I mean - and 

we don't --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, putting aside the fact, 

Your Honor, that I think that that's essentially a jury question 

-- I mean, I do think both sides get to put on the evidence that 

shows that there's been discrimination and that there -- and 

then we know what the market consequences will be. But if you 

look at plaintiff's exhibit 104, which is in the appendix to the 

Court of Appeals at 577, and you look down that list, you will 

see that they are -- where they're specifically talking about 

Reeder-Simco, and it has -- and it satisfies its 28 percent of 

its overall objective in 1999; and then you go through the 

testimony of Reeder-Simco's co-owner, and he's -- identifies 

each of the four or five competing entities that were the 

beneficiaries of those -- of the price discrimination of those 

sales in the 102 sales that were the basis for liability; and 

their percentages for the objectives during the next -- during 

1999 are 71 percent, 81 percent, 97 percent, 107 percent, 92 

percent -- those are -- those are huge differentials.

sale, it's because Volvo didn't give you a big enough discount. 

It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger 

discount.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's today, Mr. Chief Justice, to 

be sure. But tomorrow, when I go to the next dealer to -- go to 

the next purchaser, the reason I didn't get that sale was 

because I didn't have enough capital to have the same quality of 

salesperson in place to make that sale.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, but, I mean, 

that's -- I mean, long term -- of course, Volvo can terminate 

you, as a dealer, tomorrow. And --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it can't. Under the contract 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and under State -- Arkansas State 

law, it can't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- well, what -- but it --

under the Robinson-Patman Act, it can.

 MR. PHILLIPS: As long as it doesn't discriminate on 

the basis of price --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The classic --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- you're right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- case that the 

Robinson-Patman Act is directed to is when you lose sales 

because they're giving bigger discounts to other sellers. And

that's just not the case here.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But it -- it's not just sales. It's 

always been lost profits, as well. And if we are paying more, 

we're losing money, vis-a-vis our competitors. And then every 

day after that, we're competing with our -- one arm tied behind 

our back because we have less money. And is there any reason to 

doubt that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Volvo's interest may be 

in as -- making as much money off of sales this year, and they 

may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller, 

are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's true. But we know from the 

record that Volvo's purpose in this enterprise was to eliminate 

50 percent of its dealers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and to do so by using price 

discrimination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's a -- that's a broad 

Robinson-Patman principle you're arguing for, that a -- that a 

seller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of its 

distributors makes the same profit?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And if --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- of course not.

way that one of them is making less profit than another, it's 

liable?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, there are -- there are two 

elements to this, Justice Scalia. You first have to demonstrate 

that there's discrimination. And the way you demonstrate 

anticompetitive discrimination is to show that there is a 

consistent pattern. It has to be substantial discrimination 

over a substantial period of time.

 If we're trying to cut deals on a daily basis, 

presumably today you got a deal with a customer, and I'll give 

you a 10 percent, and then the Chief Justice got a deal 

tomorrow, and I may give him 12 percent, but, 2 weeks down the 

line, the situations will likely be flipped out. You're not 

going to find, where you have 55 percent of your sales, 102 

sales involving $250,000-plus of sales differentials to be the 

basis for the claim that there is price discrimination in the 

first instance, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any instance where you 

made an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a 

break that Volvo gives to other dealers -- all right? -- you 

made that offer, and the buyer says, "Yes, I'll take it at that 

price" -- and then you go to Volvo, and they won't give you that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, sure. We had thousands of those 

examples.

buyer --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and the buyer had agreed to buy 

it --

MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and you --

MR. PHILLIPS: Where we -- well, I -- had agreed to 

buy it. We had a -- clearly, there was an understanding. Our 

sales person thought that, "If I can get this discount at this 

rate, I can cut this deal," went to -- went to Volvo, asked for 

that rate, Volvo said no. Didn't get the deal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This is the Robinson --

MR. PHILLIPS: That happened literally more than a 

thousand times. The testimony on that is rampant. And the 

reason we don't make more of that, Justice Scalia, in this 

particular case, is because the jury verdict is based on actual 

sales. There is as very clear fidelity to the two-purchaser 

rule in the way the jury verdict was rendered and the way the 

Court of Appeals affirmed it. That said, I -- a lot of this 

discussion about, you know: Is that two-purchaser rule, in its 

most strict version, the right way to interpret the 

Robinson-Patman Act? Our view is, it's not. But we don't have 

to get there --

JUSTICE BREYER: If it's not, the -- the reason -- I 

thought, for about 60 years, the words "different purchasers of

commodities," it forbids any person to discriminate in price 

between different purchasers of commodities. Now, you have to 

refer -- as soon as I ask the question, or start getting into 

the language, I forget the statute, and it's so complicated that 

I'm giving you time to think about it --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and to think of those words in 

your mind.

 MR. PHILLIPS: All right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a -- it's forbidden to 

discriminate in price between different purchasers of 

commodities.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I had always thought -- and I 

think the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of 

decisions -- that the words "discriminate in price between 

different purchasers of commodities" meant you can't 

discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item, 

or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price 

exists. That's what I thought it meant. And it seems to me 

that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that 

was the general understanding of the courts. And either it's 

not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know 

why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy 

reason for not doing it in respect to the policy.

 And in respect to the policy, what worries me about 

the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo --

forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here. 

If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to 

compete better with other brands. And that means lower prices 

for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt.

 So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with 

60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust 

law, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this. I'm 

exposing my entire line of thought. I'm trying to protect 

interbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not 

being -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman; 

and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been 

read. So, what's your response?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I guess the difficulty I have, 

Justice Breyer, is understanding why you don't think we are --

what we have here is precisely different purchasers of 

commodities.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I said -- I said they -- in --

the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination 

between the item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase 

of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination 

existed. Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased, 

there is no discrimination. At least there is no discrimination 

that -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind

side.

respect to which the discrimination existed.

MR. PHILLIPS: That's what you want me to focus on.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's fine. As long as you accept 

that the first class is a distinct one, and, as far as I'm 

concerned --

case, as far as I'm concerned.

MR. PHILLIPS: I realize you may disagree with me on 

that, but --

[Laughter.] 

MR. PHILLIPS: -- we'll start there. But I just 

want to be clear that that's a completely separate analysis. 

Then, it seems to me, what you -- what you have to go back to is 

the kind of analysis that Justice Stevens was saying, which is 

that when you're talking about different purchasers of

commodities, there is no reason to be so focused on the -- on 

the identical transaction, rather than recognizing, particularly 

in the context of a dealership arrangement where you're -- have 

continuous relationships between the -- between the seller --

the manufacturer and the dealer, where you have this enormous 

disadvantage to the dealer, who has already sunk, you know, huge 

amounts of money into this and is in -- essentially at the whim 

of what is now a monopoly seller -- a monopsony -- a monopoly 

seller. And, under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense 

to say, "Look, if I'm going to systematically keep getting 20 --

10 percent discounts, where my competitor, a hundred miles away, 

is always getting 20 percent discounts," that's a situation that 

this statute seems clearly aimed at dealing with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not at the whim of a 

monopoly seller. You mentioned to me just a little while ago, 

you've got a contract with them. You can put in that contract 

whatever you want about pricing.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I have a 5-year contract that's 

already in place, so, at least for the 5 years, I'm pretty much 

at the whim of my -- unless I want to breach the contract, which

contract.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But on a misinterpretation of 

Robinson-Patman.

 [Laughter.]

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with the 

policy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather 

than the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer 

competition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather 

than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's 

ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the 

manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed 

to protect the intrabrand position?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think to make that argument you 

essentially have to make mush out of the last half of the 

Robinson-Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of 

commerce, which is where I think you would be talking about 

interbrand problems. It's problems with respect to customers of 

either of them. And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since 

1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt, 

that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an 

intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to 

competition that this statute was aimed at. And this Court 

reaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990, 

in Texaco. And it's -- and notwithstanding some effort to ask

the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me 

that that principle ought to be completely settled at this 

stage. If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix 

that's offered up by Congress.

 To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I 

told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have 

to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of 

time, you get the Morton Salt inference. You -- then we still 

have to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have 

actual injury to our business and property. And in this 

context, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely 

overwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we 

are next-to-none dealer for Volvo. In 1995, we're selling 66 

cars, we're making $165,000. Volvo implements its "Volvo 

Vision," the purpose of which is to drive my client out of this 

dealership. It engages in systematic discrimination, both with 

respect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly, 

more broadly than that. And the effect of that, at the end of 

the day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8. Our 

gross profits dropped to $26,327.

 You compare that to the kind of evidence this Court 

looked at in the -- in the J. Truett Payne case, where it wasn't 

clear that there was really any discrimination involved there, 

there was no drop in the market, there was no evidence of any 

diversion of any sales. And, even in that context, this Court

was unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding 

that the evidence was flat-out inconsistent -- or inadequate to 

sustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.

 I submit to you, the evidence in this case is vastly 

stronger. The jury reached the result that it did. That result 

was approved in the face of a JMOL --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let me ask you --


MR. PHILLIPS: -- and affirmed --


JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question.


 MR. PHILLIPS: -- on appeal.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing you did have a contract,


such as Justice Scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer 

agreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as 

favorable a concession as any other Volvo dealer could get at 

the same time. If there were such a contract in place, would 

the evidence show that it was breached?

 MR. PHILLIPS: In this case, yes, it would have 

been. We have evidence that they clearly didn't. Because they 

have a policy of trying to accomplish the same thing, and didn't 

achieve that in this particular case, in at least two instances.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did -- you did get a 

judgment on the -- whatever it was -- the State Franchises Act, 

and that is not being contested --

aspects of this mismatches -- that in one case you went back as 

much as -- there was a 7-month differential. Is there a 

timeframe, if we adopt your theory, about -- in which you can 

engage in this comparison?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, of course. You require the jury 

to make a determination that it's within a reasonable period of

time and that it's in a reasonable adjustment. There is no 

challenge to the jury instruction on whether or not the 

comparisons that were made were legitimate in any way. So, 

that's -- you know, there's no question that this Court can 

certainly establish a rule that says certain timeframes are 

either, per se, good or bad, but that issue is clearly not 

raised by the way the jury -- this jury was instructed, because 

there was no challenge to the instruction, in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's also not disputed now 

that these were goods of like grade and quality.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Not disputed that these are goods of 

like grade and quality, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, how many States have 

these fair franchising laws? Are there any States that don't?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I'm sure there are some States 

that don't. I think there are about 30-some States that do, as 

I recall.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument that focuses 

on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing 

those sales at all. I mean, if you -- you had made all the 

sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger 

discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd 

have the same argument, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think if we had gotten all of 

those sales the first time around, we would have ended up with

the profits that would have allowed us to make the sales --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, you just go back and 

look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody 

else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the 

bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, 

and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to 

be a dealer for a longer time.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think, at the end of the day, 

what we're talking about is essentially a jury question: Were 

we entitled to say these were lost profits, the margins were 

reduced, we didn't have as much money? That interfered with our 

ability to make sales in the future period, because you have the 

complete before-and-after documented history in this particular 

case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So --

MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that's a jury 

question. And the jury found in our favor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: You suggest something very -- to 

me, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I 

think, from prior law that --

MR. PHILLIPS: I hope not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you want to go look at this, you 

know, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic about 

it. We're going to be realistic. Realistic, they -- we're only

now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item, 

but the profit was lower. There's no purchaser problem.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But they got a lower profit. And I 

think, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that 

counts as an injury.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That, by itself, wouldn't count as an 

injury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes, but it's -- you know, it 

shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out 

of business.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Indeed, the market in -- the 

dealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market, 

which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result 

of -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that 

would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust 

law. So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to 

Morton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was 

quite formalistic. It didn't really look to the injury to 

competition in a market. It had a formalistic slogan that 

would, in fact, be a proxy for that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, what do you think of that? We 

follow your -- we follow your advice, we say, "Okay, we're going

to be very realistic in the future. Forget the presumptions. 

And, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of 

increased concentration through people going out of business, 

will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies 

there." What about that? I mean, I don't know if you -- you 

know, I --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not here to --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm being a little --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- I'm not here, necessarily, as an 

advocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons. I 

think the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we 

clearly win, because we -- we probably didn't need to show as 

much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular 

discrimination on our ability to compete in the future. I think 

we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of 

the substantial -- or reasonable possibility of injury in the 

first instance. But, beyond that, I -- you know, you could 

certainly hold, in this case, that Reeder-Simco has made more 

than enough of a case in order to recover under the 

Robinson-Patman Act. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in fact --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- we, neverthe- -- I'm sorry, 

Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you almost have to show that.

me, too insubstantial to support liability here. Would you 

agree? I -- and I --

MR. PHILLIPS: One --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I -- your opposing counsel says 

you almost concede that, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we -- I mean, we don't rely on 

it. And part of this -- part of the problem is that it's not --

that head-to-head item wasn't part of the jury instruction. So, 

that -- we -- I can't rely on it, in terms of supporting it. If 

you ask me, outside of the context of this case, would I defend 

that argument? I probably would try to defend the argument. 

But it's obviously much tougher when you only have one 

head-to-head. It's completely different when you're talking 

about 102 sales-to-sales comparisons over years, with 

significant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of 

injury we have here.

 If there are no further questions, Your Honors, I'd 

give you back the rest of my time.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

 Mr. Englert, you have four minutes remaining.

colloquy between the Chief Justice and Mr. Phillips. The Chief 

Justice pointed out that Reeder doesn't lose a sale because of 

the concession that Volvo gives to the other dealer, which makes 

this quite different from every other Robinson-Patman case. Mr. 

Phillips' response was, "That's today, Your Honor. But our 

future ability to compete is impaired." Well, that's very 

similar to the evidence this Court referred to as "weak" in J. 

Truett Payne. The Court didn't go all the way and say that that 

wasn't enough to give rise to damages under section 4 of the 

Clayton Act, but the -- but all nine Justices agreed that such 

evidence was very weak. The Fifth Circuit, on remand, threw out 

the jury verdict, a case that arose in the same posture as this 

case. And there is not -- as we said in the reply brief, Reeder 

is complaining about price, not price discrimination.

 Now, let me say a word or two about the record. Mr. 

Phillips says the "Volvo Vision" was to get rid of dealers, and 

to do so through price discrimination. That is a leap of faith 

that Reeder asked the jury to make at trial, but there is not an 

iota of evidence connecting Volvo's interest in making its 

dealer network smaller and more efficient to price 

discrimination. That's entirely a leap of faith. Mr. Phillips 

says an inference should be made. That's not the kind of 

inference we usually allow juries to draw in antitrust cases 

without some evidence.

 The evidence was actually that Reeder's biggest

customer, New Hi-Way, which was 82 percent of its business, was 

bought by a Memphis company. So, just to point to Reeder's 

before-and-after sales is really terribly misleading, in terms 

of causation here between so-called discrimination and the 

decline in Reeder's business.

 The so-called 102 sales are four transactions. 

There's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi-Way before it was 

bought by the Memphis company, and 25 other trucks in the other 

three transactions. They are all cases in which all Reeder did 

was take its own completed sales and compare them to sales by 

some other dealer in some other State. Reeder wasn't competing 

for the sale to that dealer's customer. That customer wasn't 

competing for the sale to Reeder's customer. So it is, as 

Justice Ginsburg's questions pointed out, completely a 

mix-and-match approach.

 And Bill Heck conceded that there were times when 

Reeder got better concessions than other dealers. If you have a 

company that doesn't engage in uniform pricing, as Volvo does 

not, it's not going to be hard for any plaintiff, whether it's 

Reeder or Reeder's competitor, to come up with instances in 

which it was the so-called disfavored dealer if it is admissible 

to compare transactions to completely unrelated transactions, 

which is what the proof at trial in this case was.

 Thank you.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you, if you have a 

minute left, is your central point that there was no proof of 

damages or no proof of injury to competition?

 MR. ENGLERT: Both, Your Honor. They need both. 

They need --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I know they --

MR. ENGLERT: In 2(a) --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- need both, but which is your 

principal argument?

 MR. ENGLERT: My principal argument is under 2(a), 

but if I fail on that, I think they fail under Clayton Act, 

section 4, as well. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Your principal argument, that 

there was no injury to competition.

 MR. ENGLERT: That was the effect of such 

discrimination, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.
