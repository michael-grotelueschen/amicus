 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company et al. v. United 

States.

 Ms. Sullivan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 IN NO. 07-1607

 MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The court of appeals in this case untethered 

CERCLA liability for response costs from the plain 

statutory language of CERCLA section 107(a)(3), and in 

so doing also imposed potentially crippling liability on 

entities with only the most attenuated connection to any 

harm. 107(a)(3), which is reprinted in the petition 

appendix in 1607 on page 266a, provides that among the 

potentially responsible parties under CERCLA are 

so-called arrangers; that is, those persons who by 

contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal 

of hazardous substances.

 The paradigmatic case, of course, would be a 

generator of hazardous waste calls up "Waste Co." and

asks Waste Co. to take those substances to a landfill or 

to otherwise dispose of them. Where CERCLA does not 

define a statutory term -- and there's no definition of 

"arrange" -- this Court has long said, for example in 

United States against Bestfoods, that we look to the 

ordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning, 

the ordinary meaning, of "arrange for" is to make plans 

or preparations to do something. The ordinary meaning 

of the word "for" is to refer to a purpose or goal. And 

the ordinary meaning of "to dispose" is to discard or to 

throw away. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if your shipper 

here knew that every time he delivered one of these 

truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up 

on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no 

doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending 

it? Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at 

least a third of the shipment?

 MS. SULLIVAN: No, Your Honor. That's not 

our facts, of course, but even if there -- there had 

been knowledge here, knowledge is not sufficient to give 

rise to the specific intent required by the statute. 

Just as in the criminal law, we wouldn't infer in a 

specific intent case that one is presumed to know the 

natural consequences of one's acts. What is required

here is an actual plan to dispose. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that it's 

Shell's truck -- that isn't this case, but suppose it's 

Shell's truck, and every time they make a delivery the 

driver catches the waste in a can, four or five gallons, 

and dumps it in the creek. Is Shell liable there under 

the statute?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, Shell might 

well be liable there, but not under 107(a)(3), rather 

under 107(a)(2).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, hasn't it arranged 

for the disposal of the --

MS. SULLIVAN: You wouldn't reach arranger 

liability there, Your Honor, because as in the Amcast 

case, when Judge Posner said the truck is a facility, 

the truck would be a facility that Shell owns or 

operates in that instance. But in this case, of course, 

Shell was hiring independent contractor truckers to ship 

the waste.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure 

that I agree with your answer. Can you give me an 

example under this statute where Shell might be an 

arranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell 

would be an arranger?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, we believe

under arranger liability shell would never be an 

arranger here. The only thing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What if Shell went out of 

business and it had some stuff left in the tanks? At 

that point, they might very well hire somebody to do 

exactly what you're saying.

 MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be an eccentric 

situation, but it could happen.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Souter, if Shell had 

residual waste product that it was seeking to dispose, 

then the natural reading of 107(a)(3) would apply 

because that would be waste product.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that the case in 

my hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the 

driver catches the five gallons that spills out of the 

hose every week and dumps it in the creek?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's really the same as 

the question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an 

arranger under (3).

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, the key 

difference in the two hypotheticals that you've posed is 

that Shell is the owner and operator of the disposal of 

waste there, and therefore it would be a 107(a)(2) case,

not an arranger case. The arranger liability is 

designed for --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, would it be 

altogether different if, instead of the FOB destination 

term, Shell continued as owner of the product until it 

had gone from the hose or whatever delivers it, so that 

there is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is 

complete?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that 

would be a different case. That would be a case like 

the so-called formulator cases, of which United States 

against Aceto from the 8th Circuit is paradigmatic. And 

in that case the key is that the company arranging --

the company was held liable for arranging to dispose of 

waste where it owned the product throughout a 

manufacturing process, sent it out to a formulator, but 

got it back as its own product, knowing that inherent in 

the formulation process was the creation of waste 

material. So Shell would have been the owner of the 

waste.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem I have with 

that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is 

an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be 

a punishing statute, but the one thing that was not 

intended was for the parties to arrange themselves out

of arranger liability by providing neatly that the 

moment the product reaches a destination there's no 

continuing responsibility on the part of the seller.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, that is 

correct with respect to arranging for the disposal of 

waste. One couldn't evade one's responsibility for 

arranging for the disposal of waste products. If you're 

shipping sludge or discarded materials or spent battery 

casings or waste oil, if you're shipping waste then you 

can't get out of your obligations by simply arranging 

for someone else to collect the waste FOB destination. 

But the difference here is that this is not a waste 

case. This is a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it waste when it 

spills? You deliver -- you're supposed to deliver 100 

gallons, 5 gallons spills; isn't that waste?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, it only 

matters for 107(a)(3) if we arrange for it to spill. 

And as Judge Posner said in Amcast, no one arranges for 

an accident except in the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: They know that --

hypothetical. They know that in the course of delivery 

you're always going to spill about five gallons. That's 

waste.

district court found in this case that Shell had 

knowledge of spills at the site of the bulk unloading. 

These were minute spills, only 80 gallons, 80 gallons a 

year out of 123,000, or .07 percent.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All I'm talking about is 

just a hypothetical definition of waste.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, even if the 

spills are waste, the key for arranger liability, the 

key for arranger liability is that you arrange for 

spills.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we were talking about 

waste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe 

you won't agree -- that when the product is delivered 

and 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can 

talk about the other parts of it later.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, the statute 

CERCLA, by cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal 

Act, does include spills and leaks as possible waste, 

and the natural application of that definition would be 

to spills or leaks in a waste disposal. If a landfill 

operator spills or leaks waste, then obviously that's 

waste. But even if you treat drips of a useful product 

-- and there's no dispute here that the D-D shipped to 

the agricultural facility was a useful product, shipped 

for commercial use for application in the fields. Even

if you view it as a spill of that product if a little 

bit falls out of the hose upon delivery at the bulk 

storage tank, it does not entail that Shell was an 

arranger for the disposal of hazardous waste.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if Shell had a choice 

between two companies to do the delivery. One would 

deliver it with no spillage whatsoever, but the other 

would deliver it with a certain amount, a small amount 

of spillage. And Shell chose the latter because it was 

cheaper. Would it not be arranging under those 

circumstances?

 MS. SULLIVAN: It might well be because 

there would be an economic benefit to Shell from the 

arrangement for shipment in the leaky truck. That would 

be quite a different case from this one. There was no 

economic benefit to Shell from the leaks here. In fact, 

Shell did everything possible, so far as the record 

shows, to prevent spills.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought your 

definition of -- of disposal implied the disposition of 

something whose use had, in effect, been exhausted, so 

that I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's 

question would have been different because even in the 

case in which they hired a sloppy delivery, they're not 

getting rid or the deliverer is not necessarily getting

rid of a product whose use has been exhausted.

 MS. SULLIVAN: That is correct, Your Honor. 

We believe the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought you 

would have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question 

differently and would have said that just because 

something's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste. I 

mean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what 

is spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy and Justice 

Souter an easy way to hold this case and to reverse the 

court of appeals would be simply to hold that when a 

useful product is spilled it is not waste. And the 

cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal Act would 

support that interpretation because in 42 U.S.C. Section 

6903(3) Congress defined "hazardous waste" as that 

material which is discarded. It analogize it to sludge. 

This is not a case about sludge or waste material.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument 

assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and 

waste. Yet it's quite common to talk about there being 

waste associated with a useful product. When you use up 

so much of this, there's going to be a certain 

percentage of waste.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Correct, Your Honor. But the

-- so even if you don't draw the line simply at the 

useful product-waste distinction, we still do not 

qualify as an arranger under 1007(a)(3) because we did 

not arrange for the spill, we did not arrange for the 

waste.

 The government relies on facts in the record 

to suggest that we had some special knowledge or special 

responsibility, and of course the government's argument 

that mere knowledge of a third-party's spills would 

create arranger liability would disrupt commerce across 

a range of industries. It would mean that the chlorine 

company is liable when the pool supply store spills a 

few drops of chlorine and the place becomes a facility. 

It would mean that the maker of perchloroethylene is 

liable when the dry cleaning establishment spills dry 

cleaning fluid near the dry cleaning machine, even if 

they had nothing to do with it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's making it too 

easy for you. It would mean all of those people would 

be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they 

know there's going to be a certain amount that's going 

to spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito 

hypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck 

that causes more spill rather than the one that causes 

less. It's not simply here's the product, we're gone,

see you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, there's no 

suggestion in the record here that we're in Justice 

Alito's example. The district court found that spills 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, i know. But 

I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument. So in 

that type of a case would there be arranger liability?

 MS. SULLIVAN: There -- we believe there 

would not be because spilling a useful product while 

it's being delivered should not count as waste. But 

even if you treated that as waste within the meaning of 

the statute or even if you treated that as a discard of 

a hazardous substance, there still should not be 

arranger liability based on mere knowledge. There has 

to be knowledge of a third party's spills.

 The difference from Justice Alito's example 

is that Shell there would be invested in the spillage as 

part of its own economic transaction, as in formulator 

cases, where you send a material out to a manufacturer 

intending for it, expecting for it to spill in the 

process, you know you're going to get 98 percent back. 

That's not this case. Shell sought here, as most 

routine commercial sellers and shippers do, to get a 

third-party truck to take all of the stuff to B&B and

have it used for its commercial application as pesticide 

in the field. There was no built-in here, no effort to 

build in here any benefit for Shell in the leaky truck, 

Quite distinguishing Justice Alito's example. The 

government --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one benefit would 

be avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than 

what I call the fixable connection. Is this the first 

occasion on which Shell because of its sales of D-D has 

been charged with CERCLA liability? Is this a case of 

first impression, or have there been other instances in 

which Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the 

D-D FOB destination?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, this is the first 

and only case in the nation that has held that arranger 

liability applies to a mere sale of a useful product 

because a third-party purchaser after acquiring 

possession and control spilled the product. So there's 

no other case I am aware of in which it's been 

adjudicated that there is any liability under these 

facts.

 But the key distinction here is that even if 

you don't distinguish between the useful product and 

waste and even if you go with Justice Kennedy's idea 

that spilling a useful product could be waste, it still

is not arranging for the disposal of that substance 

unless there's an intent to dispose. Here Shell wanted 

every drop of D-D to be safely placed in the bulk 

storage tank.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Sullivan, can I 

interrupt you? Because I'm still puzzled by your answer 

to Justice Alito. Are you conceding that if in this 

case Shell had an alternative carrier who would not have 

spilled a bit, that then there would be liability?

 MS. SULLIVAN: No, we are not, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you did in your 

answer to Justice Alito. Why wouldn't that be? Explain 

your answer a little more fully?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, we concede 

that if there is a waste product that leaves Shell and 

Shell deliberately arranges for a leaky carrier, there 

would be no issue. That would be 107(a)(3). Even if --

and we concede there might be a possible case in which 

Shell deliberately chooses to send a useful product in a 

way that it leaks. It puts the product into leaky 

containers when it leaves the shop. Then there might be 

some case in which you might attribute knowledge, infer 

intent from knowledge.

 But this is not that case because here the

transfer to the third party -- the transfer to the third 

party occurs at tender of delivery under ordinary UCC 

principles. The -- the transfer to the third-party 

purchaser occurs, and that's when the spillage occurs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was as 

part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told 

its purchasers how to handle this material, and that 

Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the 

precautions laid out in the manual.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, two points: 

The manual comes out only in 1978, and a Shell 

representative visits the site only in 1979. That 

leaves 19 years of liability unaccounted for on that 

period.

 But, more important, it would be terribly 

impractical and terribly perverse in relation to the 

purposes of the environmental laws that Congress passed 

to penalize a manufacturer for telling a third-party 

purchaser how to handle a product more safely. So to 

use the manual issued in 1978 or the inspection in 1979 

as evidence that Shell knew there were spills and, 

therefore, was an arranger would be perverse in relation 

to the environmental statutes.

 If there are no further questions, I would 

like to reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 IN NO. 07-1601

 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to start with section 912 of 

the Restatement because I think it really helps to 

demonstrate that the trial court fully understood and 

properly applied the common law standards that govern 

the determination of apportionment in a pollution case. 

That section provides that when a party bears the burden 

of proof, they have to establish the extent of harm and 

the amount of money with, quote, "as much certainty as 

the nature of the tort and circumstances permit," end 

quote.

 At the time that CERCLA was adopted in 1980, 

common law courts for more than a century had been using 

that standard to apportion damages and harm in pollution 

cases based on essentially rough estimates because the 

nature of the tort, pollution, and the circumstances 

don't allow for the kind of precision that we might 

require in some other settings such as proof of -- of 

fault, for instance.

And the United States, they say that the 

district court departed from those common-law standards, 

but it's telling: They don't cite a single common-law 

case decided before CERCLA in their entire brief. If 

you were to look at section 840(e) of the Restatement, 

which governs nuisance cases and apportionment -- it's 

an application of the section 433(a) standards -- they 

cite -- the Restatement cites approximately 50 cases. I 

don't think there's a single one where a court denied 

apportionment for a nuisance for a harm such as this one 

that is theoretically capable of apportionment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This court -- - this 

court, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment. 

Apportionment was never requested. The court said: 

"I'm going to have to figure this out on my own." In 

fact, the court deplored the parties for following what 

he called a "scorched-earth tactic."

 So the apportionment is not something that 

has been denied to the PRPs in this case. It's 

something that the court thought was proper and fair, 

but it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't 

that so?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in note 16 of the 

Ninth Circuit's opinion it actually rejects that 

argument by the government and says that apportionment

was pled throughout the case; that the government was on 

notice. That's note 16. The trial court very 

specifically rejected the government's claims of waiver 

saying, yes, apportionment was at issue here throughout 

the case, both in terms of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you point to me the 

part of the district court opinion that conflicts with 

the part that I remember so well? He is saying, this is 

a really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.

 MS. MAHONEY: Oh, he does say that, Your 

Honor. But what he says is that the theory of 

apportionment that was offered by the railroad, the 

argument that it made -- they offered an expert -- that 

gave substantial precision about how to allocate harm 

among the different chemicals on the site -- he doesn't 

accept that approach. He accepts a different approach.

 But at 252(a) he says -- he confirms --

there is, quote, "considerable evidence of the relative 

levels of activities and number of releases on the two 

parcels" that allow him to find a basis of -- for making 

a reasonable estimate of the apportionment, which was 

his responsibility as the factfinder. In addition, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it a judge's 

responsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the

record from which one could make a finding, when a 

finding hasn't been sought?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the finding 

of apportionment was sought. The trial court -- and, 

again, note 16 of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's opinion 

makes clear -- and the government doesn't say otherwise 

-- that the railroads had requested apportionment. The 

issue was whether or not they had argued the precise 

theory, and the factfinder certainly has the authority 

to choose the theory that it thinks best approximates 

what is a reasonable estimate.

 And in fact, Your Honor, the theory that the 

trial court seized upon was actually suggested by the 

government's own expert on cross-examination in the 

transcript at -- at 4077 to '78.

 And in addition, Your Honor, when it was 

time for closing argument, which was September 28th, 

1999, at the very beginning of the transcript, page 4, 

the trial court said to the government -- it said to the 

parties at the beginning of the closing argument, here's 

what I want to know about. I want you to address 

yourselves to whether or not I can apportion this harm 

based upon the relative area on the site and the 

relative time. He put the government on notice.

 When the findings of fact came out, Your

Honor, the government could have filed a motion to amend 

under Rule 52. They in fact filed a motion. They could 

have asked to submit additional evidence if they somehow 

thought that this had been unfair. They didn't do that. 

Shell did it for other reasons, but the government 

elected not to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose the district 

court, if it wanted additional evidence, could have 

said, I want additional evidence on this point.

 MS. MAHONEY: It absolutely could have. And 

so that argument of waiver was rejected by two courts 

below, both by the district court in denying the motion 

to amend -- it granted it in certain respects, but 

rejected waiver, and then by the Ninth Circuit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

you have a situation where it's clear under 

apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the 

other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough 

to pollute the -- the water. Do you have apportionment 

in that situation?

 MS. MAHONEY: It depends, but generally yes. 

And the reason, if it, as here -- the cost of the remedy 

is driven by the mass of the contamination -- and it was 

undisputed that that was the case here -- then the costs 

have gone up based upon the aggregate harm.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I assume it's 

not a linear, if that's the right word, progression, 

because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got 

to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by 

one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.

 MS. MAHONEY: But it's that the whole cost 

-- the question under apportionment is: Are all of the 

damages attributable to the harm that was caused by the 

defendant? And if they're not, then apportionment is 

appropriate. And here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that hasn't been --

that hasn't been the position of most courts under 

CERCLA. I thought they -- I thought that there had been 

relatively few cases where apportionment, when 

requested, was even allowed because the theory is the 

act provides for contribution. One PRP can go after 

another, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the 

bag is the public, the innocent victims of the 

pollution.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, under -- the 

government has acknowledged that the apportionment 

standards from the Restatement apply under the -- under 

CERCLA. And cases, as I indicated, the cases under 

840(e) almost always allowed apportionment for 

pollution, even though it meant that a farmer or a

rancher or a grower was left holding with harm that was 

caused by another defendant. But the law has always 

said you can't impose damages on a defendant that had no 

causal responsibility.

 Here what we're talking about, under the 

Ninth Circuit's holding, that they -- they didn't 

question the district court's factfinding at 248a that 

it is indisputable that the overwhelming majority of 

hazardous substances were released by B&B on its own 

parcel, on its own land, not on the railroad's land. 

Its own operations on its own --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought --

and tell me if my recollection of the facts is 

incorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B 

to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond, 

what was called South, that was on the other side, that 

was on the original B&B parcel. So you had the waste 

flowing from one part to the other.

 MS. MAHONEY: The trial court found that it 

was plausible that some leakage, some spills on the 

railroad parcel, during the 13 years of the lease made 

it into the groundwater by traveling nearly two football 

fields in an area that hardly has any rain, but said 

that 9 percent was the maximum of damages that could 

possibly be attributable to this.

What the Ninth Circuit really says is that, 

even though B&B began dumping thousands of gallons of 

chemical rinsate in 1960, which was 36 years before this 

case was filed, 15 years before the lease was ever 

entered into, that all of that harm that was caused by 

B&B has to be paid by the railroads, because they can't 

-- that's almost $40 million now -- because they can't 

prove with precision whether their share of the damages 

might be zero or one million or nine million.

 And so what, in essence, the Ninth Circuit 

did was said that because there weren't adequate records 

to prove what amount of dumping was going on in 1960 

when there wouldn't have been any reason to keep those 

records, that as a default matter 100 percent of the 

harm has to be allocated by the railroads, even though 

it's not -- they didn't question the district court's 

finding that it's indisputable that the overwhelming 

majority was by B&B on its own land. And the court has 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the issue 

of insolvency? You have talked about the Restatements. 

There's the comment H to one of the Restatement 

provisions that says you don't apportion if one of the 

other parties is insolvent.

Honor, what it actually says is that the district court 

in exceptional cases may deny apportionment due to 

insolvency. And here the district court at 248a found 

this was not such a case, exercised its discretion to 

say no.

 And in addition, Your Honor, there are no 

cases cited in that section of the Restatement where 

this was actually done. And the Third Restatement in 

section 28, comment C, says that that comment was 

actually inconsistent with section 433(a) principles.

 Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 If I could begin with the issue of arranger 

liability. The Ninth Circuit distinguished what it 

referred to as the useful product cases and made it 

clear that it would not impose arranger liability on 

Shell simply under the theory that Shell had sold a 

useful product that was later disposed of in a way that 

contaminated the environment.

district court emphasized both that Shell had control 

over the delivery process and that Shell knew that, as 

the district court put it, leaks and spills were 

inherent in the chosen method.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from 

you using your printer, there's an ink cartridge and you 

replace them after a while, and mine has a little thing 

attached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage 

bin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in 

this envelope and do something?

 Now, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows 

that several million people won't do it. They will 

throw it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me. 

All right. Are they now arrangers?

 MR. STEWART: No, I don't think they 

would -- they -- I don't think they would be arrangers 

for the disposal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. STEWART: Because even though they might 

foresee that in some --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, some? No, probably 

millions. I don't know anybody who does put it in the 

right garbage can.

ordinary tort law principles a seller's knowledge that a 

certain percentage of its product would be misused would 

not be sufficient to give rise to liability --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then how is that then 

different from Shell? Shell here knows that to some 

degree their people are going to spill this. And, of 

course, shell arranged the transport. And in my 

imaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does 

HP.

 MR. STEWART: There are two differences. 

The first is that while HP might know that some 

percentage of its customers would dispose of the 

material improperly, here the district court found that 

Shell knew that spills and leaks occurred with every 

delivery. And the second --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, now maybe HP knows 

that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer 

who --

(Laughter.)

 -- because I foolishly admitted at dinner 

that I dispose of them all improperly. Now are they 

Shell?

 MR. STEWART: The second difference here is 

that Shell arranged for the delivery and controlled the 

circumstances under which the delivery would be made.

That is, Shell hired the common carrier and Shell 

required that B&B have bulk storage facilities so that 

the D-D would have to be pumped from the delivery truck 

into the bulk storage.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So then, suddenly if HP, in 

fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have 

a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car 

batteries, same problem. They have their own trucks, 

and they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know. And they, 

in fact, put in an instruction, which says: Really do 

it; really put it in the special now.

 MR. STEWART: Again, at a certain point, 

once the product has been used by the customer --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to find that 

point. And what I have found you so far to say from the 

briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it 

easy -- but what they did was they arranged the 

transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put 

some instructions in which said the right way to dispose 

of it. Well, doesn't everybody do that?

 MR. STEWART: No, because the fact 

circumstance here was not that Shell or the common 

carrier transferred control of the D-D to B&B with 

instructions as to how it was to be used at a later 

date, and the customer then violated those instructions.

The fact pattern here is that the spills occurred during 

the process of delivery.

 And to return to Justice Alito's 

hypothetical, you asked what if Shell deliberately chose 

a particular delivery company that it knew would result 

in spills, but did so for economic advantage, that's 

exactly the case here. That is, at a prior time the D-D 

had been shipped to B&B's facility in sealed drums, so 

whatever the possibility that it might be misused later, 

it wouldn't be spilled or leaked during the process of 

delivery and transfer. But Shell decided that it was to 

its economic advantage to require bulk storage of D-D.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You say in the 

process of delivery. I thought that this material 

became the property of the buyer when the truck arrived. 

Are you saying it only -- it only became the property of 

the buyer when it was unloaded from the truck?

 MR. STEWART: The district court 

specifically declined to make a finding there. That 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does "FOB" normally 

mean?

 MR. STEWART: It says "FOB delivery or place 

of delivery." And the district court found that B&B 

acquired what it called stewardship over the property at

the time that the truck entered the premises, but that 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think it's 

something of a misdescription to say that this spillage 

is occurring in the course of delivery.

 MR. STEWART: But the district court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think as far as Shell was 

concerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled 

up.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the district court 

specifically declined to find -- to make a finding as to 

who owned the D-D at the time it was spilled.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're making it.

 MR. STEWART: We don't think that our 

argument is dependent upon the question of ownership, 

because Shell undeniably had ownership and possession of 

the D-D at the time the arrangement was made, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Independent of the time of 

control.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Independent but not at the 

time of the spill.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. But that 

would be true in the paradigmatic arranger case, where 

one company has generated waste and hires a hauler to 

pick it up and take it away. Those parties could easily

provide by contract that title would pass to the hauler 

at the time the garbage --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then in your view what it 

is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal 

when the company knows that the transporter on arrival 

may spill some of the product?

 MR. STEWART: It's more than --

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess then every oil 

company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in 

the United States is going to be -- fall within that 

because a lot of people do spill things.

 MR. STEWART: Knowledge might well be 

sufficient, but here we have more than knowledge, we 

have control.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why do we -- I mean, do 

we have control? Shell says to its buyer, see that the 

delivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't 

spill all over the place. If Shell did control, it 

wouldn't have to say that to the buyer. In effect it 

could either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt 

of the product, or it could require that as part of the 

-- its terms with the - with the deliverer. It seems to 

me that the way Shell has set it up indicates that 

control has passed to somebody else at the time that the 

spigot starts going in the tank.

MR. STEWART: Well, as Ms. Sullivan said, 

the instructions were given in 1978, fairly far into the 

period of contamination. But Even before that date 

Shell had control in the sense that it required bulk 

storage on the B&B facility.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: He says, we won't sell you 

to unless you -- you -- you have these tanks, correct?

 MR. STEWART: And its contract with the 

common carrier required that the common carrier have 

particular equipment for pumping the D-D out of the 

truck and into the bulk storage facility.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so what is your -- no 

question, those are -- those are terms of their 

willingness to deal. But what is your basis for saying 

that when the truck pulls up and they -- the hose is 

turned on to deliver, that at that point Shell is 

controlling the process?

 MR. STEWART: They have -- they have control 

of the process in the sense of defining the way it is to 

be done. You're correct that the actual process of 

unloading is being done by employees of the common 

carrier and employees of B&B rather than employees of 

Shell. But again, the whole point of arranger liability 

is to not allow the people who set in motion the process 

that culminates in disposal to get off the hook.

in effect get damages from its deliverer as a result of 

the -- the deliverer's incidental spillage. Is that 

your position?

 MR. STEWART: That is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is, that the spillage 

is a breach of the contract between the transporter and 

Shell?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think if -- if Shell 

had pursued such a cause of action, then the delivery 

company might well have argued that these -- this was 

foreseeable and that there was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you have any basis 

for saying that if it had pursued that course of action, 

Shell would have succeeded?

 MR. STEWART: No. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why is Shell in 

control?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, that's my point. 

Shell would not have succeeded in such a suit, because 

the delivery company would have argued successfully this

process that Shell has chosen.

saying that the delivery company would have had a 

defense, but you are -- are saying that Shell would have 

had at least a theoretical right under its actual 

contract with the deliverer to assert the -- the control 

over the manner of delivery that would have prevented 

the spill; is that what you're saying?

 MR. STEWART: Well, it certainly insisted by 

contract on the use of the pumping equipment of -- to 

pump the D-D from the truck into the bulk storage 

facility. And that was --

could do it if the buyer did have bulk storage, isn't 

that correct?

until delivery?

theory. That is, the point of the arranger liability 

provision is to get at situations in which one person

forth, but they could substitute other -- other goods 

from another source? Would Shell still be liable?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, I guess I would have 

to know more about the hypothetical in -- as to the 

circumstances in which the disposal occurred.

same instructions they gave here, but they just didn't 

insist that it be their product rather than somebody 

else's, another oil company's product.

understand the situation in which Shell would be 

indifferent as to whether its product was being bought 

or the product of a competitor was being bought.

back to a -- we have been arguing about details. Can I 

go back to the -- to the broader question? What is your 

best response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes 

that "arrange for disposal" implies something 

significantly different from "arrange for transfer," 

"arrange for release," "arrange for delivery" -- that 

the -- that the combination of arrangement as an 

intentional act and disposal, as opposed to one of these 

-- these other processes, implies that the, in effect,

the use of the product intended has become exhausted and 

that one in getting rid of waste as distinct from merely 

wasting something. What is -- what is your best answer 

to that?

 MR. STEWART: We agree that the term 

"arrange for" connotes intentionality, and we think it's 

satisfied here because Shell intentionally set in motion 

the process of delivery. It insisted upon the delivery 

being done in a particular fashion, and it knew that 

spills and leaks were inherent in that process. To use 

an analogy --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if we're not arguing 

about that, what you are arguing about, then, is the --

is the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more 

neutral term like transfer or delivery or what-not. 

What's your answer to that?

 MR. STEWART: The further point I would make 

is that the term "disposal" is specifically defined to 

include spilling and leaking.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, but those are certainly 

ways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came 

out in the argument. If the -- if Waste Management 

spills things along the highway on the way to the dump, 

it may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in

fact it is a way of getting rid of something that no 

longer has any use.

 So I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the 

inclusion of leakage within the definition answers the 

question whether disposal is something different from 

transfer.

 MR. STEWART: To use a couple of analogies, 

I think if I know that my car leaks oil whenever it's 

operated and I choose to drive it on the public highway, 

I think I could naturally be said to have intentionally 

discharged oil onto the highway. It may be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well you have discharged, 

but you -- the question is whether it's disposal.

 MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "Discharge" is a more 

neutral term.

 MR. STEWART: Well again, the term 

"disposal" is specifically defined to include spilling 

and leaking. You're right that one --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that --

that -- that begs the question. Because in the course 

of disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there 

can be leakage.

 MR. STEWART: That's true, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The question is disposal

versus transfer or some more neutral term.

 MR. STEWART: If you had a situation, for 

instance, where the trash company was hauling waste and 

intended to dispose of it in a more classic sense by 

dumping it at a landfill, but along the way the truck 

leaked, and some of the items spilled out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: When?

 MR. STEWART: -- I think everybody 

acknowledges that there is disposal there, and I think 

we would also say that a company that contracted with 

that trash hauler, knowing that the vehicle tended to 

leak trash on -- on every delivery, could be said to 

have arranged for not only the ultimate disposal, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: No that's at that point, 

because I think you're focusing on the word. You don't 

use the word "for" disposal, and I think that is the key 

word, and the question is intention versus purpose.

 So that in your trash hauler case, it seems 

to work pretty well for me that when we say that that 

trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was 

its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the 

dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its 

purpose.

 So how do we deal with that? The statute 

tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a

vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that 

way. Now, that seems to work.

 So we get your example. What doesn't seem 

to work is when you import the notion of intention in 

the sense of knowing that to the arranger provision, 

because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to 

buy that to get your argument. At that point I do not 

see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on 

the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right 

in the arranger provision and lots of other companies 

that shouldn't be held as arrangers. That's my problem. 

Are you following that?

 MR. STEWART: I am following that, but I 

think that the court of appeals dealt with this and 

said: Our holding does not suggest that every 

manufacturer of a useful product is liable down the road 

if the customer ultimately disposes of it --

JUSTICE BREYER: It does say that, but my 

problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they 

made useful distinctions that will do that. It will say 

"many," but it won't say, for example, the car battery 

manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own 

trucks to places where people will get them, and he 

knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter 

how hard he tries.

Well, he's not an arranger. He didn't 

arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the 

transport for sale.

 MR. STEWART: I mean, I think in a sense the 

argument for liability there would depend in part on an 

assumption that people will systematically violate the 

law, like it would be an easy thing for the Court to say 

we will not assume and we will not impose liability on 

the basis of the assumption that battery customers will 

systematically violate the law.

 But the second thing that would be missing 

in that hypothetical, even if the battery manufacturer 

were assumed to know that every one of his customers 

would dispose of them ultimately in an improper way, is 

that the battery manufacturer would not be in control of 

that process.

 The manufacturer's control over the use of 

the batteries and their ultimate disposal would be 

severed once he turned them over, and that was not the 

case here. And again I think to return to the purposes 

of the arranger liability provision, the operator 

liability provision deals very well with the people who 

undertake the actual disposal, but Congress evidently 

thought that that was not enough.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is Shell liable

because it -- it knew of the transportation 

arrangements?

 MR. STEWART: I think it is a combination of 

knowledge and control. Knowledge might be sufficient, 

but knowledge and control together form a basis for 

arranger liability. Again, if I know that the 

particular common carrier uses a truck, to use a variant 

of my earlier hypothetical, if I know that a particular 

common carrier uses a truck that leaks oil whenever it's 

operated on the highway and I contract with that carrier 

and ask it to haul goods, I think I can naturally be 

said to have arranged for the discharge of oil on --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you -- in that 

case, you have knowledge but you don't have control 

because you're using a common carrier.

 MR. STEWART: I have -- I have control in 

the sense that I have deliberately selected a mode of 

delivery, a particular common --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then you mean simply 

control over your own choice process?

 MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Not control over the 

behavior of your hauler?

 MR. STEWART: Not -- not control in the 

sense of using my own personnel to drive the truck.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether you have -- you 

might have knowledge that one chemical broker is more 

careless than another in the way the product was 

ultimately sold, I don't see why your theory doesn't 

make the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or 

ought to know that at some point in the distribution 

process there is likely to be spillage which will enter 

the waters of the United States. I think that's what 

your argument implies. I just don't see that in the 

statute.

 MR. STEWART: Again, because here Shell had 

control over the very aspect of the process that 

resulted in spills and leaks.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it could have --

could have adopted some other means?

 MR. STEWART: Not only --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all you mean by 

having control over it.

 MR. STEWART: Not only that it could have 

adopted some other means, but that it insisted upon the 

particular means --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. So all you're 

requiring is knowledge that using this means will --

will result in a spill. I don't think knowledge alone 

is enough for -- I think you need purpose. If you

arrange for disposal, I think you have to have a 

purpose. It -- it has to be your object to have the oil 

leaking along the highway as you go. Merely knowing 

that it's going to be leaking, I mean, there may be some 

other way under the statute that you can find liability 

on the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on 

the -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this 

leak. He didn't want the leak. He knew it was 

happening, but that was not the object of the transport.

 MR. STEWART: Clearly, if the Court reads 

the term "arrange for" to require purpose, we lose in 

this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 MR. STEWART: -- because that was not the 

purpose of the transaction. But here there was both 

knowledge and control.

 And in terms of fairness to Shell, I think 

it is worth noting that in the typical arranger setting, 

where a person asks a trash hauler to come pick up my 

trash and deposit it in an appropriate place, that the 

arranger's ultimate liability may be determined very 

substantially by steps that the hauler takes afterwards; 

that is, if the arranger believes that the trash is 

going to be disposed of safely, but in fact the hauler 

dumps it in a way that will contaminate the environment.

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question 

about your argument that the Petitioners waived their 

apportionment argument? Aren't there many pages of the 

district court record in which the parties address 

apportionment? For example, in the government's 

response to the Petitioners' apportionment argument, 

don't you have more than 20 pages of findings of fact 

and conclusions of law on the issue of apportionment?

 MR. STEWART: We haven't used the word 

"waiver" in our brief and -- but we concede that the 

railroads and Shell, at least in a cursory way, raised 

the issue of apportionment at trial, and the Ninth 

Circuit found that was sufficient to preserve it. In 

our view, this is like any case in which a party with 

the burden of proof on a particular issue asserts that a 

particular proposition is true but fails to introduce 

sufficient evidence to carry its burden. You wouldn't 

speak of that as waiver, but it's still a failure of the 

party to come forward with enough to carry the day. And 

you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the question of 

apportionment, is it really your position that because 

of the precision you would require, that if there's a 

big fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or

30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the 

parties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's 

no good?

 MR. STEWART: No, I think that would be an 

acceptable approach. I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that what 

happened here? I mean, whatever -- I guess the 

railroads said 6 percent, and the district court said, 

well, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9 

percent.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I guess we would have 

two responses. The first is, although the district 

court certainly believed that he was -- the district 

judge believed he was building in a margin of safety, in 

our view it's still speculative as to whether the 

railroad's share of the contamination exceeded or was 

less than 9 percent.

 But the more fundamental point is the one 

that you raised in one of your questions; that is, the 

ultimate harm to the government in a practical sense is 

the incurrence of response costs, and in general that's 

the way that damages are measured in a CERCLA case. You 

don't ask, what threat -- what was the degree of public 

-- of threat to the public safety that was posed by the 

contamination? You ask, how much did it cost to clean

it up? And it --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute what Ms. 

Mahoney said, that it costs a great deal more to clean 

up some of the other chemicals than the ones that the 

railroad was responsible for?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I don't think 

that the record kind of establishes the relative costs 

of different contaminants. What I understood Ms. 

Mahoney to say --

JUSTICE ALITO: The volume, the volume.

 MR. STEWART: What I understood her to say 

was that the cost of the remedial action is proportional 

to the mass of chemicals to be removed, and we do 

dispute that proposition. The railroad's expert, Dr. 

Kalinowski testified about the remedial action that the 

government at that time was contemplating, and it was 

what was referred to as "a pump-and-treat system," where 

water would be pumped out of the aquifer and it would be 

treated with granular-activated carbon, or GAC, and that 

was a method of removing the contaminants so that the 

water could be pumped back in. And Dr. Kalinowski said 

the amount of GAC that would be needed to implement that 

remedy would be proportional to the mass of the 

chemicals involved, but that the crucial point for these 

purposes is the treatment with GAC is only a small

portion of the pump-and-treat remedy; that is, it's 

essential to drill wells, pump the water out, then treat 

it, and then under the prior remedial approach, pump it 

back in. And then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that still 

doesn't address the question, if you have varying 

degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or 

causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to 

apportion the liability.

 MR. STEWART: I think the first preliminary 

point is there's no reason to think that the cost of the 

remedy as a whole would be proportional to the mass of 

the contaminants because you have very substantial fixed 

costs, but the other point I would make is this is where 

the insolvency of B&B really seems to us to become 

crucial because, if you had all solvent defendants and 

the evidence showed that the remedy the government 

implemented would have been more or less the same if it 

had only been 10 percent of the contamination, 30 

percent of the contamination, or 100 percent of the 

contamination, that so much of the costs were fixed 

costs that reducing the volume was really not going to 

affect the cost in any meaningful way -- if you had all 

solvent defendants, it might still be the case that 

dividing the costs up in proportion to the contamination

they caused would do rough justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what 

about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that 

question of her?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I believe her first 

answer was the cost of the remedy would be proportional 

to the amount of contamination, which we disagree with, 

and we don't think Dr. Kalinowski's testimony bears that 

out, because all he said was the amount of 

granular-activated carbon that would be necessary is 

proportional to the mass of contaminants. And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She also said that 

the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no 

cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that 

comment.

 MR. STEWART: Well, as to the first point, 

the comment h, you're right, doesn't cite cases, and it 

does say that this -- the insolvency of the defendant 

need not prevent apportionment, only that it would 

provide a basis for doing so in exceptional cases. But 

in our view, the exceptional case would be one in which 

the ultimate determination was that the cost of the 

remedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more 

or less the same even if only one defendants's 

contamination were at issue, that it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't think 

that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you 

have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible 

and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?

 MR. STEWART: Well, we would say even as to 

10 or 20 percent, if it were established that the remedy 

the government would have been required to implement, 

had the only source of contamination been leakage on the 

railroad parcel -- if it were established that the 

government could have cleaned that up at 10 percent or 

20 percent of the cost of the remedy that was actually 

chosen, then there might be a sound basis for 

apportionment despite the insolvency of B&B.

 But our big point is, at the very least, the 

government should not be left holding the bag for costs 

that it would have been required to incur if the 

railroad parcel had been the only source of 

contamination, because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do we have 

in the way of findings on that question?

 MR. STEWART: We don't have findings either 

way. That is, the district court framed the relevant 

inquiry as what percentage of the contamination was 

attributable to the railroad parcel, to the 

Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel. But

it made no finding one way or the other as to what the 

cost of the remedy would have been if only the -- the 

only source of contamination had been the railroad 

parcel.

 And certainly the -- the primary equitable 

thrust of the argument on the other side is it's unfair 

to make us pay for somebody else's contamination. But 

to the extent that the government would have been 

required to implement a remedy this costly or even 60 

percent this costly had the railroads or Shell been the 

only source of contamination, by imposing at least that 

amount of liability, we're not asking for them to pay 

for B&B's contamination. We're simply asking for them 

to pay for the response costs that their own --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is that right? 

I mean doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole 

basis for apportionment? I mean there is -- I don't 

think when you're apportioning responsibility, you 

allocate whether or not the actors independently caused 

the harm. I thought the assumption was, yes, 

everybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the 

harm, but now we're going to apportion their 

responsibility.

 MR. STEWART: Well, indeed, the second 

restatement says as a categorical matter that if either

of two causes would have been independently sufficient 

to bring about the result, then there's joint and 

several liability. The example that the restatement 

gives is two merging fires that destroyed a building.

 And so I think it is established in -- in 

the second restatement that the -- there is no 

apportionment if either of two causes would have brought 

about the -- the feared harm.

 With -- with respect to the third 

restatement, I would say that at least in the case of --

you're -- you're right. There is no exact counterpart 

to comment (h) in the third restatement. But at least 

as to indivisible harms -- and I think this is 

potentially an indivisible harm that the government 

would have been required to undertake more or less the 

same response action regardless of the source of 

contamination.

 At least as to individual harms, the third 

restatement gives a variety of approaches that a local 

jurisdiction could take. There's joint and several 

liability, pure several liability, and then there are 

several permutations. And the third restatement is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a finding? Do we 

have to take it as a given that this was an indivisible 

harm?

MR. STEWART: I don't know that -- I think 

you should take it as a given because it was the 

defendant's burden to prove different divisibility. But 

I think if you don't regard the defendants as having the 

burden, I don't think there is an evidentiary basis for 

feeling confident one way or the other as to whether the 

harm was indivisible. But with respect to --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the basis for 

thinking that every little detail in the latest 

restatement, including comments, is binding in a CERCLA 

case?

 MR. STEWART: I don't think so, and this 

Court in Norfolk and Western -- it was dealing with a 

different statute, but it said when you're looking at 

the restatement, it's more important what the state of 

the law was when Congress enacted the statute rather 

than what the common-law principles are now. And as 

we've said in our brief, we think for that reason the 

second restatement is the more crucial document.

 But if you were to look at the third 

restatement, one of the things you would find is that 

the drafters, as to indivisible harms, identified a 

variety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could 

take -- expressly decline to choose a preferred one 

among them, but said the most important determinant in

choosing between them is how will the risk that a 

particular defendant be insolvent will be allocated.

 So the drafters of the third restatement 

certainly didn't treat insolvency as a factor that 

should be ignored in citing questions of an 

apportionability.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I just ask 

one question about the -- the situation of -- of these 

two potentially responsible parties? They are the only 

ones left, right? Because B&B is bankrupt, and there's 

nobody else that has been identified.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's only those two. 

And one question about the arranger liability -- well, 

first on the apportionment. Assuming we don't accept 

your entire position, would a remand so that proof could 

be put in by both sides focusing on the issue of 

apportionment be appropriate? You questioned the 

district, even -- even if apportionment were possible, 

you questioned how he arrived at it.

 MR. STEWART: I guess that's true. To the 

argument that I've just been sketching out, that -- that 

the crucial question is what response costs the 

government would have been required to bear if -- if 

only the railroad parcel's contamination had been at

issue, our argument is that the -- the railroads failed 

to prove divisibility. But another option would be to 

remand for factual proceedings to address that question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is it true, as Ms. 

Sullivan said, that there is no other arranger case like 

this one where the, quote, "arranger" is the seller of a 

product?

 MR. STEWART: I think there is no "arranger" 

case going in either direction that is on all fours with 

this one where there is the sale of a useful product 

during the course of a delivery that the seller arranged 

-- that the seller controlled.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 IN NO. 07-1607

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Sullivan, just on the 

apportionment point, do you agree that it is your burden 

to show that this is a divisible harm, and can you tell 

me how you showed that?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Kennedy. The --

there is no dispute in this case that this was a 

divisible harm. Mr. Stewart answered Justice Scalia's 

question incorrectly.

The district court found and the circuit 

court also found -- the circuit court's finding is on 

page 36-A of the Petitioner's appendix -- that there is 

no dispute that the harm here is divisible; that is, 

there -- the -- the harm here is capable of 

apportionment. That is not disputed before this Court.

 What is disputed is whether at the second 

stage of analysis the railroads and Shell met our burden 

-- and we agree it is our burden under restatement 

principles -- of showing the -- the quantum of division, 

the reasonable basis for how the shares were allocated 

by the District Court. And Justice Alito is correct. 

There are meticulous findings, 20 pages of findings, 

based on record evidence from the government's witnesses 

and from the extensive expert testimony that both Shell 

and the railroads put in that went to the apportionment 

issue. Shell argued --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I know 

what it means to say it's a divisible harm.

 MS. SULLIVAN: It's capable of 

apportionment. The restatement suggests in the cases 

applying this -- it says you ask at the first stage: Is 

the harm capable of apportionment as a matter of law? 

And then as a matter of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that means that

whatever percentage of responsibility the parties have, 

that's the percentage of cost that they --

MS. SULLIVAN: They should bear. But then 

they -- it's up to the parties to prove a reasonable 

basis for apportionment. But both Shell and the 

railroads did argue, Justice Ginsburg -- put into 

evidence and argued at the district court that there 

should be apportionment --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does that mean 

that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs 

$2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who, 

and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra 

million it is? Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a 

divisible harm?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the 

district court here was conservative. It allocated all 

of the costs, fixed and specific, to the parties. So 

the conservative estimate of six percent for Shell, nine 

percent for the railroads, was based on the heroic 

assumption that a few drops spilled two football fields 

away of a volatile substance that evaporates twice as 

fast as water would be picked up by a rainfall that 

could happen at the relevant quantities only once every 

ten years according to our expert, once every seven 

years according to the government's expert -- on the

heroic assumption that all of those drips reached the 

pond which created a single plume of contamination. 

Assuming that, then we award six percent or nine percent 

of liability.

 But the point is there was record evidence, 

Justice Ginsburg -- and there is no need for a remand on 

this. There was ample evidence for which the six 

percent and the nine percent could be -- we -- and we 

didn't object and say we --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not normally how 

-- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a 

burden of coming forward. And the one thing that we do 

know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left 

largely to make it up. What he -- the components of his 

allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some 

evidence in the record. But ordinarily when you talk 

about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean 

they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it 

to the district judge to figure out.

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, there is no 

question that both the railroads and Shell argued for 

zero percent liability. But the same evidence that we 

put in and the proposed findings of fact -- for example, 

if you want to look at Docket Nos. 1317 and 1318, 

Shell's proposed findings of fact did suggest a basis

for apportionment. So we met our burden of production 

as well as proof. But the -- to return to the question 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm really concerned about 

the time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure 

you answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2 

million, which is an initial clean-up that has to be 

expended no matter how large the -- the spill was. How 

did you discharge your burden of proof to show that that 

is not the case here or that that is divisible?

 MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, here -- and 

I refer you to the Petitioner's appendix at page -- I'm 

sorry, to the joint appendix at page 288, to the expert 

Kalinouski who described it as a single mass removal 

scheme.

 This is not a case like a toxic soup case in 

a landfill with 238 different chemicals that require 

different extraction procedures. This is a case in 

which two chemicals reached the ground water and were to 

be removed by a single mass extraction scheme, a single 

-- what the expert called at joint appendix 288 a mass 

removal scheme. It was not disputed or argued on appeal 

that there was a single remediation process. So this is 

a simple case in which we are relying --

that cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you 

will have to hire that $2 million machine even if there 

is one drop. So for the cost of that machine it 

couldn't matter if your client put in one drop and 

nobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion 

drops. Can you allocate it? It would seem fair to 

allocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there 

is some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's 

just one single cost that takes place regardless. 

What's the state of the law on that? How do you --

MS. SULLIVAN: May I answer? A reasonable 

basis is all that's required. A practical approximation 

is appropriate here. Here the court did not distinguish 

between fixed capital costs and operating costs that 

might matter in a different case. But the key point 

here is that you should affirm as a matter of Federal 

common law that restatement 433(a) provides only a 

demand for a reasonable basis and not exactitude. Thank 

you very much.
