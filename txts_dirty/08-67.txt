 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument today in Yeager v. United States.

 Mr. Buffone.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BUFFONE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 When a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in 

a defendant's favor, that determination is final and the 

government may not seek an inconsistent determination of 

that issue from a second jury. Unlike acquittals, hung 

counts are not verdicts. They decide nothing, and 

therefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an 

acquittal. A straightforward application of this 

Court's decision in Ashe v. Swenson is all that is 

called for in this case. A new rule is not necessary.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, may I raise 

one preliminary issue? And it's an issue which is --

does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like 

your response to it. Your argument, your Ashe v. 

Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the 

brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal 

essentially determined that your client did not possess

insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts 

of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact. I've 

looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be 

candid to say I did not parse the whole jury 

instruction, so you may very well correct me in the 

assumption that I'm going to make. But the point of the 

-- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your 

argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix, 

and the judge is telling the jurists what they had to 

find. And one of them was that your client made any 

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state 

a material fact necessary in order to make the 

statements made, in the light of the circumstances under 

which they were made, not misleading as charged.

 It seems to me that the jury under that 

instruction could have come back with a verdict of 

acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had 

not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting 

in question, therefore he had no obligation to correct 

any statements, because it is not clear from this 

instruction that he had to correction the statements of 

other people who omitted material facts, and that 

therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the 

only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he 

didn't speak up and say anything.

Is that a possible analysis?

 MR. BUFFONE: I do not believe so, Your 

Honor, for two reasons. First, under the Ashe test as 

interpreted by this Court in Dowling, the record as a 

whole must be analyzed. And in Dowling the Court looked 

at admissions made by the defendant's attorney during 

the course of the second proceeding that identification 

of his client was not an issue. Similarly here, looking 

at the entirety of the record, in its arguments closing 

and opening, and most importantly in its 

cross-examination of Mr. Yeager, the government made 

clear to the jury its theory of omissions. And that 

theory of omission was that Mr. Yeager when he was at 

the 2000 Analysts Conference had a duty to stand up and 

correct omissions if there were any misstatements made 

by others. They argued to the jury that he would be 

guilty of omissions if he did not affirmatively correct 

it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, I agree that did 

seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in 

fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs. But 

is that enough? To my knowledge, we've never held that 

that is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to 

assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that 

the jury necessarily had to find a fact. And I guess

maybe my question boils down to is: Why should what 

perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination 

suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which 

basically is open-ended?

 MR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, first there 

was more to the trial record than a snippet of 

cross-examination. Again, in opening statement the 

government began by arguing to the jury that Mr. Yeager 

was the man behind the screen, that he was --

JUSTICE ALITO: That's the government's --

that's the government's argument. And in order to 

convict for securities fraud based on an omission, isn't 

it necessary for there to be a duty to disclose? And 

what would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury 

here did not find that there was no securities fraud 

because, insofar as the government was proceeding on an 

omissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to 

disclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted.

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, first, the 

instructions permitted alternative ways to reach the 

first element of securities fraud, and one of the three 

alternatives was either misstatements or omissions. And 

I think the instruction, for all of its frailty, was 

clear that the jury could convict on an omissions 

theory. Now, Your Honor's question --

JUSTICE ALITO: I agree with that, but why 

couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud 

based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any 

duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the indictment was 

an integrated theory of fraud, that it charged that Mr. 

Yeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations 

and material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose 

was to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they 

could later engage in insider trading to sell that 

stock. The omissions theory was grounded in the 

indictment. It was elucidated by the instructions, and 

it was clarified so that there could be no uncertainty 

by the cross-examination and arguments of counsel.

 This jury -- under an Ashe analysis, the 

question is what did this jury believe and what did they 

rationally decide?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ashe is quite a 

different case. Ashe is a seriatim prosecution. It was 

one event, a robbery. There were six victims. Victim 

number one, the charge relating to victim number one, 

was an acquittal. That necessarily decided that the 

defendant was not among the robbers. So that is quite a 

different situation from what we have here.

 MR. BUFFONE: Justice Ginsburg, first, it is

my belief that seriatim prosecutions raise no greater 

threat to the core values of double jeopardy than was 

raised here. Those core values are, first of all, the 

finality of acquittals; and the acquittal here was 

offended by any effort to retry an issue of fact 

necessarily decided.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not contending 

that double jeopardy itself was at issue? In other 

words, claim preclusion. There would be no claim 

preclusion, so we're talking only about issue 

preclusion?

 MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I would like 

to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That means it was 

necessarily, the issue was necessarily decided?

 MR. BUFFONE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

We do not argue claim preclusion here. Our argue is 

issue preclusion or previously known as collateral 

estoppel before clarification by this Court.

 Your Honor, to the question of seriatim 

prosecution, again, although Ashe was in a sense a 

seriatim prosecution, in all of the Ashe-type cases 

decided by this Court jeopardy had not even attached, 

let alone terminated.

 The issue we believe should be addressed in

terms of what was the finality of the judgment. The 

finality of the judgment here were six acquittals. 

Those acquittals were final and were not subject to 

redetermination. The issue preclusive effect arises 

from the jury's acquittals, not from the hung counts, 

the hung counts which were not final and which resolved 

nothing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the hung counts are 

equivalent, equivalent to an acquittal?

 MR. BUFFONE: No, Your Honor, I think 

precisely the opposite. Hung counts have none of the 

force of an acquittal. They have none of what this 

Court has historically recognized as the powerful way 

that a jury speaks when it acquits in cases such as 

Martin Linen, where the court recognized that. The hung 

counts historically, as we set out in our brief, were 

not even accepted at common law as an option for a jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we said -- we said in 

Ashe, didn't we, that you should take into account all 

the circumstances in determining what was decided in the 

first acquittal, all the circumstances. How can -- how 

can you close your eyes to the circumstance that is 

alleged here, that the -- the hung jury portion of the 

jury's verdict is simply inconsistent with the acquittal 

portion, and therefore you should not count the

acquittal for double jeopardy purposes? Isn't this part 

of the total circumstances?

 MR. BUFFONE: Justice Scalia, first, we 

believe that the -- I believe that the Ashe test relates 

to the total circumstances on the record. What is it 

from the record that the Court can derive meaning from? 

The Court can derive meaning from all that was presented 

to the jury, and from all that the jury decided. In its 

hung counts, the jury did not speak with the unanimity 

and the finality that it did in its acquittals. As this 

Court, speaking through -- in both the majority and the 

concurring opinions, dissenting opinions in Sattazahn, 

recognized, hung counts speak nothing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in a sense that's 

Justice Scalia's point, that the jury has in effect told 

us nothing, and in effect that argument hurts your case 

in one sense. Hung counts are meaningless.

 MR. BUFFONE: Justice Kennedy, I agree that 

the hung counts are meaningless and that is my point, 

but I believe that it does further our analysis and the 

proper analysis that this Court should engage in. And 

that is, do the acquittals have finality, and is there 

anything inconsistent with the jury's inability to reach 

a determination with the finality of its acquittals? 

The jury did not speak unanimously in its acquittals.

There is no record way to determine why they failed to 

reach a determination, and they are therefore not 

inconsistent with the final determination --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It shows -- it shows that 

-- that the point on which they -- you assert they were 

unanimous and the point on which you say later 

prosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on 

which the jury was confused, because they would have 

come out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on 

the counts that -- that acquitted. They should have 

come out the same way on the -- on the hung counts.

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we simply don't 

know that. The jury may have failed to reach a verdict 

for any number of reasons. On the basis of this record, 

it's quite possible that the reason that the jury failed 

to reach a verdict was that it had 176 counts before it; 

that the jury, as set out in our reply brief, had made 

known to the district court that it was under severe 

financial stress. The jurors wanted the trial to be 

over so that they could get back to their full-time 

employment, and one of the jurors actually asked to be 

removed from the jury because of that financial 

distress.

 In the face of that, the court gave a very 

unusual Allen charge; that after the jury had sent out a

note saying that they were deadlocked, the court issued 

an Allen charge and 70 minutes later discharged the 

jury. It -- the -- the point, Your Honor, is that we 

will never know why this jury --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The point is that they were 

deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming 

we don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice 

Souter raised -- they were deadlocked and would not have 

been deadlocked if indeed they made the -- the acquittal 

finding that you're relying upon for double jeopardy.

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, we know that they 

acquitted. That is a certainty. We have finality to 

those acquittals. They were unanimous and are not 

subject to question again. They cannot be subject to 

appeal, and they cannot be subject to overturning, even 

if they are egregiously erroneous.

 When we lay next to that the hung counts and 

the way that hung counts have historically been looked 

at, first not tolerated by courts: Coercive means 

applied depriving jurors of food and drink and heat in 

cold climates until they reached a verdict; contemporary 

law where we permit Allen charges in a quest for 

unanimity to, wherever possible, have a jury speak its 

will. We cannot equate, in the light of that history 

and the firm precedent of this Court, an inability to

reach a decision with the finality and persuasion of an 

acquittal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if Powell 

extends to subsequent prosecutions -- I know you argue 

that it doesn't, but if it does, isn't it unusual that 

the defendant is in better shape if a jury hangs on the 

non-acquitted count than if he is convicted on the non-

acquitted count?

 MR. BUFFONE: Well, Your Honor, that's a --

a two-edged sword, Mr. Chief Justice. The defendant is 

on the opposite horns of that dilemma. If the counts 

are not joined, then the effect of the acquittal would 

be to bar them by res judicata. So by joinder, he's on 

the other side of that fence. It's, as this Court 

recognized, whose ox is being gored in Powell by either 

the acquittals or the convictions. Well, this is a case 

of whose ox is being gored by the joinder, and it should 

not be dispositive. Collateral estoppel effect should 

apply to counts within an indictment just as res 

judicata would apply if they were separated.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's an obvious question, I 

guess. I would just like to hear your answer directly. 

Case 1, count 1, selling drugs; count 2, using the 

telephone to sell the drugs. All right? The jury 

acquits of the first, convicts of the second. Logically

impossible, but permitted under the law, right?

 MR. BUFFONE: I agree, Your Honor. Under 

Powell --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2 --

MR. BUFFONE: -- there is no question. We 

have conflicting verdicts, and we are not going to try 

to determine what the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Absolutely 

illogical. Case 2, there is no count 1. Case 2, 

telephone count, hung jury; we retry it. Permitted, 

right?

 MR. BUFFONE: Now, Your Honor, that would 

depend on what happened at the trial.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All that happened was that 

they hung.

 MR. BUFFONE: Well, if they hung, Your 

Honor, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Case 2, hung jury, 

telephone count; we retry it. All right. So now why is 

it when we put them together and, case 3, count 1, 

substantive drugs, acquitted; count 2, telephone, hung 

jury. Well, in case 2 we could get a retrial of the 

telephone count. Why can't we get a retrial of the 

telephone count now?

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, it would depend.

JUSTICE BREYER: All that happened is they 

are retrying it just as they did in case 2. Why does 

the presence of count 1 there mean that they can't retry 

it?

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, the presence of 

count 1 in your hypothetical is not dispositive. An 

acquittal on count 1 says --

JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I'm going too fast 

because you didn't take the cases in. Do you want me to 

repeat them? Maybe it's too complicated.

 I'm just saying case 1, count 1, the 

substantive count, conviction. On count 2, telephone 

count, acquittal. Everybody agrees that's permissible. 

Case 2 is only the telephone. That's all they indicted 

him for. And if they have a hung jury, you can, can't 

you, retry him?

 MR. BUFFONE: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, now, when we have case 

3, which is the same as case 1 except that, instead of 

convicting him, they had a hung jury, why can't you 

retry him, just as you could in case 2?

 MR. BUFFONE: Because a hung jury resolves 

nothing, Your Honor. It doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, everybody agrees it 

resolves nothing, and that's why you could retry him in

-- that's why you could retry him in case 2, because it 

resolves nothing. So if you could retry him in case 2, 

why can't you retry him in case 3? What does the 

presence of this other substantive count have to do with 

it. Since it never would have blocked the conviction on 

count 2, why does it stop you from retrying count 2?

 It would never have blocked the conviction 

of count 2. Why does it stop you from retrying it?

 Do you see -- do you see my --

MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the logical point I 

thought the other side was making, and maybe they're not 

because it seems to be striking you as surprising or 

maybe I'm not making it in a clear way. But what I 

wanted was a clear answer to it.

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I believe the --

the clear answer is that for collateral estoppel to 

attach, there must be a necessary determination of a 

factual issue, and the necessary determination of that 

factual issue can occur in your count 1 through an 

acquittal or a conviction. It cannot occur through a 

hung count because there is nothing to be resolved. 

There is nothing that would be necessarily decided.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Buffone, you're --

you're going through a logical analysis. If I

understand your position, the logical analysis is not 

going to win the case for you because, as I understand 

the case that we've got in front of us, we have in 

effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe 

what the law might be in these circumstances. 

One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the 

acquittals determined what you say they did, on that 

model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion 

that is raised.

 On the second model, the model of what we do 

in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no 

preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial. And we've 

simply got both in the same case. The question is: 

Which model do we follow? Do we say preclusion is the 

most important issue here, or do we say the 

open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the --

the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that --

that tells us what we ought to do? How do we choose 

between those two possibilities, each of which is open 

to us?

 MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe 

that that is a clear choice, and the rationale for the 

clarity of that choice is that acquittals have long been 

recognized as being important for finality purposes for 

double jeopardy law. So, for example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Look, I know that, and --

and by the same token, hung juries have long been 

recognized as raising no bar to a further trial. And 

the question is: Why are the values in the -- the 

acquittal case predominating, as you say they are, over 

the values of the retrial possibilities? Why do I 

choose one rather than another?

 MR. BUFFONE: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 

Perez line that tells us that when there is manifest 

necessity arising from a jury not reaching a verdict, 

that retrial is appropriate following a hung count. 

That line of cases stands in -- as I believe is the 

basis of Your Honor's question, stands in sharp contrast 

to the line of cases that require that jury acquittals 

be given final effect, cases like Foo Fong -- Fong Foo, 

excuse me.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We have got both.

 MR. BUFFONE: All right, so what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is it -- and I 

would almost suggest THAT it has to be something outside 

the lines of authority, because the issue here is which 

line of authority are you going to pick. What is it 

outside the lines of authority that says we should -- we 

should pick the acquittal model rather than the hung 

jury model to determine what to do here?

MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I think we should 

go -- the Court should go to the history of its double 

jeopardy jurisprudence, and that makes clear that the 

core concepts underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause are: 

First finality of jury verdicts; and, second, to avoid 

all of the constitutional perils of successive trials, 

because successive trials --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this about the 

finality of jury verdicts? Is -- does the Constitution 

require either Federal or State law to permit the -- a 

partial verdict?

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I do not believe 

that -- I am not aware of a constitutional underpinning 

for that, but certainly the practices in the courts are 

to permit partial verdicts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In every State?

 MR. BUFFONE: I do not know the answer to 

that question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the Constitution 

doesn't require that, then why does the Constitution, in 

your view, require that issue preclusion occur when the 

jury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other 

counts? If -- if a partial verdict were not required, 

and if the jury came back and said, we -- we've reached 

a verdict on some counts but not all counts, the remedy

would be a mistrial on all counts and a retrial on all 

counts.

 Why -- why is it does the Constitution 

require a different result if Federal law or State law 

chooses to allow the return of a partial verdict?

 MR. BUFFONE: Your Honor, I don't believe 

that it would be a different result because I think in 

most jurisdictions, as I understand it, the reaction to 

that kind of a split verdict would be to try to get the 

jury to reach a full and final verdict, to give some 

form of an Allen charge to encourage additional 

deliberations, to seek unanimity in the jury's verdict. 

Where we don't have that unanimity, the Court is forced 

for collateral estoppel, for issue preclusion purposes, 

to Justice Ginsburg's point, not to claim preclusion 

issues.

 If we set aside claim preclusion, the Perez 

line of cases tells us to do what we do with claim 

preclusion. For issue preclusion, the question is, is 

there some finality to what the jury did, in your 

hypothetical its partial verdict that speaks to the 

counts that it was not able to resolve. And if it 

speaks, that after the Ashe analysis that there was an 

issue necessarily decided, then there is a bar under the 

doctrine of issue preclusion to the re-litigation of

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Two separate lines of double jeopardy 

analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can 

retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously 

with acquittals. The first is the principle that the 

government may, under the doctrine of continuing 

jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung. 

The basic principle there is that the government is 

entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and 

that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree, 

interrupt and prevent the government from achieving 

that. Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the 

government from completing its opportunity to obtain a 

verdict.

 The second doctrinal line is that which 

grows out of the Powell case. Collateral estoppel is 

premised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are asking us 

for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell. Powell is 

not a case involving subsequent prosecutions.

 MR. DREEBEN: No. Powell was a case in 

which the Court rejected the doctrine of collateral 

estoppel as a means of upsetting a mixed verdict of 

acquittals and convictions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

in the same proceeding you have two different jury 

verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously, 

one way and one the other way. So to protect the jury's 

conclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without 

undermining the other.

 It's a very different case here. The only 

jury determination you have is the acquittal. If you 

give effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings 

in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only 

determination by the jury.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that it 

undermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice, 

because the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and 

they will bar reprosecution on that offense. To the 

extent that there are determinations that are made by 

the acquittals that are independent of any inconsistency 

with the hung counts, that too can have collateral

estoppel effect in a successive prosecution.

 But I think the crucial thing here is that 

this is not properly viewed as a successive prosecution 

for double jeopardy purposes. Ashe v. Swenson and the 

cases --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? It is a 

successive prosecution.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, it is not in the sense, I 

think, Justice Stevens that the Court used that in Ashe.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is in the sense of an 

indictment that took place after the other acquittal.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that indictment simply 

embodies non-jeopardy-barred counts that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a difference 

in the fact that in the first case where there was a 

conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the 

acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or 

something like that, that says that, therefore, we will 

give effect to the -- the conviction when they're 

simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be 

irrationality in the conflict. But there is no reason 

to doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this 

case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, no, I think that there 

is, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the

Petitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is 

inconsistent with the mistrial. And that's the only way 

in which collateral estoppel could apply, only if the 

jury had necessarily determined a fact on the acquittals 

that should have led to acquittals on the insider 

trading counts.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they had time. And 

when you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they 

just didn't reach a decision on it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- Petitioner's theory 

would be identical if there were one insider trading 

count. And I think that for purposes of this case, the 

Court should not get too distracted by the number of 

counts, because all of the insider trading counts turned 

on a common core of fact. They were all resolved 

identically --

JUSTICE STEVENS: When you have a case in 

which there is no conflict between a guilty and an 

innocent verdict, there isn't -- there is no reason to 

doubt the integrity of the acquittal.

 MR. DREEBEN: We're not questioning the 

integrity of the acquittal as far as it has direct 

double jeopardy application. The question is whether 

the doctrine of collateral estoppel ought to be applied.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And why not? Because the

answer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens 

said. Why is it that -- that if you could have the 

inconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't, 

since they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung 

count? And the answer is, because you're trying him 

again.

 And that's why we have all the briefs that 

we have, because the only way to answer this is to look 

and see if the policies that underlie the collateral 

estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here. And I 

can't think of one that doesn't. I can't think of one 

single one that wouldn't apply.

 Maybe there are some. And I can't think of 

any reason for allowing the government to have a second 

bite at this apple. What is the reason?

 MR. DREEBEN: The reason, Justice Breyer, is 

that the hung counts do not constitute a resolution in 

favor of the defendant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course they don't. Of 

course they don't. Suppose that they never brought up 

that hung count. Then you wouldn't even have the first 

bite at the apple. So you would think it would be a 

fortiori you could go ahead. But that's the case; you 

clearly can't go ahead.

Justice Breyer, that is grounded in double jeopardy 

policies. And I think it goes to the question that 

Justice Souter asked as well, why the Court should 

prefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the 

government to retry the hung counts when they are all 

brought together in the same proceeding? And that is 

this -- and I think it's made most vivid by imagining 

Ashe v. Swenson in a slightly different posture.

 Ashe v. Swenson involved robbery of six 

individuals at a poker game. The government indicted 

each one of them as a separate robbery and the 

government tried one of them first. And in that one, 

the jury's acquittal was understood to mean that the 

defendant was not the robber. If the government could 

go sequentially through and try the other five, it has 

the opportunity to try to wear the defendant down or 

refine its case or improve its case in a way that the 

Court regarded as impermissible.

 But suppose that in Ashe the government 

hadn't done that, it had brought all six robbery 

prosecutions together, and the jury returned one verdict 

of acquittal on one robber and on the other five it 

hung? In that situation I think -- which is the 

situation we have here --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is

there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal. 

They probably compromised, just to say not to be too 

tough on --

MR. DREEBEN: But, Justice Stevens, that is 

identical to this case. There is no difference to this 

case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, here you have 

sequential prosecutions, and there is no reason to 

question the integrity of the acquittal in this case.

 MR. DREEBEN: No. But, Justice Stevens, if 

you would question the integrity of the acquittal, if 

the jury acquits on one robber and hangs on five, that 

is this case. The only difference in this case is it's 

a securities fraud case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think it had 

anything to do with integrity of anything. I thought 

what it had to do with is that they are being tried at 

the same time. And to test that out in my mind, I 

imagine this. In February we try the individual for the 

drug count, he's acquitted. In June we bring a 

telephone count. Absolutely forbidden, right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why should the 

government be one whit better off because, in addition 

to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count

in January along with the other?

 MR. DREEBEN: There are two reasons for 

that, Justice Breyer. The first is that the Double 

Jeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the 

government from attempting to bring its -- all of its 

charges in one indictment against the defendant. What 

the collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the 

government going sequentially, carving its prosecution 

up into pieces, and trying in different attempts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- isn't -- isn't the 

real problem that you raised by your answer the 

following problem: That in this age in which there are, 

as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping 

criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs 

but for telephones, and I don't know what other 

overlapping crimes there -- there may be. Therefore, 

that gives the government by joining a lot of 

overlapping charges or lots of charges with common 

elements in either one indictment through various counts 

or simply by a series of indictments to be tried 

together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of 

getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on 

some of those issues. And if the government can bring 

loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a 

hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government

in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice 

Breyer's hypothetical suggested.

 If they wait and bring the second count in 

June, there's an issue preclusion. But if they bring it 

together, they've got an irrational verdict and there's 

no issue preclusion. Therefore, isn't the policy behind 

both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension 

a policy that argues in favor of saying don't let the 

government have all these bites at the apple, because in 

fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions? 

What's -- what's your response to that argument?

 MR. DREEBEN: My response to that, Justice 

Souter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of 

a balance of values. There is of course the interest 

that Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing 

interest is that the government should have one full and 

fair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that 

have been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of 

probable cause, and that does not occur when the hung 

counts deprive the government of that one opportunity.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But does the -- does the 

government ask for something more than one fair chance 

when it comes in with 117 counts? Maybe the fair chance 

consists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a 

number of indictments that one can reasonably expect a

-- a jury to handle without either getting totally 

confused or totally exhausted.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, let me -- let me give 

two answers to that, Justice Souter. First of all, the 

position for which Petitioner argues does not depend on 

the number of counts. If there had been two counts in 

the indictment --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right, I'm making an 

argument that he did not make.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- it would be the same.

 But more fundamentally, I think that the 

number of counts in this indictment should not lead the 

Court to think that this was a case in which the 

government overcharged in some nefarious effort. First 

of all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on 

the government, and that's why sound prosecution policy 

dictates against overcharging. Here I don't think it's 

fair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for 

overcharging, and that is because they break up into 

logically distinct units.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not, when considering 

what the government did on its second chance? It 

trimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the 

new indictment, there were 5. There were 99 counts of 

laundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within

the jury's ken. But isn't the most likely thing in this 

case that the jury was simply exhausted?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice 

Ginsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn 

on the same fact: did Petitioner have inside 

information, did he know that the Enron broadband system 

that he was integrally involved in, was the strategic 

manager in charge of, wasn't working? If he had that 

knowledge and he traded, the number of counts is really 

irrelevant, and I think that the fact that the jury 

resolved all of the insider trading counts the same way 

and the money laundering counts just had to do with the 

disposition of the proceeds, they're all resolved the 

same way.

 The jury obviously deadlocked on whether 

some fact that the government needed to prove for those 

counts was established. And the bizarre thing, I think, 

about Petitioner's position is that he seeks to get 

through a legal doctrine, collateral estoppel, which is 

a big extension from what the Double Jeopardy Clause 

textually prohibits, exactly what the jury would not 

give him. The jury --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- the 

point about the big extension, you were rather coy in 

your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson.

Are you asking us to revisit that?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

think that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in 

order to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say 

that Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed 

certain civil policies that are -- are expressed through 

the doctrine of issue preclusion into the double 

jeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the 

history of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by 

the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires 

the same events.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're not 

going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about 

the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we rely on that 

the case is pretty easy, isn't it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that it is because it 

says that the same offense is what you're protected 

against for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this 

case are distinct under Blockburger. But my point 

about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person was in 

jeopardy on the hung offense as well.

clear that the jeopardy continues until the government 

has the opportunity to obtain a verdict. So the fact 

that his jeopardy began is not what entitles him to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under this Court's 

decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy 

Clause.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it then becomes a 

question of what is the meaning of jeopardy. But 

insofar as the Court imported collateral estoppel into 

the Double Jeopardy Clause, it should keep in mind in 

deciding whether to extend that doctrine that in the 

civil context a crucial predicate for collateral 

estoppel is the ability of the adversely affected party 

to appeal, and that is because before we rely on 

collateral estoppel, we want to have some assurances 

that there actually is integrity to the necessarily 

determined fact that is going to preclude litigation in 

another case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the key to your 

argument is the government is entitled to one full and 

fair opportunity to try its case. It had that 

opportunity the first time around.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that this 

Court's decisions since --

counts, that would have been -- that would have been a

 MR. DREEBEN: Since 1824 this Court has 

defined the government's full and fair opportunity to 

include the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here 

what the defendant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it has -- but it has 

the right to retry in the same position as it would have 

been if it had not brought the first proceeding. And if 

it had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it 

would have been barred.

that it's in the same position --

 MR. DREEBEN: -- as if it had not bought it.

 MR. DREEBEN: It's -- it -- in this case 

what the government did was to bring all of its cases 

together. And I return to the hypothetical about 

Ashe v. Swenson because I think it strikes everyone as 

very strange to say that if the jury in Ashe v. Swenson 

had been presented with all six robbers and had 

acquitted on only one and had a returned -- you know, an 

inability to reach a verdict --

Dunn doctrine, which itself is questionable. It 

basically says there is a certain situation in which we 

will tolerate what may be an irrational verdict, and the 

reason we tolerate it is that the acquittal itself may 

be explained on other grounds. Namely --

MR. DREEBEN: I'm not relying on Dunn in 

this hypothetical. I'm presupposing that the jury hung 

with respect to the other five robbers. And all the 

government would come back and say is: For two separate 

reasons, we should be able to retry those counts against 

the other five robbers. One is that when there is a 

hung jury it's settled double jeopardy law that the 

government has an opportunity to retry; and the other is 

if you accept the proposition that the jury's action was 

inconsistent because one of the robbers earned an 

acquittal and the other five logically should have been 

the same if the jury had found that the defendant wasn't 

the robber, the jury was unable to return a verdict.

 Collateral estoppel depends on the idea that 

there is a rational jury, and if the jury has acted 

inconsistently, we don't have that basis of rationality 

that supports the policy justifications of collateral 

estoppel.

doctrine of inconsistent verdicts depends on the

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, such as lenity for the 

defendant. The government doesn't get the opportunity 

to appeal an acquittal. The government doesn't get the 

opportunity to go behind the acquittal and ask whether 

the jury acted rationally. All of things -- those 

things are true in civil cases where the doctrine of 

issue preclusion applies.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Start the other side, which 

I think Justice Stevens was suggesting. Assume that 

there was only one trial on the substantive count in 

January. Now each -- he's acquitted. Now you decide to 

indict him in July on the telephone count. You argue to 

the judge: Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy 

here because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first 

time because they were lenient. Maybe they liked his 

looks. Maybe they were distracted by a fly. Maybe they 

were, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an 

appeal. Are you going to win that case?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not under --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, not even a close. 

Okay. Not even close.

 Now, since you're going to lose that case, I 

grant you there's thousands of case talking about your

ability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury. I 

concede all those. None of them talks about double 

jeopardy, to my knowledge.

 So we're back to the hypothetical. You've 

lost your case. Now, all that you did to turn that case 

into a winning case was you also indicted him on the 

telephone count in January. Now, that was my question 

the first time, and you began to have two answers. I 

just didn't see why the government should be any better 

off because they also indicted him in January. Given 

the language "double jeopardy," you might think the 

government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's 

keep them neutral.

 So what is the reason that the government 

should be worse off because they indicted him in January 

on the telephone count as well as in June?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the government should 

not be worse off.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no -- better. I 

misspoke.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the reason is that 

when, Justice Breyer, you said double jeopardy is not 

involved in the cases involving the government's ability 

to retry on a hung count, that's not accurate. The 

Court has regarded the doctrine of double jeopardy as a

balance of policies, and one of the fundamental policies 

is when the jury cannot agree, the government has the 

right to retry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's 

right, and your argument depends upon that interest 

balancing against the interest in giving effect to the 

acquittal verdict.

 Now, what if I think, under the Seventh 

Amendment that's -- that what is important is protecting 

jury verdicts? And the interest in the irrational case, 

when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you 

have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the 

other without undermining one of them. Here, however, 

you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal 

without undermining another jury verdict. You certainly 

undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after 

a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the 

Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case 

comes out the other way, right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think so, Mr. 

Chief Justice, because I think you still have to focus 

on the intrinsic character of the doctrine of issue 

preclusion, which does depend on a rational jury. Let's 

apply it to the facts of this case, because there is --

your statement of the facts. Is there any insider 

information with relation to the insider information 

charges that is different in any respect from the 

insider information in connection with the substantive 

challenge?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, there is 

not. The government's theory here was that on the 

substantive securities fraud count, which related to the 

January 20th, 2000, analysts meeting, Mr. Yeager was 

integrally involved in formulating the message and was 

therefore accountable for misstatements to the 

marketplace about Enron broadband communications 

efficacy and effectiveness and technological value. The 

jury, if it rejected that, would acquit on those counts 

-- on that count, without reaching the question did Mr. 

Yeager know factually that the statements that were made 

by others at that analysts conference and in the press 

releases subsequently were inaccurate? If the answer to 

that question is yes, he had the information, then he 

could be liable for insider trading even though he is 

not liable for substantive securities fraud because he 

had nothing to do with creating the statements or 

misstatements to the marketplace.

 And I think I do take issue with 

Petitioner's suggestion that the theory of this case was

an omissions theory. The way that Mr. Yeager argued the 

case to the jury was that I didn't have any involvement 

in preparing or making statements at that January 20th 

analysts conference; you can't convict me of what other 

people may have said. And the jury instructions advised 

the jury that it had to find that he participated in the 

scheme and that he either made the statements or caused 

the statements or omissions to be made. If it rejected 

that, it easily acquits on the securities fraud. And as 

a result even if this Court were inclined to apply 

collateral estoppel across mixed counts in a verdict of 

acquittals and hung counts, which we submit it should 

not do, the defendant still has to carry his burden of 

showing necessarily that the jury resolved an issue of 

fact in his favor that would preclude the next 

prosecution.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he -- he 

carried that burden before the court of appeals.

 MR. DREEBEN: But the court of appeals 

relied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that 

he participated in the planning and preparation and 

statements that were made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Revisiting of that 

issue was not included within the question presented.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it's included in

our ability to defend the judgment. The District Court 

in this case made it quite clear that collateral 

estoppel did not apply because the acquittals could rest 

on the basis that Mr. Yeager did not participate in the 

analysts conference and in the press statements that 

were the basis for the wire fraud and the securities 

fraud omissions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we -- if we 

agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict 

that we granted cert to resolve would still continue.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, you could resolve it. I 

would hope that you would resolve it in a favor of a 

disposition that doesn't require you to reach the 

factual issue, but if the Court resolves the legal issue 

against us, I think it should revisit the analysis of 

the court of appeals because government isn't defending 

the precise way in which the court of appeals went about 

analyzing the double jeopardy issue, and its question of 

what facts were necessarily determined was resolved 

incorrectly, I think, as a matter of clear error. I 

don't even think Mr. Yeager will stand up on rebuttal 

and tell you that he didn't argue to the jury that his 

client was not involved in -- in the creation of the 

statements at that analyst meeting because he did make 

that argument.

And I do think that it's important that if 

the Court is going to go down a track of allowing 

collateral estoppel for mixed verdicts, that it 

encourage rigor in the way that courts determine whether 

a fact was necessarily decided by the jury.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that first 

theory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is 

always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of 

appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on 

that point, or am I incorrect?

 MR. DREEBEN: They have not reasoned it the 

way that the government reasons it, but I think that the 

Fifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the 

government argued as well as the D.C. Circuit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: A different question: 

Suppose you prevail. The hung counts are retried. And 

the jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time. 

Is there any point at which the district court can 

intervene in the exercise of its own authority and 

discretion just to dismiss the charges?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy, because I think the interest that's being 

vindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's --

as I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred 

to Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy

has never been a jurisprudence of black and white. You 

could you read the clause as saying one trial for a 

defendant. If the defendant is -- doesn't get a 

conviction at that trial, game over. But the Court has 

never done that because the double jeopardy clause has 

always involved a balance of the society's very 

important interests in having the opportunity for a 

decision up or down on whether a defendant is guilty.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the government can 

try year after year to get a conviction and were the 

defendant down? Nothing the Court can do so long as 

there's a hung jury?

 MR. DREEBEN: If the -- if the jury hangs, 

the government can retry, and there have been cases 

where --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the rule in all of 

the States? Don't some States give authority to the 

judges to say, enough is enough?

 MR. DREEBEN: I am not aware whether any 

States do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy, 

this Court has never suggested that there is. I think 

as a matter of common sense, prosecutors who are unable 

to achieve a verdict after a certain number of trials do 

tend to conclude that it's not in the interest of 

society to keep trying. But certainly one hung jury

followed by a retrial is customary rather than an 

exception to the rule, and the reason why that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But one hung jury followed 

by a second when there has been an acquittal the first 

time around is not customary.

 MR. DREEBEN: But the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the difference is in 

the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the 

integrity of the jury's verdict. You're following the 

acquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the 

Dunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here 

because you're talking about two different juries. 

You're saying the second jury should have an -- an 

opportunity to correct what the first jury did, even 

though it would not have that opportunity if the first 

jury had not faced the issue.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I -- Justice 

Stevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had 

really believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and 

was completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all 

counts.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It should have, but it 

didn't. We know that. And we just know they did not 

reach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a 

conclusion on the count on which they acquitted.

MR. DREEBEN: We should have -- we should 

presume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that 

the jury followed the instructions that it was given, 

and the instructions that it was given --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you make the same 

presumption when there is an inconsistent verdict, but 

you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it 

because of the one jury, and they may have had non --

unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the 

guy off on the one count.

 MR. DREEBEN: But I think that there is no 

reason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action 

to then be used for the jury's acquittal to block 

complete prosecution.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury did not take 

irrational action in this case. The only action --

that's relevant was the acquittal. The other they 

didn't act.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, they acted irrationally 

in the sense that if a fact necessarily determined 

acquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be irrational if 

they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't 

agree for who knows why.

have agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager 

never had inside information or acted in good faith. 

And the jury is instructed to consider each count, count 

by count, it was given instructions at the Allen phase 

of the case that it should strive to achieve a verdict, 

that Mr. Yeager is entitled to a verdict of not guilty 

if, in fact, the jury believes that he is not guilty and 

that it should make every effort to reach the verdict.

 Now, the fact that it didn't, and it would 

have been very easy for it to do, if it had determined 

logically that he did not have inside information, is a 

reason for hesitating before extrapolating out from 

those acquittals and blocking the government's 

opportunity to retry the hung counts.

 Mr. Yeager's position logically --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not all that clear, 

because as you argue the court -- the district court was 

correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue. And 

it's obviously a very difficult issue because judges 

have disagreed about it and the government and your 

opponent disagree on it. So, it's entirely possible 

that the jury wasn't able to figure it all out.

 MR. DREEBEN: I -- I don't think it is that 

difficult of an issue. I think the district court which 

was closer to it, which had presided over the trial and

which read the closing arguments, made findings that 

make it quite clear what Mr. Yeager argued and how those 

arguments were totally consistent --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The jury could not have 

been as confused as the court of appeals was.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that --

(Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN: If the jury was confused and 

it acted in an irrational manner, that's a reason not to 

apply collateral estoppel, not a reason to do it. What 

Mr. Yeager's theory implies is that if the jury had come 

back and -- under the Federal Rules of Criminal 

Procedure it can return partial verdicts. If the jury 

had come back and said we're struggling on some of the 

counts, we have a partial verdict on others of them, and 

the judge said, okay, we'll take the partial verdict; 

and the jury came in and said, we acquit on five counts, 

that Mr. Yeager's theory would be that the judge should 

say that's great, collateral estoppel now means you 

don't get to finish the deliberations on the counts on 

which you said you can't agree. And that result makes 

no sense, neither does blocking retrial in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your theory 

depends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some 

action by the jury. Now, obviously it does in some

sense.

 But if you view -- if you accept the 

proposition that juries only act by returning verdicts, 

and that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung 

jury the jury hasn't really done anything in the way 

jurors act, then the case comes out -- then the 

defendant prevails, right?

 MR. DREEBEN: I assume I can answer your 

question, Mr. Chief Justice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, because the -- the logic 

of the situation here is that in order for collateral 

estoppel to apply, there needs to be a rational jury 

verdict. And Ashe versus Swenson tells us that in 

attempting to decide what the jury rationally resolved, 

we look at all evidence in the record, not just some.

 So it isn't necessary to treat the jury's 

hung counts as if they are verdicts of a sort. They 

simply are data which show that if the jury had been 

rational and it had resolved a fact in favor of the 

defendant that was necessary for the government to prove 

on the other counts, it would have resolved those as 

acquittals as well. And once you take into account that 

total record, the doctrine of collateral estoppel with 

its premise of rationality cannot be applied.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Buffone, you have six minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BUFFONE: The Solicitor General has 

essentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view 

of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this 

Court from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important 

protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to 

issue preclusion must be approached with reason, with 

rationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to 

protect the public policies that underlie the Double 

Jeopardy Clause. And that is quite simply that what 

happened here should not occur. That a defendant should 

not be forced to relitigate before a second jury an 

issue that was necessarily decided.

 I sat through and argued through 

13-and-a-half-week jury trial. A reasonable and 

rational explanation of what occurred there is that we 

had a conscientious jury that followed its instructions, 

that tried to reach through a complex 176-count 

indictment, and they simply were not able to. They 

spoke the community will, and they spoke it forcefully 

in their acquittals. Six of them.

 And the only conclusion that can be reached

from those acquittals is that Mr. Yeager did not possess 

insider information.

 At the beginning of this trial we filed two 

motions, the first challenging the specificity of the 

indictment, and the second seeking a Bill of 

Particulars. The district court answered both with the 

same answer. The insider information that Mr. Yeager is 

charged with possessing in the insider trader counts is 

the false statements made by others at the 2000 Analysts 

Conference.

 The omissions theory was not as the 

Solicitor General submits, some afterthought. It was 

core to the government's prosecution and it was core to 

the case. The jury decided that the omissions theory 

was not a basis to convict on the six counts that it 

acquitted. It determined that Mr. Yeager did not 

possess that information. And Mr. Yeager is entitled to 

the benefits of those acquittals. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
