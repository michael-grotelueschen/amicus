3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 12-547, Metrish v. Lancaster. 

Mr. Bursch? 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. BURSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court: 

This is a Sixth Circuit habeas appeal 

11 involving AEDPA deference. Harrington v. Richter holds 

12 that a Federal court may only overturn a State court 

13 conviction that is such an erroneous misapplication of 

14 this Court's clearly established precedent as to be 

beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement, that 

16 is, an extreme malfunction. 

17  Here, a fair-minded jurist could conclude 

18 that the Michigan Supreme Court's Carpenter decision was 

19 neither indefensible, nor unexpected, when it simply 

applied plain statutory language in accord with 

21 well-established Michigan interpretive principles. 

22  Accordingly, the Michigan Court of Appeals 

23 application of Carpenter was not error, and the Sixth 

24 Circuit should be reversed. 

I'd like to begin with the statutory text.

1 In 1975, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive 

2 mental capacity affirmative defense statute. In it, the 

3 defenses are defined for mental illness and mental 

4 retardation, but it says nothing about diminished 

capacity. 

6  And that silence is crucial here because, in 

7 Michigan, for over 200 years, it has been a code 

8 jurisdiction, which means that, if the statutes address 

9 a particular area of criminal law, only that statute 

applies, and the Michigan courts are not allowed to 

11 either add to or subtract from that statutory text. 

12  So only the Michigan legislature had the 

13 power to add a diminished capacity defense. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: 200 years -- 200 years? 

16 Did you say that? 

17  MR. BURSCH: Yes. Actually, even before 

18 Michigan was a territory -- I'm -- before it was a 

19 State, in 1810, it passed a law that abolished common 

law criminal principles when there was a statute that 

21 addressed the -- the subject matter. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was some law in 

23 effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 

24 till the year 2001. There was no statute, and there was 

no ancient common law. But what was it? If I asked you 

4

25

Official 

1 the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished 

2 capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond? 

3  MR. BURSCH: It changed one time. In 1973, 

4 there was a Michigan Court of Appeals decision that 

recognized, as a matter of common law, the diminished 


6 capacity defense, but that was set aside by the 1975 


7 statute, which established all the comprehensive 


8 diminished capacity defenses available and left out 


9 diminished capacity. 


So in 1975, 1976 -- you know, 1978 --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how was the 

12 Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense? Did 

13 it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute. 

14  MR. BURSCH: Well, what the Michigan Court 

of Appeals did, beginning in 1978, in the Mangiapane 

16 case, was to ask, is diminished capacity part of the 

17 statutory code? And it never held, expressly, that it 

18 was. What it did in Mangiapane and in subsequent cases, 

19 it assumed that the defense existed, but it never held 

that. And that dicta could not override the plain 

21 language of the statute. 

22  And, in fact, counsel on the other side has 

23 not pointed to a single Michigan decision where a 

24 conviction or an exoneration on acquittal or even a 

finding of ineffective assistance was ever based on the

1 diminished capacity defense. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the 1973 case that you 

3 mentioned based on a statute, or was it based on, 

4 allegedly, a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed 

the court to fill? I mean, is that the way the 1973 

6 case came about? And was the 1973 case followed by 

7 other courts? Or was it just an isolated precedent? 

8  MR. BURSCH: The 1973 case was a common law 

9 vacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature 

had not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and 

11 so it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a 

12 common law decision. 

13  There were no other cases that relied on it 

14 before the '75 statute was enacted. And, after that 

point, the Michigan appellate courts did not look to the 

16 '72 decision as the source of the doctrine. They 

17 assumed that, if it existed, it must be somewhere within 

18 the statute. 

19  And then, in Carpenter, in 2001, the 

Michigan Supreme Court, when, finally, the very first 

21 Michigan court to look at the question explicitly says, 

22 well, it's not in the statute, diminished capacity isn't 

23 there, we've got mental retardation, we've got mental 

24 illness, no diminished capacity. As the Michigan 

judiciary, we lack the power to add the diminished

1 capacity defense. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, we don't --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Please. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, we don't really have 

6 to reach this issue in this case, according to your 

7 submission, but what would happen if a State -- an 

8 intermediate State appellate court said the law is 

9 such-and-such and then a -- a person is tried in the 

interim -- is tried and, subsequently, the State supreme 

11 court says that intermediate State court decision was 

12 incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law 

13 was exactly the opposite? 

14  MR. BURSCH: I think you would apply the 

same principles to that hypothetical as you did in 

16 Rogers, and -- and, in Rogers, you had a nearly 100-year 

17 common law history of the year and a day rule in the 

18 Tennessee Supreme Court, that the defense was available 

19 to use that term for nearly 100 years, and, yet, it 

didn't violate due process in Rogers for the Tennessee 

21 Supreme Court to abolish the rule because it was neither 

22 indefensible nor unexpected. 

23  Now, this case is much easier than Rogers or 

24 your hypothetical, for several reasons. First, as I 

mentioned, it's a habeas case, and so we've got the 

7

Official 

1 layer of AEDPA deference that wasn't there. 


2  Second, we're not talking about the 


3 evolution of the common law, like we were in Rogers. 


4 We're talking about a statute, and the statute meant 


what it said in '75, just like it did in '01, just like 

6 it does today. 

7  And the last thing is that, in the Rogers 

8 case, even the Tennessee Supreme Court acknowledged 

9 there was a change. And, here, the Michigan Supreme 

Court said there was no change because the statute said 

11 what it said in 1975, and that meant no diminished 

12 capacity. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what I'm wondering is 

14 how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a 

State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the 

16 State. Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the 

17 law of the State? Isn't that what our decision in Fiore 

18 says? 

19  If the State supreme court says, this is the 

law, and it's always been the law, then how can we 

21 second-guess that? 

22  MR. BURSCH: Well, Justice Alito, I would 

23 think about it in -- in two pieces. And the first piece 

24 is can you second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court's 

interpretation of the statute? And I think the answer 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 there, everybody has to agree, is no. The State's 


2 interpretation of its own statute binds this Court, 


3 binds all Federal courts, just like the South Carolina 


4 Supreme Court decision in -- in Bouie did. 


With respect to the Michigan Supreme Court's 

6 analysis of the retroactive effect, I agree that Fiore 

7 stands for that very proposition, and I think Indiana 

8 makes that case very forcefully in the multi-State amici 

9 brief. 

You don't have to reach that question here, 

11 however, because given the AEDPA standard and the fact 

12 that the Michigan Supreme Court decision was so clearly 

13 not a misapplication of Rogers and Bouie, it makes this 

14 a relatively easy case. 

But I think you'd be fully within your right 

16 to follow the Fiore holding. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: You -- you suggested, 

18 General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory 

19 makes your position easier. 

MR. BURSCH: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: And I wonder if that's true. 

22 I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other 

23 way, which suggests that we all understand that common 

24 law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare 

for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute 

9

1 means and that that's not foreseeable in the same way. 


2  So -- now, especially if it were a single 


3 court, saying the statute means A today, and then, 


4 tomorrow, it comes back, and it says, no, it means B, 


whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut 

6 against your position. 

7  MR. BURSCH: Justice Kagan, I think this is 

8 the easiest case because it's not just statutory 

9 interpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a 

statute that is just plain on its face. If you had an 

11 ambiguous statute, yes, then maybe there would be some 

12 more uncertainty. 

13  But where you've got a statute that 

14 enumerates several defenses, does not include diminished 

capacity, and, under Michigan law, if it's not 

16 enumerated, it's not there, and the courts can't add it. 

17 That does make this easier. 

18  I think it was probably a bigger challenge 

19 in Rogers, for example, to acknowledge that, one, 

Tennessee law had changed right out from underneath the 

21 defendant; and, yet, even given that change, this Court 

22 was comfortable that it was not indefensible or 

23 unexpected. 

24  I think when --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What about the Michigan

25

Official 

1 Court of Appeals? There's only one court of appeals, 

2 right? 

3  MR. BURSCH: Correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that court, 

several times, recognized diminished capacity as a 

6 defense. 

7  MR. BURSCH: Well, it -- it didn't recognize 

8 it as a defense, in the sense that it analyzed the 

9 statute and said, yes, the defense is available. It, in 

many instances, assumed that it might exist, and, if it 

11 did, then this is the result. 

12  The closest it comes is this Mangiapane 

13 decision in 1978, and the court says, very specifically, 

14 there that the definition of mental illness in the 

statute is similar to diminished capacity, but the court 

16 says, at page 247 of the Northwest Second Report, the 

17 court was not prepared to say they are identical. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The --

19  MR. BURSCH: So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your colleague said that 

21 there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's 

22 the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished 

23 capacity as a defense. 

24  MR. BURSCH: Recognizing it as a possible 

defense. Again, in every single one of those cases, all

1 of which would be contrary to the statutory language, 

2 incidentally, not a single one of them did a conviction 

3 or an acquittal or a finding of ineffective assistance 

4 ever turn on that point. And so, in that sense, it's 

also, again, very much like Rogers, where this Court 

6 said that the year and a day rule had never been used 

7 for an acquittal or a conviction in any Tennessee case. 

8  And so the question is, again, through the 

9 AEDPA deference lens, which is very high, was the 

Carpenter decision defensible and expected? And we 

11 would submit that any time that a State supreme court 

12 applies the plain language of the statute in accord with 

13 established principles of interpretation in that State, 

14 it could almost never be indefensible or unexpected. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That seems a little 

16 strange, for the following reason -- just as I think 

17 this case presents an example, you're claiming it's 

18 clear because the supreme court said it was clear, but 

19 the court of appeals in -- in Mangiapane, whether or not 

it assumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says 

21 that it believes that the definition of legal insanity 

22 includes diminished capacity. 

23  Its holding didn't need that analysis, 

24 because it could have assumed it and then just said, but 

no notice was given, so the defense fails here. It took 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 the time to analyze just this question and came to a 

2 contrary conclusion. Its contrary conclusion was that 

3 "legal insanity" was a broad enough term under Michigan 

4 law to encompass this defense. 

The court of -- the State supreme court has 

6 now said, no, it's not. But I don't know that that 

7 makes the statute any less ambiguous, merely because a 

8 court announces that it thinks it's not. 

9  MR. BURSCH: Well, two responses to that, 

Justice Sotomayor. First, I want to be, again, very 

11 careful about what Mangiapane actually held. It did 

12 look at the statutory language and, at page 247, said, 

13 "We are not prepared to say they are identical," meaning 

14 the definition of mental illness and the concept of 

diminished capacity. 

16  There, the question was procedural because 

17 the defendant had not given the prosecutor notice of any 

18 defense, based on mental capacity in the trial court, 

19 and so the court said, well -- you know, assuming that 

the -- the defense exists, we are not prepared to decide 

21 that today --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I --

23  MR. BURSCH: -- because you would have to 

24 give statutory notice. 

The second --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I would have thought 

2 your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have 

3 thought your first response to -- to the question would 

4 have been to deny that you say it's clear because the 

supreme court of Michigan has said so. I thought your 

6 argument is it's clear because it's clear. 

7  MR. BURSCH: Justice Scalia, that was my 

8 second point. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, okay. 

(Laughter.) 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It should have been your 

12 first point. The premise is simply wrong. You're 

13 saying it was clear because the statute's clear. 

14  MR. BURSCH: It was clear. And if any 

Michigan court had had the opportunity to actually 

16 decide it on the merits in light of this 200-year 

17 history of Michigan being a criminal code State, it was 

18 clear. And so this is the point when a State court 

19 decision is most defensible and most expected, applying 

the plain language of a clear statute in accord with 

21 State principles. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any States with 

23 a statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan 

24 statute that have interpreted the statute to say it does 

include diminished capacity?

Official 

1  MR. BURSCH: Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware 

2 of --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: This statute is -- fairly 

4 well tracks the common law tradition, which indicates 

that diminished capacity is not a defense. 

6  MR. BURSCH: Right. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just curious to know 

8 if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion 

9 under a statute like this. 

MR. BURSCH: I'm not aware of any other 

11 States that have the same statute and have addressed the 

12 question one way or the other. I do know that the 

13 language of the Michigan statute is fairly unique. If 

14 you look in the criminal law treatises, we're kind of in 

a category of only a very few States that -- you know, 

16 on the one hand, define mental illness and mental 

17 retardation, do not define or mention diminished 

18 capacity, and, yet, still have this guilty, but insane 

19 option, which is something that Michigan common law did 

not have, but then that was added in the '75 statute. 

21 So it's a little bit unique. 

22  I think it's also unique to Michigan that we 

23 have this 200-year criminal code history, which, if 

24 you're interested, you can read all about it in the In 

re Lamphere case that we cite on page 4 to 5 of our

1 reply brief. But it's when you put those things 


2 together that really make this such an easy case. 


3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General, I guess I 


4 wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really 


says, as opposed to what courts said it says. I mean, 

6 sometimes, judges make errors, and our law is dotted 

7 with places where courts have made errors and said that 

8 things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they 

9 do mean, and -- you know, we expect people to follow 

what the court says is the law, even if there's really a 

11 better reading out there. 

12  And, also, we think that people should rely 

13 on what the court says is the law, even though there's 

14 really a better reading out there. And so -- you know, 

what does it matter if we come out and said -- and 

16 say -- you know, what were these crazy Michigan courts 

17 doing? 

18  If that's what they were doing, it seems as 

19 though people had a right to rely on that. 

MR. BURSCH: Well, the expectation, 

21 certainly, is that people would rely on Michigan 

22 statutory law. And I concede that this would be a more 

23 difficult case if the Michigan Supreme Court in, say, 

24 1990 had come out in a published opinion and said the 

exact opposite of what it said in 2001. Obviously,

1 that's not what happened here. 

2  But -- but ultimately -- you know, the 

3 question that would have been on -- on Mr. Lancaster's 

4 mind back in 1993 when he shot and killed Toni King was, 

does Michigan law prohibit me -- will it punish me if 

6 I -- I kill someone? 

7  And -- and, clearly, he had to know that. 

8 And, if he had looked at the 1975 statute, he would have 

9 seen that diminished capacity was not mentioned there. 

So to the extent that he -- he wanted to rely on that 

11 defense, he wouldn't have found it in Michigan's 

12 codified law. 

13  Now, I know the argument on the other side 

14 is, well, we have these other cases which -- you know, 

mention the doctrine, kind of assume without deciding 

16 that -- that it's out there. And he wants to assume 

17 that he has all the knowledge of that, but not the 

18 knowledge of the background principle that Michigan 

19 won't add affirmative defenses to a statute through a 

judicial action. 

21  And, if you're going to impute any knowledge 

22 to him -- and -- and we submit that you probably 

23 shouldn't, then you've got to impute all the knowledge 

24 of Michigan law, the plain language of the statute and 

the interpretive principles that should guide what that

1 statute means. 

2  He knew that killing someone was wrong, 

3 unquestionably, he was on fair notice of that. And --

4 and just like in Rogers, this diminished capacity 

defense after 1975 was never relied on by any Michigan 

6 court to either hold someone guilty or to acquit them or 

7 to find that there was ineffective assistance. It just 

8 was not the kind of well-established principle that 

9 could possibly make the Carpenter decision either 

indefensible or unexpected. 

11  And then, when you layer that on top with 

12 AEDPA deference -- you know, really, this is about as 

13 simple as it gets. There is no decision of -- of this 

14 Court, not Rogers, not Bouie, not Fiore, not Bunkley, 

any Court decision that is contrary to or misapplied in 

16 this Michigan Court of Appeals opinion. 

17  Unless the Court has any further questions, 

18 I'll reserve the balance of my time.

1 Respondent had a well-established, uncontested right to 

2 present evidence of diminished capacity in order to 

3 negate the elements of premeditation and deliberation in 

4 the first-degree murder charge against him, and he did 

assert that defense at his first trial. That trial was 

6 rendered unfair by the prosecutor's Batson error. 

7  Respondent was not allowed to present the 

8 same defense at his retrial, however, because, 8 years 

9 after his offense, the Michigan Supreme Court 

unexpectedly changed the rules in midstream, holding in 

11 Carpenter that a statute that had been enacted 26 years 

12 before and that did not use the words "diminished 

13 capacity" did not express an intent to abolish any 

14 defense of diminished capacity, but the Supreme Court 

held that it had been abolished. 

16  That was fundamentally unfair to Respondent, 

17 all the more so, because, if the Michigan courts had 

18 ruled correctly on the Batson issue, retrial would have 

19 occurred before 2001, and there's no question, but that 

Respondent would have been able to raise the diminished 

21 capacity as --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: He would have been able to 

23 raise it. There's a lot of question about whether it 

24 would have been successful because, if it had gone up to

would have had the same result as here. 

6  MR. MOGILL: With all due respect -- I'm 

7 sorry. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: And your only -- your only 

9 defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise. But 

I don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has 

11 been, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has 

12 described it, that -- that there's a clear tradition. 

13 If -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will 

14 not -- will not supplement it by -- by common law 

additions. 

16  Did he not know that? 

17  MR. MOGILL: With all due respect to 

18 opposing counsel, I -- the view -- our view of the law 

19 is -- is entirely different. Michigan recognizes the 

common law in its constitution. Michigan law has -- was 

21 firmly established that the diminished capacity defense 

22 existed. By 1973 --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say it was 

24 firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion 

by the solicitor general that there is no case

MR. MOGILL: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what case --

7  MR. MOGILL: Well, first of all -- I'm 

8 sorry, Justice Scalia. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- lets the defendant off 

on the basis of diminished capacity? 

11  MR. MOGILL: The -- let somebody off? Well, 

12 first of all, we're not talking about --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What case has a holding --

14 a holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or 

mitigates the crime. 

16  MR. MOGILL: Mitigates. 

17  Justice Scalia, in Lynch itself in 1973, 

18 Ms lynch was charged with first-degree murder for the 

19 starvation -- in relation to the starvation death of her 

infant. The trial judge declined to permit -- declined 

21 to permit her to offer psychiatric testimony to mitigate 

22 to second degree. 

23  The court of appeals reversed, indicating 

24 that evidence -- mental health evidence of the kind she 

wanted to offer was admissible to establish diminished

1 capacity, that is, to negate the element of 


2 premeditation and deliberation. 


3  Once that case was decided, there is one 


4 direction only in Michigan law from 1973 until 


Carpenter, by surprise, in 2001. Yes, the statute was 

6 passed in 1975, and just 3 years later, in 1978, 

7 Mangiapane decided that diminished capacity comes within 

8 the definition of legal insanity. 

9  The phrasing in the -- in the court's 

opinion is very significant and it's much more than 

11 opposing counsel suggests. The court stated explicitly, 

12 "we find that the" -- "the defense known as diminished 

13 capacity is codified within the definition of legal 

14 insanity." 

Once that happened, then that required an 

16 accused who wanted to raise a diminished capacity 

17 partial defense to comply with the procedural 

18 requirements of the new statute. From that point 

19 forward, it was clear that diminished capacity -- and --

and these are published court of appeals decisions, so 

21 they are binding precedent statewide in Michigan, unless 

22 or until reversed or modified by the State supreme 

23 court, the legislature, or a constitutional amendment. 

24  Once that happened, there is not a case, 

including in Carpenter itself, where the prosecution

1 objected to the admissibility of diminished capacity 

2 evidence. It was so well-established, it was beyond 

3 question. It was so well --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think the question that 

was asked was, at the bottom line, at the end of the 

6 day --

7  MR. MOGILL: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- did anybody get 

9 sentenced less? Did it affect the outcome? You gave a 

case where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished 

11 capacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense 

12 was successful on the merits? 

13  MR. MOGILL: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

14 that's a very important question. The -- the closest I 

can come -- the first part of my answer is, in the 

16 Griffin case, in 1989, in an order which was a 

17 dispositive order and, therefore, was precedent, the 

18 Michigan Supreme Court disposed of an application for 

19 leave to appeal by remand -- vacating and remanding a 

case for an ineffective assistance hearing because of 

21 defense counsel's failure, inter alia, to consider a 

22 diminished capacity defense. 

23  That order could not have occurred unless 

24 the supreme court had determined that diminished 

capacity was a valid defense. The second part --

4 arguable? 

MR. MOGILL: I -- I respectfully submit 


6 that, under Strickland analysis, no. If it -- if it's 


7 not an established defense, if it's not something that 


8 would, arguably, come within the Strickland framework, 


9 there would not have been a remand. That would have 


been a -- a question of a lawyer trying to be creative, 

11 but it wouldn't implicate Strickland principles. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm a little 

13 surprised at your answer, and Justice Scalia's question 

14 indicates the same. If the law was as well settled as 

you say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to 

16 me, certainly, counsel should raise it and is arguably 

17 deficient for not doing so. Whether or not he'll 

18 prevail at the end of the day is something quite 

19 different. 

MR. MOGILL: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

21 believe that the basis for a remand in a case like 

22 this -- and this is not an unusual kind of a situation 

23 in practice, is where the law is clear, then you -- then 

24 the remand is to determine the factual basis for the 

defendant's claim, were the facts such that a reasonably

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to be --


you have to be -- you have to be that right to prevail, 

11 right? 

12  MR. MOGILL: What I have to establish is 

13 that the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals here 

14 was objectively unreasonable. And, whether it's beyond 

question, I think we, certainly, have objectively 

16 unreasonable ruling for the reasons that it was 

17 without -- not only was it well-established -- and I 

18 want to weave into this the second part of what I'd like 

19 to answer of Justice Ginsburg's question. 

I think it's very important in understanding 

21 the question of reversals or not what the lay of the 

22 land was because, where you have a framework that allows 

23 a defense to be raised and prosecutors aren't objecting, 

24 the -- the application's going to be a factual matter 

for a jury to decide.

1  So it's not going to be something that's 

2 going to percolate up into appellate legal issues. It's 

3 going to be successful sometimes, it's not going to be 

4 successful sometimes, and there are no statistics on 

that. But it doesn't -- it won't present a legal issue, 

6 and that's in no small part why the question of, well, 

7 what about a reversal --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: In Griffin -- you describe 

9 Griffin in your brief as follows: "The court vacated, 

reversed, and remanded the decision below based on," 

11 quote, "defendant's claim that trial counsel was 

12 ineffective for failing to explore defenses of 

13 diminished capacity and insanity." 

14  MR. MOGILL: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: "And insanity." So it 

16 wasn't specifically -- wasn't limited to diminished 

17 capacity. 

18  MR. MOGILL: And that's why in my --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: It was insanity in general. 

MR. MOGILL: No, it was both. The -- the 

21 insanity defense is separate from diminished capacity, 

22 which is a partial defense. In fact, at Respondent's 

23 first trial, prior counsel had raised both. At retrial, 

24 I only wished to raise the diminished capacity defense. 

The law recognizes the difference between

1 the two in Michigan. Had diminished capacity not been a 

2 recognized defense, the court's order, I respectfully 

3 submit, would have been worded just with respect to 

4 insanity. There would have been no legal basis for 

arguing -- or, excuse me, for including the -- the 

6 reference to diminished capacity. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mogill, as -- as I 

8 understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to 

9 show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you 

say it was; but it has to have been --

11  MR. MOGILL: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what you say it was. 

13  MR. MOGILL: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: And it -- there was an 

avulsive change by the supreme court.

17 Justice Scalia, and I think that's what we have. We 

18 have, from --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's hard to 

believe that, given -- given the clear text of the 

21 statute. 

22  MR. MOGILL: The problem, I -- I 

23 respectfully submit, is that nobody in Michigan until 

24 Carpenter -- and -- and I -- it -- that sounds like an 

extreme statement, but, again, the record is clear.

4 instructions on areas of law that are agreed upon 

and -- and routinely enough raised in court to warrant a 

6 standard instruction. 

7  That committee is comprised of judges, 

8 prosecutors, and defense attorneys. In 1989, that 

9 committee promulgated a diminished capacity instruction. 

That's how well-established it is.

would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor. 

6  MR. MOGILL: No. What I -- but I --

7 Justice Scalia, the answer to your question is -- is 

8 encompassed by the statutory scheme which requires 

9 advanced notice. The -- a defendant can't offer 

diminished capacity evidence in the middle of trial. A 

11 defendant has to give 30 days or whatever other time set 

12 by the judge notice -- or it had to at the time. 

13  If the prosecutor, in any case, believed 

14 that such evidence wasn't admissible, the prosecutor had 

plenty of time, prior to trial, to seek an in limine 

16 ruling from the trial court, to seek an interlocutory 

17 appeal from the Michigan Court of Appeals. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: But he could get an -- an 

19 interlocutory appeal on that? 

MR. MOGILL: Absolutely.

6  So the fact that --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Alright. Alright. But 

8 can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue 

9 that's come even close to that being sufficient? What's 

your best? 

11  MR. MOGILL: I think the closest point --

12 and it's important, and it goes, Justice Scalia, to 

13 respond to your point about lower court -- reliance on 

14 lower court opinions, is in Lanier, when the question 

concerned what's the scope of the statute that's at 

16 issue here. 

17  And this Court very explicitly stated that 

18 its permissible for the world outside of court to look 

19 at lower court decisions, court of appeals decisions, in 

terms of what had been reasonably expressed. That's 

21 consistent --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you -- if you prevail 

23 here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme 

24 courts. State supreme courts, much like us, they wait 

until courts of appeals have issued their opinions.

1 They wait to see how the practical application of those 

2 works, insofar as of the fairness of the trial. They 

3 wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then 

4 they -- and then they take the case. 

If you prevail, State supreme courts 

6 are -- are going to say -- you know, if we don't take 

7 this case, even though it's -- does not present the 

8 issue as clearly as some late case might, we don't rush 

9 in, then we're going to be foreclosed. I think you're 

proposing a dynamic which makes the Federal courts 

11 intrude on the way in which State courts choose to 

12 develop their law. 

13  MR. MOGILL: Justice Kennedy, thank you for 

14 that question, but I respectfully disagree. The relief 

we are requesting here is simply that, while the 

16 Michigan Supreme Court was entirely free to interpret 

17 this statute any way it wanted to prospectively, so long 

18 as it didn't conflict with some other decision of this 

19 Court, the question is, what about applying it 

retroactively? 

21  And this Court in Bouie and Rogers has set 

22 out clear principles for when a court that wants to 

23 reverse ground can do that or not, consistent with 

24 fundamental fairness, principles of notice, 

foreseeability, et cetera, all of which go in our

1 direction here. An -- an interesting contrast, and I 

2 think a useful contrast --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the 

4 unfairness --

MR. MOGILL: I'm sorry? 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: What is the unfairness here? 

7 Do you think there's a reliance? 

8  MR. MOGILL: There's not a reliance, nor is 

9 that an element --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- so what is 

11 the unfairness here? 

12  MR. MOGILL: In both -- in both Bouie and 

13 Rogers, this Court made it clear that reliance is not an 

14 issue. The unfairness -- and that's a very important 

point, Justice Alito -- is that by eliminating the right 

16 to present this category of evidence, the mental health 

17 evidence that would show, if accepted by a jury, that 

18 the Respondent was guilty of second-degree murder, 

19 instead of first-degree murder, what the court was doing 

was expanding the -- the scope of premeditation and 

21 deliberation; they were aggravating the offense. That 

22 is a fundamental unfairness. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- the case 

24 is -- is very different from Bouie, which you -- which 

you rely on. In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a

1 rule that is governing conduct. People come on to 

2 premises; they have no reason to think that they are 

3 committing an offense if they don't leave when somebody 

4 asks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully. 

So what the Court said in Bouie was that 


6 this is a regulation of primary conduct, and, at the 


7 time these people acted, they had no reason to believe 


8 that what they did was unlawful. That's quite a 


9 different --


MR. MOGILL: Yeah, I agree with that, 

11 Justice Ginsburg, except that, at footnote 5 in Bouie, 

12 this Court explicitly rejected the notion that 

13 subjective reliance by the accused is -- is even an 

14 aspect of the test for determining --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it isn't subjective 

16 reliance; it's -- it's what was the law. 

17  MR. MOGILL: And --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Court said that 

19 the State supreme court interpretation of the statute 

was quite a surprise. 

21  MR. MOGILL: Yes. And what the Court did in 

22 both Bouie and in Rogers was look at the underlying 

23 State law. In Bouie, the Court looked at the history of 

24 South Carolina law regarding trespass and found that, 

until a year and a half later, it hadn't been construed

1 to apply to a failure to leave, as opposed to an entry. 

2  In Rogers, the Court surveyed the very -- a 

3 very sparse Tennessee authority on the year-and-a-day 

4 rule. That same analysis here will -- must lead to a 

conclusion that all of the law in Michigan -- and, 

6 again, there are minimal holdings, for the reasons 

7 Justice Sotomayor indicated -- the -- the minimal 

8 holdings, but all the mentions and the holding go in the 

9 direction of this existed. 

It was relied on, it wasn't contested --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I don't see how the 

12 question can be whether there was a change in Michigan 

13 law because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme 

14 Court about what Michigan law was. Michigan law is 

whatever the State supreme court says it was. We might 

16 agree, we might disagree. So I think we have to start 

17 from the proposition that the law didn't change because 

18 that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said. 

19  So there must be some other ex post facto 

principle that applies when there's a certain type of 

21 unfairness. And I wonder if you could articulate what 

22 that principle is. 

23  MR. MOGILL: I would be happy to, 

24 Justice Alito, but, first, I want to address your point 

about having to rely on Michigan Supreme Court's

1 determination of Michigan law because this Court has 


2 made it very clear that you can't let a State court 


3 relabel something in a way that avoids Federal 


4 constitutional review. 


Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke to that point 

6 in Collins v. Youngblood. Justice Kennedy, you spoke to 

7 that in your dissent in Clark. Justice Scalia, in your 

8 dissent in Rogers, you spoke to the point, I think, in 

9 an apt phrasing, that this Court will rely on a State 

court's reasonable determination of State law. I --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So two -- two 

12 dissents is what you're relying on? 

13  MR. MOGILL: I'm sorry? No. The 

14 majority -- the opinion of the Court in Collins, but 

it's also a well-established principle -- and I also 

16 wanted to note that the two other mentions, but it's not 

17 a principle that's been in dispute. 

18  The -- the Court's analysis in both Bouie 

19 and Rogers also supports what I'm saying because the 

Court independently looked at South Carolina law in 

21 Bouie. The Court independently looked at Tennessee law 

22 in Rogers and --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think you're -- what 

24 you're arguing is that, under certain -- in evaluating 

certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of

1 what State law is, is not dispositive. I don't think 

2 you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell 

3 a State court what State law is. 

4  MR. MOGILL: This Court certainly does not 

have a right to tell the Michigan Supreme Court, going 

6 forward, what State law is with respect to diminished 

7 capacity. But --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, suppose this 

9 were a diversity case. Can -- can a Federal court 

say -- you know, we -- we think that the -- the 

11 decisions of the intermediate State supreme court were 

12 correct and this new decision by the State supreme court 

13 is incorrect, so we're not going to follow that? 

14  MR. MOGILL: No, but this is not -- that's 

not this case. This case involves reliance --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: It's not -- it's not this 

17 case because, there, you're trying to figure out what 

18 State law is. Here you're applying a constitutional 

19 principle. 

MR. MOGILL: We're trying -- we're applying 

21 a constitutional principle --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: So what is that -- that gets 

23 me to the second part of my question. 

24  MR. MOGILL: Yes, exactly. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- the

1 constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what 

2 State law was? 

3  MR. MOGILL: The constitutional principle is 

4 that Respondent had a right to present a defense that 

existed at the time of his offense, unless it was 

6 clearly unforeseeable -- excuse me -- unless it was 

7 unforeseeable and -- and indefensible by reference to 

8 law that had been expressed prior to the time of the 

9 conduct, that that law might change, which we don't have 

here. 

11  And, Justice Breyer, I think that the 

12 phrasing also goes to respond to your question. 

13 The -- the formulation in -- in Rogers that confines 

14 looking to the law as of the time that the conduct 

occurred, and -- and, even if you go forward, there was 

16 nothing to suggest an alternate interpretation of the 

17 statute, a questioning opinion, nothing that would 

18 suggest that the law in Michigan was about to change. 

19  We also have the fact that, unlike the 

year-and-a-day rule, diminished capacity as -- as a 

21 doctrine is well-supported and increasingly supported by 

22 medical and mental health evidence. It's the -- the 

23 exact opposite of the year-and-a-day rule in that 

24 regard. It also furthers --

1 process issue, right? 

2  MR. MOGILL: It's -- that's exactly it --

3  JUSTICE ALITO: So why is it unfair? Why is 

4 there an entitlement under due process to assert what 

appears under the law of the State's intermediate court 

6 decisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined 

7 never to have been or not to have been, at that time, a 

8 valid defense? What is the unfairness involved there? 

9  MR. MOGILL: The unfairness is because it 

was sufficiently well-established -- it was thoroughly 

11 well-established as a matter of Michigan law, so 

12 Respondent and everybody else in Michigan had a right to 

13 rely on it. 

14  In fact, if this Court were to reverse the 

Sixth Circuit, Respondent would be the only person in 

16 Michigan charged with a crime prior to Carpenter who 

17 would not be allowed to present a diminished capacity 

18 defense at a fair trial. That's how extreme the 

19 violation was. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess the alternative is 

21 you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as 

22 they are, by writing instructions to determine issues 

23 that courts themselves have never determined -- or at 

24 least not authoritative supreme courts. And that's a 

worrying matter, where you are trying to create coherent

anything over to the Bar Association. That -- the fact 

6 of that instruction is I think strong evidence of the 

7 reasonableness of reliance of the bench and bar in

18 of agreement after 45 minutes of oral argument. 

19  Number one, Justice Breyer, is that there 

really is only one case in Michigan that reaches the 

21 holding that Mr. Carpenter would like that you can 

22 assert this defense, and that was the Lynch case in 

23 1973, which preceded the 1975 statute.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think he contested that. 

I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to 

6 disagree with the proposition that, where there is a 

7 Michigan statute, it can't be supplemented by the common 

8 law. 

9  MR. BURSCH: I did not hear him say that. 

And, if you go back and you read Reese and In re 

11 Lamphere, I don't know how anyone could possibly 

12 disagree with that. There are certainly areas --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I hate just to 

14 interrupt you. 

MR. BURSCH: Sure. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he did challenge 

17 my premise when I presented that to him. 

18  MR. BURSCH: Okay. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I do think he 

disagrees with it. 

21  MR. BURSCH: Okay. Well, then I disagree 

22 with that. If you look at In re Lamphere and Reese, 

23 it's well-settled in Michigan that when the Michigan

criminal law that the code controls and the common law

2  The words of the Michigan Supreme Court in 

3 Reese itself were, "The courts have no power to add an 

4 affirmative defense that the legislature did not 

create." 

6  And -- and I really don't think there can be 

7 a dispute about that. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this -- is this a one 

9 of a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear 

from 2001 on? Are -- are there any other people who 

11 were similarly situated, who committed a crime before 

12 2001, but were tried after? 

13  MR. BURSCH: I'm -- I'm not aware of any, 

14 Justice Ginsburg, and -- and the reason for that -- that 

quirk is because his habeas process, by coincidence, 

16 happened to take such a long time. It's pretty rare 

17 that we're up here on a case where the murder actually 

18 took place 20 years ago and the trial is shortly after 

19 that. 

But -- but quirks in how long litigation 

21 happens don't determine whether people get the benefit 

22 of changes in law or not. What matters is the standard 

23 that this Court applied in Rogers and Bouie, was the 

24 change -- if there was a change -- indefensible and not 

expected.

and -- and this defense is not available? 

6  Was it -- can you point to anything? 

7  MR. BURSCH: We can't point to anything, 

8 just like they can't point to anything. You've got a --

9 you know, in 1975 --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess they can point 

11 to just a lot of people who were raising this defense. 

12  MR. BURSCH: Right. And they can point to 

13 cases that assume, without deciding, that the defense 

14 might exist. And then it wasn't until 2001, when the 

Michigan Supreme Court became the first Michigan court 

16 to look at it -- and I forget now who mentioned this, I 

17 think it was Justice Kennedy -- that the Michigan 

18 Supreme Court did what this Court often does, it waited

3 because the Michigan Supreme Court thought -- you know, 

4 there's enough confusion, because of the mentions in the 

lower court, that it's time that -- that we address 

6 this. 

7  I don't know why the Michigan Supreme Court 

8 took it up in Carpenter. What I do know is that 

9 fair-minded jurists, which is the habeas standard, could 

agree that Carpenter was neither indefensible nor 

11 unexpected. And -- you know, it's not a head-counting 

12 business, but I would note that the Michigan Court of 

13 Appeals here was unanimous. 

14  Previously, the Michigan Court of Appeals in 

Talton, decided the year after Carpenter, reached the 

16 exact same conclusion with respect to the due process 

17 question. So we've got six Michigan appellate judges 

18 looking at this. 

19  You know, going back to -- to what the 

Michigan law said, I -- I also heard my friend mention 

21 the Griffin case, this is the three-paragraph order 

22 where they -- they remand for ineffective assistance. 

23 Well, Griffin is one of the cases that the Michigan 

24 Supreme Court discusses in Carpenter.

3 know, it just wasn't there. What you have are these 


4 mentions, and, then, as Justice Breyer mentioned, he's 


got jury instructions, which are promulgated by the 


6 State bar, not the State supreme court -- or by any 


7 court, for that matter. 


8  And what you have to ask yourself, is it 


9 objectively unreasonable, is it beyond any possibility 


of fair-minded disagreement that a Michigan Court of 

11 Appeals panel could conclude that Carpenter was both 

12 indefensible and unexpected. And --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have any idea -- a 

14 rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say, 

'75 and '93, where this defense was raised? 

16  MR. BURSCH: Well, all we have are the 

17 mentions in the appellate courts. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Do you know about how many? 

19 About. 

MR. BURSCH: About 37, I believe. It was 

21 four Michigan Supreme Court opinions and 33 Court of 

22 Appeals, so it was 37. 

23  Now, of those the Michigan Supreme Court 

24 itself said their four, decisions didn't say one way or 

the other. Of the other 33, 32 of them weren't even

2 we explained in our brief, the Michigan Court of Appeals 

3 wasn't bound to follow any panel decision prior to 

4 November 1st, 1990. So those weren't even binding on 

the court of appeals itself. 


6  If you are thinking about what's firmly 


7 established -- you know, there were no roots at all to 


8 these mentions. It would be like walking past your

there, you expect it to be there the next day. You 

11 know, but if there is a small weed, you expect it to be

14 the Michigan Supreme Court finally addressed the 

question. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you rely on Reese as 

17 establishing the principle that you cannot supplement 

18 the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012 

19 case. 

MR. BURSCH: Right. I mentioned Reese 

21 because it's the most recent application. It cites In

13 arguing that Lynch was wrong to begin with because what 

14 you are arguing is that it created a common law defense 

that the courts say you can't do under Michigan law. 

16  MR. BURSCH: Right, exactly. You've got 

17 Lynch, which was the common law --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, but you're 

19 saying to me it was wrongly decided under this general 

Michigan --

21  MR. BURSCH: Oh, no, no, no. 

22  To be perfectly clear, what In re Lamphere 

23 and Reese and everything else say is that, when the 

24 legislature has spoken to a particular area, then the 

courts cannot supplement. They had never spoken about

1 mental capacity defenses prior to 1975, and so the slate 

2 was free for the courts to do what they wanted. 

3  So there's nothing wrong with Lynch in '73. 

4 The problem is continuing to assume that there was a 

defense that wasn't in the '75 statute. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you were 

7 representing a defendant in this position, you certainly 

8 would have raised the diminished capacity defense prior 

9 to Carpenter, wouldn't you? 

MR. BURSCH: Undoubtedly. But I don't think 

11 it means that fair-minded jurists could not possibly 

12 conclude that Carpenter was both indefensible and not 

13 expected. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, if you were a 

prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense, 

16 would you have? 

17  MR. BURSCH: Well, I don't know. If I was a 

18 prosecutor, I would have looked at the plain language of 

19 the statute --

6 it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel, 

7 right? 

8  MR. BURSCH: That's exactly right, Justice. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: But what's in the 37 cases 

then? I -- they got up there. I assume the defendant 

11 must have brought them. They must have brought them. 

12 They must have wanted to -- to raise the defense, and 

13 somebody said no. 

14  MR. BURSCH: No, I don't believe that there 

was a single case in those 37 where someone tried to 

16 raise the defense and the court said no, nor was there a 

17 case where the prosecutor said, you can't raise the 

18 defense, and the court said yes. It was just a number 

19 of cases. And -- you know, Mangiapane is really the 

paradigm example. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

7 raise this or -- or 20 or 100? I mean, what kind of 

8 numbers? 

9  MR. BURSCH: You know, all we've got are the 

appellate decisions referencing it. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. 

12  MR. BURSCH: So if we've got 37 cases --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: You can't really tell 

14 because nobody was objecting to anything --

MR. BURSCH: Correct. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- right? 

17  MR. BURSCH: So you've got 37 cases over a 

18 course of 18 years, '75 to -- to '93. Now, that -- that 

19 tells us maybe two cases a year in a system that 

processes thousands of criminal cases. 

21  You know, there was nothing here that would 

22 make the Supreme Court's application of the plain 

23 language so indefensible, so unexpected, that no 

24 reasonable jurist could possibly have reached the same 

conclusion as now two unanimous Michigan Court of

1 Appeals panels have. 

2  I wanted to touch, briefly, on the 

3 unfairness point. And Justice Ginsburg, I -- I believe 

4 brought up Bouie, and Bouie is really the perfect 

analogy because, again, under the AEDPA standard, it's 

6 Lancaster's burden to show that the court of appeals 

7 decision here was contrary to our misapplication. And, 

8 to the contrary, it was the exact application of Bouie. 

9  In Bouie, you had a clear statute that was 

very narrow, and the State court expanded it in a very 

11 unexpected way. And this Court found that was 

12 indefensible and unexpected. 

13  The exact opposite happened here. You had 

14 the Michigan Supreme Court applying very narrow 

statutory language exactly the way it was written, in 

16 accord with 200 years of interpretive principles. 

17  So -- so, really, the problem here is not 

18 any unfairness. The problem is the Sixth Circuit, yet 

19 again, not applying habeas deference under the statute 

or this Court's precedent and disregarding another 

21 Michigan State court decision where reasonable jurists 

22 could have reached different conclusions on this. 

23  It's not our burden to -- to demonstrate 

24 what the law was or wasn't. All we have to show is that 

a reasonable jurist could have reached the conclusion

2 doesn't appear to be any question that's the case. 


3  JUSTICE SCALIA: You want us to say, "yet 


4 again," when we write our opinion? 


MR. BURSCH: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MR. BURSCH: If there are no further 

8 questions, thank you very much. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
