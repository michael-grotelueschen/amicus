 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-1646, United States v. Rodriguez.

 Mr. Shanmugam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the 

Federal Government's most important tools for 

incapacitating serial offenders who commit serious 

crimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the 

ACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its 

application based partly upon the maximum terms of 

imprisonment for those offenses. The question presented 

in this case is whether the relevant maximum term of 

imprisonment for an offender who was already a repeat 

offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were 

subject to that offense.

 Alone among the circuits, the Ninth Circuit 

held that the relevant maximum for a repeat offender is 

instead the maximum to which first-time offenders were 

subject, even though that purported maximum would 

sometimes be lower than the term that a repeated

offender would actually receive. Because the ACCA 

cannot support that counterintuitive and counterfactual 

approach, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be 

reversed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, what is the 

government's position as to a person who is not a repeat 

offender? He commits the crime for the first-time. Now 

the government says there are alternative maximums and 

you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher. Why 

wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits 

the crime the first-time?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That is because, Justice 

Scalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally 

accommodates the possibility that there may be 

alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given 

offense. The provision the ACCA at issue, Section 

924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines a serious drug offense as "a 

State drug trafficking offense for which a maximum term 

of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by 

law," and we believe that that language is susceptible 

to the interpretation that the maximum for a repeat 

offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were 

subject and the maximum for a first-time offender is the 

maximum to which first-time offenders were subject. And 

that is particularly true because Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're adding something to 

the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in 

this field we look to the elements of the crime.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, to be sure, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And as far as the elements 

are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements 

you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a 

repeat offender.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: To be sure, Justice Scalia, 

the ACCA speaks of the maximum term of imprisonment for 

the offense. But a higher sentence for repeat offenders 

is no less a maximum for the offense than the lower 

sentence for first-time offenders. This Court's cases 

involving challenges to recidivism statutes make that 

clear because they have uniformly held that a recidivism 

enhancement constitutes a stiffened penalty for an 

underlying offense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You seem to -- you 

seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your 

position in not looking at the maximum for a particular 

offender. For example, you know, under some guidelines, 

if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced 

beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a 

first-time offender, but you say you don't take that 

into consideration.

MR. SHANMUGAM: I don't that we're flinching 

from those consequences, Mr. Chief Justice. I think 

that it is simply a consequence of the fact that the 

statute does speak of the maximum term of imprisonment 

for the offense, not for the offender. And, while we 

believe --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

different from your position here, where it is the fact 

that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to 

look to a different maximum?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is because, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that we believe that the language of the 

statute can be susceptible to the interpretation that 

there can be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment 

for broad categories of offenders, such as recidivists 

and non-recidivists. But we don't think that it can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's the reason 

you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading, 

because it's not as broad a category?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it would lead to harsh 

results for first-time offenders and we certainly think 

that Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but only if 

they're subject -- only if they have some characteristic 

that had caused the State legislature to give the higher

maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other 

enhancement.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's correct. But 

with regard to the text of the statute, we simply 

believe that the text of the statute cannot be stretched 

to accommodate the possibility of individualized maximum 

terms of imprisonment for every offender based on the 

potentially infinite combinations of facts that may 

determine an offender's guidelines range. And I think 

it's important to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any statutes 

which talk about offender as opposed to "offense" in 

this area, do you know?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think probably the 

closest analog in the criminal code, Justice Kennedy, 

would be the statute that was at issue in RLC. I 

believe it's 18 U.S.C. 5037(c)(1)(b), which provided at 

the time that the court was construing it that the 

maximum -- that the sentence that a juvenile should 

receive should be no higher than the maximum that an 

adult offender should receive. And the court did 

construe that statute to refer to the maximum that an 

adult could receive under the guidelines.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there was also the 

statute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the

statute said the Sentencing Commission "shall assure 

that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a 

term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term 

authorized for categories of defendants who have certain 

types of prior convictions."

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that did focus on the 

-- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element 

of the crime.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It focused on categories of 

offenders and there Congress's concern was obviously 

with career offenders. But I think critically in the 

LaBonte opinion itself, written by Justice Thomas for 

the Court, the Court recognized the possibility that a 

statute could establish alternative maximum terms of 

imprisonment for recidivist and nonrecidivist offenders. 

The Court specifically discussed the Controlled 

Substances Act, which does exactly that. Now, to be 

sure the language of that statute was somewhat 

different, but in our view the critical lesson of 

LaBonte is simply that it is possible for a statute to 

establish alternative maximums and the statute at issue 

here no less than the statute at issue in LaBonte 

accommodates that possibility.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be easy, of

course, if recidivism were an element of the crime --

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it would be easier to 

accept that if a State --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a crime which 

includes the act plus the recidivism?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: If a State, Justice Scalia 

were to essentially define a new crime of drug 

trafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by 

definition the maximum sentence for that offense would 

be the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject. 

But to say one more thing in response to the Chief 

Justice's question about guidelines maximums, I do think 

that it is critical to remember that Congress enacted 

the ACCA in its present form in 1986, well before this 

Court's Apprendi jurisprudence took root, and at that 

time Congress surely would have conceived of the 

relevant maximum as the offense-specific statutory 

maximum, and we know that Congress viewed that maximum 

as a discrete creature from the relevant guidelines 

maximum because in passing the Sentencing Reform Act 2 

years earlier, the statute that gave rise to the Federal 

guidelines, Congress smoke specifically about statutory 

maximums as distinct from guidelines maximums. And 

certainly we believe --

JUSTICE ALITO: In light of Apprendi and the

later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to 

draw a distinction between, between statutes that make 

recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that 

originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing 

factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: One of the virtues of our 

approach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some 

sense the same whether a legislature defines drug 

trafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or 

whether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that 

gives rise to an alternative maximum term of 

imprisonment for the underlying offense of drug 

trafficking. And our fundamental submission with regard 

to the Court's Apprendi line of cases is simply that it 

alters nothing with regard to how the ACCA should be 

interpreted because, again, Congress was defining 

"offense" in 1986 in its colloquial sense as essentially 

what the legislature defines the offense to be. And to 

be sure, it is a prerequisite for a fact to be an 

offense element that it be submitted to the jury, but 

all this court did in Apprendi line of cases was 

effectively to state a procedural constitutional rule 

under which a sentencing factor that raises the 

applicable maximum sentence has to be submitted to the 

jury.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't 

understand what you said about Congress's intent with 

regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA. You're 

saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines, 

but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within 

which the guidelines were applicable?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's correct. In the 

Federal system, that would of course be the statutory 

maximum. In some State systems, of course, the 

guidelines are themselves statutory and for that reason 

we refer to them in our brief as offense-specific 

maximums. But the critical point with regard to the 

Sentencing Reform Act is that Congress did believe that 

there was such a thing as the maximum for the offense, 

and indeed in Section 994(r) of Title 28, one of the 

provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress 

actually asked the Sentencing Commission to come back 

with recommendations to alter those offense-specific 

maximums, which we believe is certainly evidence that 

Congress viewed that as something distinct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it matter what was 

the sentence actually imposed in the State court? That 

is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor 

chooses not to charge as a second offender and so, 

although it is in fact the second offense, he is

sentenced in the State court as a first offender. Would 

it count under your reading of the Federal statute that 

it was a second offense?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Our position, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that it would count because the relevant 

inquiry is whether the offender was potentially eligible 

for an enhanced maximum sentence as a repeat offender as 

a substantive matter.  That having been said, we 

certainly believe that in the mine run of cases a court 

applying the ACCA will merely need to resort to the 

judgments of conviction or other judicial records in 

order to determine the maximum to which the defendant 

was actually subject. And this case of course presents 

a perfect example of that because the judgments for each 

of Respondent's prior convictions made clear that he was 

in fact subject to a 10-year maximum sentence as a 

repeat offender.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I take it -- supposing 

there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the 

defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or 

not. Is the fact that there was just an argument that 

he would be a recidivist enough or does the record have 

to establish that he was a recidivist?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if there were such a 

dispute, certainly we believe, first of all, that ACCA

courts would be perfectly competent to resolve those 

disputes. They are no different in kind from the sorts 

of legal and factual issues --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Shouldn't the mere 

existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least 

he's potentially subject to being treated as a 

recidivist.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, our view, Justice 

Stevens, is that once the government comes forward, for 

example, with a judgment of conviction that indicates 

that the defendant was subject to a 10-year maximum, it 

would then be incumbent on the defendant to come forward 

with evidence suggesting that that was erroneous to the 

extent that a defendant would be permitted to 

collaterally challenge that prior sentence at all. But 

we do believe that courts can resolve those disputes.

 Now, if the Court were to disagree and to 

conclude that, for comparable reasons to the reasons 

that the Court articulated in Shepard, it would be 

difficult for courts to resolve those determinations, 

then I suppose that we could live with a rule that said 

that the government is limited to judicial records like 

a judgment of conviction. But Taylor and Shepard of 

course were dealing with a quite different concern, the 

concern of how to define the prior offense, and I would

submit that the factual disputes that the Court was 

concerned about in Shepard are quite different from 

disputes about the applicability of a recidivism 

enhancement. Those were disputes about the actual 

underlying facts of the underlying substantive offense 

itself. And the Court suggested in the plurality 

portion of Justice Souter's opinion that resolving those 

sorts of factual disputes might raise constitutional 

concerns.

 But we certainly believe that by virtue of 

the rule of Almendarez-Torres, at a minimum the 

resolution of factual disputes ancillary to the fact of 

a prior conviction fall within the scope of the 

Almendarez-Torres rule and present no constitutional 

difficulties.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, I take it 

that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would 

basically be your response to the argument that the 

other side makes, that on your theory a State 

misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as --

or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the 

recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. That issue would 

arise, of course, only under the definition of "violent 

felony," which sets a one-year trigger rather than the

ten-year trigger that is contained in the definition of 

"serious drug offense."

 I think that the only point that I would 

note is that, with regard to an offense that remains a 

misdemeanor, even when it is committed by a repeat 

offender, there is a distinct statutory provision which 

we cite in our reply brief, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), which 

tinkers with the definition of what constitutes a 

qualifying offense for purposes of the definition of 

"violent felony." It says that if it's a misdemeanor, 

the sentence, the applicable sentence, actually has to 

be two years or more. But where a State actually says 

that when you commit an offense and it becomes a felony 

when you are a recidivist, then certainly we think that 

there is no problem with treating such an offense as an 

ACCA predicate for purposes of the triggering maximum 

term of imprisonment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they continue to use 

just the State terminology such that they continue to 

use the word "misdemeanor" with respect to an offense, 

which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year 

penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year 

threshold provision, kicks in?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's absolutely correct, 

Justice Souter, and I believe that that was actually the

fact pattern that was presented in the ACCA case that 

this Court heard earlier this term, Logan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: And in a footnote in its 

opinion, the Court noted this very peculiarity of how 

ACCA operates and how you need to have a two-year 

maximum rather than a one-year maximum if the State 

still treats the offense as a misdemeanor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do all States treat first 

convictions from other States -- do they all count for 

recidivism qualification if the prior offense was 

committed and the conviction was in another State?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: States do have somewhat 

different rules, Justice Ginsburg, as Respondent 

correctly points out, though I would note that many of 

the sort of factual and legal issues that would arise 

under those different rules arise outside the 

drug-trafficking context. Most States' drug-trafficking 

recidivism provisions, as least those States that have 

adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act provision, 

operate in a quite straightforward manner because they 

essentially sweep in all prior drug offenses.

 That having been said, we are unaware of any 

ACCA cases that have presented those sorts of 

difficulties. And typically what one would find, if one

looked at Respondent's cases, is that most States by now 

have fairly clearly defined rules for determining when 

an out-of-State conviction qualifies. And so at most, 

if it were unclear from the judgment of the prior 

conviction whether the prior sentencing court had 

determined whether the defendant was subject to the 

enhanced maximum as a recidivist, it would be a 

relatively easy task for a Federal ACCA court to apply 

those largely settled rules in order to make that 

determination.

 I do want to say one more thing about the 

text of the ACCA more generally, and that is that if the 

Court, as Justice Scalia had suggested at the outset, 

were to conclude that the statute is susceptible to the 

interpretation that there can be only a single maximum 

term of imprisonment for a given offense, we believe 

that it would not necessarily follow that Respondent's 

interpretation is correct, and indeed that the more 

natural consequence of that interpretation would be that 

the relevant maximum is the maximum that any offender 

could receive, rather than the maximum that a first-time 

offender could receive, and that is because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Surely not, 

Mr. Shanmugam. You were talking about broad categories 

earlier. It seemed that the broad category in the

situation you posit would be the normal offender rather 

than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look 

at.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that might be true as 

a numerical matter, though, you know, I suspect that 

there are probably more recidivist offenders than one 

might think. But I think that the fundamental 

difficulty with Respondent's interpretation is the 

anomaly that I identified at the outset, namely that 

even an offender who actually received a term of 

imprisonment of 10 years could be said to have a maximum 

of 5 years. And while it is true that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 

you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one 

maximum. You were accepting that requirement. It seems 

to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to 

pick the maximum for the particular offense without 

considering additional enhancements.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, with respect, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree. I would submit 

that if the Court has to choose a single maximum it has 

to be the maximum that the worst offender could receive. 

As a matter of common sense, when one thinks about the 

maximum --

that approach when we're talking about enhancements 

under State guidelines. You know, if the normal 

sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an 

extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you 

don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct, and that's 

because of the statute's reference to the offense and 

not the offender. But my submission is simply that if 

the Court thinks that the statute is susceptible to the 

interpretation that there has to be one maximum and 

indeed if the Court thinks that that interpretation is 

compelled, then we would submit that all offenders who 

commit an offense for which some offenders could receive 

a 10-year sentence would be subject to the ACCA. But we 

of course primarily submit that the statute is not only 

susceptible to the interpretation that we advance here, 

but that it is the better interpretation, namely that a 

statute can have alternative maximums. And we certainly 

believe that that interpretation is consistent with the 

long history and widespread practice of imposing 

enhanced penalties on repeat offenders, a practice that 

Congress surely was aware of when it enacted this 

statute dealing with the problem of recidivism.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, would you 

explain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement

in a State guideline system differently?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that if you 

get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing 

as if you get an enhancement because you're a 

recidivist. What's the difference?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The difference, Justice 

Scalia, is that the statute does speak of maximum terms 

of imprisonment for the offense and not the offender, 

and, while we certainly believe that the language of the 

statute with its reference to "a maximum term of 

imprisonment" can naturally accommodate the possibility 

of alternative maximums for broad tiers of offenders 

such as recidivists and nonrecidivists, we really don't 

believe that it can accommodate the possibility of 

individualized maximums for every offender.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think 

"ringleader" is a broad tier.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in a sentencing 

guidelines system where being a ringleader may be the 

basis for an enhancement, as it is in the Federal 

system, the fact remains that an enhancement under a 

guidelines system is merely one of many factors that 

ultimately determine the offender's guideline sentence. 

A guideline sentence is, of course, an individualized

determination made after a court evaluates a panoply of 

offender- and offense-specific factors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How would you treat an 

enhancement --

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we believe that such 

an enhancement could be subject to our alternative 

maximums approach as well, to the extent that the 

standard was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's not just 

recidivist and non-recidivist. It's some enhancements, 

but not all enhancements?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if a statute is as a 

formal matter structured in such a way as to create 

broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders, 

then certainly that would seem to be an alternative 

maximum term of imprisonment. The guideline systems, of 

course, are not structured in that way.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're depending upon the 

guidelines.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. Well, that's 

correct, and so in Apprendi, of course, I think it was 

the fact that the defendant had acted with a biased 

purpose, and that form of structuring of statutes was 

not unheard of prior to this Court's decision in 

Apprendi. And essentially what New Jersey did, as I

recall, in Apprendi was to say that if you unlawfully 

possess a firearm your maximum is 10 years.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand, but my 

point is I don't think your proposal just has two 

categories. There -- it seems there could be multiple 

kinds of enhancements that would fit your general 

description.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: And the relevant question, 

Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not just recidivist 

versus nonrecidivist.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: This case does not present 

that issue; and, in light of the history and practice of 

imposing heightened penalties on recidivists, an 

essentially universal practice as far as we're aware in 

the drug-trafficking context, we certainly don't believe 

that the Court has to address that issue.

 And, in any event, after this Court's 

decision in Apprendi, it is certainly true that States 

have made modifications to the structure of their 

offenses and their sentencing systems such that, with 

regard to factors other than recidivism, it may very 

well be that as a prospective matter that issue would 

not arise very frequently. And --

simply said, we're going to let the jury decide. We're 

going to let the jury make these determinations that 

Apprendi says have to be made by the jury. But they're 

still -- they're still referred to as sentencing 

factors.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia. And, with regard to a State that does that as 

Washington, indeed, has done in the wake of this Court's 

decision in Blakely, we believe that the relevant 

offense and the relevant maximum term of imprisonment 

actually remains the same.

 And that is simply because where all a State 

does is to say that sentencing factors must be submitted 

to the jury in order to comply with the constitutional 

rule of Apprendi and Blakely, the fact remains that the 

State has not redefined the offense. In our view, a 

sentencing factor can remain a sentencing factor even if 

it is the functional equivalent of an offense element 

for Apprendi purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me your 

argument might be slightly better if the statutory term 

was "authorized," not "prescribed." I don't say 

"prescribed" could never be used in the sense you mean, 

but when you have alternates we usually would use the 

word -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the

word "authorize" rather than "prescribe." "Prescribe" 

indicates one rule.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I suppose that may be true, 

Justice Kennedy, though again the statute spoke about 

the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, which 

I think presupposes, at least to some extent, that the 

maximum may be higher than the maximum to which a 

particular offender is subject.

 I think the only thing I would say with 

regard to the reference to "prescribed by law" in the 

ACCA is that one could naturally understand that phrase 

being used by a Congress that was acting in 1986 as 

referring to the prescribed statutory maximum.

 And, notably, the Ninth Circuit in a case 

that we cite in our opening brief, United States v. 

Parry, construed that phrase in exactly that manner in 

actually holding that, notwithstanding its rule in this 

case, the applicable maximum for a defendant sentenced 

under a mandatory guidelines system cannot be the 

applicable guidelines maximum; It has to be the maximum 

for the offense. We believe that the Ninth Circuit 

erred only insofar as it thought that that maximum is 

the maximum to which first-time offenders were subject, 

even for a repeat offender.

balance of my time.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one question 

before you sit down? You mentioned a moment ago what 

you saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the 

anomaly being that someone with the recidivism 

enhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when 

the maximum for the offense is five years. But isn't --

isn't the answer to that just as -- as the answer that 

you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is 

simply that the statute speaks in terms of "offense" so 

that there is -- there is no anomaly in getting a 

ten-year sentence for something which for this purpose 

carries a maximum of five?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Souter, an enhanced 

penalty for repeat offenders is every bit as much a 

penalty for the offense as the lower penalty for 

first-time offenders.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the question 

in the case.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that is a question 

that this Court has answered in a variety of different 

contexts dating back almost a hundred years to Graham v. 

West Virginia. And we would submit that that principle 

is certainly equally applicable here, and a penalty for 

a recidivist, while in some sense holding a recidivist

more responsible by virtue of his or her recidivist

And under our alternative maximums approach that can be

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 There are a number of serious problems with 

the government's theory in this case, and I'll start 

with this one. It is inconsistent with the statutory 

language of ACCA, as is suggested by the R.L.C. and 

LaBonte decisions that have been discussed already; and 

it cannot be reconciled with the fundamental purpose of 

ACCA, which is reflected in that statutory language.

 Congress enacted ACCA to target particular 

categories of serious offenses. Whether the defendant 

is a repeat offender says nothing at all about the 

seriousness of the offense that he committed and 

therefore tells us nothing about whether that offense 

should be treated as an ACCA --

statutes: Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five 

years; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum 

-- convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years. And 

a defendant is convicted under the latter provision. 

What would be the maximum penalty for ACCA purposes?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if that latter 

provision includes as an element of the offense that 

recidivism, that could be a different situation than we 

have here, because the statutory language of ACCA, as 

Mr. Shanmugam said, focuses on "offense." Congress said 

that an ACCA predicate in the drug context is an offense 

for which a maximum penalty of ten years or more is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could be or it 

would be?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that's a difficult 

question, Your Honor, which is not the question here. I 

suppose I would say the language would suggest that it 

would be; that if it is an element to the offense the 

defendant has been convicted of an offense that includes 

recidivism as an element, that statutory language would 

lead us in that direction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the maximum penalty 

there would be ten years, then what if in this case the 

recidivist element had been submitted to a jury and 

found by a jury. Would it matter?

MR. ROTHFELD: I would suggest, again, it 

depends upon what the element defined by the State 

legislature is in creating the offense, because that 

follows from the ACCA term of the offense, the 

punishment prescribed by law for the offense. That is, 

of course, not the question here. And it's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why should the label matter? 

Maybe as to statutes that were passed before Apprendi 

and Booker, that at that time it made a difference. 

But, going forward, what difference does it make whether 

it's labelled as an element of the offense or a 

sentencing enhancement that's proven to a jury?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think in the 

post-Blakely context one could say something that has to 

be proven to a jury is in fact an element of the 

offense. The offence may essentially be defined in 

terms of the sentencing guidelines elements at that 

point.

 But I think in figuring what Congress had in 

mind when it used the term defining "ACCA serious drug 

offense" as "an offense for which a maximum penalty of 

ten years is prescribed by law, we have to figure out 

what is the offense and what is the penalty prescribed 

by law for that.

 MR. ROTHFELD: But the reason for that, Your

chose. It is certainly correct that, generally 

speaking, it is thought that repeat offenders should be 

subject to a higher punishment, and that there is a --

serious offense. I mean, the ACCA statutory language 

uses the term "serious drug offense." That's part of 

the definition That's used in the statutory text.

 Congress had in mind punishing through the 

ACCA process offenses that have a certain level of 

seriousness. And when Congress did that it was 

reflecting on what people actually did. That's the 

whole context of this Court's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a more serious 

offense when she does it the second time; it's just a 

more culpable offender.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is precisely right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't what I tell my 

child. I say you behaved worse.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I can't disagree with 

that, Your Honor. But this is -- this is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, does the word 

"offense" -- I haven't come across it, but does the word 

"offense" have some kind of special technical meaning 

that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into 

play all kinds of circumstances?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think the Court has 

-- has repeatedly recognized the distinction suggested 

by Justice Scalia's latest question, which is that there 

is a difference between the offense and the offender.

As Mr. Shanmugam said -- and we agree 

completely -- ACCA is an offense-specific provision. It 

does not focus on the offender. The government would 

like to read ACCA as though it made a distinction based 

upon different categories of defendants. And it's 

interesting that the way in which the question is 

presented in their brief and in their question presented 

in the petition for certiorari is not in terms of the 

ACCA statutory language. It does not ask: What is the 

penalty prescribed by law for this offense? It asks: 

Could repeat offenders be subjected to an enhanced 

penalty of ten years?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it pertinent, 

Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum 

term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're 

dealing with a statute that itself is directed to 

recidivism. You're asking -- you've got three previous 

convictions and then you get a particularly harsh 

sentence. If recidivism is what you're trying to 

address, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum 

term is that it would be natural to assume that they 

would take recidivism into consideration in that context 

as well.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think not, Your 

Honor, because ACCA is a particular kind of recidivism

statute. There are recidivism statutes common in the 

States now, with the three strikes regime becoming 

ubiquitous, in which all that matters is basically the 

number of offenses that were committed. The States 

expressly disavow the seriousness of the offenses that 

constitute the predicates in those kind of regime.

 ACCA is different kind of statute. ACCA was 

motivated because Congress was concerned that there was 

a small cohort of offenders who are engaging repeatedly 

in serious offenses, and Congress had in mind that 

people who engaged repeatedly in these especially 

threatening, dangerous, harmful offenses, very 

destructive to society, they should be segregated for 15 

years through the ACCA mandatory minimum.

 But Congress was quite clear, and the 

statutory language reflects this expressly, that the 

predictates have to themselves be serious offenses. 

Congress was concerned with what people did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it just 

seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what 

they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism, 

they would think that that's a problem that should be 

taken into account in determining what maximum sentences 

you're subject to under State law.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, they could have done

that. They could -- and that would have been the 

statute the government is discussing, one which ties 

recidivism into the particular category of the offender 

and the penalties to which they are subject.

 But Congress did not do that. Congress 

focused specifically on the seriousness of each of the 

individual predicate offenses. And it had in mind what 

people actually did, whether the kinds of offenses they 

were committing were serious destructive types of 

offenses.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it did use the 

language "a maximum term," not "the maximum term," which 

would support the government's view that the statute 

contemplates more than one maximum.

 MR. ROTHFELD: With respect, Your Honor, I 

would suggest that's one of the government's odder 

arguments. I think that reading any significance to the 

use of "the" rather than "the" in this context is quite 

peculiar. I would think if a judge, for example, is 

pronouncing sentencing he or she is likely to say "I 

sentence you to a term of 10 years," not "I sentence you 

to the term of 10 years."

 Certainly the use of "I sentence you to a 

term of 10 years" doesn't suggest some contemplation of 

multiple alternative regimes of punishment. So I think

the government, I give them kudos for creativity there, 

but I think it's very difficult to read any conscious 

choice by Congress in the use of the different article.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

defendant's own understanding? In connection with one 

of these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court, 

the crime with which I am charged carries a maximum 

sentence of 10 years.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that there are two 

things to say about that, Your Honor. First of all, I 

question how seriously anyone took that statement in the 

sentencing declaration, because what really mattered in 

Washington State was the binding determinant sentencing 

guideline, which set a maximum term of 57 months, which 

everyone agrees was the highest penalty this defendant 

could receive. In fact, it's quite clear that, absent 

aggravating circumstances, which are not present in this 

case, no one convicted of this defendant's crime could 

receive a punishment, recidivist or not, of 10 years, 

enough to trigger the ACCA predicate.

 So, I question again whether or not anyone 

took that terribly seriously. But I think even if one 

did, it doesn't answer the question here. There is no 

question that there was a recidivism provision which, at

least in some theoretical sense, made the maximum 

penalty 10 years. There is also a statutory provision 

which defined the crime. And in that -- in that 

statutory provision the Washington legislature 

specifically associated with conviction of that offense 

a five-year maximum penalty.  And I think it sort of --

it sort of begs the question to say, as the government 

does, well, the fact that there is some possibility out 

there of an enhancement that increases the penalty above 

10 years, even if that were true, which is not, again 

because of the sentencing guidelines in this case, that 

sort of begs the question of what is the relevant 

offense? Is the relevant offense what you might call 

the generic categorical offense of distribution of 

Schedule 3, 4, or 5 drugs, the sentence to which anyone 

convicted of that crime, anyone who engaged in the 

elements of that offense and is found guilty in 

Washington State could have been sentenced to, and that 

is 5 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The government is correct, 

though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being 

punished for the crime, not for his recidivism. So 

you -- you can say that the punishment for that defined 

crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed 

the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished

for is the same crime.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is no doubt about 

that. The defendant here committed this offense and he 

is being punished for it, for that offense. But again, 

I think that begs the question here:  When Congress uses 

the term "the punishment prescribed by law for the 

offense," what did it have in mind? Did it mean sort of 

the generic sense of the offense in the sense of the 

offense that anyone commits who is guilty or who commits 

the elements of the offense, which is someone who is not 

a recidivist. It's entirely -- recidivism is unrelated 

to that because recidivism is not an element of this 

offense.

 So yes, the defendant here committed the 

offense. He's being punished for having committed this 

offense. But that doesn't answer the question of what 

Congress had in mind.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part I'm not 

getting. I mean, that's why it doesn't help your 

client. In general, if you did read the word "offense" 

as applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say, 

then you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of 

10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is 

the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling 

drugs? And the answer would be 10 years. Now, how do

you get out of that?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying because --

because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year 

sentence than get the five-year sentence?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, no, absolutely not, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the 

distinguishing -- how do you get out of it? I know 

you're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I look at it from the 

perspective that I think Congress looked at it when it 

wrote the statutory language here. Congress had in 

mind -- as I said to Chief Justice Roberts, Congress had 

in mind people who engage in serious offenses. Congress 

had in mind what people actually did. It was not 

passing a generic -- I think it's quite clear from the 

statutory language, it was not passing a generic three 

strikes statute. It was focusing on the seriousness of 

what people did and what people actually did, what they 

were actually convicted of doing.

 And I think for that purpose, again the sort 

of what you might call the generic or categorical 

offense, the offense unrelated to recidivism 

enhancements, is what's relevant because that is what

the person actually did. And once you bring recidivism 

into the picture, once when the three strikes brings 

recidivism into the picture, every drug distribution, 

every drug distribution offense, will become a serious 

offense within the meaning of that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what you're saying 

is that if it's a victimless crime, that the second 

offense is no more injurious to the State than the first 

was. I'm not sure that's the case. The fact that the 

State sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its 

community means that they have to spend extra resources 

to prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a 

network of distributors, et cetera. They are more 

experienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there is no question 

that recidivism is regarded as -- as, you know, a bad 

thing for a variety of reasons. And that is why 

recidivism enhancements have been -- are so common. And 

no one, no one disputes that.

 The question is when Congress wrote this 

statutory language and wrote this particular kind of 

recidivism offense in ACCA, it was focusing on what the 

defendants actually did. The recidivism enhancement is 

entirely unrelated to that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know it was

focusing on the particular problem of recidivism. 

That's what the overarching Federal statute is directed 

to.

 MR. ROTHFELD: But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I think, 

following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you 

would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists 

presented particular problems that were different from 

the one particular offense.

 MR. ROTHFELD: It is that recidivism 

statute, but it is -- again it's a particular kind of 

recidivism statute different in character from the 

three-strikes kind of statute, different in character 

from the -- the drug recidivism statute in Washington 

State, which is -- which is to be a player. Those 

statutes do not care whether the predicate acts that --

that trigger their application were serious offenses or 

not. They simply ask is this -- is this defendant 

someone who has been convicted of offenses in the past.

 ACCA is not like that. ACCA specifically 

targets serious predicate offenses. The -- the 

statutory text defines two categories of predicate 

offenses: violent felonies, which -- which are a set of 

especially dangerous, threatening offenses; and serious 

drug offenses, using the term "serious in the text. It

is clear from that Congress had in mind people who were 

engaged in acts that are themselves harmful, 

destructive, serious acts. Under the government's 

application of a recidivism approach, virtually anything 

that someone is convicted of having to do with drug 

distribution -- handing a single marijuana cigarette to 

a friend -- that is a drug distribution offense.  In 

most States that is punishable by two years, five years 

maximum. Under the government's approach that is now, 

because it could through the recidivism policy lead to a 

10-year --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the flip 

side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of 

marijuana. It's the same offense as somebody who's done 

it and been convicted of it three different times. I 

mean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the 

argument.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if the crime in 

which the individual engaged, selling a ton of 

marijuana, is going to be punished by ten years, in 

virtually every jurisdiction -- I would suggest in every 

jurisdiction -- therefore it's going to be a serious 

drug offense within the meaning of ACCA and it's going 

to trigger ACCA as a predicate.

doesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed 

the same crime three times. He might have done two very 

different things under the California three-strike law. 

Sometimes very minor crimes push the person over to 

qualify as a recidivist.

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, that's absolutely --

absolutely correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Rothfeld, apropos of 

your answers to Justice -- first to Justice Scalia and 

Justice Breyer -- you said that when the -- when the 

recidivist is being sentenced he is being sentenced for 

the offense of the -- of the drug crime. Isn't it 

equally fair or wouldn't it be equally fair to say that 

he is being sentenced for two things? He is being 

sentenced for the drug crime which is the necessary 

condition of the sentence; and he is also being 

sentenced for the fact that he is repeating that crime. 

Isn't -- isn't it fair to -- to sort of distinguish 

between the two, in effect the two factors in the 

offense?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- each one of which is 

necessary for the -- for the ultimate sentence itself?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that 

that's right and it is reflective of something that --

discussing earlier with Justice Breyer. The offense 

itself is not regarded as a more serious offense when 

it's committed by a recidivist. It's because the 

recidivist's character as a repeat offender is what 

triggers the higher penalty; and in the ACCA context 

where Congress was focusing on whether or not this 

person was engaging in particular kinds of crimes, 

particular kinds of serious crimes, that makes all the 

difference.

 I -- I return to cases that some members of 

the Court were discussing with Mr. Shanmugam, the 

LaBonte case. The Government would like to focus on the 

status of this defendant as a repeat offender. That's 

what triggers in their view the application of ACCA; 

because he is a repeat offender he is in a class of 

defendants who are subject to higher punishment, 

therefore 10-year ACCA trigger.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure the 

offense is the same. I think the injury to the State is 

compounded by the repetition.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It affects the tone of the 

community, the number of law enforcement officers we 

have to have, the cost of reincarceration, 

rehabilitation, etcetera.

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- again, I 

don't disagree with any of that, as to the consequence 

of a repeat offense. My question is whether Congress, 

when it used the term serious offense, whether it 

thought the offense itself was more serious, as distinct 

from punishment that might -- that might be imposed upon 

the offender.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what I'm 

addressing. It could be more serious when it's the 

second time.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The offense in and of 

itself.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think it's -- it's 

instructive to look at the statute in the LaBonte case 

which was -- which discussed during Mr. Shanmugam's 

argument, in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then for double jeopardy 

purposes you must look at the second offense as the 

offense, not the offender. I mean, the prior conduct is 

-- is not being punished as a matter of constitutional 

law.

 MR. ROTHFELD: No. I -- I think that it's 

quite clear in the cases that are -- and we agree by 

cases cited by the Government for this proposition --

that when you are sentenced as a recidivist to a higher 

penalty you are being punished for the most recent 

offense that you were -- that you were --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you were 

representing a -- a defendant who has two prior 

convictions for something that has a sentence of 8 

years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence 

of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing 

he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing? 

Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him 

it's 15 years?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I would say that 

because you are a recidivist the maximum you are facing 

is 15 years. But I would not say that the offense that 

you committed is a more serious offense because you are 

a repeat offender. And and the LaBonte statute I think 

illustrates this very nicely. In the -- in the statute 

the Court construed in LaBonte it referred to the 

maximum term of imprisonment for specified categories of 

defendants; and the Court found that language was 

crucial because it showed that Congress contemplated 

that there would be different terms of imprisonment for 

defendants falling into different categories for the 

same offense.

we get into conference and we are having exactly the 

same discussion that's been going on for 40 minutes 

there. There is one way to read it; there is another 

way to read it; there are various reasons to read it one 

way, various ways to read it the other way. What do we 

do?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I would suggest 

that this Court need go no further at that point, 

because the rule of lenity would dictate ruling for us. 

Absolutely. It's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't have to win 

this argument?

 MR. ROTHFELD: We do not. I think one way 

to consider the case is that there in fact are three 

statutes which bear on the question of penalty. There 

is the statute that created the crime of conviction, 

which created the -- the offense of a distribution of a 

schedule of 3, 4, or 5 drugs, and in that statute 

specifically associated with the offense is the 5-year 

penalty. There is the 10-year, potential 10-year 

penalty which is focused -- focus of the Government's 

case. There is the Washington State sentencing 

guidelines, which were binding, determinate guidelines, 

every bit as much part of Washington statutory law as 

the recidivism statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the 

Government of course responds to your rule of lenity 

argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we 

are talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather 

than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction 

in the first place.

 MR. ROTHFELD: They do say that, Your Honor, 

and I think that's simply not so. I mean, the Court has 

said repeatedly and has applied repeatedly the doctrine 

that the rule of lenity applies when the only question 

is the length of the sentence; and indeed the R.L.C. 

case which the Government has been discussing was a case 

which involved only a question of length of the sentence 

and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But someone who is, 

you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject 

to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the 

rule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as 

somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a 

crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think the Court has said 

consistently that one of the elements supporting the 

rule of lenity is the idea that somebody's liberty is 

going to be taken away, that Congress should have 

spoken, to some degree --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know -- we 

know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in 

a case like this; it's just a question of for how long.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, but -- but it's a 

profound difference. I mean, a the conviction of a 

felony possession of a gun, the variations in penalty 

can be zero. Absent ACCA, you could be sentenced to 

probation, maximum of 10 years, as opposed to the 

mandatory minimum 15-year sentence under ACCA. That's a 

profound deprivation of liberty based upon how -- what 

reading you give to these words. So -- and again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think we have applied the 

rule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely. Again we cite a 

number of cases in our briefs, the Bifulco case -- but 

the R.L.C. case, which both parties have discussed at 

some length, is a prime element in which --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is -- it is a 

fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that 

you would say in a particular case that the maximum to 

which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that 

person is in fact sentenced to 15 years. It's just the 

-- the words don't fit together under that argument.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I am not 

embarrassed by that, Your Honor. Perhaps I, I'm too

resistant to embarrassment. But I --

(Laughter.)

 MR. ROTHFELD: -- I think it's -- it's 

entirely a question of how you take the congressional 

meaning of the term punishment prescribed for the 

offense.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your 

position was that the -- the defendant is not, this 

defendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but 

gets 10. I thought your position was that the offense 

within the meaning of the statute should be an offense 

which carries a maximum of 5 years, but that this 

defendant is in fact subject to a maximum of 10.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you can --

throughout your argument you make, I think properly, the 

offense/offender distinction, and isn't that the answer 

to the conundrum?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is exactly 

right. We think that what Congress had in mind when it 

referred to the punishment prescribed by law for the 

offense it was referring to the offense, the offense of 

conviction; and it never --

JUSTICE ALITO: The offense never -- the 

offense also disregards offender characteristics, or

only those offender characteristics that are not 

elements of the offense?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well again, that's -- that's 

where we started, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm still not sure what the 

line is there.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think if it is an 

element of the offense then you would be convicted of an 

offense which carried in its weight recidivism, and so I 

would say yes, in that circumstance that would be a 

different situation than what we have here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It all depends whether it's 

labelled an element of the offense by the State 

legislature?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that whether it 

actually is an element of the offence -- I mean, in this 

case there is no question; everyone agrees it's not in 

the offense; the Government concedes that it's not an 

element to the offense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's bank robbery --

bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines. If 

you have a gun, eight years. If you brandish it, four 

more years. If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to 

$50, two years, eight years, six years. The statute, by 

the way, says a max of 20 years. Now, what's the --

what's -- does this fall within it? Doesn't it? Does 

it depend on whether he brandished it? What does it 

depend on, in your view?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I'm glad you bring up 

the guidelines, Your Honor, because I think that that is 

an element that we haven't discussed at some length. 

The government's test is what is the penalty that the 

defendant actually faced. I mean that's their --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or what he actually faced 

-- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of 

the guidelines, if they were mandatory. But what 

they're saying here is it's right in the statute. You 

just look at the statute that has the definition of what 

the offense is.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Aha, but it's not the 

definition of the offense. This statute -- the 

definition of the offense is --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm back to the same 

question then. I mean which one do we pick?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I guess there are two 

points here -- the first on the question of the 

guidelines. To the extent that the government believes 

in its test, which is what is the sentence that the 

defendant actually faced, there is no question that the 

sentence the defendant actually faced here was 57

months, well below the 10-year ACCA trigger. And the 

government does not offer any explanation that I can 

understand as to why, if their test applies, one takes 

recidivism enhancements into effect, but does not take 

guidelines reductions into effect.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You see that my question is 

going in the exact opposite way. What I am finding hard 

is once you distinguish offender and offense 

characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the 

max for the offense? And so I'm asking you, how is it 

you get out of that? Which is the same question I had 

before. I'm not so worried about your case as I am 

other cases.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the way -- the way we 

resolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by 

Justice Souter's question. What Congress had in mind 

was the offense without the overlay of a recidivism 

enhancement, which is not an element of this offense. 

One looks at the offense, one looks at the commission of 

the elements, if you commit the elements, what does that 

subject -- what kind of punishment does that subject you 

to? If it's less than 10 years, ACCA does not apply. 

If you have to call into the mix enhancements that are 

unrelated, that are offender-specific and not 

offense-specific, that's falls out because that's not

what Congress had in mind when it referred to 

"punishment prescribed by law for the offense." 

Again, Congress had in mind a limited series of serious 

offenses. It was looking at what people did, whether 

they engaged in the kind of serious, harmful, 

destructive conduct that was sufficiently bad to trigger 

the mandatory 15-year sentence, and if they did not, the 

fact that some additional overlay could be used to 

enhance their sentence is not what Congress was 

concerned about when it listed ACCA predicates.

 And, again, I don't want to fall away from 

the Sentencing Guidelines point because, as I understood 

Mr. Shanmugam's explanation to Justice Scalia as to why 

the Guidelines should not apply if enhancement does is 

because, well, this is an offender-specific -- an 

offense-specific crime, and Congress at the time that it 

enacted ACCA had in mind that guidelines in the 

statutory regime were different.

 But so far as the -- the offense has been 

defined by the -- by the statute, the relevant offense 

here is the five-year penalty associated with that 

offense. And so I think that if one is going to go 

beyond that and say we are going to look for things that 

are outside of the offense, not in the elements of the 

offense, to increase the sentence, as the government

does with the recidivism statute, there is no reason 

why, if we are prepared to go outside of the offense 

elements, that one wouldn't go to the Guidelines as 

well, which have precisely the same effect in the other 

way. I mean the government ultimately is asking for --

a one-way ratchet that if it increases the offense 

level, that's okay, but if it decreases the punishment 

for some reason, that doesn't apply. And we just don't 

see any principled basis for that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, I thought 

their argument was you look at broad categories rather 

than individual characteristics. It's not a one-way 

ratchet at all.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think, in terms of 

discussion of the Guidelines, they suggest that what 

matters is whether it is an element of the offense. I

Justice.

 There are just two points that I'd like to 

make in rebuttal:

 The first is that the government believes 

that the rule of lenity is inapplicable here for the 

simple reason that we believe that the text of the 

statute is not susceptible to Respondent's 

interpretation. And if the Court concludes that the 

statute does permit the interpretation that a given 

offense can have only a single maximum term of 

imprisonment, we believe that the only logical 

conclusion is that that maximum is the maximum that any 

offender could receive, not that the maximum -- not that 

it is the maximum that some better-positioned subset of 

offenders could receive. And while we do believe that 

the considerations that underlie the rule of lenity have 

less force in this context, and the Court has never 

applied the rule of lenity to the ACCA, we ultimately 

believe that the fact that the text does not permit 

Respondent's interpretation is the end of the inquiry.

 The other point that I would just make is 

that if this Court were to adopt Respondent's 

interpretation, it would have pernicious consequences, 

not only for the ACCA, but likely also for a number of 

other critically important Federal statutes as well.

With regard to the ACCA itself, both the definition of 

"serious drug offense" and the definition of "violent 

felony" are framed in terms of the maximum term of 

imprisonment for the offense, and at least 28 States and 

the Federal Government have drug-trafficking offenses 

that would qualify as ACCA predicates for repeat 

offenders under the government's interpretation but not 

under Respondent's. And with regard to other statutes 

similar language appears --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's good or bad, 

depending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of 

the statute is right or the other side's.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's good to put more 

people in jail? I mean, that isn't necessarily what 

we're after. We're --

MR. SHANMUGAM: I mean only to highlight the 

practical significance of this issue, Justice Scalia, 

and again, certainly in enacting a statute that itself 

deals with the problem of recidivism, we believe that 

Congress would not have wanted to be insensitive to an 

offender's past recidivism.

 But with regard to other statutes, I want to 

note that similar language also appears in the Federal 

three-strikes law and in the Controlled Substances Act,

which along with the ACCA, are among the most important 

Federal statutes dealing with a problem of recidivism. 

And similar language also appears in a number of general 

Federal criminal statutes, including RICO and the very 

substantive statute at issue here, the felony possession 

statute. And if this Court were to adopt the Ninth 

Circuit's interpretation, it could potentially lead to 

the narrowing of all of those statutes as well. The 

Ninth Circuit, alone among the circuits, has adopted 

this view that the relevant maximum for an offense must 

be the maximum that first-time offenders receive. We 

believe that that is erroneous and that the judgment of 

the Ninth Circuit should be reversed.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Shanmugam. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
