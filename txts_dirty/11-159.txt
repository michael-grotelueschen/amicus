CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato. 

Mr. Miller. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Social Security Administration has 

reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to 

provide that, as a general rule, a person seeking to 

establish eligibility for child survivor benefits must 

show that he or she would have been able to inherit 

personal property from the decedent under applicable 

State intestacy law. That interpretation is supported 

by the text, structure, and history of the Act, and it 

comports with principles of federalism because it defers 

to State law on the determination of family status, 

which is a traditional subject of State regulation. 

It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron. 

Now, the textual arguments in this case 

involve the interaction of three provisions of the Act. 

And the first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic 

benefits-granting provision. And that says that under

certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is 

entitled to benefits. And that provision has a 

cross-reference to a definition of "child" in section 

416(e) of the Act. And 416(e), which is reprinted at 

page 4a of the appendix to our brief, says that the term 

"child" means (1) the child or legally adopted child of 

an individual, (2) a stepchild under certain cases, and 

(3) a person who is the grandchild or stepgrandchild of 

an individual. 

Now, I think the one thing that's 

immediately apparent from looking at that provision is 

that under anyone's reading, it's a little bit confusing 

because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two 

different things. That is, the first "child" is broader 

than the second, because the first one includes the 

second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so 

forth. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a State legislature 

got the crazy idea that children born to married people 

during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under 

State intestacy law. Would that mean that they would be 

ineligible for survivors' benefits? 

MR. MILLER: Not necessarily, because if 

somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at 

the outset that that is unlike the law of any State

either in 1939 or today. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But what if they did -- what 

if they did that? 

MR. MILLER: There -- there are two 

alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the 

statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack 

intestacy rights to establish their eligibility. Those 

are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3). And 416(h)(3) says that 

an applicant who is the son or daughter of an insured 

individual but is not a child under -- under paragraph 

(A), which is the reference to State intestacy law, 

shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was 

an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that 

the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a 

court decree for support. So, I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Those are -- those are 

obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose 

parents are not married. 

MR. MILLER: That's right. And the reason 

for that is that, in fact, under the law of every State, 

both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are 

married do have State -- do have intestacy rights. But 

I think what the provision I just referred to 

illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is 

a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at

the ordinary meaning of the word "child," the concept of 

an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a 

child, would be completely nonsensical. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it means something 

else. Maybe it means that to the Congress that 

initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a 

child was a child. They knew what a child was. And the 

type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child. 

There wasn't a need for any definition of that. And 

they -- they never had any inkling about the situation 

that has arisen in this case, just as they had no 

inkling that any State would go off and take away 

intestacy rights for children born to married people 

during the course of their marriage. 

MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, I think -- I 

think those are probably accurate factual claims about 

what Congress was thinking, but had Congress wanted --

the way that Congress chose to make sure that the 

children of married parents could establish their 

eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law, 

because Congress knew that under State intestacy law, 

those children had such rights. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't there something 

sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in 

the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about

stepchildren and grandchildren and even 

stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not 

referenced? But you're saying that as to the largest 

category, the category in which 90 percent of people are 

going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to 

State law. 

MR. MILLER: Well, it -- that's -- that's 

what section 416(h) says. Section 416(h) sets out a 

rule --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose I'm not so 

convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is, 

because there are two sentences of -- of section (h). 

I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress 

would have specified everything about what -- how you 

get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and 

stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at 

issue. 

MR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I think it's 

because with respect to the main category of people at 

issue, the question Congress was asking is: What is the 

class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently 

close relationship to the insured person such that it 

would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the 

loss of support that they would likely be getting during 

the person's life? And if you look at what is the body

of law that defines that class of people who have a 

close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy 

law. And State intestacy law sets out sort of clear, 

easy-to-apply rules for the distribution of estates. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't 

always do --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Miller, there's one 

provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell 

me what it means. It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last 

sentence of (A). It says: "Applicants who according to 

State law would have the same status relative to taking 

intestate personal property as a child ... shall be 

deemed such." What person is that referring to? 

Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a 

child? 

MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. The 

first sentence sets out the general rule that you look 

to State law for the definition of "child." And the 

second sentence says that people who do not have the 

status of children but nonetheless have the inheritance 

rights of children shall be deemed children. And as a 

practical matter, the people that that applies to are 

people who have been equitably adopted. 

There's a doctrine in the law of many States 

where you have an adoption -- or you have an agreement

to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption. In 

that circumstance, the would-be adoptee does not have 

the status of a child for all purposes or even 

necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can 

take property from the adopting parents. So, that's who 

would be covered by that sentence, and that's now 

addressed in the regulations at --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyone else or just that 

category? 

MR. MILLER: I think -- I think that is 

the -- the most likely category that it would apply to. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said earlier 

that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I 

assume that's not always the case, particularly with all 

this new technological advancement. There must be 

situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law 

provides. And what does the Social Security 

Administration do in that case? 

MR. MILLER: The Social Security 

Administration tries to apply State law. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. My hypothetical 

is that there's no clear answer. I mean, let's take a 

situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new,

and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to 

decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for 

State intestacy law or not. What would SSA do? 

MR. MILLER: Well, the SSA does the best 

that it can to figure out what the State law is, and 

then on review in the district court, you know, the 

district court is able to review that. And there have 

been cases in which district courts have certified 

questions to State courts. And I think actually the 

fact that there are those difficult questions that can 

come up in some of the cases, particularly involving 

assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one 

of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than, 

as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and 

then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to 

create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to 

resolve all of those very difficult questions. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There was in my memory, 

and it's been a while, that some States, if not all --

and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem 

any child born during the marriage to be a child of the 

marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so 

that if a mother has had a relationship outside of 

marriage, the married parent's still responsible for 

that child.

That would take care of, I think, a great 

number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that 

occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the 

biological input of one of the parents? 

MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. And, in 

fact, there are statutes in a number of States 

addressing the question of when a -- yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. My question was, 

do all States have similar rulings? And for those that 

don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as 

Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new 

technology? What happens to that child in terms of 

their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a 

child for Social Security purposes? 

MR. MILLER: I -- I can't speak with 

certainty to all of the States, but I believe that that 

is the -- the general rule. So, I'm not aware of any --

any States where, when you have a married couple using 

donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be 

deemed the child of the husband. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: My impression is that, I'm 

not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, 

a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage 

unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the 

father.

MR. MILLER: I believe that is -- that is 

the general rule. And I think one thing that that 

illustrates, of course, is that Respondents' definition, 

which is also the court of appeals' definition, of what 

a child is and the definition that they urge the Court 

to apply in 416 is the biological child of married 

parents. 

And not only is the -- does the "married" 

part of that not comport with the ordinary understanding 

of "child," because of course in ordinary usage whether 

somebody is a child doesn't depend on whether their 

parents are married, but the biological part also does 

not comport with legal usage because, both in 1939 and 

today, there are many cases in which biological 

parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both 

for the reason that we were just talking about and then 

also for -- another example is when you have an 

adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else 

is no longer legally the child of his biological 

parents. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you tell me if -- if 

the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children 

within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the 

dependency or the deemed dependency requirements? Or is 

that a back-up argument that you have? Or --

MR. MILLER: We -- that -- that would be a 

question for the agency to address in the first 

instance. The agency has not addressed that question in 

the administrative process here. So, we are not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it was addressed in 

the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it? 

MR. MILLER: That's right. And the Ninth 

Circuit read the dependency provision of the Act to say 

that any legitimate child is deemed to be dependent, and 

it then conducted an examination of legitimacy under 

California law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have a position 

on that here? Or -- you want that to be elaborated more 

by the agency? 

MR. MILLER: That -- that's right. I mean, 

I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms 

about dependency, the statute creates a number of 

presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural 

child, any child under the -- that first -- that second 

child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category 

is deemed to be dependent. So, it doesn't necessarily 

turn on -- on factual dependency, which is obviously not 

present in --

dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you rely only on that

The section is entitled "Old-age and 

survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also 

provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits 

if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such 

individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time 

that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual 

has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such 

individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et

It seems to me -- is the word "survivor" 

used anywhere in the text of this statute except in 

the -- in the heading of this section? 

MR. MILLER: I don't -- it doesn't appear in 

any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but 

I would certainly agree with you that it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We use titles to determine 

the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?

MR. MILLER: The dependency requirement is 

defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not 

reproduced in the appendix, but which has the effect of 

making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed 

dependent. Now, we don't think that the children in 

this case qualify under 416(h). So, there's no -- not 

even any need to reach the dependency question there. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then what does -- what does 

(d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --

MR. MILLER: Well, the dependency 

requirement is something that people who don't qualify 

under 416(h), people who are adopted children or 

stepchildren or grandchildren, may in some cases have to 

make an individualized determination of actual 

dependency. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn’s say – it 

says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that 

requirement. If such -- such child, the one defined in (e). 

MR. MILLER: Right, but then -- but then 

402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under 

certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h) 

analysis. And I -- I would refer you on that point to

the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are 

404.361, which say that any natural child -- which is 

the term the agency uses for that second child in 

416(e) -- any natural child is deemed dependent. Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask --

Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous. Is 

that your position? Is it your position that the 

definition of "child" is ambiguous and that we have to 

give the agency deference, or is it your position that, 

in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social 

Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it 

couldn't, in the circumstances of this case? 

MR. MILLER: I think that when the statute 

was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same 

structure of these provisions as we have now, it might 

at that time have been ambiguous. But the agency 

adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure 

materially identical to its current interpretation in 

1940, and it has adhered to it ever since. And Congress 

has amended the statute with the understanding that that 

was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through 

State law to qualify. 

And I think in light of that history, at 

this point -- and Congress's ratification of that 

understanding, at this point the best view is that it is

unambiguous and clearly resolves the question in favor 

of the interpretation set out in the agency's 

regulations. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Miller, could I take you 

back to 416(e)? I take it that you don't contest that 

for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get 

benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're 

just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State 

law on those questions; is that correct? 

MR. MILLER: Yes, because those terms do not 

appear in 416(h). There's -- there's no instruction in 

the statute that those terms be defined by reference to 

State law, as there is with respect to "child." 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And, you know, I'm looking 

at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example. 

It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if, 

blah, blah, blah. It seems to have just sort of an 

understanding of what a grandchild is. In other words, 

it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's 

limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing 

understanding of what a grandchild is. And so, I'm 

wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it 

also true of children? 

MR. MILLER: Well, I should say two things 

about that, then. The first is, specifically with

child. The child -- what kind of child?

would qualify under 416(h) as a child. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, so, for grandchildren, 

the agency is also looking to State law? 

MR. MILLER: Indirectly. I mean, a 

grandchild is not expressly defined in the Act, but 

somebody who qualifies either under State law or you can 

also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone 

who qualifies as a child in that same sense. 

But -- I mean, again, the lack of a -- what's 

significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision 

in the statute that tells you how to define 

"grandchild." I mean, the -- the run of cases that 

Congress was concerned about involved children, and for 

-- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those 

cases, Congress gave explicit guidance, and that's to 

look to State law, in 416(h). 

Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that 

the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express

cross-reference to the definition in 416(e) but doesn't 

cross-reference the definition in 416(h). 

And I think there are two problems with that 

argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own 

terms says that it applies for purposes of this 

subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the 

Act that we're talking about here. So, effectively 

416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition, 

and there's no need for an express cross-reference. 

The second point about that is that the 

structure of the definitions here is very similar to the 

structure of the definitions used in defining other 

family relationships that are eligible for benefits. 

So, under 402, some of the other subsections of 402, 

there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or 

widower of an insured person. And just to take the 

benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute 

says that the "wife (as defined in section 416(b) of 

this title)" under certain circumstances can get 

benefits. 

If you look at the definition in 416(b) of 

"wife," it's very much like the definition in 416(e). 

It says, "the term 'wife' means the wife of an 

individual," and then it has some limitations. So, if 

you were to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you -- go ahead and 

finish. 

MR. MILLER: If you were to take 

Respondents' approach, you would just stop there and 

apply some sort of Federal standard of figuring out 

whether people are married or not. But in fact 416(h), 

in paragraph (1) of 416(h), says an applicant is the 

wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person 

if the State courts would regard them as being married. 

So -- and in the 1939 Act, all of those 

references to State law for wives and widows and 

children were all combined in one paragraph, so it was 

even clearer that that was how the statute worked, that 

you look to State law for defining all these family 

relationships. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I now have in 

front of me (h)(3). I don't see how it has anything to 

do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C). 

Why do you think it has something to do with that? 

MR. MILLER: I'm sorry. The -- the 

definition of dependency is in -- is in(d)(3), 

402(d)(3), not -- if you're -- 402(d)(3) says a child 

shall be deemed dependent upon his father unless at such 

time such individual was not living with or contributing 

to the support of such child and the child is neither

the legitimate nor adopted child of the individual. So, 

the effect of that is anyone who is a legitimate child 

is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, unless such 

individual was not living with or contributing to the 

support of such child -- which is certainly the case 

here; the child had not yet been born -- and other 

qualifications. The principal condition does not exist. 

Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting 

father unless at such time such individual, mother or 

father or adopted father was not living with or 

contributing to the support of such child. How does 

that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)? 

MR. MILLER: Well, because the child is 

deemed dependent unless he was -- I mean, again, 

since -- to be clear, we -- we think that the children 

in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status 

because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may well be. 

MR. MILLER: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that is ambiguous, why 

doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it 

(h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing 

with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to 

me that they don't meet that requirement.

MR. MILLER: That -- that might well be the 

case. Our position is simply that that's not an issue 

that the agency has addressed and that would be a matter 

for the agency to resolve in the first instance if this 

Court were to disagree with us on the definition of 

"child." 

I referred a minute ago to the 1939 Act and 

the structure of that Act, and I think that that's very 

instructive because, again, the way that the provisions 

were arranged in the 1939 Act, as we set out in our 

brief, were the same for present purposes as they are 

today. And Congress, when it amended the Act in the 

1960s to allow certain nonmarital children to be 

eligible for child status, recognized that that was the 

case, recognized the commission's interpretation that 

everybody had to go through 416(h) and establish their 

eligibility under State law, and then chose to make 

express exceptions to the requirement of State law for 

those children. No such exception applies here. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Miller.

MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

If I can, I'll start with a question that 

Justice Sotomayor asked about the ambiguity or not of the 

statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not 

ambiguous at all. We think that it unambiguously 

dictates the reading that we advance. And it's useful, 

I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it 

presents essentially two issues. One is whether all of 

the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits 

that are defined to be children in the statutory 

definition of "child," section 416, qualify for child 

benefits without reference to State law, as we submit. 

If they do, then the second question is 

whether the children in this case, the Capato twins, 

fall within one of the categories of children so 

defined. And we think that they very clearly do. 

Congress said expressly that every child as 

defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they 

satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this 

case. Section 416(e), to which Congress has expressly 

directed us in determining who is a child eligible for 

these benefits, defines a child to be (1) a child or 

adopted child, (2) a stepchild --

MR. ROTHFELD: We think subsection 416(e) is 

sufficient as to the children defined to be a child

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As the child who should 

receive. So, what's the purpose of (h)? 

MR. ROTHFELD: And our understanding of who 

falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of 

"child," is the natural child, the biological child of 

married parents. There are, of course --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, the -- a child who 

was born during marriage but is not a biological child 

wouldn't qualify? 

MR. ROTHFELD: No -- well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though they qualify 

under State law as a child? 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, as to the question of 

what (h) is designed to accomplish, we think that 

Congress enacted (h) for children whose parentage or 

parental relationships were unclear, which would 

principally have been children who were born outside of 

marriage, as to whom there was no presumption --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, would this -- let's 

assume Ms. Capato remarried but used her deceased 

husband's sperm to -- to birth two children. They're 

the biological children of the Capatos. Would they 

qualify for survivor benefits even though she's now 

remarried? 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that's an 

interesting and more difficult question than what we 

have here. I think that the answer may well be "yes," 

and I think that the -- situations like that can arise 

really in -- outside of the IVF context. That's a 

related situation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's -- you see, 

a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable 

because I don't see the words "biological" in the 

statute. I don't see the word "marriage" directly 

when -- within the definition of "child." So, where do 

I draw them from? Where do I come --

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both of 

those questions. As to where marriage comes from, I 

think from a number of sources. One is the point that 

was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at 

the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939, the 

overwhelming majority of children in the United States, 

more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95

percent -- were the children of married parents. And 

so, when Congress --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would be true 

under State intestate law. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, simply as to what 

Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child --

and you asked where marriage comes from in the 

statute -- I think when Congress said a child is a 

child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it 

would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that 

time, which was the children --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the words -- you say 

this is plain meaning. It says the child of a wage 

earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are 

importing the term "married," because someone can be the 

undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried. So, 

it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed. A 

wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage 

earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me say two things 

about that. And, first, to continue the question of 

where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference 

to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the 

companion to the intestacy provision upon which the 

Government relies.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and there's no reason 

to refer to (h). 

MR. ROTHFELD: But I think (h) reflects what 

Congress had in mind in the statutory definition, 

because in the provision that I'm referring to, Congress 

said that if the parents went through a form of marriage 

that was defective in some sense, nevertheless the child 

would be deemed to be a child, which tells us that 

marriage (a) was a significant part of what constitutes 

childness as defined --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't -- look, 

when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the 

mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most 

children were indeed children of married people doesn't 

change the word "child." I mean, we don't go back and 

say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what --

what their immediate concern is, and here they used the 

word "child." 

MR. ROTHFELD: But --

were children of married people, that's what they must 

have meant by "child." I just don't think that follows 

at all. "Child" means child. 

MR. ROTHFELD: If I may, Your Honor, 

Congress wrote a Federal definition of "child," and as 

Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when 

Congress defined "child," it defined "child" to include 

a number of things.  The first thing that it defined was 

a child is a child or adopted child and stepchild, 

grandchild, stepgrandchild. Congress used the word 

"child" to have a particular meaning, because it said a 

child is a child and other things. The other things 

that it mentioned were --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess 

the question is, when it says a child is a child, does 

it mean a child is a child born in wedlock or a child is 

just a child? And we know that Congress knew how to 

distinguish between the two because Congress 

distinguished between the two in this very Act in the 

dependency provisions. It talks about the legitimate 

child of such individual. Well, here it didn't add that 

word. It just said "the child." 

MR. ROTHFELD: But -- and I think the reason 

it did that, I mean, as -- again, as Mr. Miller said, 

Congress used the "child" in two senses. It used the

word "child" in the generic sense: Everyone who 

qualifies for child benefits is a child. So, it said 

"child" is, in that sense, a child, adopted child, 

stepchild, so forth. 

In the dependency section, Congress is 

referring to all children, all children in that -- in 

the generic sense, everybody who qualifies for benefits 

as a child. And, therefore, Congress had to distinguish 

between what we say it meant when it said a child is a 

child, natural child of married parents --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Are there any other statutes 

that you can point to around this time which support the 

notion that when people said "child" they meant child 

within a legal marriage? 

MR. ROTHFELD: I can't point to specifically 

that, because I think it was clear when Congress used 

the word "child" that that's what they had in mind as a 

generic matter. As I suggested, when --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. You can't point 

to anything because it's so clear? 

MR. ROTHFELD: In a sense, that's right. If 

everyone knew what the word meant -- the word "child" was 

used to define, I think, the category that people would 

have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal 

sense.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, don't you 

run into a problem? Perhaps not in 1939, but since then 

this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with 

the distinction between children born in and out of 

wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that 

the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, 

that there are no illegitimate children. All children 

are legitimate, whatever their parents may be. 

MR. ROTHFELD: That is true. But I think 

the question is, what was the intent of Congress when it 

wrote this statute in 1939? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but if we are going 

to apply those equal protection decisions to this 

statute --

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that may 

suggest that an unfavorable application of the statute 

to children born out of wedlock would be 

unconstitutional. But the question of whether or not 

Congress intended to provide benefits to these 

children --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I suppose the question 

is aren't you at the very least getting us into a 

situation where we should interpret the statute the 

Government's way because of constitutional avoidance 

concerns?

children who are born through, you know -- through 

assisted means by its incorporation of State law in 

favor of --

who are born after the father has died, which is in 

accord with the title of the statute: survivors 

benefits. 

MR. ROTHFELD: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's issue here -- what's 

at issue here is not whether children that have been 

born through artificial insemination get benefits. It's 

whether children who are born after the father's death 

get -- get benefits. 

MR. ROTHFELD: But I think -- I suspect the 

reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on 

that point is there is no question that children who are 

born -- who are, quote, conceived naturally in the marriage 

and are born after the father's death are deemed to be 

dependents and receive benefits. That has been the 

consistent position of the agency, and we think that 

that's clearly right. So, I don't think that the fact 

the child was born after death says dispositively that

what your definition of "child" is. Is it just a 

biological offspring? Is it limited to a biological 

offspring born of a particular marriage, but in what 

context? Because we go back to Justice Ginsburg's 

question of what happens if the -- if the decedent is 

the mother. There's no question that she bore this 

child. Married or unmarried, does it matter? 

Does marriage matter only if it's the father 

that's the decedent? What is your --

MR. ROTHFELD: We think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is a sperm 

donor, does any offspring that sperm donor have qualify? 

MR. ROTHFELD: No, we -- we think not, 

because what we think what Congress had in mind when it said 

in the first part of clause (1) of the definition of 

child is the child, the natural child -- and I use 

natural as distinct from adopted child or stepchild who 

are dealt with separately in the statute, which is why 

we think it is clear that Congress was there talking 

about natural children, biological children -- the 

natural children of married parents, which we -- as I

MR. ROTHFELD: We think that as Congress 

wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that 

child would then have been referred to the intestacy 

provision upon which the Government relies, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, so there are 

situations in which you think those provisions should 

govern. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Yes. Absolutely. We think 

that those provisions were added as an additive 

provision as a mechanism for children who do not qualify 

for the definition to be deemed a child. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is what was not 

clear to me. So, you're -- you're not arguing that 

"child" has just one natural meaning. 

MR. ROTHFELD: We -- we argue that Congress 

used the word "child" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In whatever meaning you 

could give it. 

MR. ROTHFELD: We -- I wouldn't say that. I 

think that when Congress said a child is a child, which 

is the provision of the statute we were referring to, 

it was distinguishing the child from the adopted child and 

stepchild, and we think they were doing it in the

context of marriage because (a) that was the paradigm of 

family relationships at the time; (b) we think the 

reason -- what Congress was very concerned with 

accomplishing in the statute was guaranteeing certainty 

in the -- in parentage and the parental relationship. 

And it set up a system of -- because in 1939 

there were no genetic paternity tests, there was no --

it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically 

certain as to who the -- at least as to who the father was, 

Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether 

or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the 

child. 

The principal one of those was the marital 

relationship because in 1939, as I think 

Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very 

strong, virtually per se conclusive presumption that a 

child born in marriage was the biological natural child 

of both the father and mother, of the married couple. 

And so, the existence of the marriage was a way of 

establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was 

the child of the parents, the child of the survivor --

of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being 

invoked here.

MR. ROTHFELD: I think -- we think that we 

are arguing essentially a -- sort of a subset of that 

theory. Our sense of what Congress was up to was that 

it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in 

response to the previous question, in establishing 

parentage. And the principal way in 1939 that Congress 

could do that was by (a) invoking existence of a 

parental relationship which established sort of as a per 

se matter that the children born within the marriage 

were the children of each of the married -- each member 

of the married couple. 

For parents -- children who did not fall 

into that category, there was this additive provision, 

section (h), which provided a mechanism for doing it, 

and establishing that State intestacy law would 

recognize this child as the child of -- typically it was 

going to be the paternity that was contested -- the

child of the father, (h) established a mechanism for 

doing that. So, I think that we are getting to the same 

place --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if --

MR. ROTHFELD: -- that your question 

suggests. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the children 

-- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived 

4 years after of the death in this case?  Would your 

argument be the same? 

MR. ROTHFELD: I think that our argument 

would be the same, but as a practical matter, almost all 

of these cases involve children who were born relatively 

soon after. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? Why 

would they all involve children born relatively soon 

after? 

MR. ROTHFELD: They don't necessarily have 

to, but I think the practical reason why they do is that 

it's often the case that the surviving mother has 

children to produce a family sibling for an already 

existing child as was -- as was the case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's no 

reason it couldn't take place 4 years after. 

MR. ROTHFELD: There is no reason. That's

correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what happens if 

the biological mother remarries or something and then 

goes through this process? Does the child get double 

survivor benefits or --

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- I assume 

you would argue that in that case the child is eligible 

through two different routes. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Potentially, that's correct. 

There are rules in the Act that prevent double recovery 

of survivor benefits. And so, I don't think that would 

be an issue that would arise here. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, these 

children were born 18 months after the insured wage 

earner died. If we look to other categories of 

children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for 

adopted children. For stepchildren, they qualify only 

if they had that status no less than 9 months before the 

wage earner died, and adopted children is also a 

limitation. The stepchild and the adopted child --

there could never be any question of being born 

18 months later. They wouldn't qualify. There's --

there is a time limit for the other children. And if 

Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would

have put a time limit on this, too. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that the 

question that the Court has to confront here is, 

Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word "child." 

And it was -- sort of the first question in the case, I 

think, is whether we are correct in our understanding 

that, when Congress wrote this definition, all 

applicants for child survivor benefits who fall within 

that category, those defined categories, qualify. 

And then we have -- if the answer to that is 

"yes," and so children as defined in clause (1) of the 

definition, which we think that the Capato children do, 

whether or not all children so defined qualify for 

benefits without regard to State intestacy law. If we 

are right about that, then that raises the question what 

is the meaning of "child" in the -- in the statute? And 

we think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: The question is what -- you 

haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not 

right, which is right in (h) which says: In determining 

whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the 

Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law. 

Okay? That's what it says. Now, how do you 

get out of that? 

MR. ROTHFELD: Because --

there's an implicit exception. 

MR. ROTHFELD: No, no. That's not what we 

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that that 

doesn't apply. And so, I've listened carefully to your 

reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its 

language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of 

why it doesn't apply. I mean --

MR. ROTHFELD: Because --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that two parents 

have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X, 

and they have a child. Fine. The father dies. Were 

they married? They never went through a ceremony. Is 

there a common law marriage? Might it depend on the 

State? Do you know the answer in every State? My 

answer is: You don't know. And I don't know. And, 

therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in 

order to see whether that (e) is satisfied. Now, we 

have to look to it to decide if they're married. Even 

you say that. 

So, what Congress did is it found a pretty 

good shorthand way of saying where you look. We're not 

going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just 

going to look at their intestacy law. That's, as I read

it, what it seems to say. 

Now, I have been listening to you , 

and I don't see how you're going to save us from 

even worse problems, particularly when I started looking 

at the state of the artificial insemination and so 

forth, and every State has a dozen different variations. 

There are uniform acts. There are things you have to 

acknowledge in writing. It's a very complicated 

subject. And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to 

read it the way you want. But I want you to reply to 

that. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the answer to the first 

sentence of section (h), if that were the only thing in 

the statute, I think that you would be right, but 

there's a second sentence to (h), which says in -- in 

applying State intestacy law, the -- the Commissioner is 

supposed to look at the status of an applicant and 

determine whether or not the status of the applicant is 

the same as that of a child. And if so, the applicant 

is deemed --

paragraph.

according to such law would have the same status 

relative to taking intestate property as a child or a 

parent shall be deemed such." 

MR. ROTHFELD: And that --

JUSTICE BREYER: So? 

MR. ROTHFELD: But as a child. Why does it 

-- it requires a comparison to someone who is a child. 

"Child" is defined in section (h). If -- if -- I think 

the problem with the Government's interpretation of the 

first sentence of that -- of section (h) is that it 

makes the -- the statute circular.

what Congress was up to in the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. 

MR. ROTHFELD: It --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MR. ROTHFELD: It was an additive provision 

that says that if you are the same -- and I think this 

is an important point, Justice Breyer. If you are the 

same as a child, you are deemed to have child status. 

You can't --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But then, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't 

one just say, well, first sentence, who is a child? Look 

to State law. Second sentence, when State law treats 

other people as children, you should treat them as other 

-- as children, too. So, the two sentences can cohere 

fine. For children, look to State law, and also look to 

State law to see who they treat just like children.

a plausible reading of -- of the text, Justice Kagan.

That's what State intestacy is concerned about. And you 

don't really know who their parents is. Another thing 

is there are already children who are eating up all of 

the money. And then some new person shows up, and you 

have to take the money away from the other children in 

order to give it to this new child. And all the time, 

you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead 

really wanted. 

And so, that's why the States have gone into 

all kinds of writing requirements. And -- and you want 

us to sort of -- applying this old law to new 

technology, just overlook those complications. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, Congress wrote a 

Federal definition of "child," and it's not an 

extraordinary thing for Congress to write a statute that 

has language that applies in certain circumstances, and 

the world changes. New developments require application 

of the statutory text to those new developments. 

If our reading of the statute is correct --

if what we think that Congress had in mind when it wrote 

this statute was that it wanted to set in place 

categories of applicants for child benefits as to whom 

parentage in a relevant sense could be determined with 

certainty, and it did that by focusing on the status of 

the marital relationship between the parents, and it did

it by providing an alternative basis in section (h) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would be fine 

if the statute said what you claim it says. It says a 

child is a child of a wage earner. And you'd have to 

import these things that Congress didn't say to get to 

what you claim is the plain meaning. But what do you do 

with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining 

whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual 

for purposes of this subchapter"? The subchapter is not 

for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire 

subchapter, which would include (e). 

MR. ROTHFELD: Right. And I think actually 

that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg, 

because in determining whether an applicant is a child 

for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the 

use of the word "child" in the generic sense, in the 

sense -- when -- when Congress said a child is defined 

to include people who fall in these various categories 

of children. So, everybody --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how could it do that 

when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine 

whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this 

subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law 

of intestacy"?

these two sentences have to be read together as 

accomplishing the same thing. What I think what the --

it's saying that in making the determination whether or 

not a child qualifies for child benefits, that the 

Commissioner -- applicants who according to such law 

would have the same status relative to taking intestate 

personal property as a child shall be deemed such. 

I think one can't apply the statute without 

knowing who a child is, because it -- it is directing 

the Commissioner to engage in a comparison. It's 

directing the Commissioner to say: Does this applicant 

have the same status as a child? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's exactly right, 

Mr. Rothfeld. But you have two choices. In the second 

sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be 

compared to the other, which is children. The question 

is, are children described by the first sentence of 

that, or are children described by the (e) section? 

So, you're just reading the first sentence 

out of the statute and saying that the second sentence 

totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go 

back to (e). 

But the first sentence exists. And it says: 

Who are children? Children are who they are under State 

law.

MR. ROTHFELD: No, and I -- I think that 

what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine 

whether or not -- when an applicant who does not fall 

within one of the defined categories in section (e) 

applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine 

whether or not that child has the same status relative 

to State law as the child as defined in the definitional 

section. 

The Congress -- as I say, Congress said 

expressly that a child as defined in section 416(e) of 

the statute qualifies for benefits. And so, I think it 

establishes a Federal standard as to what -- what a 

child is for purposes of the Act. 

The Court has to determine what that 

standard means to apply to any particular child.

Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous. Is there 

any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour 

that it's at least ambiguous?

didn't -- wasn't anticipating at the time. I think --

one of the questions that was suggested to my friend, 

Mr. Miller, by Justice Alito, I think, that if the child 

who is the -- in 1939, who is the child of married 

parents, natural child of married parents, sought 

benefits under this statute and they were denied because 

some State developed an aberrant law of intestacy and 

said that such child would not qualify, would not be 

deemed to be the child of their parents, I think that 

that would have been regarded as a clear misreading of 

the statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- do you think that 

Congress thought of either of these situations as real 

possibilities? Do you really think that the 1939 

Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute, 

ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally 

born -- all naturally born children -- or that children 

could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later? 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They weren't thinking of 

either. 

So, the question becomes, given the language 

of (h) that says define "child" this way throughout the 

subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its 

plain meaning?

convince us of. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if we have to convince 

you not to give the statute its plain reading, then we 

will -- not going to prevail. I certainly recognize 

that -- that plain meaning has to control. And as I 

suggested at the outset, the reason we think we prevail 

is that the plain meaning of this statute as was written 

in 1939, as it would have been understood by the 1939 

Congress that adopted it, was that the natural children 

of married parents, the paradigm of the situation of the 

child at that time, would fall into this category. Now, 

it is certainly true, as you say --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's because every 

State law recognized them as such as well, correct? 

MR. ROTHFELD: And every State law -- and I 

would put it the other way: Every State law recognized 

them as such because that was the way in which children 

were understood -- the meaning of the term "child" was 

understood at the time. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if we're going back

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there wouldn't be --

a child that's born 18 months after the father died 

wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the 

marriage would have ended. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that one has to 

look at what Congress at the time -- I guess I would put 

it this way: If -- if the Court were to accept our view 

that Congress had in mind the children of married 

parents, the question is whether any particular child 

falls in the box Congress would have regarded as the 

marital box or the non-married box. 

Situations like this simply could not have 

arisen in 1939. Congress would not have specifically – 

as Justice Sotomayor said, Congress would not have 

specifically had in mind, contemplated, the question of 

posthumous conception because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rothfeld, I know that 

the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my 

curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the 

requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency 

upon the father? 

MR. ROTHFELD: I guess two responses to 

that. One, as Mr. Miller said, this -- that issue was

MR. ROTHFELD: The answer -- the answer why

The reason that we think we would prevail on 

that question is because, as Mr. Miller said, Congress 

created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child 

of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed 

to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of 

the parent's death. And that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Miller, what do you 

think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that 

I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a 

marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that 

(h) is designed to deal with situations in which 

biological status is contested? 

MR. MILLER: Well, I -- the principal 

problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not 

supported by the text of what 416(h) says. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But why do you think that? 

What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with 

the theory that I just gave you? 

MR. MILLER: I would point to (h)(2)(B) and 

(h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow 

people to qualify when they can't establish State 

intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who 

is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not, 

and is not deemed to be, the child. 

So, if biological parentage were -- were 

what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked 

at (h) when there was some question about biological 

parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son 

or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense. 

And so, to give effect to those meanings --

to give effect to those provisions, to give them

meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than 

just in cases of disputed biological parentage. It is 

in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass, 

and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded 

it. 

The final point I would make is simply that, 

even if the statute were silent on whether to look to 

State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to 

hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a 

body of Federal common law about parental status. Here, 

of course, there's an express textual command the 

other way. And it would be particularly inappropriate 

to create, as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule 

that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the 

context of --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the last 

sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that 

Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of 

people who were indisputably children? I don't see how 

you can get around that, because it says what you're 

looking for under State law is to determine whether 

someone has the same status relative to taking intestate 

personal property as a child. 

MR. MILLER: I think the answer to that is 

the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago,

and that is that you have to read the first and second 

sentences together. And the first sentence sets up a 

general rule that you're looking to State law, and then 

the second is about people who would have the same 

status as children under State law. So, that the basic 

background definition in either case is coming from 

State law. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So, if the person is a 

child -- you have applicants who according to State law 

had the same status as a child, a person has that status 

because the person is a child, and the person is deemed 

to be a child, it seems very clear that that shows that 

(h) -- that this provision is directed to people that 

Congress in 1939 did not think fell within this paradigm 

of a child. 

MR. MILLER: The -- well, the second --

maybe, I may be misunderstanding you, but our view of 

what the second sentence does is that it covers people 

who are not treated as children, who are not children 

under State law but nonetheless have the inheritance 

rights of children. So, principally the -- in the case 

of equitable adoption, those people would have the 

status of children. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Miller, Mr. Rothfeld.
