 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of 

New York.

 Mr. Barnhouse.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Possessory and use taxes are extremely 

difficult to collect, even under the best of 

circumstances. Indeed, here the city alleges in its 

second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents 

on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate 

of 55 cents on the dollar. Yet it wants to collect 300 

cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed 

these taxes in the first place.

 The Respondent City of New York alleged two 

RICO claims and pendent State law violations that the 

city said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to 

collect cigarette possessory taxes from its city 

residents. The alleged lost opportunity to tax was 

based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants 

in four consolidated cases did not send names of

customers to the State of New York and had statements on 

their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco 

taxes applied.

 The Federal district court dismissed all 

claims. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated 

one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners, 

the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and 

affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its 

common law fraud claims.

 Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was 

improper because the city does not have standing to sue, 

based on the injuries that it has alleged. It does not 

have standing because the city's claim that it lost the 

sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to 

business, and it's not an injury to property.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why isn't the 

money property?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Money in the bank would be 

property, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, but an opportunity 

to collect money is an inchoate interest, and so it 

would not be property at that point. It would be the 

opportunity to collect it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't a 

lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property 

of an individual?

MR. BARNHOUSE: The lawsuit would be -- the

recovery would not be property until it became choate, 

until there was an amount of money assigned to it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no such 

adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no 

such adjective as "choate." There is "inchoate," but 

the opposite of "inchoate" is not "choate."

 MR. BARNHOUSE: All right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any more than the -- I 

don't know.

"gruntled."

the law, Your Honor.

the opposite of "disgruntled" is "gruntled."

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Is "gruntled."

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Well, it would -- it would 

be inchoate at the time the -- the city was just 

exercising its opportunity to tax, but had not -- or

exercising its sovereign right to tax, but had not yet 

assessed the tax --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the status of 

taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in 

Pasquantino. There it was a question of alcohol taxes 

owed to Canada.

 There were taxes due, but not paid. So why 

doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property 

question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as 

property?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg, 

Pasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal 

prosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with 

the term "property" in the -- in the Mail and Wire Fraud 

Statute, not the overlying 1964(c) requirement of injury 

to business or property.

 Moreover, it was the taxpayer who was being 

prosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor 

into Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell 

you the liquor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there are certainly 

differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case, 

either. But why would the determination of what --

whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as 

property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?

MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg, once the 

amount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of 

the amount owed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no assessment 

by Canada in the Pasquantino case.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: There was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said the -- the 

defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting 

it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The prosecution on the mail 

and wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was 

not an issue there. It was the U.S. Government --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're talking 

about -- only about property, not standing or anything 

else. And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme 

aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it 

was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud 

purposes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor, for wire 

fraud purposes. and the Court took a very expansive 

view of property in Pasquantino.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why is this different? 

I mean, it's clear that "property" can mean that. You 

acknowledge that it can mean the government's 

entitlement to money from taxes?

the Mail and Wire Fraud Statute, this Court has held 

that property can be for purposes of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it can mean that. Now 

why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: At the time, because of the 

overlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO 

of injury to a person's business or property, and 

because of Congress's reliance at that time on the 

antitrust laws and the general understanding at that 

time that business or property did not include the type 

of sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax, 

as confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in 

Hawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court 

affirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much 

difference -- different from the actual collection of a 

-- of a set amount of tax that the government knows it 

has coming.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the word "property" used 

in the antitrust laws?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. In fact, 

the -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does it say?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The standing for purposes of 

the antitrust laws is injury. A person has standing who

has been injured in his business or property. It's 

exactly the same as in RICO. In fact, Congress took the 

language from the antitrust laws, Justice Scalia, and 

placed it into RICO unchanged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it -- and it's clear 

that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does 

not include the government's entitlement to income from 

taxes?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. In Hawaii, 

this Court made it clear that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The Hawaii case didn't 

involve a claim to taxes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Stevens, it was a 

claim of injury to the general economy, which included 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right, and parens patriae 

for the community at large.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor. The State 

of Hawaii brought three claims. One was its injury to 

itself; one was the potential class action; and then the 

parens patriae claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But none of them involved 

a claim to taxes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It was my understanding that 

the injury to the general economy, the underlying claim

was that by losing that economic engine, that the State 

itself would be injured because of the loss to the 

economy and in its governmental functions. The actual 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that's 

something different. This isn't just the general, you 

know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the 

State. Here, what they're saying is: You caused people 

who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of 

money.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Scalia, it's not an 

identified sum of money. They don't know -- they can't 

tell who owed the taxes, in what amount, whether any of 

those people were eligible for the exemption under the 

law. It was inchoate. It was not known. It was not 

known who owed it or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it might have been 

inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, 

I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they? I 

mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward. 

Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: They would have to -- they 

would absolutely have to prove that for purposes of 

damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So worry about that later.

I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to 

prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that 

are very clear do not constitute property.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the -- what they've 

alleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but 

that they've lost the opportunity to tax. Moreover, 

they should not be able to reach that point because the 

allegations themselves are that the injury is not 

proximate. It is the city itself --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different issue.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It is a different issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to talk about 

that one, aren't you?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: I was hoping for a smooth 

transition, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You've got it.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the injury to the 

city is much like the injury in Holmes, where the city 

claims to be at the tail end of the chain of causation. 

They allege two injuries, sources of their injury. One 

was that statements made on an Internet website somehow 

caused people who purchased cigarettes in New York City 

not to pay. The district court described that source of 

injury as farfetched. Those were Judge Batts' words.

 The second source of injury they claim is

that by not reporting to the State of New York, the city 

then did not receive information about which city 

residents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then 

not go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and 

JUSTICE ALITO: Putting aside the fact that 

the Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State 

rather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it 

be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's 

farfetched that having a statement on the website "No 

taxes due" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those 

cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Well, Justice Alito, the 

allegations here are not that there were no taxes due. 

There wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, "Don't 

pay your taxes." What the website's allegations are is 

that the sales are tax-free, and the sales were 

tax-free. As the city points out, they -- it was beyond 

the power of the city to impose any sales tax on these 

transactions which occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New 

Mexico.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is it, a user tax once 

it gets into the city?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Exactly, Justice Scalia. 

It's a possessory tax --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Like automobiles.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just like automobiles. If 

you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the 

State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you 

have to pay a use tax.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: That's right. That's right, 

Justice Scalia, and the obligation to pay that tax is on 

the person who brings the car into the State. The 

obligation to pay the possessory use tax is on the 

citizens of the city of New York.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all it was 

alleged that these websites said, "tax-free"? They said 

"tax-free"?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: "Sales are tax-free."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Sales are tax-free." 

That's very clever.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: And "no tobacco tax." Those 

are the two allegations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No -- "no tobacco tax"?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is a tobacco tax, 

isn't there? Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use 

tax a tax on tobacco?

specifically not a tax on tobacco. It's a tax on the 

possession of cigarettes and there are exemptions to it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that just a 

question -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a 

proximate cause question?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it -- is it fraudulent to 

say "sales are tax-free" as opposed to, you know, saying 

no taxes are due?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Well, it has to do with the 

intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening 

causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes.

 The -- RICO requires someone who has been 

injured in their business or property by reason of the 

alleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was 

injured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of 

its citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their 

taxes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was injured because it 

couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who 

they were. And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins 

Act, was to help States find the people who were evading 

the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The 

Jenkins Act was -- was focused on allowing States to

help find those, and the city is therefore outside the 

zone of interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose -- suppose 

you had a case in which an individual that lives in New 

York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes 

outside the State and says: I want to buy a lot of 

cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help 

me? And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship 

the cigarettes.

 Is there proximate cause? Is it there if 

the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case? 

Would you say there's no proximate cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: I would say that there is no 

proximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the 

seller who the person went to and said: My goal here is 

not to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to 

get them into the city in a way that I don't have to?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you think the city --

and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a 

suit for its injury against the seller of the 

cigarettes? You think there's no proximate cause in 

that hypothetical case?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor, I would say 

that there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy, 

there would be the intervening cause of the person's

decision. It's -- it's beyond the first step.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though those are the 

only two people that have made the arrangement, and that 

was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement? 

And you still say there's no proximate cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Your Honor, the intent to 

injure, even if specific, as the Court held in 

Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient 

to change -- to give someone standing under RICO.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your answer to 

Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation 

standard as -- in RICO is different than general 

proximate cause standards in tort law?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: No, Your Honor, because I 

believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court 

has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause 

analysis in tort law. When the Court first started 

applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust 

law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it, 

the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause, 

and -- and it really discussed the elements of that 

quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case 

where it talks about five or six factors that the Court 

has to look at, those factors being the nature of the 

plaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the

type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall, 

or here the RICO laws. We would submit that it is not. 

It's an injury to a sovereign interest.

 The directness of the injury. Here the 

injury is indirect. It either comes -- flows through 

the citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the 

State that didn't get the reports of customers in the 

city.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the 

question I had asked you and was not finished getting 

your position on. Jenkins requires report to the State. 

You say the city was not within the zone of interest. 

But from the point of view of the sellers, the 

out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would 

they really want not only to have the burden of sending 

a list of names to the State, but to every county and 

municipality? Isn't it the -- just as it is in New 

York, there is a working relationship. The State gets 

all the names, and then it sends the names to the 

cities.

 You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it 

would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more 

burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only 

do you have to disclose to the State but also to any 

municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?

MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Ginsburg, Congress 

could have given the States power to share those lists, 

but it did not under the Jenkins Act. And it's not 

clear that -- that -- even the agreement --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- we're told that 

New York City and New York State have a tax information-

sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share 

this information with the city.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: The -- the agreement, and 

it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to 

get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1 

of the quote, in footnote 6: "Provided, that the 

disclosure of that information is permissible under 

existing laws and agreements." And this is proprietary 

information. These are customer lists.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what do you do 

with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's 

hypothetical? I mean, she can pursue her own question, 

but I'm interested in the answer.

 Her question is, suppose the statute were 

amended so that the information had to be given to the 

city as well as to the State; would the case then be 

different, hypothetical case?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, it would be different, 

because in that instance the city would be the --

would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct 

victim, would be within the zone of interest of the 

statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any sanctions for 

failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, 

without having to go through RICO?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Justice Scalia, it's a 

misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the 

U.S. Government. Those -- that's the extent of the 

Jenkins Act. And -- and the -- and what the city has 

done here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take 

the misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it 

into RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail 

and wire fraud.

 These sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in 

New Mexico. And it's my client's position, and it's no 

secret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that 

the Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not 

include his sales. There -- there's a dispute with the 

city on that, but it's not even clear that the State had 

a right to get these names, much less the city.

 Yet the city is claiming because it didn't 

get the names -- and if it had the names it claims a 

recovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the 

dollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the

dollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first 

place.

 Because the civil RICO has a separate 

standing requirement separate from mail and wire fraud, 

as Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not 

just the predicate act's standing requirement, but --

but the person injured in his business or property by 

reason of -- because Congress took this "business or 

property" language right out of the antitrust laws 

unchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that 

language. The court drew a bright line. It was a 

pragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that 

that business or property did not include injury to a 

sovereign interest.

 The opportunity to collect taxes is a 

sovereign interest. The taxes themselves, once 

collected or assessed, could be property, but not the 

opportunity. The injury flows either through the States 

or consumers and, therefore, is not proximate. These 

websites were not State-specific, much less 

city-specific.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't -- you 

don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with 

respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the 

taxes? If there's some way in which someone else

contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely 

that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's 

not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause, 

is it?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It wouldn't automatically be 

outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it 

was action that made it more or less feasible. But it 

would be unreasonable under this Court's decision in 

U.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that 

you cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not 

filing taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to 

rely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial 

language on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to 

decide that for some reason they didn't have an 

obligation to pay.

 And these websites had language that said --

the city attached the -- the pages from the websites 

themselves to the -- they were part of the record, the 

RICO record. I had those just a second ago and I can't 

seem to find them.

 But the -- the website pages for my client 

specifically had languages noted in the briefs that said 

these are not city-specific or State-specific, that --

that you need to contact -- you should contact your 

State officials for purposes of determining what your

individual obligations are regarding possession and tax.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many people who buy 

cigarettes out of State come back to their home State 

and voluntarily pay the use tax?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: In the response to the 

petition, the city said it's a fraction, I believe, of 

the people. They've also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there some exemption, 

anyway, for a couple of cartons?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: There is an exemption, yes, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: For what, two cartons?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Two cartons of cigarettes. 

And -- but -- but it's clear that possessory and use 

taxes are a bear to collect for any government. And the 

city here, as I -- as stated in the record, says even 

under the best of circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, it 

collects only 40 cents on the dollar, perhaps as much as 

55 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it needs the names so 

it can collect anything. Otherwise, how is it -- how --

how would it ever know?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It would rely on its 

citizens to step forward and pay it.

MR. BARNHOUSE: And they don't. And that's 

the intervening cause of the -- that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It would probably cost them 

more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't 

you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the 

names?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It's a very expensive 

process, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, and it -- it's 

tedious. You get the names. You have to go through the 

names and write. There's a cost involved in all that. 

There's a lot of friction in that entire process. 

There -- there are lots of reasons that, even when the 

city gets the names and even under its allegations of 

collection rates, Justice Ginsburg, very small, 40 cents 

to 55 cents on the dollar.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know if these 

Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the 

State?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It -- it's my understanding, 

Justice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins 

Act reports from some vendors. Those can come in all 

sorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of 

paper perhaps. And it would be the State's 

responsibility then to go through those, select which 

ones were residents of the city of New York, and then

decide whether under existing laws it was even permitted 

to share this proprietary information with the city, 

before giving those to the city.

 It would then be the city's responsibility 

to take the list given to it by the State and decide who 

hasn't paid. Then there's the exemption issue that 

comes on top of that. And then go out and try to 

collect these amounts, which they allege to have done in 

at least two instances.

 Finally, the policy -- I'm sorry. The 

policy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a --

makes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have 

looked at issues such as additional fire protection, 

payment of -- of public benefits, other instances where 

governments have come forward and under RICO tried to 

bring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses, 

overtime that was paid to police that had to monitor 

protests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid 

to people who were not legally in the country and 

working in agriculture.

 Governments have brought those and the 

circuit courts of appeals in both of those instances 

said those are injury to sovereign interests, citing 

Hawaii, and not the kind of injury to business or 

property that Congress intended when it adopted RICO.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KOERNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 With respect to the definition of property, 

this goes back to Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where in an 

original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of 

Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which 

attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation 

plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to 

the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the 

generation plant.

 Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense 

was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost 

the opportunity to collect taxes. This Court found 

standing and allowed them to sue and successfully 

challenge under the interstate commerce rule. That was 

before we get to Pasquantino. Justice Ginsburg is quite 

right --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Did -- was 

there some statute at issue in that case which required

not just an interest, but an interest in property?

 MR. KOERNER: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. KOERNER: The -- it was just -- I was 

just going to -- yes, it was just a discussion of what 

was the nature of Wyoming's interest. Was it 

substantial enough to allow them to sue, challenging the 

Oklahoma statute.

 In Pasquantino, though, the issue was 

foreclosed. In that particular case the issue of 

definition of property was the exact same issue that you 

have in the RICO case. Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a 

predicate for RICO. In that case there was, as Justice 

Ginsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the 

importation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland. The 

charge was wire fraud.

 And first, there were two issues: One, the 

revenue rule, which is not relevant here. But the first 

issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect 

taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to 

property. And there was a long discussion by this Court 

equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the 

Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of 

Black's and the Webster's definition that property 

includes not only that which you actually have, but that

which you were denied the opportunity.

 In this particular case, the reason we don't 

have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we 

allege of the defendant. It's a little tough --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, because 

of -- because of what?

 MR. KOERNER: The fraud of the defendant. 

It's a little hard to argue when you've created the 

situation so we can't collect that an inability to 

collect then becomes no property. After Pasquantino 

this Court decided the Anza case, which I'll discuss for 

both issues.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Before you get to Anza, 

this might be a good time to ask because I don't think 

we focused on this in Pasquantino. But if in fact the 

failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then 

why isn't every corporation that files an income tax 

return and makes two false statements automatically 

liable for RICO? I mean --

MR. KOERNER: As long as they meet the 

definition of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that would mean the 

States have a new method, which I don't think they use, 

a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who 

makes two false statements or a false statement in two

income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would 

have vast repercussions. I mean, it might be very 

beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; 

but --

MR. KOERNER: If people --

JUSTICE BREYER: How, how -- why would it 

not be --

MR. KOERNER: Why would --

JUSTICE BREYER: But they left -- they don't 

have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes. 

But in effect you would read into the RICO 

predicate protecting States.

 MR. KOERNER: This is precisely what 

happened in Anza.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but nobody 

focused on this issue. So -- so that's what's bothering 

me. What is the -- what is the stopping place?

 MR. KOERNER: If you're --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or is there one? And if 

there is none, how do we reconcile this view of --

they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and 

Pasquantino to the contrary. Right. But they're 

suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come 

up.

understatement.

what Congress intended. If you look --

JUSTICE BREYER: If they did, then why 

didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as 

a predicate act?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, in fact what they put in 

in 1978 was the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that cuts against 

you.

 MR. KOERNER: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because if they put in one, 

your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need 

that or not. Your theory applies to every tax, every 

tax.

 MR. KOERNER: Well, the reason they put it 

in was to increase the criminal penalties as well as 

recognize the civil penalties.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but go back to my 

question.

 MR. KOERNER: The importation -- yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: My question is, forget the 

cigarette taxes. If I accept your argument, am I then 

saying that California, New York, and every other State 

that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go 

through, look for two tax returns that have a false

collect RICO damages?

 MR. KOERNER: Yes, that's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a pretty 

far-reaching --

MR. KOERNER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you know anybody, any 

court that has ever said that?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, the issue hasn't been 

raised. But the -- but the -- RICO has been 

consistently interpreted by this Court in an 

expansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not 

truncated it except in the one area of securities 

violation and only because they found that there were 

ample remedies in securities law, and because they 

thought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and 

wire fraud.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that help?

 JUSTICE BREYER: If Congress wanted that 

result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not 

paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?

 MR. KOERNER: Because they had a more 

general definition, and they wanted the broadest 

possible interpretation. But the Cigarette Contraband 

Trafficking Act was put into RICO as a predicate crime.

The sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to 

the State and the city. It's the only economic injury. 

It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this 

when, in addition to the general definition, they put 

this in.

 In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in 

1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on 

congressional minds.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Congress said --

we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner, 

Congress said you can only -- only the Federal 

prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins --

MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- not New York City, not 

New York State --

MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and it's a 

misdemeanor.

 MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And now you -- you are 

saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after 

what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax 

violations?

 MR. KOERNER: No. What we're saying is the 

Jenkins Act is some evidence of the state of mind of the

defendant when he commits this fraud. What we are 

saying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file 

reports with the State indicating both the identity of 

the seller and the identity of the purchaser. Our 

predicate act is not Jenkins. Our predicate act is wire 

and mail fraud. Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would 

still have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based 

on the representations of the seller, which is that all 

the sales are tax-free.

 What Jenkins does through the cooperation 

agreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these 

taxes when they're complied with. If the defendant by 

active intervention does not file and instead advertises 

no sales tax required, he is preventing us from --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you know -- do we 

know that? Do we know whether the Petitioner has in 

fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?

 MR. KOERNER: No. We have -- we have 

alleged that he has not -- not filed one report with New 

York State. Indeed, he has actively represented in the 

website that he has no obligation to file the report, 

and that any information that he obtains from the 

purchaser is confidential.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I think that 

their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right,

it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud. All these tax 

violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax 

return normally.

 MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So all of these would be 

mail fraud. But mail fraud is not a treble damages 

statute. And therefore the question is who will 

prosecute, State or Federal? So normally it's State if 

it's a State tax. But it's one thing to say Congress 

didn't care about that and quite another thing to say 

that Congress didn't care if the States were going to 

use this in order to collect three times what the taxes 

are owed. And so they're looking for a way to cut off 

this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax --

failure to pay your State taxes. And that's why they've 

hit on this idea of the antitrust. I don't know if 

that's a satisfactory idea. I don't see the solution. 

I think I see the problem.

 MR. KOERNER: But in the antitrust case in 

the State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was 

not allowed to sue was not because of the injury. It 

was not -- it was the directness of the injury. This 

Court pointed out the fact that there was the 

possibility of duplicative recoveries, and the State of 

Hawaii was acting on behalf of the consumers.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it was injured 

by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the 

consumer's failure to pay the taxes. That is an 

intervening cause.

 MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, why shouldn't 

that be the end of the causation chain?

 MR. KOERNER: Because it's -- while the 

consumer has failed, we are suing the seller because he 

set up the ambiance, the environment for the consumer 

not to pay. It is his --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're suing him for 

setting up the ambiance?

 MR. KOERNER: Yes. He is the one who 

created the fraud, by leading the consumer to believe 

they didn't have an obligation to pay. We are suing 

based on impedence with the opportunity to collect 

taxes, where there are three parties to this 

transaction --

JUSTICE ALITO: In order to -- in order 

to -- to prevail on that theory, would you have to prove 

that these -- these alleged misrepresentations in fact 

caused people not to pay taxes?

 JUSTICE ALITO: And you think you could

response rate of individuals on their own when the 

Jenkins report is not filed is extremely low. Yet when 

the Jenkins report is filed they do --

JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what percentage of

City voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax 

returns for items that they purchase on the Internet?

this particular --

made, you still have to -- have to assume that this --

number one, you have to assume that the State would turn 

the list over to the city, which the State isn't 

required to do.

 MR. KOERNER: But we do have a cooperation 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be, but the 

State isn't required to, and the State can terminate 

that agreement whenever it likes.

 But, secondly, after you get the information 

we have to assume that you're going to move against 

these people.

 MR. KOERNER: If you look in footnote 8 of 

our brief, we point out, even in this case, when we've 

settled with parties and they've turned over the 

information we have been able to recover significant 

amounts of the taxes owed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it -- does it 

affect your ambiance theory that the website has the 

language that your friend told us is on it, that you 

have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from 

State to State or whatever the exact language is?

 MR. KOERNER: No. No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That still creates 

the ambiance?

MR. KOERNER: When you look at the website 

and you have flashing lights that say "No taxes 

required," indeed we allege in the complaint that the 

entire business model is predicated on the fact that 

they don't have to pay State and city taxes.

 The wide difference allows for the profit 

for the seller and a savings for the buyer. That is 

what we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove 

that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you satisfy Justice 

Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by 

saying that if there were a corporation that went around 

to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid 

taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and 

that would be closer to your case?

 MR. KOERNER: It would be -- it would be 

easier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's 

fact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a 

fraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO, 

and indeed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, you're 

certainly consistent and persistent on that point.

 MR. KOERNER: Yes. That would be a better 

factor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it would seem to 

me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to 

differentiate this case. And isn't that consistent with 

RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, I do want to reiterate 

the fact that, apart from the general language in this 

case, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking 

Act, which I alluded to earlier. That -- that Act 

precisely deals with the problem of underpayment of 

taxes for cigarettes. It was passed in 1978 and then 

amended in 2006 to include localities. It has very 

severe penalties under RICO criminally. It allows for 

fines and forfeitures. But more important, you can use 

RICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that 

entire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect 

taxes. So it's difficult to say that Congress was not 

aware of this problem, aware of its potential scope.

 And while I understand this Court's 

frustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in 

many cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides 

with Congress to change it. If they feel there is a 

misuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out 

of context in terms of what they contemplated, then they 

should change it.

 Yet --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept 

of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.

 MR. KOERNER: It is, but if you look at --

Chief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate 

cause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is 

that there are other factors that are not associated 

with the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want 

courts or juries to have to parse -- parse out 

legitimate business problems and illegitimate business 

problems because they become too complex.

 You don't have that here. Here, you have 

direct injury to the city, and it's an easy calculation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know -- you gave an 

instance in your brief or two instances of successful 

attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the 

cigarette buyer. Did those come about because the city 

received the Jenkins Act list from the State? How did 

the city get --

MR. KOERNER: In the particular cases that 

we mentioned in footnote 8, they were parts of 

settlements for the people who had, similar to this 

particular defendant, had advertised as tax-free, and we 

had settled with those people to get the reports, and 

then, based on the reports, we were able to track them

 Where we get the Jenkins -- where people 

voluntarily disclose the Jenkins Act reports, we do 

follow up aggressively, but the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you follow up by 

writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is, 

when you wrote them a letter, about half of them 

coughed -- coughed up the tax.

 MR. KOERNER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They may have been the 

foolish half. Did --

(Laughter.)

 MR. KOERNER: No.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be worth it. It 

can't possibly be worth it.

 MR. KOERNER: Here's what would be worth it: 

If we can stop the fraudulent practices that these 

sellers represent through the treble damages. The only 

benefit that these Internet sellers have is the cost 

saving as a consequence of the tax saving.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is what they're doing 

any different from what out-of-State mail order houses 

have done in -- they set -- they set up in States 

without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a 

compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I 

don't know is ever collected.

 MR. KOERNER: Well, I would like to think 

that those out-of-State sales entities don't exist 

solely to try to deprive receiving States of tax. The 

difference here is the entire business plan is based on 

not paying tax.

 Now, RICO has been in business since 1970. 

Your decisions have expanded its use. As I indicated, 

there has been no attempt to restrict it in any way, 

and, indeed, despite --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

because in every one of those cases, or at least in many 

of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we 

don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and 

we're faithful to that intent.

 But I guess, as I tried to point out 

earlier, this is a different question. This is the 

usual judicial application of concepts of proximate 

cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad 

RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted

would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate 

cause question.

 MR. KOERNER: But in the proximate cause 

equation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the 

Court, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful 

issues. And as I indicated, where there's a combination 

you don't want a Court to weigh what's lawful and 

unlawful.

 But here our injury -- injury is solely the 

result of an unlawful use. There are no intervening 

factors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- I don't 

understand that. The injury is directly caused by the 

consumers who don't pay the taxes.

 MR. KOERNER: And I -- that's -- that's the 

way you frame it, I understand, but it can be equally 

framed by saying the injury is caused by the seller's 

misrepresentation, which encourages the purchasers not 

to pay taxes.

 And if you look at the websites, there is no 

doubt about what this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you say then that 

proximate cause is in part established because of the 

specific intent? Is that --

MR. KOERNER: No. I'm saying --

you said that, because the Associated Contractors said

MR. KOERNER: I know. What I am saying is 

that, given the opportunity to prove this, we can show 

that the entire business model was intended never to 

have any taxes paid on these transactions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in the world and 

in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there 

proximate cause because this was the business model? 

How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause? 

There's not specific intent.

 MR. KOERNER: There are no other intervening 

causes between the fraud and the injury to the city. It 

is -- we lost an opportunity. Look --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know. But there is no 

other -- take a case which was put to you as the seller 

who has many reasons for selling from out of State. 

They have a good catalog business, it's a 

well-established name, and so it's not just to avoid 

taxes. How is that different from what happened here?

 MR. KOERNER: Because in this case, they 

don't have any other reason --

proximate -- the universe of the law that we call

proximate cause, how do you explain that? It's not 

specific intent.

 MR. KOERNER: The law of proximate cause in 

the case you described, you would have to consider all 

of the issues, some related to the transaction that 

you're suing on, some not. If the mail order catalog 

could show there were other reasons for their sales, not 

attributable to the unlawful RICO definition, then it's 

the type of injury you don't want to make an inquiry to. 

But if you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Reason on whose part? Some 

reason on whose part? On the seller's part or on the 

New York buyers' part? They will be -- the New York 

buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not 

going to pay taxes on it. But it seems to me the seller 

couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or 

not. So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes, 

the seller has gotten what the seller wanted.

 MR. KOERNER: Except that the buyer -- the 

seller is advertising it as tax-free. He's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a mail order 

house and they put a little line on it, says: By the 

way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes. 

Then they're also subject to RICO prosecution?

 MR. KOERNER: As I said, it's a harder case

because there may be other reasons why that mail order 

house is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza, 

just like you said in Holmes. But in this case there's 

only -- it's the whole model. There's only one reason 

why they're successful.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe that isn't 

completely true. Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at 

least theoretically. You buy stuff over the Internet, 

you buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all 

right, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not 

is your decision.

 MR. KOERNER: Except that the seller --

that's not the facts in this case. The seller 

affirmatively represented that there are no taxes. He 

told the consumer, and then kept the consumer's identity 

unknown --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, we were --

MR. KOERNER: -- by deliberately not filing 

as required by Federal statute, and places us in a -- in 

the position in the circle of having no knowledge of who 

the buyer is, having affirmative misrepresentation, and 

we are the only one in this transaction who are directly 

injured.

permanent misrepresentation made?

MR. KOERNER: The customers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Usually you're not liable 

for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied 

on. You really think that the -- that a large 

percentage of the people who were getting this stuff 

really, really were gulled into believing that New York 

State was somehow being done out of taxes?

 MR. KOERNER: Yes, because of the 

representation that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Really?

 MR. KOERNER: -- they would never contact 

the State with any information concerning the 

transaction. That's exactly what they did. Everybody 

understands in the nature of these purchasing exactly 

what it's about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I am sure the purchaser 

knows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should 

pay taxes. But you're -- you're telling me that the 

only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because 

of this misrepresentation that you don't have to 

purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes. I've known a 

lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that 

gullible.

obtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the 

Internet. What I'm saying, you have to look at the 

context of the facts. The facts were affirmative 

misstatements by the seller.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the seller 

didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the 

whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but 

they don't have that statement in there; they just say: 

Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to 

pay taxes or not.

 And what if that was the -- that was exactly 

the -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer 

says: They'll never catch you if you don't pay it.

 MR. KOERNER: I think it's a question of 

proof, and if we're able to show that these individuals 

thought it was tax-free, then we should be able to 

pursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act. You 

have the Cigarette Trafficking Act. That is within 

RICO. That sole economic injury is loss of revenue to 

the State and the city.

 So if we allege the Cigarette Trafficking 

Act -- it was not applicable at the time of this case; 

it was amended to apply to localities slightly after, 

but if we predicated the case on that, would you still 

say there's a proximate cause issue when you have

MR. KOERNER: No, no, no. It was 

rhetorical. I wasn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. KOERNER: I'm just trying to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back at 

maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which 

is you're focusing on -- you keep saying: The whole 

purpose of this, look at their website.

 But the issue is proximate cause, and if 

you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's 

either proximate cause or not. And if the -- if the 

indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct 

cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem 

to me that their intent is pertinent.

 MR. KOERNER: But we're seeking -- the 

injury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been 

denied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates. 

Indeed, if you look at the legislative history of that 

Act, the sole purpose was to make it a very, very 

serious felony, and with civil undertones, in order to 

discourage the act as a disincentive, so that this

trafficking, which is a major problem, started to be 

reduced.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. 

Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking. 

I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of 

it. It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to 

ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell, 

distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no 

evidence of payment of applicable State or local 

cigarette taxes.

 MR. KOERNER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there is no applicable 

State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these 

cigarettes.

 MR. KOERNER: But if the shipment is done 

with the intent of avoiding taxes, which was 

contemplated by this statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what it says. 

It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear 

no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and --

MR. KOERNER: That's correct. There's a 

question of proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is no applicable 

taxes at the time that they ship it.

have other businesses that are legitimate. This 

particular enterprise has no legitimate aspect.

you, "sales tax due," and if they have no outlet in the 

State, it says "sales taxes due: Zero." What is the 

difference between that situation and this situation?

 MR. KOERNER: Well, first of all, in time, 

the Internet has raised many issues. It's unclear how 

Congress feels about this. We have legitimate 

enterprise.

 But cigarettes have been a particular focus, 

and I think, in effect, you cannot use the general 

argument as to the Internet, when you have congressional 

legislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was 

specifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like 

this, where States were -- were being deprived of the 

revenues through the interstate shipments.

 And you have the traffic -- the Cigarette 

Trafficking Act which is, again, an expression by 

Congress that they want these individuals to be put out 

of business. That's exactly what RICO is about.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Winter in the 

Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in 

enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or 

maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State 

vendors. What -- what was the basis for his statement

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 Justice Stevens, the city brought exactly 

that case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a 

defendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that 

case was similarly dismissed by the district court, and 

that dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit.

 Justice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the 

States was going after $14,500 in back sales and 

gasoline taxes. After having prosecuted the individual, 

they were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh 

Circuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first 

circuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the 

case could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss.

 JUSTICE BREYER: On cause, why isn't it a

don't tell them who's bought it. They're supposed to,

no one will pay or that some will pay? Some will pay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Some pay. Some don't.

They have the numbers there. They get more than half.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It's -- it's foreseeable 

that some won't pay. That's foreseeable, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you get half-treble 

damages. What is that? One-and-a-half damages.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: But, at that point, it 

becomes speculative, Justice Scalia, and it's -- it's 

foreseeable that some won't pay, but it's also 

foreseeable that some people won't pay --

JUSTICE BREYER: And, if you put people in 

front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's 

speculative?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: I'm sorry? I didn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if you put somebody 

in front of a railroad train and half survive because 

they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: No, Your Honor, but, in that 

instance, I would be the one pushing the person, and not 

the one -- I would be the person, as in Pasquantino, who 

did not --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you say it's 

foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money. And 

that's what they're arguing?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the answer to

that?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: That it's foreseeable that 

they won't get a lot of money?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The reason is because of 

what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It's but for, and it is 

foreseeable that some -- some taxpayers in New York will 

not pay. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: End of case. Now, we go to 

the damage section.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But for -- no, no, your 

response is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a 

definition of proximate cause.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: But it's not a definition of 

proximate cause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You need more than that.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: That, itself is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: I took torts a long time 

ago. I thought that was part of it.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: What -- what the Court said 

in Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not 

only foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that--

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. There can be other 

things that cut it off. Proximate cause. Foreseeable. 

No kind of an event that would cut the causal chain,

like some odd fluke or something.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: No policy reason or others 

for cutting the chain. I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962, 

okay?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't it -- well, I 

don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a 

proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that 

the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?

 In other words, there's only proximate cause 

if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that 

they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the 

proximate cause chain?

 MR. BARNHOUSE: It -- if we assume that --

that the assumption that they will pay their taxes 

breaks the proximate cause? I'm not -- I'm sorry --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that you have 

to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful 

question.

 In order --

MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, sir. That's why --

that's why I'm trying to understand.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In order to maintain 

the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for

one of those links in the chain, that a party is going 

to commit illegal action.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's wrong. I 

mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a 

lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb 

in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets 

mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though 

there is an intervening criminal act.

 Now, maybe what you want to argue is that 

that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to 

either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and 

that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut 

off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as --

such as RICO. That would be a reasonable argument.

 MR. BARNHOUSE: That's a great argument, 

Justice Scalia.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And a good place to 

end.

 Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
