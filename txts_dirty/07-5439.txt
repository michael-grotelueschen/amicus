 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in the Case 07-5439, Baze v. Rees.

 Mr. Verrilli.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Kentucky's lethal injection procedures pose 

a danger of cruelly inhumane executions. If the first 

drug in the three-drug sequence, the anesthetic 

thiopental, is not effectively administered to the 

executed inmate, then the second drug, pancuronium, will 

induce a terrifying conscious paralysis and suffocation 

and the third drug, potassium chloride, will inflict an 

excruciating burning pain as it courses through the 

veins.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Verrilli, your 

argument is based on improper administration of the 

protocol. You agree that if the protocol is properly 

followed there is no risk of pain?

 MR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that 

respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice. The protocol simply 

does not address several key steps where risks can arise

and, beyond that, the protocol's -- and I think this is 

critically important -- the protocol's procedures for 

monitoring to assure that the inmate is adequately 

anesthetized are practically nonexistent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

expert -- I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint 

appendix -- agreed that if the two grams of sodium 

pentothal is properly administered, the way he put it, 

in virtually every case there would be a humane death.

 MR. VERRILLI: That is true, but there can 

be no guarantee that it will be properly administered 

and that is because even in clinical settings there are 

always -- there is always the potential for difficulty 

which manifests itself in actual problems, for example 

in the setting of an IV.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it were properly 

administered, would you have a case here? Let's assume 

100 percent of cases are properly administered.

 MR. VERRILLI: If there were a way to 

guarantee that the procedure worked every time, then we 

wouldn't have substantial risk.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my question --

MR. VERRILLI: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume 

hypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100

percent of the time it's properly administered. Then do 

you have an argument to present to the Court?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, if the "if" is, I 

apologize for this, but for clarity -- the "if" is that 

100 percent of the time the dose of anesthetic is 

properly administered into the condemned inmate, then we 

don't have a significant risk. Of course that is not 

what the record in this case establishes. The record 

establishes the contrary. There is -- you cannot assure 

that there is going to be a guarantee of -- of 

successful administration of the anesthetic. And that 

is why the monitoring part of the process is so 

critical.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would you -- would 

the monitoring suffice? In other words, you started out 

by saying there is no way that it could be administered 

and assure 100 percent against risk, so it would be 

helpful if you clarified: Yes, there is a way of 

monitoring adequately and tell us what that would be, or 

no, there is no way.

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I 

think we have tried to suggest in our brief that there 

is a way to monitor effectively even with the three-drug 

protocol. It's challenging. The key component of that 

is that one needs a person trained in monitoring

anesthetic death to participate in the process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Who would be a medical 

doctor -- and medical doctors, according to the Code of 

Ethics of the American Medical Association, can't 

participate.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, Your Honor, of course, 

that's why there is another practical alternative here, 

which solves that problem, which is the single dose of 

barbituate, which does not require the participation of 

a medically trained professional.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that seems to be a big 

part your argument, but it doesn't appear that that 

argument was raised at all in the Kentucky courts, and 

it seems that there is virtually nothing in the record 

of this case that shows that that's practical or that 

it's preferable to the three-drug protocol. It may well 

be, but without anything in the record of this case, how 

could we hold that the three drug protocol is 

unconstitutional?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, if I may Justice Alito, 

I do think and I'd like to provide the references where 

it is raised and then the evidentiary references that 

support the argument --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where was it raised? The 

citations in the brief that was submitted by your

co-counsel are inaccurate to show that it was raised in 

the Kentucky courts.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, at page 684 of the 

joint appendix, the -- this is the trial brief, the 

brief raised in the trial court -- one assertion made 

there is that an alternative chemical or combination of 

chemicals that poses less risk of unnecessary pain and 

suffering during an execution is --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, that's -- that's the 

trial court, and you think that just the word an 

"alternative chemical poses less risk" is sufficient to 

raise the argument that the three-drug protocol is 

unconstitutional, because a single drug protocol 

involving thiopental is preferable. That one word?

 MR. VERRILLI: And then -- and then, no. 

And then later, on page 701, the brief argues that there 

are nonpainful ways of stopping the heart.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are they? That is, I 

was -- I can't find -- what should I read? Because I've 

read the studies. I've read that Lancet study, which 

seemed to me the only referee for it said it wasn't any 

good. And I've read the Zimmer study and I found in 

there an amazing sentence to me which says that The 

Netherlands Information Task Force concluded it is not 

possible to administer so much of it that a lethal

effect is guaranteed. They're talking about thiopental. 

So I'm left at sea. I understand your contention. You 

claim that this is somehow more painful than some other 

method. But which? And what's the evidence for that? 

What do I read to find it?

 MR. VERRILLI: The thiopental is a 

barbiturate and by definition will inflict death 

painlessly. The record in this case establishes -- each 

expert, the Petitioner s expert and Respondents' expert, 

testified that it is guaranteed at the three gram dose 

to cause death.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's what they're --

they're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if --

or two grams or three grams; I thought it was three 

grams here. And I ended up thinking of course there is 

a risk of human error. There is a risk of human error 

generally where you're talking about the death penalty, 

and this may be one extra problem, one serious 

additional problem. But the question here is can we say 

that there is a more serious problem here than with 

other execution methods? I've read the studies. What 

else should I read?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the record 

references, which I think the record pretty clearly 

establishes, Your Honor, that death is certain to occur

through the use of thiopental at the three gram dose.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do with the 

euthanasia -- instead of talking -- I looked; I found it 

more important to look at what they do with euthanasia 

than to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and 

I was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just 

read to you. What am I supposed to do about that?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think to refer 

instead to the expert testimony in this case which says 

that death is certain to occur, and in addition, that 

medical testimony in this case that it is certain to 

occur in a very few minutes. Those are the transcript 

references that we provided at page 18 of the reply 

brief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That method has 

never been tried, correct.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it has never been tried 

on humans. That is correct. It is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know whether 

there are risks of pain accompanying that method?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think you do, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because by definition, barbituates cannot 

inflict pain and do not inflict pain.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The record 

establishes that the second drug that's used here is

used to prevent involuntary muscle contractions. That 

would not be -- there wouldn't be a safeguard against 

that under one drug protocol, I take it.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, yes there would, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because the reality is that 

thiopental and other barbituates are anti-convulsives. 

Their point is to -- among other things to suppress any 

involuntary muscle --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- do you 

agree that that is an appropriate problem to be 

addressed by the execution protocol, that they should 

try to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle 

contractions?

 MR. VERRILLI: No, because to the extent 

that the reason that they are offering to do it, is 

because of the potential for discomfort that it may 

cause the audience given the risk that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that their 

-- one of their reasons was that it would enhance the 

dignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also 

to the condemned.

 MR. VERRILLI: I understand that, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but given the extent to which it increases the 

risk that there can be ineffective anesthesia, and it 

can go undetected, it doesn't seem to us to be an

argument of sufficient force to justify using it despite 

that risk particularly when it seems to us that the 

issue of dignity can be addressed by communication with 

the audience.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do we do with 

the -- if you prevail here, and the next case is brought 

by someone subject to the single drug protocol and their 

claim is: Look this has never been tried. We do know 

that there's a chance that it would cause muscle 

contractions that would make my death undignified. It 

will certainly extend how long it takes to die, so I'm 

subject to a lingering death and the more humane 

protocol would be the three drug protocol?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think with respect to 

the lingering death point, I think it would, this 

Court's cases are talking about is the consciousness of 

lingering death and the torture that that imposes, which 

you wouldn't have of course in this situation. I don't 

think there is a credible argument that the use of a 

barbituate alone could inflict pain. They do not 

inflict any pain. Now, of course there are 

possibilities of maladministration, but not 

maladministration of a one drug protocol that results in 

any pain, and therefore there is just not a credible 

Eight Amendment argument. It seems to me that it

couldn't be cruel and unusual punishment, because there 

is no pain.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, I think 

that your main argument in this case, I mean, there's --

barbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the 

day, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main 

arguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate. 

So you were beginning to say what controls would be 

necessary to render this procedure constitutional, and 

one that you said -- trained personnel to monitor the 

flow.

 MR. VERRILLI: The monitor for anesthetic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. VERRILLI: To ensure that anesthetic 

depth has been achieved and maintained.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is --

MR. VERRILLI: That is correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Two questions: Who would 

the trained personnel be? And, the second question, 

what would be the measures that they would employ?

 MR. VERRILLI: The trained personnel could 

be a physician, a nurse or anyone trained by them 

adequately in this process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do we do about 

the point -- the point that the doctors or the nurses

say it's unethical to help with an execution? I mean, 

if we are going to talk about the constitutionality of 

the death penalty per se, that isn't raised in this 

case. And what the other side says is, well, you're 

just trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a 

procedure that can't be used.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the one point 

of the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate 

that we are not doing that. Beyond that, it seems to me 

that the State can't have it both ways with respect to 

the -- the issue of the participation of medically 

trained personnel. On the one hand, they cannot say 

that we have qualified medically able personnel 

participating in this process and that's our guarantee 

of its efficacy, and on the other hand say a requirement 

of having trained qualified personnel participate is 

impossible. And they do say that. For example the EMTs 

that participate in Kentucky are under the same ethical 

set of issues as doctors are.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you use those EMTs? 

Would they be qualified? Would the team that inserts 

the IV, would that team be qualified?

 MR. VERRILLI: With additional training they 

could be qualified. They aren't qualified by virtue of 

their training to become EMTs. They would have to be

additionally trained.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Verrilli, are we in the 

difficult position in hearing your answers that, in 

effect, we're being asked to make findings of fact about 

the availability of medical personnel and the 

feasibility of training and so on that the trial court 

never made because it didn't think it had to make a 

comparative analysis here, so that if, in fact, the 

comparative analysis is crucial to the case, we should 

send the thing back for factfinding by a trial judge 

rather than trying to do it here. Should we remand if 

we accept your argument?

 MR. VERRILLI: It is true Justice Souter 

that the trial court did not make factual findings on a 

whole range of issues with respect to the difficulties 

of constituting the proper dose, the risk of catheter 

placement, the risk of blowouts, the risk of mixing up 

syringes, and the adequacy of the monitoring. And I 

agree, Your Honor, that it did so because it didn't 

believe that that was particularly relevant to the issue 

before it. And that's the -- the basis of our 

disagreement with respect to the legal test.

 Now, it is -- it is our position that the 

record is sufficiently clear and sufficiently 

uncontradicted on the key points with particular respect

to monitoring that the Court would not have to remand 

but it certainly would be a reasonable thing to do in 

view of the deficiencies in the actual findings.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You were interrupted, and 

you gave Justice Ginsburg -- you said you have two 

problems for monitoring. She asked you who would do 

this and what measures would they use.

 MR. VERRILLI: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you were never able to 

get to the second.

 MR. VERRILLI: With respect to the second, 

it's a combination. They would use the available 

equipment, EKG and blood pressure cuff which is the 

standard practice used for monitoring for 

unconsciousness, but in addition, as the expert 

testimony in the case established, you have to have 

close -- close visual observation by the trained person.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to the cuff, I 

thought the record was rather clear that it is just not 

used at these low blood pressure levels.

 MR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy. There was some question about whether the 

third device that this monitor is used but the blood --

the tracking of blood pressure is a critical way of 

monitoring for unconsciousness as is the EKG and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, this is an 

execution, not surgery. The other side contends that 

you need to monitor the depth of the unconsciousness. 

When you expect to bring the person back and do not want 

harm to occur to the person. But they assert that to 

know whether the person is unconscious or not all it 

takes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's their contention.

 MR. VERRILLI: There is no slap in the face. 

There is no shaking the person. There's no testing of 

that kind whatsoever under the Kentucky protocol. So 

even under that understanding, which we don't think is 

correct, that -- we don't have that here and that's one 

of the problems. All there is, is visual observation by 

an untrained warden and an untrained deputy warden who 

had testified in this case that they don't know what to 

look for to determine whether somebody is conscious or 

unconscious.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: With regard to the trial 

court's failure to make findings about the availability 

of people to do this and about the possibility of --

practical possibility of more effective and less painful 

drugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you 

produced?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you introduce evidence 

to show that indeed medically trained personnel were 

readily available to do the things you say?

 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think we introduced 

evidence that medically trained personnel were ready 

available, but we did introduce evidence about what 

needed to be done and, of course, as I said, Kentucky 

like the other states had their ability to bring 

medically qualified personnel to bear to run this 

process. And so I do think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm very reluctant to send 

it back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide 

cessation of all executions while the trial court 

finishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to 

the State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could 

take years.

 MR. VERRILLI: I understand that, Your 

Honor, and that's why I suggest --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't want that to 

happen.

 MR. VERRILLI: That's why I suggested that 

there is -- that this case can be decided on the basis 

of the record here because the undisputed expert

the protocol.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you another 

question?

 MR. VERILLI: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask another question 

about the state of the evidence. It really goes to an 

understanding of your position that was discussed a 

little bit earlier about the preferability of simply 

barbiturate dose as opposed to the three-drug 

combination. You said a moment ago that the evidence 

was -- and I think it was undisputed evidence -- that 

three grams of the barbiturate actually used would be 

sufficient to cause death; is that correct.

 MR. VERRILLI: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that was undisputed?

 MR. VERRILLI: Each side's expert testified 

to precisely the same thing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. VERRILLI: Three grams was certain to 

cause death.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the current 

three-gram dosage were used and the second and third 

drugs were not administered, death would occur based on 

the undisputed evidence in this case.

 MR. VERRILLI: The record establishes that

death is certain.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Secondly, my understanding, 

my recollection, is that in a couple of places in your 

brief, one at least, you referred to the preferability 

of administering a, and I think the term was, massive 

dose of barbiturate, which I took to mean more than the 

three grams. Is that what you meant?

 MR. VERRILLI: No. Three grams is a massive 

dose.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That is the massive dose.

 MR. VERRILLI: But if one had any doubt 

about the certainty of the effect of causing death, one 

could always just increase the dose. But the record 

here is that three grams --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any evidence in 

the record about what the enhanced dose would 

appropriately be if you decided or if a protocol author 

decided that there would be no chance whatsoever that 

death would not occur, and the amount should be greater 

than three grams? Was there any evidence in the record 

about how much there ought to be if you were going to go 

above three grams?

 MR. VERRILLI: I'm not sure there's anything 

in the record, Your Honor. There is discussion in the 

amicus briefs about some other jurisdictions that have

gone as high as five grams.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the government has 

told us they do.

 MR. VERRILLI: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal response.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have objections 

that would apply even to your single drug protocol. You 

tell us that one reason this challenged protocol doesn't 

work is because people will mix the drugs in the wrong 

way, including the sodium pentathol. That objection 

would still be there if we adopted your alternative, 

wouldn't it?

 MR. VERRILLI: No, Mr. Chief Justice, 

because, as I've tried to say earlier, even if there is 

maladministration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm focusing 

specifically on the mixing of the drugs. The mixing of 

the sodium pentathol would be undertaken under the 

Kentucky procedure and under your proposed alternative, 

correct?

 MR. VERRILLI: That's correct. But the 

difference is if there's an error at that stage in the 

process and the execution proceeds, there may be a 

problem that needs to be fixed, but it will not be a 

problem that causes any pain, and that's the critical

difference because if it doesn't cause pain it can't be 

a cruel and unusual punishment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have been discussing 

this as though that is a constitutional requirement. 

Where does that come from, that you must find the method 

of execution that causes the least pain? We have 

approved electrocution, we have approved death by firing 

squad. I expect both of those have more possibilities 

of painful death than the protocol here. Where does 

this come from that in the, in the execution of a person 

who has been convicted of killing people we must choose 

the least painful method possible? Is that somewhere in 

our Constitution.

 MR. VERRILLI: We don't make the argument 

that States are required to choose the least painful 

method possible. Our standard is grounded on three, I 

think, extremely solid, well- established points of 

Eighth Amendment doctrine.

 The first one is this: The core concern of 

the Eighth Amendment at the time of its founding, of 

course, was precisely the question of whether the 

carrying out of death sentences would inflict torturous 

deaths. So we're at the core of the historical concern.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't agree with 

that. The concern was with torture, which is the

intentional infliction of pain. Now, these States, the 

three-quarters of the States that have the death 

penalty, all except one of whom use this method of 

execution, they haven't set out to inflict pain. To the 

contrary, they have introduced it presumably because 

they, indeed, think it's a more humane way, although not 

one that is free of all risk.

 MR. VERRILLI: That's the second principle, 

Your Honor, is that this Court's cases, including the 

ones that Your Honor averted to, have said that the 

standard is whether the means of execution inflicts 

unnecessary pain.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No --

MR. VERRILLI: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unnecessary and wanton, 

unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, the -- with all due 

respect, Wilkerson and Kemmler say "unnecessary pain." 

Resweber says "unnecessary pain and" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, you're changing 

your position. You said -- you just said earlier that we 

didn't have to find the least painful way.

least painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain, 

aren't you?

 MR. VERRILLI: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you rectify that?

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, because, Justice Scalia, 

our position is that the pain that is inflicted here 

when this goes wrong is torturous, excruciating pain 

under any definition. We're not talking about a slight 

increment different. We're talking about the infliction 

of torturous pain.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your position that 

every form of execution that has ever been used in the 

United States, if it were to be used today, would 

violate the Eighth Amendment?

 MR. VERRILLI: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, which form that's been 

used at some time in an execution would not violate?

 MR. VERRILLI: We would have to suggest it 

to the test that we are advocating, which it would --

whether there is a risk of torturous pain.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Hanging certainly would, 

right?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it would have to be 

subjected to the test.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a hard question?

Is that a hard question, whether hanging would, whether 

you had experts who understood the dropweight, you know, 

that was enough that it would break the neck?

 MR. VERRILLI: If there is a risk of 

torturous pain and if there are readily available 

alternatives that could obviate the risk, then any 

significant risk --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Hanging's no good. What 

about electrocution?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it would depend. The 

argument about electrocution, Justice Scalia, is whether 

or not it is painless, and that was its point when it 

was enacted, that it would be a painless form of death.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be, it has to be 

painless?

 MR. VERRILLI: It does not, but that was its 

point, and I think one would have to subject it to the 

test to see whether it inflicts severe pain that is 

readily avoidable by an alternative.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You have no doubt that the 

three judge protocol that Kentucky is using violates the 

Eighth Amendment, but you really cannot express a 

judgment about any of the other methods that has ever 

been used?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, electrocution may well.

But it would depend again, Your Honor. If it could be 

established that it was painless, that there wasn't a 

risk that it could go wrong in a way that inflicts 

excruciating pain then it would be upheld. If it 

couldn't, it wouldn't. That does seem a serious 

question. Obviously, the Court granted certiorari to 

consider it a few terms ago. But that would be the 

test, the mode of analysis here, and I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think you'd have to 

show it's unusual, not painless. I mean, cruel and 

unusual is what we're talking about. There's no 

painless requirement in there.

 MR. VERRILLI: There is an unnecessary pain 

requirement. There is also, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does this unnecessary 

pain requirement come from?

 MR. VERRILLI: From this Court's cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum in our cases, right?

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, it comes from this 

Court's cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum in our cases.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it seems to me it's 

more than that. And Pinetti is one case that shows it, 

because there's a case in which the Eighth Amendment 

forbid the execution of a person who was insane at the

time of execution. In that situation there is no intent 

on the part of the people carrying out the execution to 

inflict cruel and unusual punishment. This Court didn't 

require intent in Pinetti. In fact, it said something 

quite different, really the polar opposite. It said 

that the States have to have in place procedures to 

ensure that there wasn't an arbitrary infliction of the 

death penalty in that circumstance, without any 

requirement of intent.

 The Gregg-Woodson-Lockett cases don't have a 

requirement of intent, and the Kemmler and Wilkinson 

cases don't have a requirement of intent in them either. 

With respect to the "unusual" character of it, just 

drawing from the dictionary definitions that Your Honor 

posed in the Harmline case, this is unusual in precisely 

that way in that it is, if Your Honor will just bear me, 

it is such that does not occur in ordinary practice. So 

I do think it's unusual in that sense.

 And I'd like to reserve the balance of my 

time if I may.

please the Court:

 Mr. Verrilli and I agree that if the first 

drug is properly administered there will be a painless 

death. It is only if the first drug is not properly 

administered that there is any possible constitutional 

argument in this, in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you also agree with 

the counter- proposition that if it is not properly 

administered there is some risk of excruciating pain?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And do you agree that if 

that risk, say, occurred in every case, that it would 

violate the Eighth Amendment?

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.

 Because the administration of the first drug 

is so important, it is important to focus on the 

safeguards Kentucky has in place to make sure that the 

first drug is properly administered. Contrary to what 

Mr. Verrilli has suggested, Kentucky has excellent 

safeguards in place. Let me start with who, who puts in 

the IV line, which is the most critical step of the 

process. Kentucky uses what is probably literally the 

best qualified human being in the Commonwealth of 

Kentucky to place the IV line. It uses a phlebotomist 

who in her daily job works with the prison population.

The problems the prison population --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it this is obvious, 

but I wondered when I went through the brief. I assume 

this phlebotomist is not an MD?

 MR. ENGLERT: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the training? I 

mean, "phlebotomist" is somebody who works with veins, I 

take it. What is the training?

 MR. ENGLERT: The training is a certain 

amount of learning followed by on-the-job experience. 

This person places 30 needles a day in the prison 

population and at page 273 of the joint appendix it 

points out that she works in her daily job with the 

prison population. So what she is used to from many 

years of working with the prison population is the kind 

of problems of compromised veins we have in the inmate 

population specifically.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's somebody like the 

Red Cross worker who puts in the needle when somebody 

donates blood.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. It's someone 

like the person who inserts an IV in a hospital. The 

experts in this case all agreed that in a hospital 

setting IVs are not inserted by medical doctors, they 

are inserted by phlebotomists. That's what they do.

They teach medical residents how to insert IVs because 

doctors in training don't know how to do this. And it's 

what's somewhat derisively referred to as scut work in 

the hospital setting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, I thought 

that there wasn't a serious question about who inserts 

the IV, that those are trained people, but the point 

that was highlighted was that the people who control the 

flow into the IV connection, that those people have no 

training, the ones that are called executioners, the 

ones who operate the, what is it, the syringe.

 MR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, Kentucky has 

safeguards in place to make sure that the inmate is 

asleep before the second and third drugs are given. 

Now, with respect to those people's training, it's not 

accurate that they have no training. Kentucky has had 

one execution since 1998, since it adopted lethal 

injection, one execution altogether by lethal injection. 

It's had 100 practice sessions. Kentucky requires 

monthly practice sessions every month by the execution 

team because it is very concerned to get it right.

 Now, with respect to pushing the IV, those 

are people whose training is participation in the 

practice sessions, but to make sure that the first drug 

has had its intended effect, the warden and the deputy

warden are in the execution chamber. They are literally 

right on top of the inmate. It's suggested in the 

briefs that they're feet away. That's not accurate. 

The record reflects they are inches away.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they also are not 

trained people. I think what seems puzzling to me is 

the State has made an effort to make sure that the 

people on the team that inserts the IV, that those are 

well-trained professional people, but then apparently 

they leave the room, so that once the IV is inserted 

there is no professional person that has any further 

part.

 MR. ENGLERT: That's -- to say they leave 

the room is accurate, but the suggestion that they have 

no further part is misleading. They go into the next 

room. They watch through a one-way mirror, carefully 

watching to make sure nothing has gone wrong. They're 

in close proximity to the inmate and they are watching 

now with respect to the warden and deputy warden it's 

been suggested they don't know what to look for. That's 

false. The record shows otherwise. The main problem in 

the excuses that have gone wrong the main problem is an 

IV goes into tissue instead of the vein. If that 

happens, Dr. Dershowitz testified, pages 600 to 601 of 

the joint appendix the inmate would be awake and

screaming. The warden and the deputy warden know how to 

tell the difference between sun whose eye haves closed 

and who seems to have gone to sleep and someone who is 

awake and screaming. It's not just Dr. Dershowitz, it's 

Dr. Haas and Dr. Highland, pages 353 and 386 of the 

joint appendix also testified that this would be clear.

 Now, Mr. Verrilli says use a blood 

pressure monitor as a safeguard. Justice Kennedy said 

doesn't the record show that that's not of any use at 

very low blood pressures, and Justice Kennedy is exactly 

correct, at page 578 of the joint appendix. 

Dr. Dershowitz testified that the blood pressure cuff 

simply would have no usefulness in monitoring at this 

level of introduction of the barbituate.

 Mr. Verrilli has mentioned the one drug 

protocol at some length this morning and has said it is 

certain to cause death if three grams of sodium 

thiopental are administered. His expert, Dr. Heath, 

page 499 of the joint appendix, was asked let's assume 

that you don't take any other measures and gave a 

three-gram dose of sodium thiopental, what would you 

expect to happen? I would expect the blood pressure to 

drop. Would that kill them? No, I wouldn't expect it 

to cause death.

that a five gram administration of that drug would be 

fatal?

 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. There is 

nothing in this record --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not in the record, 

but it's in this document that we received the last few 

days, this long deposition of Dr. Dershowitz.

 MR. ENGLERT: Justice Stevens, let me be 

very precise in this answer, if I can. What is clear is 

that a rapidly administered three or five gram dose of a 

barbituate would cause death in normal circumstances.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if it doesn't, if you 

just administerED more of the drug, then what?

 MR. ENGLERT: That's problematic actually. 

This is all way outside the record.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.

 MR. ENGLERT: My understanding is that the 

human body can't take more than a certain amount of the 

barbituates, so it actually becomes problematic to go 

past five grams, which is why nobody comes goes higher 

than five grams.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you contend that the 

second drug in the three-drug protocol is necessary in 

order to make the execution effective?

 MR. ENGLERT: No, not effective.

unpleasant appearance of death, Your Honor.

for the second drug when it does, that is the drug that 

creates the risk of excruciating pain?

the risk of excruciating if and only if the first drug 

is improperly administered.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I understand that.

 MR. ENGLERT: And the justification is many 

safeguards are in place to make sure the first drug is 

properly administered so it doesn't create any real 

risk.

 And second, it does bring about a more 

dignified death, dignified for the inmate, dignified for 

the witnesses. It's not just --

outweighs the risk of excruciating pain?

excruciating pain outweigh the risk of an undignified

 MR. ENGLERT: A substantial risk of 

excruciating pain, a substantial risk of excruciating 

pain --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even a minimal risk. 

Everyone who goes through the process knows there is 

some risk of excruciating pain that could be avoided by 

a single-drug protocol.  Would he prefer to say, I want 

to die in a dignified way?

 MR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, if I may answer 

your question a little bit indirectly. That risk cannot 

be -- the risk of pain can be avoided by single drug 

protocol, but there's not a certain death with one drug 

protocol. It's also a very -- it takes a very long time 

to die with one drug protocol.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what's "very long? 

10 minutes?

 MR. ENGLERT: Again, your Honor, this is way 

outside the record. What Dr. Dershowitz --

protocol for animals because it's more humane than the

this but presumably that's because veterinarians told 

the state let slate our that was a good idea.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why was that necessary to 

pass a law if the standard veterinary practice was not 

to use T I'm obviously trying to get to what evidence we 

have here for a finding somewhere that we can take into 

consideration that there is a comparative benefit under 

the, under the veterinary practice as distinct from the 

protocol which has been devised so isn't it reasonable 

to suppose that the Kentucky legislature needs some kind 

of a finding came to some kind of a conclusion that in 

fact there was /SEUG deleterious about using the second 

drug.

 MR. ENGLERT: That much is reasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. ENGLERT: What's deleterious about using 

the second drug we all agree is if the first drug is 

mall administered it can cause main. If the first drug 

is not mall add /STEUPBer inned no pain, no pain in 

humans, no pain in an the mas the judgment was weighed 

not to use the second drug.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only cost correct me if 

I'm wrong but the only cost that you have identified in 

using the one drug only are number one, the appearance 

cost which you equated with dignity in your response to

Justice Stevens and number two, the possibility and I 

don't know how strong a possibility but the possibility 

that the one drug would not work. Is there any other 

cost? In using one drug.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes. The length of time it 

takes to die.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it you don't 

have a figure for that Justice Stevens said 10 minutes 

and I don't think you had a clear answer one way or the 

other as to whether there was likely to be more.

 MR. ENGLERT: If you go outside the record 

of this case in which the record wasn't allowed go into 

the Harbison record the logic I believe Dr. Dershowitz 

testified he would expect it to take 30 minutes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And 30 minutes is against 

some risk of excruciating pain is, that in effect is it 

reasonable to say 30 minutes is too long.

 MR. ENGLERT: Depends on how large the risk 

of excruciating pain S here there is very little 

evidence risk of excruciating pain.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is your point that there is 

simply no quantification of what that risk is.

 MR. ENGLERT: No. That is one of my points 

but that's not my whole point Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay what's your.

MR. ENGLERT: Take a look at speaking 

rhetorically, one can take a look at the so-called 

botched executions in this country the death penalty 

inform ace center website. The is called botched 

executions aren't excuses in which there was pain. They 

are excuses in which in the overwhelming majority one of 

three things happened. It took a long time Poretto find 

a vein and that's the only reason they say it was 

botched or the inmate showed muscle movements the exact 

same thing the poem poem poem prevents and with no 

evidence whatsoever there was no pain a/K-PLG those 

/PHOUFPLTs the experts on the other side suggest those 

are botched excuses or somebody made a human error and 

didn't get the /SRAEUB properly. You don't need medical 

training to tell when the guy says it's not working that 

it hasn't gone into the vein.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the nub of your argument 

really is they have not made a case or they do not have 

a record case for any significant likelihood of 

excruciating pain is this.

 MR. ENGLERT: That's correct. Beyond the 

absolute bare minimum likelihood that is inherent in any 

process that involves human beings. They agriculture 

mixing of the drugs is a problem. There is a finding of 

fact to the contrary by the district court well

supported by evidence. They argue that the placing of 

the IVs is a problem Kentucky really doesn't have the 

best qualified person in the state to place the IVs, 

they argue that there is a risk because the people 

watching don't know what to look for. All they need to 

look for is swelling, whether the person is awake, 

that's noticeable to a lay observer. They argue that 

the personnel monitoring the execution are not 

sufficiently close which is false. The warden is itch 

muches away. That's the testimony --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's still unclear why 

they should make such an effort to get trained personnel 

in the first instance and then even if they are in the 

next room, why isn't, why did they deliberately pick 

nonprofessional people to both administer the drugs and 

to check the inmate for consciousness.

 MR. ENGLERT: There are reasons for that 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the reasons.

 MR. ENGLERT: Okay. To administer the drugs 

the only trained personnel, the only so-called trained 

personnel are the people who are barred by the AMA 

ethics requirements and by Kentucky law from 

administering the drugs. Doctors and nurses. As to --

team and it seems that they would be preferable to 

executioner who have no professional qualifications.

 MR. ENGLERT: The expert team the people who 

have had 100 practice sessions since the last execution 

are administering the drugs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean the people who 

administer the -- who place the IV lines.

 MR. VERRILLI: They have -- they have zero 

expertise in pushing drugs. They have expertise in 

placing the line. They have expertise in finding a 

vein. They have no more experience pushing drugs than 

the person who pushes the drugs.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Englert, can I ask you 

a rather basic question? Do you think the 

constitutionality of the three-drug protocol itself is 

at issue in this case or merely the question whether 

Kentucky has done an adequate job of using that 

protocol?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, I think what's properly 

before the Court is only the latter question. But 

obviously --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So if we just decide this 

on the ground -- and the record is very persuasive in 

your favor, I have to acknowledge -- but if we decide 

the fact that Kentucky is doing an adequate job of

administering this protocol, that would leave open the 

question whether the basic use of this second drug, 

which does nothing but avoid unpleasantness of the 

visitors, is itself constitutional?

 MR. ENGLERT: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have to wait for 

another case to decide that rule?

 MR. ENGLERT: I -- the Court could write an 

opinion either way, obviously. There is a good reason 

to hold that the use of the second drug is permissible.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I -- to be very 

honest with you, I think that you're -- you make a very 

strong case on the administration in Kentucky on the 

record in this case, but I'm terribly troubled by the 

fact that the second drug is what seems to cause all the 

risk of excruciating pain, and seems to be almost 

totally unnecessary in terms of any rational basis for a 

requirement.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that we're not going 

to be able to decide today.

 MR. ENGLERT: Petitioner's own brief 

acknowledges that the three-drug protocol can be applied 

constitutionally. Judge Fogel in the Morales case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It may have been in this 

very case, it may be. But that leaves often a whole 

other area of litigation, is what troubles me.

 MR. ENGLERT: Every State that has publicly 

said what it uses, uses the three-drug protocol. It 

would be very strange to hold that that is cruel and 

punishment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But no legislature has 

ever required it, as I understand it.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, no. 14 legislatures have 

required it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The three-drug protocol?

 MR. ENGLERT: The three-drug protocol.

 Justice Ginsburg, back to your question. 

There is a reason why the IV team members leave the 

room. The curtains are opened after the IVs are placed, 

and the people in the room can be seen by the victim's 

families, by the inmate's families and by the media. 

Protecting the anonymity of the execution team is 

extremely important. They are subject to all kinds of 

pressures if their anonymity is not protected. So 

instead of staying in the room, they go again behind a 

one-way mirror in an adjacent room where they have an 

extremely good line of sight to the IVs. This is 

actually covered in the trial record in this case, that

they do have a good line of sight. And it's not --

nothing really changes because they go into another 

room. Pages 210 and 286 to 287 of the joint appendix is 

where there is testimony that the people in the adjacent 

room do have a good view of the IV line.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the executioners are 

also not visible to the public?

 MR. ENGLERT: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a finding that 

the second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.

 MR. ENGLERT: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --

MR. ENGLERT: We don't quarrel with that. 

The purpose it serves is the purpose of dignifying the 

process for the benefit of the inmate and for the 

benefit of the witnesses.

 The Chief Justice said, isn't there going to 

be litigation against another protocol as soon as it's 

adopted, and yes, Mr. Verrilli will say that's silly, to 

protect the dignity of the inmate, that argument will 

fail. But the history of death penalty litigation 

suggests that the next advocate who comes along 

representing an inmate will say, the one drug protocol 

is no good because it doesn't do enough to protect the 

dignity, or the two drug protocol is no good because it

doesn't do enough to protect dignity.

 With respect to the time it takes to carry 

out an execution and whether that's a legitimate 

consideration, I actually invite the Court's attention 

to one of the briefs, amicus briefs, filed in support of 

Petitioners, the Human Rights Watch brief, which in turn 

cites the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee in 

the NG case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if we held that that 

justification was insufficient to justify this protocol, 

it's hardly likely we would hold that it's so serious 

and make the whole procedure unconstitutional.

 MR. ENGLERT: I'm not sure I follow the 

question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The interest in protecting 

the dignity of the inmate and of the observers is the 

justification for the second drug.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If we held that that --

that that justification is insufficient to justify the 

protocol, how could we ever hold that that justification 

is so serious as to make the whole procedure 

unconstitutional.

 MR. ENGLERT: I'll tell you frankly how you 

could hold that. What will happen in the next case is

they will say: This issue wasn't raised in the trial 

court in Kentucky, therefore the Supreme Court decided 

this case on an inadequate factual record, and therefore 

the Court should take a new look at it because life and 

death are at stake.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably it 

would depend upon whatever new alternative the plaintiff 

in that case proposed.

 MR. ENGLERT: Correct. If the standard is 

truly eliminating all unnecessary risk of pain than 

anything that is not the single optimal standard is 

unconstitutional, and the States cannot do what they 

have done for the last 220 years, which is to use 

different protocols at different times and work to 

improve their protocols. Thank you.

pain free when followed and to order the State of 

Kentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in 

any execution and is out of step with the laws and 

practice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the 

United States. The proposed constitutional standard 

that Petitioners say requires this extraordinary result 

has several fundamental flaws.

 First, it is at odds with this Court's 

precedence establishing a substantial risk threshold for 

claims of future injury in the Eighth Amendment context 

and this Court's cases holding that the added anguish 

caused by the negligent, accidental or inadvertent 

infliction of pain is not the unnecessary infliction of 

pain prescribed by the Eighth Amendment. Justice 

Marshall wrote that for the Court in the Estelle v. 

Gamble opinion on page 105, and this Court has 

reiterated the principle that negligent, accidental or 

inadvertent infliction of pain, however strong or 

anguishing, is not proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the 

response which I think was in the briefs that the 

substantiality requirement has been derived in the 

course of conditions of confinement -- sort of 

litigation -- and we really should regard execution as 

sort of a -- a separate subject for purposes of coming

up with a standard. What do you say to that?

 MR. GARRE: A few things. We are here today 

in this Section 1983 action, because this Court and the 

Hill case and the Nelson case analogized methods of 

execution claims to conditions of confinement claims 

insofar as these claims are not directed to the 

punishment itself, but to the manner in which punishment 

is implemented or carried out. So this Court itself 

under the Hill and Nelson case put these types of cases 

into the conditions of confinement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we did for purposes 

of making a habeas 1983 distinction, but I -- is the 

distinction supportable when we come down to the 

question whether there should be a standard specific to 

execution as opposed to other conditions?

 MR. GARRE: I don't think it is, Justice 

Souter. The substantial risk standard that the Court 

has applied in the Farmer v. Brennan case and the Hiland 

v. McKinney case -- applied to conditions of 

confinement claims -- where inmates faced the risk of an 

excruciating pain or even death. If the risk -- if the 

standard that the Court applies to someone who is forced 

to spend -- to live with a five pack a day smoker is 

substantial risk, even though that person faces the risk 

of developing lung cancer, which everybody would agree

is excruciatingingly painful death they're not sure why 

the Constitution would place any different standard with 

respect to the types of claims at issue in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any comparative 

element in the substantial risk standard, if it were 

clearly established, undisputed that there was an 

alternative method that was much less risky, would there 

be an Eighth Amendment problem with the State or the 

Federal government nevertheless persisted in using a 

method that was inferior?

 MR. GARRE: We think that that could be part 

of the analysis -- that you would look to other feasible 

available alternatives. Although I would say that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's part of the 

analysis, this never ends.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's part of the 

analysis, there will always be some claim that there is 

some new method that's been devised, and once again 

executions are stayed throughout the country.

 MR. GARRE: And we agree with that, and 

that's why we think that Petitioner's claim is wrong. 

It's going to lead to endless litigation and a regime in 

which there is no finality. The other point I wanted to 

make, in response to Justice Alito, is that as a

threshold matter, this court case is establishing that 

you have to show with respect to the method you're 

challenging, a risk that is more than the risk of 

negligence or accident in the method that is being 

carried out. And again, Estelle v. Gamble establishes 

that, Farmer v. Brennan reiterates that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're standard is that 

there has -- well, don't let me misphrase it for you, 

but there have to be other obvious available 

alternatives.

 MR. GARRE: Well, the way that we've 

described it, Justice Kennedy, is you that have to show 

a substantial risk that the method you're challenging 

would impose a considerably greater degree of pain than 

other available feasible alternatives. But to get into 

that kind of comparative inquiry, we do think that you 

have to get over the first threshold established by this 

Court's cases -- that you're arguing about something 

other than the accidental or negligent infliction of 

pain, and we don't think Petitioners in this case have 

even gotten over that hurdle.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your safeguard one is 

the only -- you have against Justice Scalia, endless 

litigation, or does your threshold two do the same 

thing.

MR. GARRE: Well, threshold two would as 

well because once you're into that kind of comparative 

inquiry you would still have to take a look at the 

feasible other alternative and no one has ever tried the 

one drug alternative. Justice Breyer you're right we 

don't know whether it's going to work in practice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Those who oppose capital 

punishment entirely across the board are quite willing 

to take a careful look at everything. They are quite 

willing to take a look at other alternatives. That's 

the problem we come up with a decision that requires a 

careful look in every case whenever there is a newly 

developed method of execution the problem will always be 

before us and executions will always be impermissible. 

We agree with those concerns, Justice Scalia, I want to 

be clear. Our standard is not a least risk --

JUSTICE BREYER: You have to, I mean, I 

can't, I don't know if "substantial" is the right word 

to capture it. Perhaps the right word is is there a 

significant risk that can be easily averted and what I'm 

worried about here is do we or do we not send it back, 

I'm quite honestly disturbed by the fact that in this --

I can't report they both recommend pancuronium and that 

the sodium thiopental doesn't work not even in grams of 

three doses in all cases but they think the contrary and

if there is uncertainty here should we send it back for 

consideration of all these things in a more full hearing 

under a standard that does allow comparisons with other 

methods not to find a comparison not too fine a 

comparison but at least a practical comparison.

 MR. GARRE: And the answer is no. First and 

foremost they had an opportunity to develop the one drug 

alternative below. They made no effort to present any 

evidence on that. The record is completely undeveloped 

and typically this court doesn't allow people to go back 

and relitigate a case again.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes but if we don't do 

something like that in this case Mr. Garre another case 

is going to come along and we are going to be right back 

here a year from now or 18 months from now and wouldn't 

it be better to get one case litigated thoroughly and 

get the issue decided rather than simply wait here for 

another one to wind its way.

 MR. GARRE: We think that this court should 

decide the issue. We think it should decide it by 

saying Petitioners have not established a 

constitutionally significant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure but if we decide it on 

this basis the next Petitioner is going to say I'm

present and therefore we are going to have a new case 

and new round of litigation and I think what's 

disturbing Justice Breyer what's disturbing me and 

others is we want some kind of a decision here, and it 

seems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it 

if comparison analysis is appropriate and I will be 

candid to say I think it is is to send this case back 

and say okay do a comparative analysis, make the 

findings and we will then have a case that will in 

effect resolve the issue as much as one case can ever 

do.

 MR. GARRE: Let me make two responses to 

that if I could again we don't think Petitioners have 

shown anything close to a substantially of risk and 

second a virtue in allowing there is a virtue in not 

going further in this case and allowing the states 

themselves to continue to assess this matter. The 

states have continuously reassessed and repeated 

modifications to their lethal injection protocols three 

states within the last years have taken major internal 

reviews of the three drug protocol California Tennessee 

and Florida they have all concluded that additional 

safeguards were warranted but that --

that comparison with other possibilities is not

necessary so long as the only risk that is coming is a 

risk of negligence or improper execution of what, of 

what the protocol requires right?

 MR. GARRE: That would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that so long, 

so long as the only risk comes from negligent 

application of the protocol, no comparison is required?

 MR. GARRE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if we decided that, if 

we decided that if this protocol is properly executed, 

it does not create a substantial risk that would be the 

end of the matter wouldn't it.

 MR. GARRE: That would be the end of the 

matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we would not have 

another case in front of us next year.

 MR. GARRE: That's probably true. There is 

no shortage of imagination on the death penalty 

advocates that have brought those kinds of claims but a 

decision along those lines would go a great way to 

providing greater clarity and certainly in this area.

Government concluded that that was an appropriate dosage 

to ensure a deep consciousness among the condemned 

inmate. Other jurisdictions have picked three grams and 

I would say that the Federal Government is currently 

considering whether five or three is the correct dosage. 

But the Federal Government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you mean to say 

unconsciousness.

 MR. GARRE: Unconsciousness, yes to render 

the inmate deeply unconscious for a number of hours 

that's established by the record thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Garre. 

Mr. Verrilli, you have three minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. 

The risk here is real that is why in the State of 

Kentucky it's unlawful to euthanize animals in the way 

that carries out its executions that's true not only 

with the use of pancuronium one cannot use potassium 

unless someone trained in ensuring effective anesthesia 

is participating in the process and what that is is a 

marker that this is a real danger sufficiently real that

it's not tolerated with animals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the anesthesia 

concern of course is you don't want to kill the person 

when you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery 

so you would want somebody trained there that you could 

bring them back if anything went wrong that concern is 

not present here.

 MR. VERRILLI: Nor is it present with 

respect to euthanizing animals and never the -- it's the 

danger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a 

torturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians to 

say you have to have somebody in the process who is 

trained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice 

Breyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point 

my understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a 

doctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who 

administers this whole process and so the risk is 

dramatically different in a situation where you have 

that trained person there than the situation we have in 

Kentucky now with respect to the other states and the 

other so-called botched executions that my friend 

Mr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that 

they were all about cut downs and small problems. The 

record finds a fact in the Morales case without respect 

to the 11 lethal injection studies there six out of the

seven were inadequately -- the experts in that case 

admitted it was likely that one was not likely an at the 

time -- at the time that the pancuronium and potassium 

were put in the system similarly in the case in North 

Carolina the evidence credited by the court was that 

with respect to four of them the condemned inmate was on 

the -- any gasping struggling not the kind of 

involuntary twitching that Mr. Englert is worried about 

but clear that the anesthetics are not working with 

respect to the lethality of thiopental at page 42 of the 

joint appendix Dr. Heath says that thiopental will be 

lethal by itself three grams at page 494 he says indeed 

it will be lethal by itself in virtually every case at 

two grams. At page, at page forgive me I don't have the 

page number reference handy but Dr. Dershowitz the 

state's expert says the same thing now the reference 

that Mr. Englert referred to at page 499 is where 

Dr. Heath is being a asked a question of whether would 

you expect death to occur when three grams are 

administered but he is being asked a series of questions 

about administration in a surgical procedure which are 

using ventilators and other procedures to keep the 

person alive and he said in that setting the answer is 

no so that's just not a fair representation of the 

record at all now with respect to the question of

whether we ought to analogize this to the deliberate 

indifference standard and convictions of confinement 

cases it seems to me there is a fundamental difference 

here which is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is 

making a deliberate choice here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

sentence.

 MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

A deliberate choice here to use chemicals that create 

this danger and given that it has done so it ought to 

have the commensurate obligation to take the reasonable 

steps necessary to on vote the risk.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
