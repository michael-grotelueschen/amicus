 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-969, Federal Election 

Commission versus Wisconsin Right to Life, and Case 

06-970, Senator McCain versus Wisconsin Right to Life.

 General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 In McConnell against FEC this Court upheld 

Title II's restrictions on electioneering communications 

by unions and corporations against facial attack. In 

doing so, this Court reviewed a voluminous record and 

concluded that the vast majority of the ads that had 

been run in previous cycles and came within the 

statutory definition could constitutionally be regulated 

by Congress. Accordingly, this Court rejected the 

overbreadth challenge and upheld the statute on it face. 

To be sure, the last time this case was before the Court 

the Court made clear that nothing in McConnell 

foreclosed an opportunity for as-applied challenges to 

the statute and the Court remanded the case for that 

purpose. But to be consistent with McConnell's

overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot 

have the effect of calling into question a substantial 

percentage of the statute's applications. Yet the 

district court's decision below has precisely that 

forbidden effect.

 There is nothing atypical about the three 

ads that are before this Court. Indeed, they closely 

resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court 

identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that, 

although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless 

were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we were wrong last 

time.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously 

you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in 

McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that 

decision -- I mean, that's an option the Court can take 

in the appropriate case.

 I would suggest that this is not the 

appropriate case for a number of reasons, not the least 

of which is that I think it was briefed in this case 

really as something of an afterthought, not as a 

principal focus of the briefing. In the McConnell case 

this Court, as you well remember, had an unbelievably

exhaustive record before it in making a judgment about 

the facial constitutionality of the law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have a 

concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions 

of the other side are very appealing as far as the 

rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad, 

even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for 

election within, within 90 days. We didn't that have 

appealing case before us. Now that we have it before us 

and now that you tell us that this is a typical case, 

maybe we were wrong about the overbreadth challenge 

before.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, I don't 

think you were. And although you didn't have this case 

before you, you had many, many concrete cases before you 

that are really indistinguishable from this case. You 

had the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How are we supposed 

to decide whether this case -- if you think it's 

important to our resolution, how are we supposed to 

decide whether this particular case is typical or not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I guess it's hard 

for me to say how you would decide whether it's typical. 

I'm not sure that's the question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's very

hard to determine. Therefore, I think it's hard to 

determine in the abstract whether its inconsistent with 

the conclusion in McConnell that a vast majority of the 

cases would not be covered or if it's inconsistent with 

it.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

let me try to come at it this way, which is to say I 

would have thought that if you're not going to overturn 

McConnell, you're just going to apply it and say, well, 

what kind of as-applied challenges are left, I would 

have thought that what you would have in mind is ads 

that had an identifiable characteristic that marked them 

as being outside of the mainstream and somehow different 

from most of the ads. And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets back to my 

same question: How do we know that this is or is not 

outside the mainstream. We have just the three ads that 

are at issue here. It's not as if we have a survey of 

all the ads that are run during the blackout periods in 

particular election cycles. How do we tell whether this 

is within the mainstream or not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: One strong indicator that 

these are in the mainstream is how close they are to the 

Jane Doe hypothetical that this Court identified as the 

prototype of the kind of ads that, although they took

the form of issue ads, they looked like issue ads, they 

really were indistinguishable from and the functional 

equivalent of express advocacy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, that 

Jane Doe ad was in the record last time. They were 

others, weren't there, the issue ads?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: There were hundreds. I 

mean, as you well remember, there were hundreds of ads 

in the record. And this Court was able to draw 

conclusions about them both by looking at some of the 

specifics, but also looking at the forest, if you will. 

One of the things they recognized, for example, is that 

these ads weren't turning up uniformly wherever issues 

were being debated. These ads turning up in the close 

elections, in the close races. And there was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the Court 

in McConnell used the term, as you've used it this 

morning, "vast majority." What is that? Is 70 percent 

a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going 

to be outside of that and would be candidates for this 

as-applied challenge?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, no, Mr. Chief Justice, 

because the Court used "vast majority," and I mean, that 

could mean 70 percent, it could mean 80 percent, it 

could mean 90 percent. Equally importantly, on page 207

of the opinion, when it was specifically addressing 

overbreadth, it made the argument, it made the 

conclusion, that both in absolute and relative terms 

this statute was not substantially overbroad.

 And it seems to me then at a minimum for any 

as-applied challenge to be consistent with that 

overbreadth determination, it can't have the effect of 

opening up the statute wide open such that on a going 

forward basis the majority, certainly a substantial 

number, percentage, inconsistent with an overbreadth 

holding, of the ads that would be run by unions and 

corporations within the last 60 days of the election 

would qualify for the exception. That just seems 

inconsistent with the overbreadth holding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, did that statement 

refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It referred to all ads 

that would come within the statutory prohibition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and here we are 

dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads. 

So that statement doesn't necessarily speak to whether, 

you know, a vast majority of all issue ads have to be --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But with respect, 

Justice Scalia, there were so many issue ads in the 

record in McConnell that if issue ads were an

appropriate category for as-applied challenges, it would 

have been impossible for this Court to reject the 

overbreadth burden.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know if that's so. 

So long as that statement applied to the totality of 

ads, many of which were ads just directed at defeating 

particular candidates, I don't see how you can see that 

we're bound by that statement.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, the 

only other obvious candidate that we could carve out 

would be express advocacy. And the Court was clear in 

footnote 18 of the opinion what percentage that was, 4 

to 5 percent. So as to the 95 percent of the ads that 

didn't engage in express advocacy, this Court still had 

no difficulty concluding that the vast majority of them 

were within Congress' conception of the purposes of the4 

statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Everything that is not 

express advocacy is an issue ad? The world is divided 

into express advocacy and issue ads?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's one way to divide 

it. You're using the term "issue ad."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't divide it that 

way. I would think there are a lot of express advocacy 

ads. I think there are a lot of non-express advocacy

ads that are not issue ads.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, you're use 

the term "issue ad" as if it's self-defining. I don't 

view it that way. And I mean, even Appellee has tried 

to narrow it to grassroots lobbying. Now, of course 

there's a problem with the grassroots lobbying argument 

and that is it was made to this Court in McConnell, and 

at that time the nature of the argument wasn't, oh, 

grassroots lobbying, that's a sort of idiosyncratic or 

atypical application that would give rise to a narrow 

as-applied exception.

 No, the argument there, and a great 

illustration is Appellee's national affiliate, National 

Right to Life. At pages 6 and 7 of the reply brief in 

McConnell, they argued about grassroots lobbying and 

said, boy, this statute applies to grassroots lobbying, 

therefore it's substantially overbroad.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're suggesting 

the district court decision is not consistent with 

McConnell. But it seems that your approach today is 

inconsistent with our decision last year that you can 

have as-applied challenges. You're suggesting that if 

we allow this as-applied challenge to go forward that we 

have to facially strike down the section.

not saying that. My point is that not all as-applied 

challenges are created equal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So tell me what one, 

an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge 

looks like, or what the standard would be that we would 

apply in a way that you think would not call into 

question the decision in McConnell about Section 203?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, let me give you a 

couple of as -- I mean, look, my job is to defend the 

constitutionality of the statute on its face and as 

applied. So I'm not suggesting that any of these 

as-applied challenges would necessarily success or I 

wouldn't be up here trying to make some argument in 

defense of the statute.

 But let me give you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you're saying, 

though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're 

saying the only way we can do that is if we think that 

the statute is facially unconstitutional. I'm just 

trying to see if there's a way of --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- approaching this 

as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to 

revisit that prior --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't your case, with 

me at least, for you to tell us that it is your job to 

say that no as-applied challenge will suffice.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well then, let me give you 

an --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that doesn't 

inspire me with confidence in what you're telling us.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Let me give you some 

inspirational as-applied challenges that would be better 

as-applied challenges than this one. A challenge by a 

501(c)(3) corporation that has difficulty separating up 

a separate segregated fund. Much better as-applied 

challenge. The challenge that was brought in the Maine 

case that you have before you in another -- in another 

petition or another appeal, that was a challenge to an 

ad that was run in an unopposed primary. That starts to 

sound like a pretty good as-applied challenge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. There is -- there is a 

claim here that there -- that there was difficulty in 

setting, setting up a fund in time to do what had to be 

done with respect to this issue, which was a distinctive 

issue that had come up and they said we didn't have time 

to set up a - a - a - a separate PAC that, that would 

effectively meet the problem. Why isn't that 

distinctive enough?

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, 

Justice Scalia, it would be a better case if that were 

the claim. There's no doubt that appellee has a, a PAC, 

a separate segregated fund.  To their claim isn't that 

they didn't have one. Their claim is it was underfunded 

vis a vis what it would cost to fund these ads. But 

that itself is clearly a conscious decision, because if 

you look at how much money they had in their PAC in 

2000, they had 155,000 or something like that in their 

PAC. Plenty to pay for this ad. This time around they 

had 13,000. Now why is that? It's pretty clear from 

the record that they shifted their emphasis not to 

getting money for their PAC, but to get money in their 

general corporate treasury to fund these ads. And so 

they raised 300 million dollars in corporate funds. But 

that's not hat doesn't make this a good as-applied 

challenge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I, can I 

understand you to suggest we ought to draw a distinction 

in as-applied challenges between a 501(c)(3) 

organization and a corporation?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is not a 

501(3)(3) corporation?

501(c)(3) corporation has a much better as-applied 

challenge if they can bring it. And that's the 

as-applied challenge that's sort of been discussed in 

some of the amicus briefs. The problem is Appellee is 

not in a position to do that, because they are a 

501(c)(4) corporation. Another example of a better 

challenge would be the Chief Justice's hypothetical from 

the earlier argument which would be a corporation that 

runs a series of ads and then wants to continue to run 

them during the election cycle.

 Well, that's not guilty this case, but it 

well could be. The filibuster issue isn't something 

that came like a bolt out of the blue on the eve of the 

election. Throughout 2003, there were filibusters in 

the Senate on a pretty regular basis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We all -- we all know --

maybe -- I think, I think it's accepted, that the public 

only tunes in to the political dialogue shortly before 

the election. That's the time in which you -- in which 

you reach the public. So the fact that the filibuster 

has been going on for a long time is -- I don't think 

answers the question as to how speech can be the most 

effective.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

don't see -- you may be right that certainly people do

tend to focus on issues in the context of an election. 

But I think the record in this case does not bear out 

the conclusion that people only care about them at those 

times or that groups don't bother running ads at other 

times. I mean if you look at the 2005 time frame, the 

record reflects that a number of groups, not Appellee, 

but a number of groups had issue ads addressing the 

filibuster issue. And what's interesting about that to 

me is if you look at joint appendix 45 and 46 for the 

examples they were able to do it in terms of tag line, 

"Earth, call the Senate." And if, if Appellee had run 

those same ads which would capture the issue, then they 

wouldn't even have come within the statute. So it does 

illustrate both that this is an issue that drew enough 

public interest to generate ads at different time 

periods, not just in the reelection context, and even 

when did it that, it was possible to engage on the issue 

without coming within the confines of the statute. So 

it just seems like --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are, are there frequent 

issues -- instances in the political process, do you 

think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a 

candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win 

anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very

difficult. But they want to run the ad anyway in order 

to affect his conduct or her conduct once they're 

reelected, so that they'll take a different position, a 

second look.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me 

logically that's possible. I just don't know if that, 

if that happens very often.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, it's 

certainly possible. I don't think it's common, though. 

And the reason I say that is just to go back to the 

record in McConnell, the one thing the record there made 

pretty clear is when you got to the period 60 days 

before the election, these ads were not being ran in a 

way that would have some random distribution that you 

might expect if they were just interested in the issues 

or just interested uniformly in all reelections. These 

ads were really concentrated in the close districts. I 

mean one of the lines that stick out in my mind from the 

record is in trying to fund money for these so-called 

issue ads, the Club for Growth executives said "we need 

money for these issue ads because they make all the 

difference in close elections."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well now -- but -- yes, it 

may make the difference in a close election but it is

also, it is also likely to be more effective with regard 

to the Senator that you -- whose vote you want on the 

issue. Are you, are you going to waste your, waste your 

money in, in those districts where the Senator is not 

going to vote the way you want no matter what? The 

situation you pose is precisely the one where you would 

want your issue ad to run.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, if 

your point is that there may be an interest in trying to 

leverage the upcoming election to get somebody's 

attention --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: To get the Senator's 

attention.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Senator who is, who is 

at risk is likely, is likely to listen. The Senator who 

has a safe seat is not.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No doubt that's true. But 

I think it also implicates the, the interests of 

Congress in the statute that this Court recognized and 

upheld on its face. When, when the whole point is, 

we're not just interested in this issue in the abstract, 

and we're not running this issue just because there's a

pending vote in Congress; we're interested in running 

this ad because it's a pretty effective vehicle both to 

defeat this candidate's reelection chances, but if we 

don't succeed on that maybe we'll convince him to change 

his mind.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't tell which of the 

two they had in mind. Whether they wanted the Senator 

defeated or they wanted to put enough pressure on the 

Senator that he would change his vote with regard to the 

filibuster. I would think that the latter is more 

likely the motive than the former. And why do you 

assume the worst?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- I don't know, the 

fact that by the time they ran these ads Senator 

Feingold voted 20 times out of 20 to filibuster suggests 

to me that they probably concluded that the best to get 

a Wisconsin Senator who wouldn't filibuster was to 

change senators not to change to change Senator 

Feingold's mind.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The relevance of this 

same group having a poll strongly opposed Feingold every 

time he ran for election. It's no secret that they were 

opposed to his candidacy.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No. That's absolutely 

right, Justice Ginsburg. And obviously the statute

itself in its bright line test doesn't make you get into 

those kind of inquiries. But if their claim, if they 

come into court and say well, we had a pure heart; we 

didn't have an intent to affect the election --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But this is -- this is the 

First Amendment. We don't make people guess whether 

their speech is going to be allowed by Big Brother or 

not. If you are going to cut off the speech, there 

ought to be a clear line. Not whether -- whether I, I 

had ads against Feingold in the past or whether Feingold 

voted 20 times against this or, or half of the time 

against this. It seems to me you need a clear First 

Amendment line. And you're not giving us any.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure I am, Justice Scalia. 

I'm giving you the statute, on its face, which couldn't 

be clearer. If you want to have as-applied exceptions, 

if you want to go down the road, to quote the Chief 

Justice in dissent in MCFL, of creating "barely 

adumbrated exceptions," you may inject some vagueness. 

Now that may be necessary. And there may be as-applied 

challenges out there that do the trick without creating 

vagueness. But I don't think this is the one. And just 

because the first as-applied challenge you see is a 

problematic one doesn't mean this aren't better 

as-applied challenges out there.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN,

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, ET AL.

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 I'd like to -- I'd like to address three 

points that came up at the earlier part of the argument. 

First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect 

correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions. 

Then I would like to address the two questions that I 

think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we 

know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the 

standard -- what standard would a court apply in 

adjudicating as-applied challenges?

 And then finally, assuming there's time 

permitting I'd like to address the question of why we 

shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both 

by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia.

 First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia, 

and it relates to what the predicate was of the now 

famous vast majority reference. I'm quoting from --

it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I

believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue 

ads. In fact, what this Court said was the precise 

percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a 

candidate and were aired during those relatively brief 

pre-election time spans but had no electioneering 

purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and 

among the judges on the district court. Nevertheless, 

the "vast majority" of ads clearly had such a purpose.

 Chief Justice ROBERTS: Is that, is that 

your test, if it has any electioneering purpose?

 MR. WAXMAN: We think the test is whether or 

not it is as this Court indicated, I think, whether it's 

the functional equivalent of express advocacy. It 

doesn't use the magic words but does it have the same 

effect, that is, the test that this Court should -- not 

this Court, a district court adjudicating an as-applied 

challenge that is based on the content of the ad not the 

sort of as-applied challenge brought in MCFL or Brown 

versus the Socialist Workers Parties that relate to the 

nature of the speaker, but one that's based on the 

content requires the challenger to show okay, in a 

context of a statute that is facially valid and can 

constitutionally be applied to the vast majority of ads 

that are covered by the definition of electioneering 

communications, he needs to come in and show that with

respect to this ad, it has characteristics such that no 

reasonable voter could view it as promoting, attacking, 

supporting or opposing a candidate.

 Chief Justice ROBERTS: Do we, do we usually 

place the burden when we're applying strict scrutiny 

under the First Amendment on the challenger to prove 

that they're allowed to speak, as opposed to the 

Government to prove -- to carry the burden that they can 

censor the speech?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, you -- I think the rule 

is quite clear that you never do that. This strict 

scrutiny clearly applies here. But in the context of 

a -- the application of a statute that has already been 

upheld as facially constitutional in the vast majority 

of applications, the Government doesn't have the burden 

of reconvincing the district court the -- what the --

the very things that the Supreme Court has already 

decided.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That vast majority thing, 

is that a -- was that the holding of the case? I mean 

MR. WAXMAN: It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Every -- every -- every 

word that we it uttered in that prior case is law? I

court free to think that maybe it is really not the vast 

majority? But just because we said vast majority, it is 

like writing it into the statute?

 MR. WAXMAN: It's -- well, we would have an 

awful lot of laws if everything you wrote constituted 

law and a holding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MR. WAXMAN: But that statement and a 

statement that follows shortly after it on the following 

page were essential to this Court's decision that 

applying the strictest possible scrutiny, this law was 

very narrowly tailored.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But the test as to any ad is 

whether any reasonable person could view the ad as -- as 

an electioneering ad?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think -- well, an 

electioneering ad, Justice Alito, I think puts too much 

of a burden on it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Any reasonable person could 

view it as what?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think that what a district 

court would say is could a reasonable voter in the 

targeted electorate have understood that this ad was in 

part promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing?

JUSTICE ALITO: The same group has long had 

ads on a particular issue, and let's say a particular 

candidate's position on the issue is very well known to 

people who pay attention to public affairs. And let's 

say we're in the black out period and now important vote 

is coming up on Congress on that very issue. If the 

group continues to run the ad on that issue, that -- a 

reasonable person could view that as, as saying 

something about the election, couldn't it? Couldn't 

that person?

 MR. WAXMAN: I, I would think so. If it --

JUSTICE ALITO: That would be prohibited?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it would depend, as your 

question suggests, on the context in which the ad is 

run. Now I want to make two points with respect to your 

inquiry. Number one, as this Court has reiterated, 

we're not talking about a ban here. Any one of these 

ads can be run so long as it is funded the same way that 

the election law requires them all to be funded. That 

is, with money that --

JUSTICE ALITO: What do you -- what do you 

make -- what do you make of the fact that there are so 

many advocacy groups that say this is really 

impractical?

to give you the ACLU as an example because many -- their 

brief is quite powerful. They and the other amici who 

provide a growing table of amicus briefs every time this 

issue comes up, have never, ever, brought their own 

as-applied challenge, although those these groups are 

not shy to litigate when they think important rights are 

in effect. They have been in the three years since this 

Court decided McConnell, and in the year since this 

Court made clear what I think we had assumed, which is 

this statute is -- it is open season on as-applied 

challenges. There have been precisely two as as-applied 

challenges brought, both brought by the counsel in this 

case. The ACLU's brief which is as representative as 

any other says look at these ads that we've been running 

about really important issues: The war in Iraq, 

Guantanamo, etcetera, etcetera, here is the text of the 

ad. If we had put onto a tag line of that ad, please 

call Senator so and so and tell him no, we wouldn't be 

allowed to do it.

 Well, you know what? With one exception 

that I'll explain in a minute, in its 90-year history, 

the ACLU has never -- way before Bickler was passed, 

even outside the 60-day period, they never put that line 

on. And you know why? It's because they have pledged 

to their members and to the public that they will not

engage in electioneering of any sort. They are 

completely nonpartisan and they don't ever want to be 

understood to the contrary, and so they never utter 

those words.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's an 

important part of their exercise of First Amendment 

rights to petition their senators and congressmen, and 

to urge others to -- as in these ads -- contact your 

senators, contact your congressmen. Just because the 

ACLU doesn't do that doesn't seem particularly pertinent 

to me.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, though, I mean, I think 

it does demonstrate a few things. First of all, it is 

entirely possible, as this Court reiterated in 

McConnell, for the exact same message or an equally 

effective message to be given at any particular time. 

If the ACLU or the National Rifle Association or any of 

the other groups that never wants to actually bring an 

as-applied challenge but always wants to say oh no, no, 

no, this is horrible, wants to run an ad, as this 

Court has -- they can establish a separate segregated 

fund. And if they come in and convince a court that 

that's impractical or impossible, maybe they get an 

as-applied challenge.

also? Is it the case that they have never targeted, so 

to speak, a particular legislator?

 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think anybody would 

claim that. Even the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they would 

either. Why pick on the ACLU?

 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- I wasn't -- I don't 

mean to pick on the ACLU. I think highly of both 

organizations and many of the amici that are arrayed 

against me. The point is that I use the ACLU as an 

example because the reason they never put, they never 

name a congressman is because they don't want their ads 

to be perceived as breaking faith with what they tell 

the public.

 As for the NRA, the NRA actually did bring a 

challenge against the FEC in the D.C. Circuit and said, 

"we don't really qualify under MCFL because we take some 

corporate funds, but it's de minimis and we think that's 

what the Supreme Court had in mind. You know what? 

They won. But they can't take yes for an answer. They 

want to establish that this law is facially 

unconstitutional. And that does go to the point I 

think, if I may, as to why -- well, it -- why you 

shouldn't reexamine McConnell for first principles.

 But let me just say in response to your very

first question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the reason that 

we know that this ad is typical is, as this Court 

created, articulated the paradigm of an electioneering 

communication, the test in the Jane Doe example, and 

this case is materially indistinguishable from the Jane 

Doe ad. That is one that, quote, "condemns Jane Doe's 

record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to 

call Jane Doe." Here we've got an ad that denounced 

the, quote, "group of Senators who had filibustered 

judicial nominees" -- may I finish my sentence?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please.

 MR. WAXMAN: The only thing that 

distinguishes that statement from Jane Doe is knowing 

that Senator Feingold was part of that group, and 

reasonable listeners in the context of the ad itself and 

the web site would certainly have known that. Thank 

you.

that they are repudiating the very studies and expert 

witness testimony that this Court relied upon in 

recognizing a distinction between sham issue ads and 

genuine issue ads. That was a methodology that the 

Government created and this Court relied upon. Now they 

are converting genuine issue ads which they identified 

in the record through their expert testimony and their 

studies. These ads are contained in the joint appendix 

on pages 159 to 167.

 Their expert based upon their studies 

testified that these were genuine issue ads. Now they 

refused to state, as they do here, refused to state a 

test to determine what's a genuine ad. So we are left 

trying to comply with this law and mount the as-applied 

challenges that this Court said is available to us to 

look at these ads and determine what essential features 

there are of these ads. And as I will explain further 

later, these are grassroots lobbying ads of the type not 

like Jane Doe or yellow tail, but as -- but exactly the 

type of the PBA ad, for instance, which we have focused 

on, which is on page 166 of the joint appendix. So in 

these studies, and these experts, they only looked at 

the text of these ads to determine whether they were 

genuine or sham.

intent of the speaker. There was no testimony about the 

particular groups who ran these ads on whether or not 

their PAC was supporting a particular candidate. No 

expert in McConnell speculated about the possible effect 

of any particular ad to determine whether it was genuine 

or sham.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How could you tell? I 

rather liked the one --

MR. BOPP: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I rather liked the one we 

had before about Senator Faircloth, and his ad was, 

Senator Faircloth is against the trial lawyers and their 

efforts to increase liability laws, so write him. Now, 

testimony all over the place. That is the advocacy 

candidate ad of the century. And you couldn't possibly 

know that without having known that one of the parties 

had spent millions trying to paint Faircloth's opponent, 

Senator Edwards, as the creature of the trial lawyers, 

that anyone -- that anyone in North Carolina knew it. 

So they read those words and they understand precisely 

what's at stake. They're saying vote against Edwards, 

vote for Faircloth. You just tell me how anyone could 

know such a thing without looking at the context.

whether or not it was sham or genuine, that ad was sham 

or genuine, there was no testimony, no reference --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought people offered to 

bring in such facts as -- there was a web site address 

here. It says, indeed oddly, don't phone the Senator. 

Go look at the web site. And if you look at that web 

site, it says defeat him, defeat him, defeat him. I 

mean, that sounds as if they have defeat in mind.

 So certainly, there are about four or five 

things which they said to look at outside the four 

corners. So I'm not certain what it is in the law that 

says that you only look to the four corners. I mean, I 

read the opinion below. Did you read it, by the way, 

the 1,000-page opinion? I bet you did, the 1,000-page 

opinion of the district court?

less, but you know what that record was like in the

labor unions cannot give money to political campaigns. 

And if it is true, as it is true, that what political 

campaigns are about now is television. And if it is 

true, as it is true, that these are the single lion's 

share, the single best way to get somebody defeated or 

elected, then if you open the gates and say corporations 

and rich givers or whatever can contribute by writing 

these ads and paying for them, forget the first two

throw out the protected speech in order to target 

unprotected speech. And the line of argumentation that 

the Government is presenting simply ignores the fact 

that at least we have a dilemma, we have Congress in 

session during the blackout periods, voting on items. 

And we have in the First Amendment one of the four 

indispensable freedoms, your right to petition the 

Government.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you it's 

exactly as Justice Scalia said. If we agree with you in 

this case, good-bye McCain-Feingold. Maybe we should do 

it up front. That's what you advocate. Very well. 

Would you address that? Why should this Court only a 

year or two after it upholds McCain-Feingold, accept a 

position that either in fact or in theory overturns that 

case?

 MR. BOPP: Because facial upholdings can 

only be sustained constitutionally if as-applied 

challenges are adequate to protect the protected speech. 

And this case demonstrates that that is probably 

impossible. It is certainly demonstrating that when the 

Government has changed its criteria, it is using 

criteria that it rejected previously now to say genuine 

issue ads which we asked this Court to rely upon in 

their testimony and studies as genuine issue ads, that

Hampshire probably did not, because they did not know 

the context.

 Your argument, seems to me is, ignore the 

context. And my question is, why should we ignore --

why should we do that?

 MR. BOPP: Well, that test that has been 

articulated by the Government would invite ads to be 

prohibited based upon the varied understandings of the 

listener, and that --

communication depend upon the understanding of the 

listener? Can we even sensibly talk about what a 

statement means or an advertisement means without 

understanding the context in terms of the listener's 

understanding?

 MR. BOPP: You do that all the time based 

upon the -- the test is, what do the words say? What 

does the ad say? What does the speech say?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. The question is, what 

do the words mean.

 MR. BOPP: Yes, what do they mean.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it is impossible to 

know what the words mean without knowing the context in 

which they are spoken.

JUSTICE SCALIA: When they put these 

exhibits, were those exhibits complete with context?

 MR. BOPP: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so. They 

just -- just like the ads were.

 MR. BOPP: There were two huge big studies 

on -- two in '98 and 2000, and there was absolutely no 

testimony about the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is, why should 

we ignore the context? How can we tell what something 

means without the context?

 MR. BOPP: Well, there is relevant context, 

such as the person named, the incumbent is a candidate. 

That would be a relevant context. It is broadcast 

within 60 days of a general election, in which he is a 

candidate as well as a voting member of the Senate. 

That would be context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- those don't go 

to meaning in the sense of, for example, the Faircloth 

Edwards example does. Why should we ignore the aspects 

of context which determine meaning, i.e., the 

understanding that a listener would have?

 MR. BOPP: Because it simply -- it would 

prohibit all speech because no one would know in advance 

whether or not there would be --

and Edwards?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course they knew that.

 MR. BOPP: I have no idea.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course they knew that. 

And just as presumably, you knew the position of Senator 

Feingold in these advertisements, and the people in the 

state knew because of your other -- because of your 

other public statements.

 MR. BOPP: Because of one or two press 

releases?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should those things be 

ignored?

 MR. BOPP: There's absolutely no evidence 

that anyone in Wisconsin knew his position on the 

filibuster.

draw peoples attention to the web site.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You think the only source 

of information about Senator Feingold is your 

advertisement?

 MR. BOPP: No, but I don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then if your advertisement 

is not the sole source of information, then why do you 

assume that no one in Wisconsin knows what the senator 

has been doing when he votes.

 MR. BOPP: Look, polls show that a majority 

of the people don't even know who the Vice President of 

the United States is. So to suggest that they know a 

particular position --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So your position is that we 

ignore context because no one -- because the voters 

aren't smart enough to have a context?

so we can give that information to the voters.

it's sort for me deja vu all over again. We've heard 

it.

 MR. BOPP: Yes, but you said --

JUSTICE BREYER: And what happened before --

either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how 

frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want 

to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it 

to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads --

and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about. 

That's what that 1,000-page record is about. That's 

what the 10,000 pages of testimony were about. That's 

what McCain-Feingold was about, and all those witnesses. 

They said in today's world these are the kinds of ads 

people run just to defeat people. And then they said, 

moreover, most of the campaign money goes on them. And 

then they said, moreover, if you let corporations and 

labor unions contribute to these, well, then they can 

contribute to the campaign. And the only thing I left 

out before was, if you're prepared to say the 

Constitution the Constitution requires us to let 

corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well, 

how could it be constitutional to have a statute that 

forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate, 

something that's been in existence only since I guess 

1904? But how could that be constitutional if they can

just give this money directly? Why can't they give this 

same money to the candidate?

 MR. BOPP: Well, because of your decision in 

Beaumont, which creates a distinction between 

contributions and independent speech, and this is 

independent speech.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty easy to tell 

whether you're giving money to the money to the 

candidate or not, isn't it?

 MR. BOPP: Very readily.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a fairly bright line 

that you don't have to worry about stepping over the 

wrong side of it.

 MR. BOPP: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas this one, 

especially if you adopt a context determination that 

requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? I mean, 

1,000 is what we have here, is we happen to have three 

criteria, absolutely clear: Does it mix the candidate? 

Does it run within 30 or 60 days before the election? 

And is it targeted to an electorate? Now, that's clear.

 Now, if you're prepared to say that's 

unclear, I don't understand it, you don't need a 

1,000-page record about that. All you need is a record

where you have your organization to come in and show how

force to the other conclusion of all three district 

court judges that there were genuine issue ads.

Feingold to change his position on filibusters?

 MR. BOPP: It was indeed. It was to lobby 

him about the upcoming vote.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think they had much 

chance? Do you think that was a realistic goal?

 MR. BOPP: Yes, as it turns out, because in 

2006 we ran the same sort of anti-filibuster ads and 

Senator Kohl, now up for reelection, changed his 

position on the filibuster. So these things happen. In 

other words, people -- people's positions are affected

by grassroots lobbying, and at least people should have 

the opportunity to engage in grassroots lobbying.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that called democracy?

 MR. BOPP: We are hopeful, Your Honor. And 

that our part -- our system of self government is based 

upon the self- government of the people and their 

ability to influence the actions of governmental 

officials.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bopp, your 

argument that McConnell's facial holding should be 

overturned appears on page 62 of your brief. I take it 

you have at least 61 page arguing that your as-applied 

challenge can succeed without overturning McConnell's 

position?

 MR. BOPP: Yes. Yes, we have, which would 

require the adoption of a reasonably ascertainable test, 

one that people would not be subject to three years of 

litigation, scorched earth litigation tactics, intrusive 

discovery into every aspect of their organization for 

decades. It would have to be clear, simple, and 

objective and be able to be implemented on short notice, 

because things pop up, like the filibuster of a Supreme 

Court nominee in January of 2006.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your test? Their 

test is fuzzy, I agree with you. What's yours? Do you

have a clear one that does not invalidate the whole 

statute?

 MR. BOPP: Well, based on their evidence in 

McConnell and these grassroots, and these genuine issue 

ads, I think there are three key or essential features 

of those ads that we are satisfied would protect 

grassroots lobbying and genuine issue ads. The first is 

based upon the content of the communication, they focus 

on a current legislative matter, take a position on it, 

urge people to contact them, their congressmen and 

senators, to take a particular action or position.

 Secondly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That says what's good. 

What is your test for what's bad?

 MR. BOPP: Second, the ads do not mention an 

election, candidacy, political party, challenger, or the 

official character, qualifications, or fitness for 

office. That was the key link the district court found, 

that these ads not, as Buckley said -- and of course 

McConnell was litigated under Buckley -- is that they 

were not unambiguously candidate- related.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- give us the third 

one. I want to go back to --

MR. BOPP: The third one is, as long as the 

ad meets this pattern, that the fact that the ad -- ours

does not -- but the fact that the ad mentions the name, 

the position of a public official on an issue and 

praises or criticizes him or her for that does not 

affect its genuineness.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. May I go back to 

your second criterion? It seems to me your second 

criterion is simply the injection of magic words back 

again. You're saying if we don't use certain magic 

words it's okay. That's a magic words test.

 You're not looking for any particular word. 

You're looking for the meaning and breadth of the, of 

the item.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but you said if we 

don't mention the election and the candidacy of this 

person for this election, that is one of the 

sufficient -- one of the conditions with the other three 

which would be sufficient to justify the, on First 

Amendment grounds, justify running the ad. That seems 

to me simply to be reinjecting magic words in a negative 

form.

 MR. BOPP: Well, in a much more expansive 

and comprehensive test which looks to three features of 

the ad. But in any event, you look at the words all the 

time. Is it fighting words? You look at what are the 

words, what are they saying?

context.

there is an election upcoming, so it's within 60 days.

that matter, whether the is a current Legislative Branch 

matter or likely to arise in the near future.

to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get 

at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad 

that is not a genuine issue ad?

dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to 

the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you 

know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get 

rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech 

that is justified.

 So even if there is something that might 

sneak through that does achieve what Congress didn't 

want to achieve, the answer in the First Amendment is 

that's too bad. There's some stuff you just can't get 

at. There's a lot of bad speech that is allowed all the 

time because you can't get at it without suppressing the 

good speech.

 MR. BOPP: I think that's the standard.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In fact this isn't the 

First Amendment totally on one side. Isn't this, isn't 

this a case where the courts held that there are very 

significant constitutional interests on both sides of 

the equation, which is what makes this kind of thing 

difficult. Isn't that so?

 MR. BOPP: And so giving meaning to one side 

was upholding it facially. Now your job is to give 

meaning to the other side, which is genuine issue ads 

that are to be protected as applied.

pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the

question and why we've upheld McCain-Feingold.

 MR. BOPP: But even if you use balancing, 

you've already used it. You upheld it on its face, 

because you said the vast majority were shams. At the 

same time, you said there were genuine issue ads. You 

reserved the question of whether or not the interest is 

sufficient, the governmental interest is sufficient, to 

prohibit genuine issue ads in footnote 88. You know, 

they refuse to give the test. They refuse to tell us 

what is the standard.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your test, as I 

understand it, is the test to determine whether you fall 

within this sort of heartland of the statute which we 

upheld on facial challenge. Yours is a test where 

exclusion from the facial rule; isn't that correct? 

That's -- that was why you were giving the answer to 

Justice Scalia that you gave?

 MR. BOPP: I did --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What you're saying: I have 

three criteria and if I satisfy those criteria, then 

the, then the facial validity of the statute is not an 

answer to my claim. That's basically what you're 

saying.

success in that you're saying, okay, the Government then 

has the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny. That's 

the reason for your test, isn't it, to get you out of 

McCain-Feingold -- I mean, to get you out of the holding 

in McConnell?

 MR. BOPP: We're not trying to get out of 

the holding in McConnell.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. You're saying this 

is an applied challenge which is different in some 

relevant respects, so that the facial holding in 

McConnell shouldn't apply to us, it shouldn't bar, 

shouldn't justify the Government barring our ad. Isn't 

that your logic?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say yes to that, 

I think.

 MR. BOPP: Thank you.

 But the -- we're trying to -- actually --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You want to go further than 

that, I know. But that's your first step.

 MR. BOPP: No, our first --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what you were

challenge.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The way to do that is say, 

there's something different about my case from the case 

which was taken as typical in upholding statute against 

facial challenge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He fears the Greeks even 

when they bear gifts.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BOPP: Yes, we have. We have 

demonstrated how these ads are materially identical to 

the genuine issue ads this Government presented to this 

Court and you relied upon that representation. We have 

demonstrated why and their experts have agreed that the 

Yellowtail ad, the Jane Doe ad, is completely different 

than our ad. Their experts say that our ads are 

grassroots lobbying ads.

 Now, we are faced with a change in position 

of the Government. I mean, in McConnell the Government 

said naming a candidate is critical. Now their experts 

say it doesn't matter if you name a candidate or not, 

any genuine issue, any ad, can influence an election if 

you mention an issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your, your principle 

concern at this point is getting yourself out from the 

holding of McConnell, in other words, by saying we have

a case which was not the typical case in McConnell, 

that's why it's an as-applied challenge and that's why 

this is a new ball game. And I take it your principle 

argument for that in criticizing the Government's 

position is that the Government didn't use to say that 

there's something significant or something insignificant 

about naming the candidate, and now they do.

 That it seems to me -- if I understand your 

argument -- goes back to this context argument or not. 

Because the argument that's being made is, in context we 

know perfectly well what's going on.

 MR. BOPP: I just think that misrepresents 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying you shouldn't 

look at the context.

 MR. BOPP: I think that simply misstates the 

effect of this ad. If anybody wanted to influence an 

election with this ad, this was the most remote, 

attenuated, speculative way.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why did you refer them 

to the web site? There's nothing remote or speculative 

about what happens when they look at the web site.

 MR. BOPP: And that has been also misstated 

in the briefing here. There was absolutely nothing on 

the web site about anything other than the filibuster

issue. There was nothing about the PAC or what the PAC 

was doing. It was all about the filibuster.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Anything about Senator 

Feingold?

 MR. BOPP: Well, of course. It was about 

Senator Feingold's position. It was, the one change --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Did the web site indicate 

the -- the Wisconsin Right to Life's position on Senator 

Feingold?

 MR. BOPP: Only on the filibuster, yes. It 

identified -- the ads don't, the website does --

identified the position of Senator Feingold on the 

filibuster and criticizes him for that.

 Now, if that is to be -- you know, number 

one, the whole First Amendment was adopted to allow --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's part of the context, 

isn't it? In other words, you're supplying some --

MR. BOPP: No.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- context for the ad. 

You're saying, if you want to know the context in which 

we're saying this, look at the website.

part of the context.

what the statute allows. My point is, it seems to me 

you are referring to context. Why therefore is it

the statute could be validly applied to an ad that says 

look at this website, and the web site then uses the 

magic words?

 MR. BOPP: Perhaps. I'm not certain of 

that. And I'm sorry that I don't have a considered 

response to that question.

 But that is much different than what we are 

faced with. We are faced with ad hoc criteria that is 

being used by the Government. They reject examining 

subjective intent because it's unworkable. Now they 

want to examine subjective intent. They disclaim to 

this Court and Justice Scalia's question about, well, 

anything that might influence an election, can we 

regulate it? They said no. Well now they are claiming 

that, that anything that might influence an election --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you believe that 

the First Amendment would not be violated by an ad that

was the functional equivalent of one that contained 

magic words?

 MR. BOPP: Well, I disagree with that 

holding of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There might be an 

upholdable constitutional difference between two ads 

that convey the same message.

 MR. BOPP: Well, I don't believe they have 

the same functional --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If they're the functional 

equivalent, by hypothesis, they convey the same message.

 MR. BOPP: Well, Your Honor, I lost that 

argument in this Court. So you know, I'm not trying to 

relitigate McConnell. I'm trying to give meaning to 

McConnell. I mean, you talked about genuine issue, as 

this Court did. Their experts identified genuine issue 

ads. They said, as this Court said in Wisconsin Right 

to Life I, as-applied challenges can be brought. And so 

we're trying to give meaning to that, that there --

JUSTICE BREYER: The theory is that the ad 

itself on the web site, in your opinion, would have been 

okay? You turn to the web site three months before the 

election. It says 16 times out of 16 in the past two 

years, Feingold and Kohl have voted to filibuster 

certain of the President's nominees. Feingold and Kohl

are putting politics into the court system, creating 

gridlock and costing taxpayers money. Now three months 

before the election you put -- write that in your ad. 

Now, is that in your opinion constitutionally protected, 

gets it out of McCain-Feingold?

 MR. BOPP: In the -- as a broadcast ad?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. What you did, suppose 

instead of what you ran, you know, in a broadcast ad.

 MR. BOPP: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You think that is 

protected?

 MR. BOPP: Yes. Because whether you praise 

or criticize a Government official's action in office 

has nothing to do with whether it falls under the First 

Amendment's protection of petitioning. In fact that's 

what, you know, the kind of information -- we didn't do 

that. But that's the kind of information that's very 

relevant to the constituent's effort to petition.

like to stress the virtue of as-applied challenges. You 

might wonder in the abstract, wasn't there a problem 

with the statute that applies to a group running a 

series of ads and then one of them falls in the period. 

But then you look at an as-applied challenge and you see 

that didn't happen here. In fact, the opposite did. 

This issue was percolating since March of 2003. These 

ads were run some 500 days after the first filibuster 

vote. Both before and after Senator Feingold's 

reelection cycle, they addressed this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that go to their 

meaning or to the intent of -- is that what governs? 

It's the intent of the person who puts it on? I thought 

-- I thought you were focusing on the meaning of it, 

what it conveys to the public.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, if you're 

looking for an as-applied challenge that's going to 

identify a genuine issue ad, I would think that it would 

go somewhat to intent. And I would think the 

reason that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's new to me. I 

thought you were asking us to look at the meaning. What 

does it mean to the --

GENERAL CLEMENT: No. Our position is 

slightly different than intervenors on that point. And

I think the reason that the series of ads hypothetical 

is beguiling is because it suggests that because they 

run the same issue ad all the time, they must be 

interested in the issue, not the election, and the 

opposite is true here.

 They run ads about this issue, they run --

they have communications about this issue outside of the 

period of Senator Feingold's reelection. They don't 

rely on broadcast ads. They rely on e-alerts when it's 

not during the election cycle. But when it's during the 

election cycle, all of a sudden they start running 

broadcast ads. And I think it shows what the timing 

suggests. The timing here suggests an intent to 

influence the election, not an intent to engage on the 

issue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How long will the blackout 

period be during the upcoming year for the presidential 

candidates?

 MR. BOPP: Well, I think that in various 

places it will be 30 days before the primary and then 

obviously 60 days before the general.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be as long as 200 

days; isn't that correct.

 MR. BOPP: Not in any one place. And if 

there's an argument, though, that because of the way the

various broadcast media affect Manchester, New 

Hampshire, that's a great as-applied challenge. The 

virtue of as-applied challenges are that you get a 

concrete record and you don't have to speculate, wow, 

you know, is it possible to address the filibuster --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to speculate 

before you try to put the ad on.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, you don't.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to speculate 

whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in 

the zone of three different radio stations or television 

stations, a different rule applies. Doesn't the person 

who wants to speak have to speculate, roll the dice?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, they don't, Justice 

Scalia, and one of the arguments that's made to try to 

suggest that there should be a reconsideration of 

McConnell is, as-applied checks don't work. How can you 

say that? In the two cases that have been brought, 

there were preliminary injunction proceedings that were 

completed before the blackout period began. So in that 

case, bring your preliminary injunction if you have a 

question.

 But the virtue of as-applied challenges, and 

the last thing I'll say, is the virtue of as-applied 

challenges, they're not all created equal. Just because
