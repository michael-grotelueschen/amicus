 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 08-304, Graham County Soil 

and Water Conservation District v. The United States, ex 

rel. Wilson.

 Mr. Browning.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The issue in this case is whether the word 

"administrative" as used in the public disclosure bar of 

the False Claims Act includes State audits and reports 

or is limited to Federal sources.

 If this Court were to hold that a relator 

can simply copy a State report or a State criminal 

indictment and then proceed with a qui tam action, there 

will be a proliferation of opportunistic qui tam actions 

brought under this statute.

 Such construction of the statute would have 

a devastating effect upon States, local governments, and 

the Federal fisc.

 Much of the work of State government 

involves cooperative Federal and State programs. States

have been an effective partner in fighting against fraud 

and abuse with respect to those programs. For example, 

many States have turned to computerized software to 

identify irregularities in connection with Medicaid 

billings. California has implemented a process of 

analyzing both its Medicare and its Medicaid databases 

in order to identify doctors who bill in excess of 

24 hours in a given day.

 Under the decision below, that investigatory 

work can simply be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an 

action brought based upon that public report. The 

result is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But under your proposal a 

State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect, 

immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the 

information unusable by conducting a hearing.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, the 

government certainly argues that it would result in 

State and local governments immunizing themselves from 

qui tam liability.

 With respect to States, the Fourth Circuit's 

decision expressly includes reports of the State 

government. States, of course, are not liable under the 

qui tam provisions, as a result of this Court's decision 

in Vermont Department of Natural Resources v. United

States ex rel. Stevens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's also the 

original source, if -- if the relator is the original 

source of the information.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes -- yes, Justice Ginsburg, 

that -- even if there is a State report that a -- that 

a -- is in the public domain, a local government could 

still be sued under that document, if -- in spite of 

that document, by either the United States or a qui tam 

plaintiff that stands as an original source. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the 

argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent 

provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and 

this would -- if you would -- if you include State and 

local reports, that will shrink the availability?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, there is no 

question that Congress looked at the pre-1986 public 

disclosure bar, the provisions that existed between 1943 

and 1986, and during that time frame an action, a qui 

tam action, would be barred if it was based upon 

information that was available to the -- the Federal 

Government.

 Congress decided that that cut off too many 

qui tam actions, and as a result it reached a 

compromise. Many members of Congress wanted to totally

eliminate the government knowledge bar. On the other 

hand, the United States Department of Justice at the 

time was arguing that the existing bar should remain in 

effect as a result of abusive and frivolous qui tam 

actions and their concern with respect to that. So a 

compromise was reached in which the bar was completely 

changed. It was changed to allow for a -- for an 

original source to bring the qui tam action, essentially 

a relief valve that addressed Congress's concerns with 

respect to cases such as United States ex rel. 

Wisconsin v. Dean.

 It also in the 1986 amendments set out 

specific sources of information and directly identified 

the type of public information that a qui tam action can 

be based upon. That list, of course, includes many 

sources that might or might not be readily available to 

the United States Government. For example, it includes 

reports by a news media. A -- an obscure article in a 

weekly publication of limited circulation does not 

realistically put the government on notice of a 

particular fraud.

 The same can be true -- said with regard to 

an action filed in Federal court, a private action 

between civil litigants based upon diversity 

jurisdiction. If that -- if there is a summary judgment

motion filed in that case and there are a number of 

depositions, one of which might indicate fraud, that are 

filed in that summary judgment motion and the case 

settles, that -- there will never be -- that summary 

judgment motion wouldn't be reviewed by the Federal 

district court judge. But still, there is no question 

that the filing of that document with the Federal court 

would constitute a public disclosure under the first 

clause of the public disclosure bar.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be a -- would it 

be a civil hearing? A deposition -- you would consider 

a deposition to be a civil hearing?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I am referring to 

a deposition that is actually filed with the court in 

connection with the summary judgment motion and the case 

then settles. Generally, the -- the courts have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what provision 

would it come under?

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Scalia, the phrase 

"criminal, civil, or administrative hearing." The 

courts have consistently read that word "hearing" as --

as including all courts' proceedings, not simply the 

hearing itself, documents that are filed with the 

clerk's office --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Documents are -- documents

are a hearing?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the -- if 

Congress had meant to limit that word "hearing" to 

literally in-person oral arguments or in-person 

testimony, it -- the result would be that a criminal 

indictment could be copied by a qui tam plaintiff and an 

action brought based upon that.

 That, of course, was this Court's decision 

in United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess. The -- it is 

clear from the congressional history that Congress 

wanted to change that result by -- so Congress used the 

word "hearing" that obviously meant more than -- than 

simply --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Meant more than hearing?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

the part of the problem, is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's an argument that 

doesn't go very far with me. I mean, "hearing" means 

hearing.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the -- the 

problem is -- is that Congress really did not speak very 

clearly at all with respect to the False Claims Act, and 

so we're -- we're left with this mess of trying to 

figure out exactly what Congress intended.

JUSTICE ALITO: In your view, must an 

administrative report be a report that is generated by 

some government unit? Could it be a report by the 

administration of a university, for example?

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Alito, the 

Petitioners would not read that phrase as -- that 

broadly. When the Congress has used the word 

"administrative hearing," that would appear to indicate 

action by the government.

 And, under any of the dictionary definitions 

of "administration," clearly a State administrative 

proceeding, a State administrative report, would fall 

within the scope of the dictionary definition. We don't 

believe the Court needs to read that language as 

including private hospitals, private universities.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But I'm not sure why. 

You -- if -- unless "administrative" is informed by the 

other adjectives in that prepositional phrase, "in a 

congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting 

Office," presumably GAO, "report," it -- unless that is 

the -- you know, unless it's informed by those other 

references, and that's why it has to be governmental, 

I'm not sure how you limit "administrative" to 

governmental reports.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, the public

disclosure bar uses the phrase "administrative hearing" 

twice, and it's referring to Black's Law Dictionary. It 

defines "administrative hearing" as, essentially, a 

hearing conducted by an administrative agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say "twice," you 

mean in the first clause that says "in a criminal, 

civil, or administrative hearing"?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. And then in 

the second clause it proceeds to use the phrase 

"congressional, administrative, Government Accounting 

Office hearing, audit, investigation, or report."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a redundancy 

there if the statute means what you say it does; it says 

"administrative hearing" in both the first clause and 

the second clause.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, there is a 

redundancy based upon Petitioner's construction of the 

statute. But Congress was not particularly concerned 

about redundancy in the False Claims Act. For example, 

again it uses the phrase "congressional, administrative, 

or GAO."

 GAO, of course, is a body that reports to 

Congress. Its head is appointed by the President. So 

under any definition GAO would either be congressional 

or administrative, so there is a redundancy there.

There's also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think there would 

be a good lawsuit as to whether "congressional report" 

includes a GAO report. I think that's a lawsuit. I 

don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Justice Scalia, let me 

also point out that there is a redundancy in connection 

with the use of "audit, report, or investigation." 

Essentially, Congress is using the same word to mean 

essentially the same thing in that clause as well.

 But yes, our reading does result in a 

redundancy in the statute. Of course, the government 

reads this entire clause as being limited to Federal 

proceedings. They would urge a redundancy in the 

statute as well. But what's more important is this 

Court has consistently said that it will not read the 

same phrase as having a different meaning in the same 

sentence.

 Yes, Congress has created a redundancy, but 

that is no more egregious than the fact that it used the 

phrase "Government Accounting Office" to refer to what 

was clearly the General Accounting Office.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, that argument 

does not scare the government. I think the government 

would like to read "administrative hearing" in the

first -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal 

administrative hearing as well.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia. That is 

their argument today. Of course, just 11 months ago in 

United States ex rel. Poteet v. Medtronic, the 

government argued in the Sixth Circuit that a qui tam 

action should be dismissed based upon a State court 

complaint. They convinced the Sixth Circuit to accept 

that position and dismissed that complaint on January 14 

of this year.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that was on -- on the 

basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the 

second?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, based upon 

the first clause of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this particular audit 

report we are talking about, this is the audit report 

was done by an independent accountant? Is that --

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. There are 

two audit reports -- I'm sorry, there are two reports. 

The key one is the report that identifies or asserts 

that this work at issue should have been sent out by 

bid. That was prepared by an accounting firm for Graham 

County, North Carolina, the same auditor that was 

engaged by the county to comply with the Single Audit

Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that audit 

on file with the Department of Agriculture?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I would have to 

go beyond the record, but yes, we have conducted a --

submitted a Public Information Act request, and 

essentially a week after the document was transmitted to 

Graham County it was transmitted to the United States 

Department of Agriculture.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The arguments in this case, 

my initial reading of them, are more balanced than any I 

can remember, really. For each one, there is a 

counterargument and I'm somewhat left up in the air.

 So if -- since we have to decide it, it 

should -- should I take this into account: That if the 

Respondents are right, you are absolutely correct that 

there will be a lot of people, perhaps, who get rewards 

at the Federal Government's expense who shouldn't have 

them. No question. They front-run the government. 

They read the report, run in court fast, before it's in 

the newspaper.

 But if you are right, then they are going to 

have to assign people to look at these obscure 

administrative reports that didn't even get in the 

newspaper. So they want to do that, they don't have

people to do it, and they say these people are 

performing a service of sorts by reading them, the 

reports, for them and telling them about it. And there 

it is, balanced.

 But they are the ones who suffer. You see, 

they suffer both ways. They suffer if people don't tell 

them; they suffer if in fact too many people are getting 

unjustified rewards because the money comes from the 

Federal Government, the 10 percent, 25 percent. So if 

they're the ones who suffer, should I not pay special 

attention to their views as to how the balance works 

out?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, Justice 

Breyer, first of all, the government hasn't been 

consistent. As we pointed out in United States ex rel. 

Poteet, they have taken the exact opposite position with 

regard to clause 1 in the first circuit.

 But the real issue here and what should 

concern the Court is the fact that there will be a 

tremendous number of opportunistic qui tam plaintiffs 

that arise. If someone can simply go to an ongoing 

State or local government investigation, copy it, and 

bring it --

JUSTICE BREYER: As you can tell, I have 

taken that point in.

MR. BROWNING: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So my question wasn't that. 

My question was, Should I or should I not give them a 

little expertise weight on the grounds that they are the 

ones who know it best, that they are the victims?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, I would suggest that 

the weight that should be given is to the partners of 

the Federal government, States and local governments 

that are in the trenches administering these programs, 

that will have tremendous difficulty if there is a rash 

of qui tam actions that are brought that disrupt ongoing 

Medicaid and other investigations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How will that happen? 

Meaning, how will they know, A, that the investigation 

is occurring; and second, what can they do under Federal 

or State law to require the disclose of ongoing 

investigative materials?

 I don't know -- mind you, I haven't studied 

them -- but the ones that I am familiar with never 

permit the public -- none of the Freedom of Information 

Act-type legislation, never permit the disclosure of 

ongoing investigative material. So I am a little bit 

confused by how that would happen.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Sotomayor, there are 

going to be some exceptions to many States' Public

Information Act requests, things such as attorney-client 

communications, in some cases criminal investigations. 

But for most States there will not be any sort of 

prohibition against a plaintiff's attorney filing a 

Public Information Act request saying, print out -- give 

us a copy of all printouts that show disparities and 

irregularities with regard to Medicaid billings.

 Moreover, most States are -- by law are 

required to receive complaints concerning the State's 

Medicaid program. Those are generally processed by the 

State's system integrity program. And those reports are 

going to be readily available to Public Information Act 

requests.

 Essentially, what this Court should be 

worried about are State employees who know where the 

documents can be located. You can simply copy the 

document, bring a qui tam action, and produce a windfall 

for yourself, potentially disrupting the State 

investigation. And if Congress really wanted to do 

that, if they wanted to create this rash of ill-advised 

qui tam actions, this flood that's about to fall upon 

the States, Congress should have written a little bit 

more clearly before doing so. It isn't consistent with 

the language of the statute or with congressional 

intent.

Throughout the legislative history it is 

clear that what Congress was intending to do was to have 

access to true insiders, the whistleblowers, to obtain 

information that would be confidential, that would not 

otherwise be available to the Federal Government.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Congress obviously 

wanted more than that, because if Congress's intent was 

the one that you are announcing then it should have just 

permitted original sources to sue. But that's not the 

choice it made. It broadened the scope of qui tam 

actions to include more sources or more reward for 

individuals who don't have original information.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, it -- it 

added the original source provision, and it identified 

certainly sources of information and said, you cannot 

bring an action based upon those specific sources.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --

MR. BROWNING: Those include --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 

Is the fact that they've included the news media 

consistent with your view?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That seems to be a much 

more open source of information than you're raising.

 MR. BROWNING: Exactly. The government

argues that the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal, 

the public disclosure bar should therefore be read as 

exclusively Federal. But the existence of this category 

of news media indicates that Congress did not intend the 

public disclosure bar to be exclusively Federal sources.

 There -- there -- under the government's 

theory that all of this fall -- the entire public 

disclosure bar should be read as limited to Federal 

sources, the only news media that would be able to -- to 

fall within the scope of the public disclosure bar would 

be the Voice of America, which is the only Federal news 

media currently in existence, to my knowledge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Stars and Stripes, maybe.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you, 

Justice Scalia.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's not 

terribly persuasive. In the statute there are separate 

provisions, they talk about disclosures "in criminal, 

civil or administrative hearings," "in a congressional 

administrative or Government Accounting Office report, 

or from the news media." Simply because you want to 

limit "administrative" or not limit "administrative" 

does not mean that the other side's view requires news 

media to be modified by "Federal."

I would like to make in response is:  First, these 

clauses -- and there are three clauses, the first one 

beginning with "in" and the third one beginning with 

"from" -- they do not serve different purposes. Rather, 

they serve to identify the sources that Congress did not 

want to give rise to a qui tam action. So this list has 

to be read as a whole.

 The second point I would like to make is 

throughout --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We should stop calling them 

clauses. They are really phrases.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.

 With respect to these three phrases, the --

throughout the legislative history, the year and a half 

that the False Claims Act was being debated, there were 

only two clauses that began with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Phrases.

 MR. BROWNING: -- the preposition "in" --

phrases.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BROWNING: -- that began with the 

preposition "in" and then "from" in connection with 

"news media." It was only on October 3, 1986, that 

the -- when it was -- the provision was finally enacted 

by the Senate, that this second "in" was added before

the second clause.

 So, Congress undoubtedly did not intend to 

make this 11th-hour change and have some substantive 

change to the statute. Rather, it should best be read 

as a last-minute insert to make the clause, the three 

clauses as a whole, read and flow much better than they 

did prior to that time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me just as a 

practical matter, suppose -- suppose the county says, 

you know, we found out that we were defrauded by this 

contractor, and it sues the contractor. But its suit 

doesn't cover really all of the damages, only half of 

it. Can a qui tam action then be commenced for the 

portion that the county isn't seeking? I mean, how does 

that work?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, if there has been 

a public disclosure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which there would be if 

there's a complaint filed by the county --

MR. BROWNING: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- against the contractor.

 MR. BROWNING: Essentially what the lower 

courts have done is they would allowed a qui tam action 

to go with regard to a completely different claim. But 

if it were simply the fact that the public disclosure

covered a portion of the time period but not all of 

it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Depends on the identity of 

the claim?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and suppose in 

their race to the courthouse, the qui tam plaintiff 

files on Monday and the county files on Tuesday?

 MR. BROWNING: Under -- under that scenario, 

if the qui tam action is filed before the public 

disclosure, then the qui tam action would not be bourne. 

-

If there are no further questions, I'd 

like --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I, just one -- one 

quick question. I -- I -- I just want to be sure I 

understood. Do you draw any distinction between the 

preposition "in" and the preposition "from"?

 MR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor. I think it 

is -- as Justice Alito pointed out when he served on the 

Third Circuit, that some of these prepositions are very 

awkward indeed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Part of the random nature 

of the whole provision, right?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. HURT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. HURT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The decision of the Fourth Circuit is 

correct because the text of the False Claims Act compels 

the result, and the purpose -- and also the purposes of 

the 1986 amendments to the Act. As the Fourth Circuit 

noted, Congress grouped the disclosure sources in 

paragraph (a) of the public disclosure bar into three 

distinct categories. In CATEGORY 2, the term 

"administrative" which is at issue here is sandwiched 

between the terms "congressional" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's begin at the 

beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the, 

what is it, "civil, criminal, administrative hearing." 

Do you as the government -- do you agree with the 

government that you have to insert "Federal" there, too? 

Or does that phrase --

MR. HURT: No.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- include States?

MR. HURT: No, the -- the text of category 2 

compels the result here, although we do believe that the 

better view of category 1 is that it is also Federal as 

well, and the context -- the overall context --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose it 

isn't? Suppose the general "civil, criminal, 

administrative" is read to mean -- include State. Why 

shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin 

phrases, be read in pari materia?

 MR. HURT: Because each of those categories 

is distinct, not only grammatically, but as far as 

function. The first category is clearly adjudicative in 

nature. The second is non-adjudicative. And the third 

category is -- is news media and stands on its own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why should we read 

the second category back to alter the meaning of the 

first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to 

alter the meaning of the second? It -- it is absolutely 

clear when you read this, "in a criminal, civil, or 

administrative hearing"; there is no limitation to 

Federal on that. And you acknowledge that the criminal 

and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal 

proceedings, right? So when you read that phrase, 

"administrative" simply means, obviously means State 

administrative.

Now, why shouldn't I read that forward and 

say, well, since it means State there, it must mean 

State in the next one, in a congressional, 

administrative, or GAO report.

 MR. HURT: The argument for category 2 is 

less compelling, we agree. The argument for category 1 

is most compelling because these categories are distinct 

and should be looked at as separate units for that 

purpose. You have category 2 as non-adjudicative, and 

category 1 is adjudicative. And so you have -- you have 

distinction there.

 If you were looking at the three categories 

and, for instance, you don't say category 3 and say 

category 3 is nongovernmental, so therefore we should 

construe category 2 to include private administrative 

reports.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is, what sense 

does that make? I mean -- and I thought you said that 

the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil 

or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does 

not apply to State proceedings in your view. You said 

that was the better view.

 MR. HURT: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the state of the law 

on that? I thought it was virtually -- what is the

state of the law?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that just as to 

administrative. Don't you acknowledge that the criminal 

and civil apply to State criminal and civil?

 MR. HURT: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You want the whole thing to 

be just Federal?

 MR. HURT: No, we think the better view is 

that the whole category is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The whole category?

 MR. HURT: -- exclusively Federal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you'd have to say 

that. But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?

 MR. HURT: The -- the court of appeals have 

basically gone the other way, but they have looked at it 

in a very superficial matter and have not really 

directly addressed the issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are we supposed to do? 

I mean, to me it makes no sense. We are only talking 

about things that don't get into the newspapers. So --

and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of 

this would be, look, we don't have people to go send 

around to every -- read every State report. We just 

don't have that personnel. So we rely on these 

whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified. I

would think the same thing would be absolutely true of 

State criminal proceedings that don't get into the 

newspaper. There are probably 50 -- several 

thousands -- thousands and thousands.

 So how to read these differently is a 

problem for me. And I think that's on your side of it. 

But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to 

me is the -- is the question here.

 MR. HURT: Well, the False Claims Act in 

sections, the pertinent sections 3729 and 3730, refers 

to the Federal Government many times but never with the 

modifier "Federal." They do it through context. And in 

fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any history, which 

I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history 

or anything else that you can point to, to me that's 

important, showing that that first criminal hearing 

means just Federal?

 MR. HURT: Yes, the -- the legislative 

history shows throughout -- beginning with the House and 

Senate bills and going forward that these -- the earlier 

version shows these were exclusively Federal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they meant criminal 

hearing. Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal 

hearing, not State.

MR. HURT: Exactly, and you have references 

JUSTICE BREYER: You say "exactly." I was 

looking for the backup for that.

 MR. HURT: Yes. The legislative history is 

clear on that point, and in fact if you look at the 

Senate bill that was passed August 11, you have the 

final version of paragraph (A), and then you -- which 

was enacted in law, and paragraph (B) was somewhat 

different, but it had the phrase "government or news 

media," "disclosures to government or news media." It's 

clearly referencing back to paragraph (A) and 

categorizing those sources as either sources of capital 

"G" government, the Federal Government, or the news 

media.

 And the changes -- the subsequent changes to 

paragraph (B) give no indication that Congress's 

background understanding of that changed. There is no 

indication of that. And of course you have the Senate 

sponsors of the bill making the same statements that 

this was clearly Federal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- what was the 

reason for that be, given that there are so many joint 

Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's 

involved here? Why wouldn't a State report be as much

of a public disclosure as a Federal report? I mean, we 

are told that this particular report was filed with the 

U.S. Department of Agriculture.

 MR. HURT: Because it gives no -- a report 

produced by a State or a local government -- and again, 

their argument is not just State but every little local 

entity producing these reports fall under the 

category 2, according to them. Simply the fact that a 

local or State official might be producing this report 

gives no indication that the Federal Government is 

focusing on it or looking at it. And in fact --

JUSTICE ALITO: You think the Federal 

Government is focusing on everything that is disclosed 

in every civil proceeding that occurs in Federal court?

 MR. HURT: No, but Congress was selecting 

general categories and as a general category the Federal 

proceedings they thought were more likely to put the 

government on notice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: News media, they are likely 

to be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?

 MR. HURT: Well, I think that as a general 

category it was reasonable for Congress to assume that 

the news media disclosures would be disseminated in 

general to the general public and would put pressure on 

the government to take action, and the government would

pay attention to that in general.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they could have 

said "national news media." It didn't say "national 

news media." It said "news media."

 MR. HURT: It said "news media."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It includes a local radio 

station, a local community newspaper, right? All of 

that is included.

 MR. HURT: Congress was drawing the lines --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet, State proceedings, 

which are excluded, right?

 MR. HURT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even state supreme court 

cases and so forth. It seems strange to me.

 MR. HURT: Well, under, under -- this Court 

recognized in Cook County that the 1986 amendments 

abolished the government knowledge rule and allowed the 

qui tam relators to bring cases even where the 

government, Federal Government, had possession of 

information about the fraud.

 What we are doing here is not even -- we are 

not even sure the government has possession of these 

reports. A lot of these reports are just sitting in 

file cabinets all around the country in these little 

administrative office buildings.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hurt, let me just give 

you what's really troubling me about this case. You 

have two citizens of a small town. One of them goes to 

the hearing and gets all this information, the other one 

doesn't go to the hearing and reads about it in the 

newspaper. The latter is a permissible plaintiff, the 

former is not; is that correct?

 MR. HURT: Correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that make any sense?

 MR. HURT: It does, because Congress drew 

it -- picked it as a general category. They were 

thinking probably most likely The New York Times or 

newspapers that have actual investigative reporting 

resources, and that was what they had in mind.

 Here you have a whole --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't show that it 

makes sense. It just shows that Congress wasn't 

thinking clearly. There's as difference between the 

two.

 MR. HURT: One of the huge problems with 

Petitioners' position is it's going to sweep into 

category 2 an enormous number of reports and audits that 

the Federal Government is likely to never see, never 

come across, and you need these concerned citizens to 

go -- you want the citizens to go and look at these.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, are you 

sure that -- your argument is that this is sandwiched 

between two Federal descriptions? Are you sure 

"congressional" is limited to Federal Congress? The 

first definition in Black's Dictionary is "a formal 

meeting of delegates." And I don't know -- maybe I 

should -- I don't know if all 50 States refer to their 

legislature by some term other than "Congress."

 MR. HURT: The Petitioners have not pointed 

to an example of a State congress. I think it's 

generally conceded that that would be Federal. And 

also, when you look at GAO, that's clearly a Federal 

entity there as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to go back to 

Justice Ginsburg's very first question. I want you to 

assume that in category 1 it means State or Federal. 

Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't. I want you to 

assume that. If we assume that, does it make any sense 

to confine category 2 to Federal only?

 MR. HURT: Yes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the 

practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I 

want to know the practical rationale for that, the 

practical reasons why that should make sense.

just a totally -- a category that is much -- many 

magnitudes greater than the number of criminal, civil, 

and administrative hearings. You are going to have 

millions of documents all over this country in file 

cabinets that are generated by local and State 

governments that there is no possibility the vast 

majority of those would ever come across the attention 

of the Federal Government. And so you want concerned 

citizens to be looking through, monitoring their local 

governments, digging up these reports and bringing 

lawsuits based on those. The Federal Government's 

simply not going to do it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which decision of ours do 

you think would prompt Congress to go back and do this 

right? I mean, do you think that finding the way the 

government wants us to find will produce a revision of 

this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do 

you think that finding for the other side, giving the 

government some incentive to get this fixed, would 

likely produce a proper amendment? What do you think? 

I think the latter, to tell you the truth.

 MR. HURT: Well, unfortunately we have to 

deal with the statute as it is. And, you know, the --

our position uses all the clues in the statute to 

construe it. The other side construes it in a crude

manner and says, let's treat it like a laundry list, 

let's not use any of the grammatical clues in construing 

this language, and also let's construe it in a way that 

ignores what Congress did in 1986, which was to abolish 

the government knowledge part. This is a reimposition 

of that bar.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the second 

phrase said "in a congressional, news media, or GAO 

report." Would you read "news media" to be 

governmental?

 MR. HURT: No, I would not.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between that and the way it's phrased now?

 MR. HURT: Because it is -- Congress did put 

it in a separate category, so --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, no. Right now we have 

"in a congressional, administrative, or Government 

Accounting Office report." And you say you have to read 

"administrative" in light of "congressional" and "GAO." 

But what if it said "in a congressional, news media, or 

Government Accounting Office report"?

 MR. HURT: I think that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't you make the 

same argument with relation to "news media"?

 MR. HURT: I think the contextual clues

would be less compelling there in that situation, and 

you would have --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that?

 MR. HURT: Because you would have a category 

that would have a mixture of exclusively Federal and 

nonfederal. Here you have a category that you can't 

construe consistently as exclusively Federal, given the 

contextual clues in there. So as it is drafted now, if 

you look at all the clues you do have distinct 

categories that can be construed each on its own merits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This audit report is 

required by Federal law, isn't it?

 MR. HURT: Yes, as are many reports, 

Medicaid reports by private recipients, today. This 

report was only done because the local government was a 

recipient of Federal money, no different from any 

private recipient, a not-for-profit. So there was no 

real distinction there. It was not really a 

governmental report, in the truest sense of the word, as 

it should be construed or regarded for purposes of the 

public disclosure bar.

 And that's -- that shows the real -- one of 

the real problems of going down to the -- to the local 

and State level. You get all of these problems where 

the recipient is generating the reports rather than the

-- the administrator versus the recipient. You get all 

those problems going down to this level, the local and 

State governments, and it shows the real problem with 

that.

 Again, this is the -- the overall statute is 

Federal, it's to recover the Federal Government's money. 

The statute has a strict dichotomy between the Federal 

Government and everyone else. If the States or local 

governments are going to be qui tam relators, they bring 

it as a private person. Thank you.

you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say

statute, what's in the first phrase?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

-- I want to start by making clear that we disagree that 

that's a better interpretation of the first clause, but 

I will take it as the premise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's a lot hard to 

say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi --

means Federal civil, criminal and administrative 

hearings.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- it may indeed 

be harder to do that. We think that it is warranted in 

light of the policy that motivated Congress and in light 

of other references to Federal administrative, civil and 

criminal hearings in the statute. But even if those 

reasons which we think justify limiting the first 

category to Federal proceedings -- the Court were to 

disagree with that, that would not justify disregarding 

the clear indications of the Federal limitations on the 

second clause. And there is no policy --

mean to interrupt. Clear limitations, you really have 

only one, right? I mean you have no argument construing

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

think that -- that again, as Justice Alito's question at 

the very beginning of the argument illustrated, the 

literal language of the word administrative would 

encompass hearings conducted by private hospitals or 

universities as well. Now Petitioner es hewed that 

interpretation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we would just 

-- we would just take the sections from your brief today 

and say well no, you have got to read it in the context 

in which it appears and this is all Federal, which means 

it's all governmental.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's 

right, Your Honor, and governmental in a particular 

nature, of a particular nature, the Federal Government. 

As is the Court's decision in Cook County made clear, 

municipal governmental entities are with respect to the 

False Claims Act the same as private corporations. The 

-- the Court recognized that municipalities are the 

recipients of many Federal dollars. In that case the 

local governmental entity whose conduct is at issue was 

a county hospital. And -- and county hospitals receive 

funds under the same programs that private hospitals --

JUSTICE BREYER: I just want to get your 

expertise on this, because you have probably read the 

legislative history of the 1986 amendment. All right, 

am I right in thinking this? If I go back and read 

it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this 

entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or 

conference, does the word State appear in any relevant 

context?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not right. Okay. So 

when it appears --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I guess it 

depends on what you mean by the relevant context.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm -- the relevant 

context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in 

respect to the first clause, "criminal, civil, or 

administrative proceeding." Is there any indication 

that those were meant to apply -- any indication that 

those were meant to apply to State as opposed to 

uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative 

proceedings?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor, it 

is -- it is clear from the legislative --

to the bar, but a report or a hearing conducted by a 

State legislature would not.

was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was 

generating reports, audits, as distinguished from 

administrative agencies.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well -- well, Your 

Honor, it is of course a -- a truism, that -- that 

programs are administered by the executive branch more 

than the legislative branch, but that is no reason to 

think that Congress would have meant to exclude, if 

those State legislatures did conduct a hearing with 

respect to fraud by the State, exclude that as a public 

disclosure. The reason that Congress didn't include 

State legislative reports is because it didn't include 

State reports at all. It was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that -- that doesn't 

follow like the night the day. It could be, as it was 

explained, they didn't include State legislatures 

because they didn't think they would be generating 

relevant material.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

-- I think that it is more likely as -- as the 

development and progress of the clause reflects, that 

Congress was focused on what does the government know 

and what does the disclosure show about the whether the 

government is already or is likely to focus on the 

fraud.

is there any effort to get this clarified?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There -- I -- there

whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and 

second refers to State as well as Federal. If the 

debate took place in a context where everyone's just 

thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put 

in the word Federal. They don't think of everything. 

All right. Now, that's my question.

 You started with the House. The House to me 

does think just of Federal. The Senate's ambiguous on 

that point --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Senate --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and the conference is 

yet more ambiguous on that point. So is there 

anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate 

versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they 

did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's 

sort of mixed up? Or am I going to see that that 

context there is Federal?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The context is --

is Federal. References to States in connection with the 

act that Congress has thought about it are treating 

States like other private qui tam relators.

 They Petitioner referred to the Dean case, 

and, in fact, that was something that the -- the 

legislative history refers to, but what was offensive 

about the decision in the Dean case was that Wisconsin

had been the original source of the information, but had 

been barred because it had provided that information to 

the government.

 And, under the government knowledge bar, 

they had been precluded, so -- so Wisconsin would have 

been taken care of under the original source provision, 

but it doesn't reflect a view that States have a 

particular distinctive role.

 In fact, as this Court's decision in Cook 

County reflects, municipalities are treated just like 

any private corporation for purposes of the act. They 

can be defendants, they could be plaintiffs, qui tam 

relators, but there is no reason to construe the statute 

in a way that would allow a local government, 

technically, to shield itself from qui tam suits by 

disclosing the facts that would be the underlying 

information support of the fraud claim in, perhaps, a 

report that was intended to -- to whitewash the 

situation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that the --

when a -- when State employees want to immunize 

themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we 

will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick 

it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.

think it's important to note that, in order to be a 

public disclosure -- the second category at the very 

least -- all that needs to have happened is that 

information be disclosed to -- to one additional person.

 That -- and that makes a lot of sense when 

we are talking about disclosures of the government --

Federal government's own reports because, if the Federal 

government is already investigating and pursuing the 

fraud, one other person that finds out about it and then 

files a qui tam action on the basis of the government's 

own effort is precisely the situation that Congress 

sought to preclude.

 But it doesn't make any senses when we are 

talking about a disclosure to an individual by a State 

or local --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's lots of 

disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal 

reports that the government isn't pursuing.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we think that 

the -- the disclosures -- the allegations in the types 

of reports, audits, investigations, that are referenced 

in the clause are the type that would evidence that the 

government is pursuing them.

 And -- but where a State -- perhaps a local 

school board discloses facts that might give rise to an

allegation of fraud in a hearing where there was only 

one or two members of the public in attendance, there is 

no reason to think that that information is going to be 

brought to the Federal government's attention.

 The purpose of the bar is to balance --

Congress was seeking to balance two rules. One is to 

encourage qui tam relators to bring information and 

bring suit where the information was unlikely to be 

something that the government -- Federal government was 

focusing on.

 Where the Federal government was able to 

protect itself and bring this suit on its own, then 

there's no reason for the Federal government to have to 

share its recovery.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why can't it -- why 

can't it protect itself if these reports are in its 

possession? How are they any more in the -- or less in 

the government's possession than articles in the news 

media, than State, criminal, civil, and administrative 

hearings?

 You, yourself, make it very clear that the 

government -- it isn't keeping track of all of those 

other sources.

possession of the government -- it's happenstance that 

this particular report, the Crisp & Hughes report, was 

sent to the Federal government official.

 But the vast majority of State and local 

governmental investigations, audits, and reports, are 

not going to be given to the Federal government, and 

even though they are -- they cite the Single Audit Act, 

which is only a very narrow subset of audits that States 

or local governments perform -- do not actually disclose 

the allegations of the fraud.

 In order to get to the actual information of 

the fraud, the -- first of all, it would have to be 

brought to the attention of the relevant Federal agency. 

Usually, the cognizant agency is the one that has the 

most money at stake, but the fraud may have to do with a 

different Federal program, so it has to be brought to 

the attention of the program whose interests are 

actually at stake.

 They have to go beyond the report that is --

that is publicly available in the clearinghouse website, 

which tells you virtually nothing, to an underlying 

report which is itself, generally, fairly vague, and all 

Petitioners say is that the working papers of the 

auditor are available to the government, not even in the 

government's possession, they are available to the

government if it requests it.

 The government has to drill down many levels 

before it necessarily is going to know about that fraud.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that argument 

suggesting that the court didn't even need to reach this 

issue, even assuming that the State administrative 

reports are included in the bar?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No -- no, Your 

Honor, I don't think so.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, aren't you arguing 

that what was in this audit report wasn't sufficient to 

show the fraud? That's not your argument?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No -- again, this 

report here did have information that was indicative of 

fraud, and this report --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In which way?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which way? All it said 

was that this person wasn't chosen by bidding. But 

aren't there situations in which non-bids are permitted?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There -- there were 

multiple allegations. One of the allegations underlying 

the relator's claim is that the government -- the county 

certified that certain procedures were followed that 

would have included a requirement that it be bid out,

and that it was not.

 Another was that certain work was paid for 

or billed for, but wasn't performed or was not performed 

well, so there were -- there were different allegations, 

and where that would be disclosed to a single person, 

that would constitute a public disclosure, at least with 

respect to Federal --

General can always bring suit, right? I mean, all we

about it, the Attorney General could always bring suit,

your comments or your questions about legislative 

history; here, I think the legislative history tells us 

very little because of the many changes in the Senate 

version and the House version, and unfortunately, there 

was not a conference committee report, so we won't know 

the nature of the compromise.

 At most, the legislative history helps us to 

show what Congress was generally concerned about, and 

throughout the original committee, the Senate and House 

report, there is a concern about qui tam actions based 

upon public information.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I agree with you about 

that. I think it's the silence, though, that might cut 

against you.

 MR. BROWNING: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's --

it's basically silence -- the reason I am thinking that 

cuts against you is because of this sorting of the 

context where they are focusing on Federal.

 And, if everybody is working in that 

context, then nothing said about State means they are 

just assuming it's all applying to Federal.

 Now, what I'm looking for, you might be able 

to put your finger on, is something that shows that my

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Breyer, that the 

government assumes and repeats throughout its brief that 

the False Claims Act is exclusively Federal in nature; 

therefore, you read all of its terms as essentially 

being -- being Federal.

 That, of course, does not answer what 

Congress intended with the public disclosure bar --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When we say everybody's 

working in a certain context, how -- how many people is 

everybody? What percentage of the House and of the 

Senate were involved in these committees that were 

drafting these bills and that issued the committee 

report?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Justice Scalia, your 

point is well-taken, that this would only be --

JUSTICE BREYER: I think in the -- it was --

it probably came out in governmental affairs in the 

Senate, which I think had 17 members at the time.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes.

 Continuing with your -- your question, if I 

could, Justice Breyer, that there is nothing to indicate 

that the public disclosure bar should be exclusively 

Federal.

 It, of course, includes news media, which is 

not Federal. It also includes criminal, civil, or

administrative hearings. But moreover, there are many 

aspects of the False Claims Act that are not exclusively 

Federal in nature.

 The very change that we are talking about --

the -- the change to the public disclosure bar was a 

result of a push by the National Association of Attorney 

Generals to actually change the public disclosure bar to 

make sure that States could bring qui tam actions.

 That is why the public disclosure bar 

includes an original source provision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To -- to follow up, 

I think it was a question that Justice Breyer asked 

earlier. Do you have any tie-breaker on your side?

 I mean, if we do decide the arguments are 

pretty much in equipoise, the suggestion was that the 

Federal government is both the beneficiary and the loser 

in the qui tam actions, from the sense they lose a 

percentage of recovery, and so we ought to let them 

strike the balance.

 What argument do you have on your side?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, again, that our 

concern from the perspective of the States -- and it's a 

concern shared by local governments -- is the reading 

that Respondents advocate will produce a flood of qui 

tam --

that's one of the arguments that, I think, is balanced 

on the other side. For example, is -- do -- have we 

ever said -- and this is an unusual statute, of course, 

with a private Attorney General and all that.

 Have we -- does -- is there any authority 

for the idea that we should read it restrictively 

because of that?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, it does give rise 

to a -- a false claim will, of course, give rise to 

criminal liability. Moreover, it is a case dealing 

with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever -- have 

we ever said that that's a basis for reading the act 

restrictively?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, there is some 

older authority to that affect. The specific case -- I 

apologize. The name escapes me.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what your claim is --

is that the government -- the Federal government is not 

the only person harmed?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes.

local governments --

MR. BROWNING: Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- are significantly 

harmed.

 MR. BROWNING: We are -- we are partners --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which the Federal 

government doesn't care about, right?

 MR. BROWNING: The Federal government has, I 

think, taken a very short-sighted view because these 

sort of qui tam actions will be very disruptive to what 

the Federal government's partners are actually doing in 

the trenches in administering these programs.

 Moreover, the Federal False Claims Act -- it 

is clear that it is not exclusively Federal. When it 

was amended in 1986, Congress changed Section 3732(b), 

which allowed pendent State claims to be brought, so a 

State, if there is a Federal false claims action, could 

intervene to protect the State's portions of the -- the 

monies that are at issue.

 Moreover, in Section 3733(l)(7)(A), the 

civil investigative demand provisions, Congress 

expressly viewed the word "administrative" to include, 

not only Federal administrative proceedings, but State 

administrative proceedings as well.

to pay them then it would be to hire staff to do that.

 Now, your point is that they get a little 

over-enthusiastic sometimes, and they can bring actions 

that maybe not be so well-justified, and the -- the 

Federal government is going to have to hire people to 

sort those out anyway, and so would the States in that 

kind of mess.

 Is that your point?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes. They will be very 

enthusiastic if they can simply take a State report 

showing Medicaid fraud and bring a qui tam action. That 

will be very disruptive to states and to local 

governments.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
