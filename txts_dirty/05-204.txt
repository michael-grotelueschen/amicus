CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American 

Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases. 

Mr. Smith. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH 

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276 

MR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Texas legislature passed a new 

congressional districting map in 2003 for only one 

reason: maximizing the number of Republicans who would 

represent the State of Texas in Congress. Even though 

the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts 

which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went 

to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22 

districts, moving around 8 million people into new 

districts, abandoning concerns about compactness, 

wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating 

the population by race and by politics into 32 

districts which are extremely noncompetitive. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your -- your 

statement that it was for one reason only means it 

wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of

race or ethnicity? 

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the finding of the 

district court, which we're relying on here, was that 

it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship 

rather than on the basis of race. 

Now, they started out by trying to engineer 

the defeat in the -- in the legislative process, 

engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen 

who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning 

districts because they were moderate to conservative 

and they were, as the district court put it, able to 

appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for 

them in 2002. 

By the end of the legislative process, they 

went further and decided to take the risk of 

eliminating one of only four districts in the State in 

which African Americans had an opportunity to elect 

candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of 

the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas. 

Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that 

with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that 

was the one that we've called the land bridge district, 

District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban 

concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down 

on the Mexican border.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's no good. 

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not even to prevent 

retrogression, which would violate section 5. 

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, the retrogression 

problem was created by the fact that they had gotten 

rid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that was done for 

political reasons, not racial reasons. 

MR. SMITH: Exactly, Your Honor, and that's 

the argument that was made and rejected expressly by 

this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly 

minority district rather than a compact minority 

district because if we did it the other way, a nearby 

incumbent would lose his seat. That was precisely the 

argument that was made there, that it was really 

incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly 

district to send that excessive racial message in order 

to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which 

is mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I 

notice the -- the State of Texas offers no response. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what -- what is your 

proposal? What -- what is -- what is a State to do if 

-- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing 

its districts, perfectly valid political motivation

let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that 

it would eliminate a majority minority district, what 

-- what is the State supposed to do? 

MR. SMITH: I think the State has to stay 

within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno 

doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the 

pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a 

district -- has to -- has to create a minority 

opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise 

violate Shaw. 

Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- I'm -- as 

Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25 

problem. The briefs --

MR. SMITH: District. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for your co-counsel 

don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem 

for me. 

Justice Scalia's point was let's assume --

and I have some doubt about it. Let's assume that 

there's a valid reason for redoing section 23. That 

means you need another district to avoid retrogression. 

What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on 

that assumption, based on that assumption? 

MR. SMITH: I don't think that it makes a

constitutional difference under this Court's cases 

whether or not the reason they decided to place the 

district there and give it that configuration was 

because they had a political agenda somewhere else. 

The -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were 

deliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority 

district there, and to do it, they had to go all the 

way up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them 

up with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, that's not what 

makes it bad. Even if they created a compact district 

but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority 

minority district, that would be a district created for 

a racial reason. The mere fact that this one happens 

to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and 

-- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation 

unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition 

against regression. 

MR. SMITH: Our point, Your Honor, is that in 

this situation, doing it this way, the -- the 

motivation predominates over the other legitimate 

districting criteria, which I think under Bush and 

under --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which 

motivation?

motivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out 

as far as they did to capture --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can the -- can the 

State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in 

effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's 

entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant 

and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a 

defense? 

MR. SMITH: Our submission is that they 

cannot, Your Honor. 

Now, if I could turn to the partisanship 

issue, our --

JUSTICE BREYER: May I just clarify one thing 

on that? 

MR. SMITH: Sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I take it your reason was 

that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they 

can use race to prevent retrogression. Of course, they 

can, but if they do, they have to create a compact 

majority minority district, not an elongated majority 

MR. SMITH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the -- that's the 

argument. I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and that they 

can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way 

where the race predominates over the other values 

because we have a political agenda of protecting some 

other incumbent in a non-minority district. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how does that 

make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is 

the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's 

compact and the predominant motive was the 

consideration of race, that doesn't bother you? That 

seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more 

extensive judicial review of the compactness and based 

on racial considerations that are, under your view, the 

predominant factor in each case. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think there's 

a question of what you mean by the word predominance. 

And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times 

when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to 

-- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for 

example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very 

similar district, where race is said to predominate in 

a different sense than it does when you simply are 

creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or 

to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. 

Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you

to create minority districts. It should require that 

it makes sense that people make efforts to do that. 

We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things. 

We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's 

cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political 

agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a 

different way which sends this extra message of 

excessive racial consideration. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can take race 

into account if it's compact as a predominant motive. 

You can't take race into account if it's not compact. 

MR. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, you 

certainly can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a dominant motive. 

MR. SMITH: You certainly can intentionally 

create a minority district under section 2 of the 

Voting Rights Act. I don't know how you could comply 

with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do 

that in situations where, under the Gingles criteria, 

that's what you're supposed to do. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I'm a little 

puzzled by the -- the questioning. Doesn't everyone 

agree that the predominant motive in all the districts 

was political? You agree to that, don't you?

 MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you don't agree that 

that necessarily makes it valid, that that's 

necessarily a defense to section 2. 

MR. SMITH: No, I actually don't agree with 

that, Your Honor, and you're right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and the problem with 

section -- with district 23, under section 2 of the 

Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation. It's the 

results that have changed. Isn't that correct? 

MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question under the 

district court's opinion is whether the political 

motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise 

be a violation of section 2. Is that correct? 

MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it 

correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results 

is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal 

protection one and not a section 2 one? 

MR. SMITH: Right, but -- but our challenge 

under the Equal Protection Clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about 

district 25. 

MR. SMITH: It's a little hard to keep all

the different arguments straight, but yes. Our 

argument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor. 

And -- and the argument is that the intent went too far 

because they had to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I 

asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of 

this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how 

that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not 

the section 2 requirement. 

MR. SMITH: Well, I think there are 

situations in which you have a political motive 

overarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same 

time, that pushes you to do some things which could 

violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial 

conduct. And that's what this -- that's what our 

argument is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't think that's 

a defense. It seems to me the State creates the very 

problem that it claims that it must use race to settle. 

MR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor, yes. 

We don't think it's a defense in this instance. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, with respect to section 

2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship 

between the predominant political motivation and the 

existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?

JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- let me put it another 

way. 

MR. SMITH: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if you otherwise 

demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political 

motivation a defense? 

MR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. 

MR. SMITH: Certainly not. 

Now, we have a -- an argument about that too, 

which has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort 

Worth area, and I think the political defense there 

doesn't have anything to do with it. 

Now, if -- if I could, I think that the whole 

map -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates 

the Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different 

reason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any 

rational, legitimate public purpose. At the time, 

there was a lawful map in place that had the right 

number of districts, and the district court found as 

fact that the only reason that this law was even 

considered, let alone passed, was to help one political

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. That's a surprise. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a -- a 

plan that was put in place by the legislature instead 

of a temporary plan put in effect by a court? 

MR. SMITH: The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there -- isn't it --

you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting 

instead of as the very first redistricting done by a 

legislature. 

MR. SMITH: It was the first one done by the 

legislature because they violated the Constitution 

intentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw 

a map 2 years earlier. Our submission is that the 

existence of some power that the legislature may have 

to -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well 

have that power. We don't -- we don't question that --

doesn't justify the map. They still have to, in 

exercising that power, point to some constitutional 

basis for which they're acting. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it's a 

perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because

we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion

for. Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for 

political reasons. I mean, to say that this is, you 

know, something horrible is ridiculous. You 

acknowledge that political motivation is fine. 

MR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you? 

MR. SMITH: -- we acknowledge that we 

tolerate political motivation in the context of map-

drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes 

being served, which is to say at the beginning of the 

decade when they have to redraw the map anyway. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. 

MR. SMITH: But our position is when it's 

purely for partisan motivation, which is -- only occurs 

in mid-decade --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even when the map is 

so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came 

out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had 

less of a divergence between the voting strength of the 

Republican Party and the number of Republican seats 

than had existed under the previous allocation by the 

Democrats.

a justification for two reasons, Your Honor. This 

notion that you can have compensatory gerrymandering 

and that that can be your justification -- I think it's 

wrong as a matter of law because all it amounts to is 

another way of saying we like -- we don't like the 

partisan composition of the delegation that the people 

voted for and we're going to change it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm saying less. Less. 

It -- there's less of a divergence under the new map 

than there was under the old one. The only difference 

is this divergence is in favor of the majority. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, as the district 

court found -- and this is on page 85 of our 

jurisdictional statement appendix -- it wasn't that 

there was bias in the map that the court drew. It was 

that there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly 

favored the Republicans in the court-drawn map. It 

just so happened that the voters in those districts, in 

six of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to 

like voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who 

they were comfortable with. Now, if you tell me -- I 

-- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to 

understand how anyone could say the legislature can, as 

a matter of -- use the machinery of government to 

decide that those voters should not have that

opportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, just 

take it in -- in an abstract way. If you think that 

the prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in 

power, are you saying that when that shift in power in 

the statewide offices changes, that the new party in 

power cannot redress the gerrymandering of its 

predecessor? 

MR. SMITH: My -- my answers to that are 

twofold. I think as a matter of law that the Court 

should hold that -- if that's the only justification, 

you ought to wait until you have other public purposes 

for redrawing the lines. 

But even if that were -- even if the Court is 

going to allow that kind of justification for mid-decade 

redistricting, it shouldn't allow it here because it 

was just factually untrue, as the district court found. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's get back to 

the -- to the principle without just talking about 

these -- these factfindings. It -- it seems to me 

very odd for you to be telling us that partisan 

gerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole 

or substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying 

that we can't correct it when it's happened. 

Let's assume that the 1990 legislative plan

was one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan 

intent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the 

Democrats or party X to having a much greater advantage 

than the general registration would give it. And if it 

leaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why 

-- why can't it be redone? 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think that if 

the Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand 

that argument. 

MR. SMITH: I think it's a dangerous thing to 

do, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't 

redistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it 

as partisan compensation, that's okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me give you 

another parallel. Let's suppose that districts have 

been gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes 

for years. Can you take race into account in drawing 

new districts to remedy that racial discrimination? 

MR. SMITH: I think if a map is illegal, Your 

Honor, then -- then certainly it is within the power of 

-- of the legislature to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that's -- but now, 

in fairness, I think to the red brief argument --

you've read the red briefs.

 MR. SMITH: I have, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They are filled with 

factual information that in their opinion shows that 

previously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much 

worse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a 

balance. That's what their view is. Now, I want to 

know really precisely what is your response to that 

argument. 

MR. SMITH: My response is -- is -- factual 

response is that by the time we got to 2002, the 

district court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts, 

which voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other 

office, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that 

whatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if 

there was one, had been eradicated because all of these 

Democrats in those districts had become more 

Republican. And so the map was not biased. There was 

nothing wrong with the lines. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do I look to in 

the record to verify what you just said? 

MR. SMITH: You look to the court's finding 

on page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored 

the Republicans. And you look at the expert reports 

filed by both sides at the trial that preceded that 

finding, and the experts for both sides said that the

court-drawn map was a pro-Republican map that favored 

the Republicans or, at minimum, was fair, and that with 

the kind of voting patterns that existed in Texas at 

the time, one would expect the Republicans to carry 20 

districts in most of the elections. 

Now, they also said -- and -- and this is a 

reason why the State didn't actually put their expert 

on the stand -- that the map that the legislature had 

drawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the 

Republicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they 

would still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the 

vote, they'd still get 20 districts. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what percentage did 

they have? I -- I thought that -- you say that they 

should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts 

did the plan give them? 

MR. SMITH: The plan gave them 20 districts 

in which they had a strong Republican majority. Now, 

what that means is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that's what they 

should have had, given -- given the voting in the 

State. 

MR. SMITH: I say they -- that given that 

opportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen, 

that's -- that's all that anybody could reasonably ask

for. That's the only kind of justification that I can 

even imagine justifying purely partisan redistricting 

in mid-decade. 

The fact of the matter is the large majority 

of the Members of Congress who went to Washington after 

the 2002 election were elected by Republicans in 

Republican districts. That's what the facts are. Now, 

they say, well, vestiges of the past gerrymander are 

still around, but what does that mean? The fact is the 

districts are by now overwhelmingly Republican in the 

large majority of cases. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any -- any 

authority either in the text of the Constitution or in 

a -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a 

legislature can reapportion its districts is because 

there's been a census? 

MR. SMITH: Our -- our position is slightly 

different. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's your 

position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad 

because your -- your position is the only reason is the 

census is -- has -- has caused there to be less than --

than one man/one vote. 

MR. SMITH: There may be cases where you 

could do mid-decade redistricting for neutral,

legitimate public purposes. I submit they'll be quite 

rare in -- in practice, but there certainly could be. 

Our position is you can't redraw the lines 

purely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to 

that I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v. 

Larios. In that case, the district court found that 

population deviations, sufficiently small that they 

weren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't 

pass the rational basis test because the only 

explanation you could offer for those deviations was 

that they were systematically attempting to help the 

Democrats at the expense of the Republicans. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but are you saying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say that mid-

decennial districting is suspect or subject to some 

special rules, then it seems to me that you're --

you're taking away a very important deterrent that 

works on legislatures when they do decennial 

districting. If you know as a legislature, when you do 

a decennial districting, that your program is going to 

be presumptively valid or not subject to partisan 

gerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're 

liable to overreach. And it -- it seems to me very 

dangerous for this Court to take away that control 

mechanism that exists so that legislatures know that

there's a possibility that if they overreach, they can 

be corrected. 

MR. SMITH: That -- that might be a concern, 

Your Honor. I don't think the -- the historical 

practice supports it because the fact is that while 

there's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting, 

whatever one wants to call it, in the last several 

decades, there have been precious few, if any, examples 

of anybody trying to convene the legislature before the 

next census to try to fix it. It is extraordinarily 

rare. And the reason for it is we -- there's a general 

tradition we've established in this country that 

whatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if 

it's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next 

time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that little -- even 

if it's done by the court. I like the way you slipped 

that in. I mean, even if you had a general rule that 

you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census, 

surely there ought to be an exception unless -- which 

-- which would read, unless the districting you're 

living under was never decreed by the legislature, but 

was decreed by a court. And that was the situation 

here. Surely, that's a good reason, even if you

adopted your general proposition. 

MR. SMITH: The -- the reason I -- I slipped 

it in is that in my description of what I think is the 

current tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked 

and found how many court-drawn congressional district 

maps have there been in this country in the last 40 

years, and how many times were they redrawn by the 

legislature. And the answer is that if you go back 

between 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only 

two of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways, 

one in Hawaii where they only have two districts and 

then the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas. 

It's not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'd say that's a shame 

for the democratic process. I -- I don't like the idea 

that -- that there are a lot of districts out there 

that have never been drawn by the people, which is what 

the Constitution envisions. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the other thing 

I think about this -- this argument about that we have 

this -- this need to have a legislative plan is you 

invite an abuse of a different kind. If you -- if you 

say to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at 

the time when you have an undisputed constitutional 

obligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of --

of the decade, as long -- and you'll know that what 

that will do is it will give you the right to come 

along anytime you feel like it when you get your 

political ducks --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that the reason 

these lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the 

decade, because the majority party sat on its hands? 

MR. SMITH: That's absolutely what happened 

here, Your Honor. They didn't make any serious efforts 

to redo it. The only person --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought there -- the 

houses were divided. One party, one -- had one house; 

the other, the other. And so they were at loggerheads 

and they --

MR. SMITH: The reality is -- and the record 

-- there was discussion of this at trial by Senator 

Ratliffe -- there was not very serious effort to do 

this at the time. The only person who can call a 

special session -- and it does take special sessions in 

Texas to get these lines drawn historically -- is the 

Governor. He declined to call any special sessions 

when they -- when they had a divided legislature. Of 

course, 2 years later, when they had unilateral control

of the whole legislature, we were calling special 

sessions like mad to get the job done. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the court -- even from 

the court's perspective, was it the same three judges 

that did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered 

plan? And I thought that the -- the judge who presided 

told us in his latest opinion that they never 

anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed, 

they tried to stay as close as they could to the then-

existing plan. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, there was some 

language to that effect. If you go back, though, and 

read the opinion that the -- the judges wrote in -- in 

2001 when they actually were describing in meticulous 

detail their process of drawing the map, he 

specifically said then that they didn't follow the old 

lines, that they used neutral criteria like compactness 

and following political subdivisions, and that they --

this was not an effort to -- to come up with a map that 

matched the old map. 

The only thing that I think really fairly can 

be said about the court-drawn map is it did give a 

separate district to all of the incumbents, which is 

what you'd expect a court to do. They're not going to 

sit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have

to run against each other. And so it did have that 

effect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage 

to continue on. 

But it is -- it is not true that the -- that 

the court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond 

that. The court specifically said otherwise in 2001 

when it drew the map, and then it said in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're not -- we're 

not trying the court for a bad intent. We're looking 

at the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of 

what it's done is to leave in place something that's 

slanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor 

of the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's 

-- there's a ground for the new legislature to act. 

And -- and one -- one reason legislatures may 

not have redrawn plans often is because they always 

protect incumbents. 

MR. SMITH: But, Your Honor, the facts are 

that it wasn't slanted. The facts are the experts both 

testified from both sides at the trial that the map was 

fair to both parties and that it contained 20 

Republican districts. And that's what the court found 

too in 2004. Then we have an appeal and we go back 

down on remand, and suddenly we're starting to hear 

about vestiges of gerrymanders. But the court didn't

withdraw its finding of fact that there were 20 

Republican districts in its own map. 

That's true. I mean, look at the way the 

votes were cast in 2002. There were 20 Republican 

districts in the map. The six districts that these 

Democrats represented who they -- who they -- the 

moderate Democrats that they were targeting -- the 

average vote for statewide office in that district was 

something like 65 percent -- 55 to 65 percent for the 

Republican candidate. 

I -- I looked, for example, yesterday at the 

-- there was an election for the Attorney General in 

Texas in 2002. It was an open seat, two -- two non-

incumbents running against each other, two people from 

Austin. And the average vote for the Republican 

Attorney General candidate, Mr. Cruz's boss, in that 

election in those six districts was 62 percent for him 

and 38 percent for the -- the Democrat. So these were 

not Democratic districts. This was not a gerrymander 

in any rational use of the word. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Smith, may -- may I ask 

you to comment on -- on one problem that I have with 

your position that has nothing whatever to do with the 

-- with the fact that there was a -- a judicial 

redrawing in the first place here?

 If I understand your argument, you're saying 

that a -- a districting that takes place prior to the 

report of a new decennial census, which is done for 

purely political reasons, maximizing political 

advantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under 

the Equal Protection Clause. 

MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And yet, I take it it's also 

your position that if the districting is done in 

response to the new decennial figures so that there's a 

need to do something to conform to one person/one vote, 

that there is nothing illegitimate about political 

motivation, at least up to some point --

MR. SMITH: Right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in -- in drawing the 

lines at that time. 

How can we in principle say that the 

motivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow 

constitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995? 

MR. SMITH: It seems to me that one is not 

saying that it's legitimate in 1991. One is saying 

that in redistricting, which is a messy process, we 

tolerate a lot of mixed motives. We tolerate some 

consideration of race. We -- we ask for some 

consideration of race. We tolerate some consideration

of politics. But that is dramatically different under 

the rational basis test from a law that is passed 

solely for political reasons because it doesn't have 

the other kinds of interests that are being promoted 

and protected in -- at the beginning of the decade. 

And so there's a drastic difference, it seems to me, 

under the rational basis analysis between a law which 

serves a lot of purposes, some governmental and public, 

some of them private, and -- and not legitimate bases 

for governmental action. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're making the 

assumption that a mid-decennial districting is not 

interested in compactness, it's not interested in 

counties, it's not interested in keeping a university 

within one -- within one district. That's -- that's 

just simply not true. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the fact 

here is that the only reason they decided to change was 

for partisanship. That's what the district court found 

as a matter of fact. 

Now, the other legal requirements of -- of 

the map that are -- give you the -- the legitimate 

bases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the 

decade were already satisfied because such a map 

already existed. And as this Court said in -- in

Growe, the -- the court-drawn map, in some sense, 

changes the status quo. You have to say what are the 

additional governmental interests that are -- that 

exist and justify going through this process again and 

changing that map, which already is fully lawful, has 

been affirmed by this -- this Court as lawful. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, both to the 

Justice Kennedy and -- and to me, ultimately comes 

down, I guess, to saying that political partisanship 

alone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other 

motivations, is per se wrong. 

MR. SMITH: It's -- it's not a basis that can 

justify public conduct, State action. If -- if it was, 

then it would be perfectly okay, I suppose, to have 

government subsidies for some parties and not for 

others, or to have -- let some people use public 

facilities and not others. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's -- let's 

assume that the -- that the partisans who do the mid-

term redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for 

partisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we 

can do. And the limits are the traditional ones, 

compactness, et cetera. Let us assume that there is, 

in fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to 

conform to those districting principles. Under those

pose is what is the justification for doing anything, 

not -- not for any particular line --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but how 

about the question that I posed?

say, we are -- we -- we decided to redraw the old map 

because it was so departed -- it's so departed from 

these important principles and values like compactness 

and respect for subdivision -- so if that's our reason 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm -- in a way, I'm 

making it easy for you. I'm saying, look, they're --

they're saying we think we can get a better deal for 

our party, but we are respecting these districting 

principles. Equally illegitimate? 

MR. SMITH: I think so, Your Honor. If all

they're saying is we -- we didn't go as crazy as we 

could have, but the only reason we did anything is 

because we want more seats, but we could have done even 

worse, that seems to me not a -- not a justification 

for action, but merely a -- a decision not to -- to be 

more political than purely political. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have with 

that is that it is -- it is impossible -- I think you 

would agree. It is impossible -- and may, indeed --

let's assume undesirable -- to take partisanship out of 

a political process. And -- and if partisanship pure 

and simple, even though subject to the discipline of 

districting principles, is -- is illegitimate, then I 

don't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of 

any districting at any time. 

MR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, our -- our 

submission is it makes a difference when it's pure 

rather than merely one of the many things that is going 

on. 

If I could take a few minutes just to talk 

about our section 2 argument with respect to the 

African American --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you do that, may I 

just ask one short question? 

MR. SMITH: Sure.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You've mainly attacked the 

plan as a whole in your briefs. And I'm wondering. I 

often look at particular districts, as you may know. 

Are there residents of districts 23, district 24 that 

are plaintiffs? 

MR. SMITH: We have plaintiffs in every 

district, I think, on the whole map, certainly any 

district that would raise a concern under --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not identified 

easily --

MR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, but -- but I 

think that there -- there was a -- in the complaint 

there's allegations about where each of these people 

live, and I think that -- that we were very careful to 

make sure anything we were talking about specifically, 

such as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had --

we had plaintiffs. The -- the list is quite long. So 

there is standing, I think, for all of those arguments. 

Now, on -- on district 24, our submission is 

that under section 2, there ought to be protection for 

districts where the minority group does not have an 

absolute majority but where the evidence shows that it 

can effectively elect a candidate of its choice in --

in concert with a -- a predictable group of Anglo or 

sometimes Hispanic crossover voters, and that we think

on the facts of this case, this was such a district 

because the African Americans in every case were a 

large majority of the voters in the Democratic primary 

and the Democratic nominee, in virtually every case, is 

elected in this district regardless of what -- what 

race that person may be. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the 

percentage of the African American voters in the 

district as a whole? 

MR. SMITH: Citizen voting age population is 

26 percent, Your Honor. The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if -- if your --

if your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to 

any racial group that could influence an -- an election, 

I don't see the limits on your principle. 

MR. SMITH: That's not our -- our test, Your 

Honor. Our test is they -- they have to control the 

election, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had a 

situation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent 

another group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent 

controlled who was elected by siding with one group or 

the other group, then you would say that that was an 

influence district for that small -- the smallest group 

in the district?

 MR. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think that 

would work because I think the way we -- we view what 

you have -- you -- the group has to be able to decide 

who's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to 

see whether there's enough crossover voting to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Suppose there's a 

primary where it works that they can get on the ballot. 

Suppose we're looking at the general election. 

MR. SMITH: If -- if that group gets to 

decide who gets on the ballot --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Accept the hypothetical. 

MR. SMITH: Yes. If that group has -- has 

picked who gets on the ballot and their choice always 

wins the general election, I think that's not an 

influence district. That's -- that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the answer? I mean, 

you've read the briefs. The obvious reply to that is 

there are many, many districts in the United States 

where African American voters have a big influence on 

the Democratic primary. 

MR. SMITH: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: A lot. And there are a lot 

where the Democrat wins. So if your principle is 

accepted, says the other side, that means that any 

district that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't

be changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans 

can be changed. Now, if that argument is right, it's 

hard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle 

of constitutional law. So I want to see what -- what 

your response is to that. 

MR. SMITH: I think there are a number of 

limiting principles that apply here that -- that 

suggest we're not just coming in here and asking for 

the Voting Rights Act to become the -- the pro-

Democratic act --

JUSTICE BREYER: Obviously you're not. 

That's why I would like --

MR. SMITH: And -- and --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- you to say what 

specifically the answer to that argument is. 

MR. SMITH: The -- the -- first of all, there 

are not that many districts in which African Americans 

control the Democratic primary and then have 

predictable ability to see that person elected in -- in 

the general election. Where that is the truth, they 

then have representation of the kind that I think is 

valuable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 

Now, of course, there are going to be limits. 

One of them is De Grandy. They -- they only have 

rights up to a proportional level of their proportion

of the population. And by not respecting -- not 

protecting this kind of district, what you do is, in 

fact, condemn the people, the African Americans in 

Texas, to less than proportional representation because 

there is no other way to give them a district in which 

they have any possibility of -- of participation in the 

process and electing a candidate of their choice. This 

is the only place in Texas where it can be done. 

They're -- they are more than an eighth of the 

population, citizen voting age population, and they're 

only getting 3 districts out of 32 because the State of 

Texas chose to eliminate this district. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: This would be at -- least 

your criterion, whether we accept it or not, would --

would be more administrable if we're dealing with the 

elimination of a district than if we were dealing with 

the question of creating one. Do you take the position 

that the NAAC brief does that there really should be 

distinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking 

to create something new or preserve something which has 

been in place? 

MR. SMITH: I -- I perhaps have more faith in 

the ability of courts to predict the future than -- than 

that brief does, but -- but I certainly can imagine a 

rule where the court says, we're going to require that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA PERALES 

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-439 

MS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I will begin by arguing that Texas violated 

the Equal Protection Clause by making excessive use of 

race in its changes to district 23. After removing 

100,000 Latinos from district 23, the State used race 

to craft a razor-thin Latino majority. Abandoning 

political data, the State used census block 

redistricting to achieve 50.9 percent Latino voting age 

population. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In 23. 

MS. PERALES: In district 23, Your Honor. 

Thus, the State used race, as we contend, not 

only to protect an incumbent, but to give the false

impression of Latino support for that incumbent. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Focus for a minute just on 

the -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the 

lines to exclude some Latino voters. Just focus on 

that, not the later justification. The district court 

found that this was for political reasons, not racial 

reasons, even though it was a largely racial group that 

was removed. Do you attack that finding as clearly 

erroneous? 

MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do 

attack that finding as clearly erroneous. This case is 

really the flip side of Easley v. Cromartie because in 

this case Latino voters supported Republican and 

Democratic candidates. As the State asserts 

vigorously, Latino voters voted significantly and 

substantially --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt you just 

with one -- one question on district 23? Regardless of 

what the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering 

why is the district court's finding on intent relevant 

to the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is 

results? 

MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Stevens. The --

the test under section 2 is results, and that goes --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So that even if the intent

was primarily political, it would still violate section 

2. 

MS. PERALES: Yes, and we argue in our brief 

exactly that. But we hope today to focus in oral 

argument at least first on the Fourteenth Amendment 

violation, which is the intentional use of race both as 

intentional vote dilution, as well as the analytically 

distinct claim under Shaw v. Miller. 

With respect to the question whether Latino 

voters voted with such a high correlation -- and that's 

the phrase used from Easley v. Cromartie -- whether 

there was such a high correlation between Latino voters 

and Democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to 

justify removing them because of their race and then 

saying that they were Democrats, that nexus simply 

doesn't exist under the facts of this case. 

Besides the State's arguments and -- and the 

many assertions that it makes with respect to Latino 

voting support for Republican candidates and especially 

Congressman Bonilla, we also have Latino voting for 

Bonilla that rises and falls. If Latinos were close 

adherents to the Democratic ticket, you wouldn't see 

fluctuating support for Congressman Bonilla. You would 

see low and steady support if Latinos were Democratic 

voters. Instead, we see something very different,

which is Congressman Bonilla gaining support in the 

Latino community within his district up until 1996 

where the peak is 30 percent Latino support and then a 

steady decline over a series of elections, ending in 

2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found, 

Latino support for Congressman Bonilla. This is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that undermine 

the assumption that there's -- they're voting as a 

bloc? 30 percent of the group is voting for one 

candidate. Is that sufficient to establish a voting 

bloc? 

MS. PERALES: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Under 

section 2's question with respect to racially polarized 

voting, we would contend that voting as a bloc 70 

percent or subsequently higher than 70 percent to 90-92 

percent is enough under section 2 to satisfy the test 

whether Latinos are voting cohesively. Congressman 

Bonilla has never been able to garner a majority of 

Latino support, not more than 30 percent. 

But with respect to a somewhat different 

question, which is whether partisanship and race 

correlate so highly in district 23, that you can remove 

Latinos and in the hopes of being able to take the 

Democratic index down, we say that that kind of voting 

is not tight enough. In Easley v. Cromartie, of

course, the Court found that African American voters 

voted 95 to 97 percent for Democratic candidates across 

elections. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Does 

this go to motive or result? I mean, what if I'm --

I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I 

remove it for that reason? I'm not removing them for 

racial reasons. I'm removing them because I want to 

remove Democrats. And you're saying that if I have 

made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic, 

that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial 

decision? 

MS. PERALES: This Court made clear in Bush 

v. Vera that the State may not make exactly the kind of 

assumption, Justice Scalia, that you described. The --

the Court held in Bush v. Vera that you cannot use race 

as a proxy for partisanship. You cannot make that 

assumption. So if the State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that was 

because it was deliberate in that case, and that's not 

the hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed. 

MS. PERALES: In this case, we contend that 

the State removed Latino voters from district 23 

because they were Latino and that --

hypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice. 

MS. PERALES: That if the State --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm assuming --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I -- as I understood it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're removing them 

because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that. 

MS. PERALES: Then it is still wrong to take 

out 100,000 Latinos using that assumption. I mean, the 

-- the act that was done was to slice through the most 

Latino county in the United States, 95 percent Latino. 

The people were not removed anywhere else. Clearly, 

the State removed Latinos from this district and then 

said, well, we did it because we were aiming for 

Democrats. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But is it -- is it wrong 

under the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under 

section 2? 

MS. PERALES: It's wrong under both, we would 

argue in our brief. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But on Justice --

Justice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to 

remove Latinos as Latinos. And maybe the answer to 

that is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter 

whether your motivation is invidious or not. I don't 

know whether that's your position. But it -- if that's

not your position, then I think there's got to be a

MS. PERALES: We contend that in this case 

the removal is invidious because it was Latinos that 

were identified and taken out and then -- for 

incumbency protection, similar to what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that because there 

were no other Democrats who could have been identified 

and taken out? 

MS. PERALES: There's no testimony that the 

State considered ever taking out anybody else but the 

people in Webb County. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that the 

county was 92 percent Latino or something like that. 

MS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can you -- how can 

you possibly take out any substantial number of 

Democrats without taking out Latinos?

the State removed --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I -- I 

don't understand -- I think your argument is at cross 

purposes. I mean, the one point -- and you're making 

the point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly 

for the Democratic candidate. They voted as much as 30 

percent for Bonilla. But the Voting Rights Act is 

concerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically 

as a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice. Well, 

if they're 30/70, it's not -- it's hard to think of 

them as having a clear candidate of choice. So what 

does it matter whether they're in or out? 

MS. PERALES: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

under the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002 

was something very, very different. After 1996, when 

Mr. Bonilla garnered the high of 30 percent among 

Latino voters, not -- not in his district but among 

that group --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the percentage 

goes up, the percentage goes down. 

MS. PERALES: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It depends on who's 

running against him. At the low point, there was a 

popular Hispanic candidate running against him in some 

of those elections.

coverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular 

group is being denied the opportunity to elect a 

candidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if 

you're right that the -- the vote is split over time, 

depending on the circumstances in a particular 

election. 

MS. PERALES: No, Mr. Chief Justice, because 

this is bloc voting at rates of 70 percent or higher, 

and after 1996, that 70 percent bloc went to 80 percent 

and then it went to 90 percent. And as the voters 

became increasingly disenchanted, I suppose, with the 

incumbent, that decline was steady. It didn't 

fluctuate up and down. It was going down and it went 

down even farther. Mr. Bonilla was always opposed by a 

Latino candidate in each of his general elections that 

he's had since he's been elected. So that hasn't 

really been a factor for the voters. But as they 

became more cohesive and they reached 55 percent of the 

-- the registration in the district, they were poised 

to elect their candidate of choice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well, 

but then -- and this is why I say it's an argument at 

cross purposes. If you're right about that, then the 

assumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be 

voting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which

I thought was your -- your first point. 

MS. PERALES: We would contend, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that voting against Congressman Bonilla 

doesn't make you a Democrat. And it, in fact, 

highlights that the State was seeking voters, Latino 

voters, who had withdrawn their support for Congressman 

Bonilla as opposed to just seeking Democrats because you 

can vote against Congressman Bonilla and still vote 

Republican in other races, as Latinos did. And you 

could have been a former supporter of Congressman 

Bonilla. It doesn't make you a Democrat in that sense 

that race and partisanship are completely 

interchangeable so that the State can scoop in and grab 

100,000 people of the same race and then say later, 

well, we were taking out Democrats. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just the 

State that's saying it, though. You have a district 

court finding that ethnicity was not the predominant 

factor, that politics was the predominant factor. 

Maybe -- as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were 

right, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it 

was being done for political purposes not for ethnic 

purposes. 

MS. PERALES: We agree, Mr. Chief Justice,

incumbency protection, but a State may not use race as 

the means to the end of protecting an incumbent. What 

happened here was that the only group of voters who had 

shifted their support away from Congressman Bonilla 

were Latino. Democrats had never voted for Congressman 

Bonilla. The problem inside this district was not a 

problem of Democratic voters. It was Latino voters who 

had supported him and withdrawn. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can -- can the State 

use race as the means to an end of electing a new 

candidate that the race wants? And what should be the 

difference? 

MS. PERALES: It should turn on the candidate 

of choice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it sounds like 

you're going to say race cannot be used as this basis, 

but how can race be used not to protect an incumbent 

but to allow the group to choose the representative of 

its choice and then reelect him every year? 

MS. PERALES: Well, district 23 was created 

by the Balderas court pursuant to a finding under 

section 2. So it was a remedial district under section 

2 when it was created in 2001. And in 2002, when it 

was used as a remedial district, it -- it elected a 

Latino-preferred candidate in 13 out of 15 elections,

according to the State's expert, and came very close to 

unseating Congressman Bonilla. The State's response 

was essentially to punish Latino voters for voting 

against Congressman Bonilla by slicing them out of the 

district. So the State used race to achieve its end of 

-- of incumbency protection. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the -- if the 

objective is just to get rid of voters who vote 

against Congressman Bonilla, why is that an equal 

protection violation? It's not done for -- for race or 

ethnicity, but just to get rid of voters who vote against 

him. 

MS. PERALES: Because the group of voters who 

had withdrawn their support were Latino voters. The 

district court discusses the -- the interrelationship 

of these phenomenon in its opinion at jurisdictional 

statement appendix 128 when it says, the State acted to 

shore up the incumbency of Congressman Bonilla, and the 

next sentence is, his support among Latino voters had 

dropped to 8 percent. It was, in fact, the -- the 

voting behavior of Latinos as opposed to anybody else 

who had caused the incumbency crisis, and it was 

Latinos as Latinos who were removed from the district. 

At the same time, however, the redistricters 

sat down and figured out exactly how many Latinos they

wanted to leave inside this district to achieve a bare, 

razor-thin Latino voting age majority population, and 

that was done to give the impression of Latino support 

for the incumbent. The chief redistricter --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- and what 

relevance does that have? What provision of the 

Constitution prevents you from leaving a majority of 

one group in a district to create the impression that 

the district supports a particular candidate? 

MS. PERALES: The Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. 

Chief Justice, race may --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the 

Fourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating 

the impression that a particular group supports a 

particular candidate? 

MS. PERALES: This Court has held that race 

may not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and 

here race was used most gratuitously and cynically to 

make sure that the State could say a majority of 

Latinos in district 23 support Congressman Bonilla. 

The chief redistricter in the House, Representative 

Phil King, testified -- and this is expressed motivation 

-- that they sought to maintain a 50 percent Latino 

voting age majority in the district while making it 

safer for Congressman Bonilla, which involved pulling

Similarly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how many -- what 

percentage would they have shifted from making it look 

like a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51 

percent to when it would actually be one? What 

percentage does it shift from being looking like one to 

being one, both above a majority? 

MS. PERALES: Oh, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but 

-- but quite a distance. The -- as the Balderas court 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's the 

number? 

MS. PERALES: The voting age population for 

district 23, as created by the Balderas court, Your 

Honor, was a great deal higher. It was 63 percent, and 

that was what was able to give the 55 percent voter 

registration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your number? 

It has to -- anything short of 63, it's just looking 

like it? I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a 

very fine line between a -- in each case a majority 

Hispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a 

constitutional violation and in the other case, it's --

it's required by the Voting Rights Act. So what is the

magic number between 51 and 63? 

MS. PERALES: We would argue that race cannot 

be used for its own sake, that if you're going to put 

people together into a Latino majority district, it 

should be to meet a purpose, for example, to create an 

opportunity district under the Voting Rights Act. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the number? 

MS. PERALES: That would be -- well, 

depending on how many people it takes in that 

particular district to elect a candidate of choice. In 

this case it was 63 percent. It might be a different 

number for a different district. But your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this district 

were drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just 

to make it look like a Hispanic district? 

MS. PERALES: No, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. So what's the 

number? It's -- it's somewhat more than 51 percent 

because you're saying that's a constitutional 

violation, and I want to know how many more it takes 

before it becomes what's required under the Voting 

Rights Act. 

MS. PERALES: Maybe I can answer the question 

by going around to the court's finding, which was that 

district 23 was created not as a Latino opportunity

district, that it would not operate to offer the 

opportunity to elect the Latino preferred candidate. 

And the -- and the district court found this on page 

145-146 of our appendix to the jurisdictional statement. 

And in that same paragraph, they said, but it has a 

political nuance that Congressman Bonilla will be elected 

from a Latino majority district. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to 

get a number. If you're asking us to rule on a 

constitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what 

the number is that changes it from a political nuance 

to a Hispanic opportunity. 

MS. PERALES: That number would be the number 

that shows Latinos have the opportunity to elect their 

candidate of choice. It will be a different number for 

each district, but it would always be in the evidence 

of the case because the analysis is done on different 

districts. 

Here, all of the experts agreed that district 

23 had been created so that it would not elect a Latino 

candidate of choice, but that the State testified that 

it wanted to keep it voting age majority, that they did 

so because they wanted Henry Bonilla to run from a 

Latino majority district. The State abandoned 

traditional redistricting criteria to do so,

redistricting at the bloc level and splitting 6 

election precincts out of 51 in Webb County, which is 

wholly unnecessary even to equalize population in 

either district. There is no reason for the State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it have been 

better --

MS. PERALES: -- to have done that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it have been 

better in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics 

so it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district? 

MS. PERALES: Well, the State certainly could 

have moved Webb County whole out of the district. It 

depends on how they would have done the overall --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and that would 

have been preferable. It would have been preferable to 

you if it was, say, 45 percent Hispanic rather than 

50.8, or whatever it was. 

MS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, it -- it 

just doesn't hang on a particular number. It -- it 

turns on whether or not the district is an opportunity 

district, and if it isn't an opportunity district, why 

is the State sitting down and using race for its own 

sake to be able to say we got 50.9 percent Latino 

voting age population? We managed to zigzag that 

boundary through the streets and -- and through the

neighborhoods of the City of Laredo so that we could 

say it was a Latino majority district. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't one 

answer that we were doing it, number one, because we 

wanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use 

race to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2 

claim? You've got to use race for those purposes. 

MS. PERALES: Well, under section 5, the 

State went ahead and created district 25 as the offset 

because it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had 

been dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going 

to be able to be used for section 5 purposes. 

Similarly, under section 2, the State saw 

that it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to 

make an offset district which caused its own problems. 

So the use of race here to achieve the 50.9 

percent voting age majority was not to satisfy the 

Voting Rights Act, either section 5 or section 2. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you could have used that 

reasoning to create a district in the first place, but 

you cannot use that reasoning to create an offset 

district in the second place at the same time that 

you're trying to protect an incumbent. I think that's 

what you're saying.

percent voting age population here in this part of the 

State, it would be obvious that you weren't going to 

yield an opportunity district. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're 

saying that would be implausible as a section 2/section 

5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it. 

Is that --

MS. PERALES: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MS. PERALES: Yes, most certainly. 

This case represents an egregious use of race 

in redistricting. Without the Equal Protection Clause 

to protect minority voters, States will have free rein 

to use race to manipulate not only electoral outcomes, 

as it did here, but also the complexion of a district 

in order to be able to express some kind of symbolic --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But, of course, you want 

them to use race to manipulate outcomes. It's just 

sometimes.

comply with the Voting Rights Act, yes, Justice Scalia, 

it is appropriate. It was not appropriate here.

Mr. Cruz. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ 

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES 

MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The central issue in resolving these various 

challenges to mid-decade redistricting is determining 

which institution is constitutionally vested with the 

primary responsibility for redistricting. Elected 

legislatures or Federal courts. 

In Texas, for the first time in 12 years, the 

legislature acted to adopt a congressional 

redistricting map. That map, in turn, replaced one of 

the most profoundly anti-majoritarian congressional 

maps in the country with a map that reflects the 

demonstrated preferences --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask, General 

Cruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered 

map or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map? 

MR. CRUZ: The legislature replaced the 

court-ordered map, but the court found as a factual 

matter that the court-ordered map, in the court's 

words, quote, perpetuated the 1991 Democratic Party 

gerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its

own map with the same judges. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't think it 

really perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering 

that was present in the earlier map, do you? 

MR. CRUZ: Well, the court's map, under the 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you. 

MR. CRUZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it did? Do 

you think --

MR. CRUZ: Yes, we do. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the court-ordered map is 

just as bad as the Democratic map? 

MR. CRUZ: The district court found that it 

had blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under 

the district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were 

reelected. So the identical outcome was yielded. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is your opponent 

correct in saying that in six of those districts, the 

Democrat won even though the district was majority 

Republican? 

MR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and then 

the district court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that sound like a 

gerrymander?

 MR. CRUZ: It -- it depends. The districts 

were drawn such that the Democrats who were running 

were incumbency. And the reality of congressional 

elections is that incumbency is a tremendous advantage, 

and in the face of incumbency --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was going to say I --

if I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to 

leave majority other party districts in which the 

people from the other party were voting for a candidate 

from my party with some regularity. I'd want to do 

that. That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to 

do. 

MR. CRUZ: And that's exactly right. These 

districts were drawn to protect incumbents. 

It is notable that if one looks on a national 

level, the 2001 map drawn by the court led to the most 

anti-majoritarian results of any of the 50 States in 

the Union. There were only two other States with more 

than five Members of Congress that saw a minority of 

voters electing a majority of the delegation, and those 

were Illinois and Tennessee. In each of those, 49 

percent in Illinois elected one extra seat to Congress; 

in Tennessee, 48 percent. In Texas, by contrast, 45 

percent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the 

overall State vote elected not just a one-seat

majority, but a two-seat majority. And so on any 

national level, the prior map was the most profoundly 

anti-majoritarian. 

Now, this Court resolved in -- in Vieth that 

majoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but 

that being said, as Mr. Smith characterized in Vieth, 

he characterized the fundamental principle of democracy 

-- and this is Mr. Smith's characterization -- is the 

principle that a majority can elect a majority of the 

delegation. 

And as this Court concluded in Gaffney v. 

Cummings, achieving political fairness, achieving a 

rough sense of proportionality, such that a majority 

can elect a majority of the delegation, is not only 

legitimate, it is salutary. It is --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I -- I wrote 

an opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you 

on that, and I wonder if -- if then the thing to do 

would be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw 

a map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a 

majority of the congressional delegation. But when 

they do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance 

that it works the same way for both parties. I mean as 

a standard. I thought my standard worked before. I 

guess there wasn't that much agreement, but -- but --

 (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- from the point of view of 

-- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm 

glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it 

works out the same way for both. 

MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under the standard 

articulated in your opinion in Vieth, in our judgment 

the result would be a straightforward affirmance here 

because the map that was adopted is precisely what was 

advocated in Vieth of a majority of the population 

electing a majority of the delegation. 

That being said, the question here is not 

whether that is required. Indeed, it is ironic. In 

1992 the Republicans in Texas brought a political 

gerrymandering challenge to the predecessor map here, 

and that map was rejected -- that challenge was 

rejected under Bandemer, and the district court in 1992 

told the Republican plaintiffs -- said even though this 

may be tilted against you, there is nothing to prevent 

you, over the ensuing decade, from running candidates, 

from building support, and from eventually taking 

control by electing your candidates to the machinery of 

government and adopting a map you deem fair. 

That -- those words of the district court 

prove prescient because that is precisely what happened

over the ensuing decade, and it is equally true today. 

There is nothing in Texas to prevent the Democratic 

Party from doing the exact same thing over the ensuing 

decade if they can command a majority of votes at the 

polls. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question? Assume you're correct that as a whole the 

plan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth. 

Does that necessarily mean that every district within 

the -- the plan is immune from constitutional attack? 

MR. CRUZ: Of course, it does not, and there 

are a variety of district-specific attacks. The 

plaintiffs have framed their partisan gerrymandering 

attack as one that focuses on the map as a whole. And 

-- and the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. 

MR. CRUZ: -- and the reason for that is that 

in the Vieth decision, Justice Kennedy's concurrence 

was the controlling concurrence, and it set out a 

standard for subsequent partisan gerrymandering cases 

that litigants should find a, quote, substantive 

definition of fairness in districting that commands 

general assent. 

Rather than attempt to meet that challenge, 

the plaintiffs have refused to discuss effects at all,

and that's not by accident because any assessment of 

effects would yield that the current plan is more fair 

than the predecessor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the -- the next 

question I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible 

there can be a single-district challenge, what is the 

justification for the -- the cracking of district 24, 

which was a majority Democratic district before, into 

five different districts, none of which would elect a 

Democrat. 

MR. CRUZ: The legislature made a policy 

judgment, and under the decision --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it -- is it defended 

by anything other than political motivation? 

MR. CRUZ: There were a host of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean in district 24. 

MR. CRUZ: There were a host of judgments 

about the multiple districts that district 24 was 

broken into, and the district court found, for example, 

that Representative Grusendorf wanted the City of 

Arlington contained in one single district. There were 

a whole host of specific motivations about the 

surrounding districts that were drawn. 

Indeed, the district court said on remand 

that appellants' argument ignores, as it must, the

reality that the lines are infused with the myriad 

mixtures of local politics and accommodations, often 

inconsistent with overall objectives of partisan gains. 

That was the district court's finding on remand, that 

there are a host of decisions here that have nothing to 

do with partisan gain, that have to do with drawing a 

map that are the constitutional responsibility of a 

legislature in drawing a redistricting map. 

Appellants frame their basic challenge on 

partisan gerrymandering because they cannot look at 

effects, because any examination of substantive effects 

yields the conclusion that the current map is much more 

fair than the prior. They disavow any examination of 

effects. Instead, they frame it as solely partisan 

intent, which has never been the standard under this 

Court's precedents. But even under that standard, they 

base it on a simple syllogism that is found nowhere in 

the Court's precedents, a syllogism that says because 

there was an extant legal map in place, the 

redistricting was unnecessary. And so anytime there is 

a court map, it is unnecessary redistricting. 

The problem is appellants raise a false 

dichotomy because every legislative redistricting is 

voluntary. Whether it is Texas in 2003 or Pennsylvania 

in 2001, the legislatures face a binary choice. They

can act and adopt their legislative policy preferences, 

or they can not act, in which case they know with an 

absolute certainty that a court-drawn map will govern 

the election that follows. In Pennsylvania, to be 

sure, it was a map that would be drawn subsequently, 

but the decision is the same. Does the legislature act 

to embody its preferences or does it allow a court-

drawn map to govern the elections in the States? 

And I would note the consequence of the rule 

that appellants are urging is that it would create an 

enormous incentive for the minority party in every 

State to attempt to deadlock the system, to shut down 

at the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a 

map because if they're able to deadlock the system, if 

they are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State 

and no map passes, the consequence of that -- they 

would know for certain under appellants' rule -- is a 

court will draw the map. And under the Upham standard, 

the court map will reflect the preexisting policy 

judgments of the predecessor legislature. So any 

minority party has an incentive. If they can stop it 

from happening at the beginning of the decade, they 

have an incentive to seek a better map.

 MR. CRUZ: Indeed, yes. That -- that is 

predicated upon a preference for a decade ago rather 

than what would be adopted now. 

The Framers chose political checks for the 

problem of partisan gerrymandering. They assigned 

principal responsibility to elected State legislatures 

whom they certainly knew would care a great deal about 

politics, and they assigned supervisory authority to 

another elected legislature, Congress. 

The appellants point to a host of perceived 

policy problems about the specter of seriatim 

redistricting of legislatures coming back every 2 years 

and tweaking the line here and tweaking the line there. 

To the extent that is a problem, Congress is the 

institution constitutionally authorized to address it, 

and there is no indication that there is a looming 

threat of seriatim redistricting. It didn't happen 

here. It was the first time in 12 years the 

legislature had acted. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, could I ask 

you another district-specific question? Because I want 

to get it on the table and let you explain it to me. 

Focusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the 

moment -- and I -- I know you probably disagree with 

this but -- that the results of the redrawing of

district 23 violated section 2, would you say that it 

would be a defense to that violation that the 

motivation was actually non-racial but purely 

political? 

MR. CRUZ: As the hypothetical is -- is 

asked, the answer would be no. But -- but the 

difficulty is if the motivation -- if there's a 

violation of section 2, a political motivation does not 

excuse it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Not a defense. 

And the second question for me is that if 

there were a violation in district 23 of section 2, 

could it be cured by creating a district -- the 

district farther to the east. I forget the number. 25 

I guess it was. Would that be a cure in your -- in 

your judgment? 

MR. CRUZ: The Court has concluded before --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Given what the Court said 

in Shaw II. 

MR. CRUZ: Right, right, that -- that a -- a 

section 2 violation in one area cannot be corrected 

with a discrete change in a different area. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. CRUZ: However, in De Grandy, the Court 

also said that the assessment is the totality of

circumstances in the region under assessment. And in 

the totality of circumstances, the district court made 

factual findings against the plaintiffs that they 

cannot demonstrate were clearly erroneous. Indeed, 

that -- that is the problem with all of the district-

specific claims that all of the sets of plaintiffs have 

brought is that this was tried in a full trial. The 

district court took testimony, made credibility 

determinations --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Except for the fact the 

district court really didn't find a violation in 

section 2. They didn't quite, as I'm suggesting, say, 

well, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it 

and have a defense by what we do in -- in district 25. 

And I don't think De Grandy is an answer to that, and 

I'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my 

question. 

MR. CRUZ: If they are wholly different areas 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. CRUZ: -- the Court has concluded no. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. CRUZ: If they are --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the argument -- the 

question then would be whether district 25 is a wholly

different area from district 23. 

MR. CRUZ: That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do we look 

at to determine that? I know what we said in De 

Grandy, but I mean how -- I mean, you talk about the 

south and west Texas. I mean, on the other hand, 23 

and 25 are actually not that close together. So how do 

we know that we should be looking at all the way from 

El Paso to the Gulf, as opposed to a narrower area? 

MR. CRUZ: They are not that relatively close 

together, but -- but that is because this region of 

Texas is -- is vast and -- and relatively lightly 

populated. And so district 23, for example, runs 800 

miles in length because you've got miles and miles of 

-- of desert land and open ranch land with very low 

population. 

The way the Court did it in De Grandy, which 

is also the way the Court should do so here, is to look 

at what the parties agreed to and how they litigated 

the case. 

In this case, everyone litigated the district 

23 section 2 claim with a focus on south and west 

Texas. Indeed, what speaks volumes is that if one 

examines the demonstration map that the GI Forum 

appellants introduced, which is at their -- their

appendix to their jurisdictional statement, page 241, 

that map only covered south and west Texas. They 

proposed no districts for the rest of the State. They 

were focused --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I didn't 

understand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section --

district 25 at all. 

MR. CRUZ: It did not, and -- and, indeed, 

she has never joined in the racial gerrymandering claim 

that has been brought by the -- by the Jackson 

plaintiffs. Her claim has focused on -- as -- as it 

concerns racial gerrymandering, not that the 

legislature did too much of it, but -- but in a sense 

that it should have done more. It should have been 

more aggressive in seeking to create majority minority 

districts. And -- and the district court has factual 

findings that rule against those claims. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Would a -- I'd like you to 

elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim, 

particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree 

that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for 

it somewhere else. You agree they can't make up for it 

particularly when their only way is for political 

reasons. But your argument is they never violated --

that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.

 MR. CRUZ: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it 

didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what? 

Because you have the three preconditions which seem to 

be met, and then you have some kind of -- it doesn't 

violate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the 

preconditions, there is some kind of overall 

proportionality. But all that is rather unclear in my 

mind, and I want to know what your view of it is. 

MR. CRUZ: There are multiple reasons, 

Justice Breyer. As an initial matter, the district 

court found on page 131a of the Jackson appendix to 

their jurisdictional statement that CD 23 was not an 

effective minority opportunity district. So that's a 

direct finding that the -- that the old CD 23 was not 

an effective minority opportunity district. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why was that? 

MR. CRUZ: Because the -- the data 

demonstrated that a majority of Hispanic voters were 

not able to elect their candidate of choice. Although 

Congressman Bonilla consistently commanded a 

significant percentage of Hispanic votes, he did not 

command a majority, and the candidate for whom a 

majority voted did not prevail in the congressional 

election.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that somewhat 

inconsistent with the decision to reshape the district? 

Why did they do it then? 

MR. CRUZ: What the legislature did -- the 

legislature's express intention was to shore up 

Congressman Bonilla's electoral chances, and -- and it 

was explicitly because Congressman Bonilla is a valued 

member of the delegation and the legislature made a 

judgment that they wanted to increase his margin of 

victory. If one --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and in your view, 

that justification allows the creation of district 25, 

which has, as far as Latino population, people of quite 

different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know, 

the -- the two-ended -- the district on the two ends. 

MR. CRUZ: We did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that to me was --

was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a 

serious Shaw violation. And -- and the two are really 

linked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by 

virtue of what it did in 23, that the State claims a 

right to do what it did in 25. 

MR. CRUZ: We did not place our principal 

emphasis, with respect to 25, on the Voting Rights 

Act's concerns potentially raised by the alterations in

23. That was a motivation, but it's not our principal 

motivation. Our principal argument on 25 is that there 

are a series of factual findings the district court 

made that are not clearly erroneous and, indeed, we 

would submit, are -- are completely supported by the 

record to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a -- a 

section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as 

opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23? 

MR. CRUZ: The legislature was certainly 

concerned about section 5, and with respect to the 

adjustment in -- in district 23, it was possible that 

the Department of Justice might deem the alteration of 

district 23 to be something that would be retrogressive 

and, accordingly, having a district that was -- a 

performing Hispanic opportunity district would increase 

the chances of preclearance. So -- so that was a 

factor in the consideration, was a desire to comply 

with section 5 and also to comply with section 2, 

although section 5 was the -- the principal focus of 

the legislative discussion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it permissible for 

a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and 

ethnicity in account -- into account in drawing a 

district?

 MR. CRUZ: This Court has never squarely 

resolved that. This Court has assumed in the racial 

gerrymandering cases, assumed without deciding, that 

compliance with the Voting Rights Act is a compelling 

interest. And the -- the districts that have been 

struck down have been struck down as not being narrowly 

tailored. Although we advance that argument, we don't 

have to prevail on that argument for district 25 to 

survive the racial gerrymandering claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as to 23, do you want 

this Court to say that it's constitutionally 

permissible to take away a number of minority voters 

from the district, but leave just enough so that it 

looks like a minority? Is that a permissible use of 

race? It -- it seems to me that's an affront and an 

insult. 

MR. CRUZ: Except the district court found as 

a factual matter that what happened in district 23 was 

wholly political. It was not racial, so that the 

voters were not removed because of race. They were 

removed because of politics. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but the 

additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make 

it -- to make it look good. 

MR. CRUZ: The -- the legislature was aware

of -- as this Court has said, the legislature will 

always be aware of the racial composition of a 

district. But the legislature specifically -- for 

example, unlike Bush v. Vera, there are no bloc-level 

cuts based on race. Indeed, in district 23, what the 

legislature did, by and large, is go straight down 

Interstate 35 which cuts right in the middle of Webb 

County. Now, if one considers Webb County, there --

there are two halves of it. There is the half that 

moved into new district 28. Now, those voters 

presumably cannot complain about being disenfranchised 

in that. At least the Hispanic voters there are now in 

a unquestionably performing Hispanic opportunity 

district that elects an Hispanic Democrat to Congress. 

The remaining voters in Webb County -- in 2004, 

Congressman Bonilla carried a majority of Webb County, 

and so it is difficult to see who is being 

disenfranchised, given that both halves of Webb County 

are electing a Congressman for whom a majority of their 

voters are voting. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- in -- in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in contrast to that, 

however, you could not make that argument or -- or that 

response with respect to -- to district 24, the

district in which the -- the Black vote was -- was 

cracked. And in response to earlier questions from 

Justice Stevens, you -- you mentioned there were a 

number of motivations for dividing it up the way it 

did, and -- and yet, as you also acknowledge, those 

differing motivations don't answer a -- a section 2 

argument. What is your answer to the section 2 claim? 

MR. CRUZ: Well, as you know, Justice Souter, 

purpose under the '82 amendment is irrelevant to 

section 2. It is an effects-only test, and -- and the 

district court had a series of factual findings, most 

of which appellants did not even challenge until their 

reply brief, each of which is independently sufficient 

to defeat their claim. The -- the district court found 

against them on all three prongs of Gingles, and those 

findings were fully supported by the record. 

As an initial matter, the appellants 

attempted to frame this as debating the legal question 

over whether 50 percent is an absolute barrier. The 

district court concluded that it needn't resolve that 

question because the facts here presented no 

opportunity to determine if there might be some 

tolerable deviation below 50 percent. In this case, 

African American voters in old district 24 comprise 

less than 22 percent of the voting age population.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but following Georgia 

and Ashcroft, isn't -- isn't that a possibility that we 

should consider as a satisfaction of what has come to 

be known as the -- you know, the first of -- of the 

Gingles factors? 

MR. CRUZ: In our judgment, Georgia against 

Ashcroft expanded the flexibility for States to 

determine how to comply with the Voting Rights Act. 

Georgia against Ashcroft obviously was a section 5 

case, and it determined that in considering 

retrogression, that opportunity districts and influence 

districts should both be considered. It surely did not 

mean that there was a cause of action now for any 

plaintiff to argue that any conceivable influence 

district must be drawn. That goes entirely against the 

central theme of Georgia against Ashcroft, which is 

that States have flexibility in choosing a 

representational model for voters in that State. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it is not 

inconsistent with Georgia and Ashcroft to say that for 

-- for much the same reason, States have less 

flexibility in cracking influence districts once they 

have been established. 

MR. CRUZ: That might perhaps be true if the 

plaintiffs could demonstrate the other Gingles prongs,

but on the second and third prong, the district court 

found that African American voter cohesion was far from 

clear and there was absolutely no cohesion between 

African Americans and Hispanics in district 24. 

Indeed, they voted in an almost completely polar manner 

in Democratic primaries. 

And third, the district court found that 

there was not Anglo bloc voting. 

And so all three of the prongs -- what the 

district court found as a factual matter is that 

district 24 functioned as an Anglo Democratic district. 

And indeed, this case is unusual in that there were 

some extraordinary direct testimony that the way 

district 24 operates is not accidental, that in 1991, 

it was explicitly drawn by Anglo Democrats for the 

specific purpose of electing Anglo Democrats and only 

Anglo Democrats. And that was testimony not from a 

State witness but from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice 

Johnson, a Democratic African American incumbent from 

the adjoining district who was in the State legislature 

in 1991, and she said the African American population 

there was deliberately split up to create a district 

that would be -- elect white Democrats. That direct 

testimony is extraordinary and it shows that what the 

data demonstrate, which is that white Democrats control

the district -- and that's what the district court 

found as a factual matter -- is not an accident. It 

was precisely the intended effect of the map-drawers. 

Indeed, if one looks to the three races that 

the appellants' experts examined that were African 

American versus Anglo in the primaries, of those three 

races, an African American candidate of choice who was 

Black prevailed in only one. 

Of the 20 races appellants' experts examined, 

of those 20, only one Black candidate prevailed, and 

that case, the district court found, was aberrational 

because that candidate was Ron Kirk. He was a former 

mayor of the City of Dallas. He was a very popular, 

local politician with a strong friends and neighbors 

effect. 

If you take that aberrational case out, the 

two other cases appellants' experts looked to both 

showed that the African American candidate, one of whom 

was supported by 76 percent of African American voters, 

lost. And indeed, what happened was the Anglos and the 

Hispanics voted in virtual unison against the African 

American candidate. 

That data -- if one looks to the endogenous 

races, there had never been an African American 

opponent to Martin Frost, or the exogenous races, those

three we talked about -- the data demonstrate quite 

persuasively that African Americans were drawn into a 

district where they did not have an equal opportunity 

to elect their candidate of choice because they lacked 

the ability to elect a Black candidate. Now, they 

could choose to do otherwise, but in this district, 

they could not choose to elect a Black candidate. And 

that was the district court's finding and that's what 

the data demonstrated. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I move 

you south and west again, back to district 23? How do 

we tell -- as redrawn, it had what? 50.8 percent. And 

I gather that that's not considered a Hispanic 

opportunity district because of lower voting turnout, 

registration, participation? How do we tell when 

something is being done to make it look like a Hispanic 

district and, instead, when it's being done for the 

opportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity 

district if voter turnout and registration are 

increased? 

MR. CRUZ: The district court made a finding 

that the reason district 23 was altered was to increase 

the chances of Congressman Bonilla prevailing. And in 

particular, if one looks to Webb County, which is the 

county that was split, Webb County centers on the City

of Laredo. And in 2002 -- the race that the GI Forum 

appellants focus on principally -- the candidate that 

ran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a 

popular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a 

very strong following in Laredo. And as a consequence, 

Mr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within 

slightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr. 

Bonilla's percentage of the -- of the Latino vote 

dropped to its lowest historic point. 

That, as the district court found, was also 

aberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local 

support, and the clearest evidence of that is under the 

new map, when half of Webb County was placed in the 

adjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran 

against the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro 

Rodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which 

demonstrates that his success was because the -- the 

voters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and, 

accordingly, voted for him against either opponent, 

Henry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez. 

And so, when the legislature was determining 

which section of voters to remove for political 

reasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr. 

Bonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County, 

was a natural place to move voters who had in the last

election demonstrated they would vote for his opponent. 

Under any assessment of 23, the prior map had 

five districts that were indisputably Hispanic 

opportunity districts, plus district 23 that elected 

Congressman Bonilla, an Hispanic Republican. The 

current map has six districts that are indisputably 

Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 which 

elects Henry Bonilla. So the result is the same in 

district 23, and there is an additional Hispanic 

opportunity district in district 25. 

If I may turn to district 25 and return to 

Justice Kennedy's questions earlier about racial 

gerrymandering with respect to that district. 

The first indicium this Court has looked to 

in racial gerrymandering case -- cases is unusual or 

bizarre shape, and on that indicium, this district does 

not fall anywhere near the districts this Court has 

struck down as racial gerrymanders. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the reason 

the lines are straight is nobody is there. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CRUZ: But those counties have to be 

placed in some district. And -- and so the appellants 

call a series of seven whole contiguous counties a land 

bridge, but those are very sparsely populated counties.

 In whatever district they're in, they're going to have 

to connect with a population zone. And what the 

district court found as a factual matter is that the 

elongated nature -- the relatively elongated nature of 

district 25 was a function of the geography and the 

fact that you have population along the border and then 

you have a large space of relatively low population, 

and then you have to get back up to population. So 

Texas historically has run north-south districts to get 

enough population to form a congressional district 

under this Court's one person/one vote precedents. 

District 25, if one examines -- the district 

court expressly found that the plaintiffs failed to 

prove purposeful discrimination. The State defendants 

introduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was 

precisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie 

decision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages 

331 and 332 of the joint appendix. And what that 

analysis did is precisely what this Court found in 

Cromartie I was sufficient on summary judgment to 

defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering. 

It assessed the lines in Travis County, the 

northern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts 

the legislature made driven by politics or driven by 

race. And so what the State's expert did is drew a map

that would be based on race that would maximize the 

Hispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis 

County. He then compared that map to the map that the 

legislature had drawn and said what are the differences 

between what it would look like if the legislature was 

attempting to maximize race as compared to what it 

would look like if it was attempting to maximize party. 

And what the State's expert found is there was on the 

order of a 1 percent differential which is you're 

talking between 24 and 25 percent. So it was about 4 

percent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's 

map and more Democrats in the State's map. And so what 

the State's expert found is precisely along the lines 

as the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had 

drawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking 

for Hispanics. 

In addition, if one examines the two 

numerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and 

perimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured 

8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's 

reconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was 

8.6 Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low. 

As a -- as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29, 

and 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had 

perimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as

compared to district 25's score of 9.5. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, if you've 

finished your answer -- I didn't want to interrupt you, 

but that makes -- reminds me of a question I wanted to 

answer you because -- ask you, rather, because you make 

a very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found 

very helpful, that the -- a State should be able to 

correct a prior gerrymander by -- for -- with political 

motivations. 

I would like you to comment on this 

suggestion. Supposing we said they have an absolute 

right to do that with one caveat, that any new district 

has to be more compact -- no more -- no less compact 

than its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of 

problems? 

MR. CRUZ: That could be a salutary policy 

goal, and -- and Congress could certainly enact that. 

But I -- I see no -- no source in the Constitution 

placing that requirement upon States particularly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: We have -- we have quite a 

history, as you just identified in your response to 

Justice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly 

grotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these 

tests of compactness for use in this very litigation. 

And the fact that the lawyers have come up with this

approach to it makes me think maybe it does have some 

relevance to the whole problem we're trying to 

confront. 

MR. CRUZ: At an extreme level, lack of 

compactness can indicate something was going on. If 

one looks at the districts this Court has struck down, 

if you look at Bush v. Vera -- and we have in the joint 

appendix the silhouettes of those districts that were 

-- you know, had fingers going out in every direction. 

There's plainly something questionable going on. 

These districts are nothing like that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: When I -- when I was 

thinking about this problem, I looked at district 24. 

The thing that was interesting to me is that most of 

the neutral justifications that you describe -- and 

they're certainly in the -- in the five new districts 

that replaced it, but in the key part of the population 

that was moved, it becomes much less compact than it 

was before. 

MR. CRUZ: The -- the new map --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which it seems to me quite 

significant. 

MR. CRUZ: The -- the new map was somewhat 

less compact than the prior map, but it does --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And its particularly --

particular reference to the targeted group that was 

moved out of the district. 

MR. CRUZ: But lack of compactness does not 

-- no one has brought a racial gerrymandering claim 

with respect to districts other than 25 and, to some 

extent, 23, although the 23 challenge is not a typical 

racial gerrymandering claim. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm suggesting the 

challenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering 

challenge. 

MR. CRUZ: I understand that, although a 

majority of the Court in Vieth concluded that in order 

for a political gerrymandering claim to succeed, that 

there must be a substantive standard for fairness to 

measure the map against some baseline. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's the standard I'm 

suggesting. Right. That's exactly the point. 

MR. CRUZ: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The compactness standard. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. CRUZ: But the Court had before it --

appellants urged in Vieth compactness, principles of 

cracking, principles of packing. One of the dissenting 

Justices advocated that standard, and yet, a majority

of the Court -- the plurality explicitly rejected it. 

And Justice Kennedy's concurrence explicitly rejected 

the standards discussed in the dissents, including a 

standard looking to compactness. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that Justice 

Stevens is suggesting that as a standard. He's 

suggesting it as a disqualifier. If it's not as 

compact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's --

I -- I don't think he's suggesting it's okay. So we 

still don't have a standard. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I was suggesting that 

would be a safe harbor, and -- and it would just --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A safe harbor from an 

unknown standard. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Jump in whenever you 

want. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CRUZ: Under any standard that looks to 

the substantive lines on the map, anything that -- and 

we have spent hours racking our brains trying to think 

of a standard for litigation purposes that would yield 

the old map being more fair than the new one. We're 

not aware of any coherent standard that looks to 

substance.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this. 

Suppose you have a court that's required to 

redistrict, and the court has two experts. Expert 

number one says, here is a plan. It's totally partisan 

in its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and 

the Republican registration. It gives them exactly 

proportional representation. Plan number two gives 

minimal consideration to this, but it's compact. It 

takes into account geography, communities of interest, 

and so forth. Would the district court be in error if 

it adopted the first plan? 

MR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that question 

actually was litigated in this case, the first time in 

2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the 

new map. One of the arguments that was presented to 

the district court was that the old map was no longer 

consistent with how Texas voters were voting. And the 

district court concluded that under the Upham case, it 

lacked the authority to take that into account and to 

change the demonstrated policy preferences of the last 

legislative map. And that's why, on remand in this 

case, the district court found although it didn't 

intend to work partisan bias, that that was the effect 

of its map. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my hypothetical

is designed to suggest that partisanship, political 

lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to 

a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the 

hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court 

for abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing 

political considerations. And then if that's true, it 

means that there is some standard lurking out there 

indicating that political considerations should be of 

at least secondary importance. 

MR. CRUZ: In this case, the district court 

was presented with maps that would be more fair on --

on pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what 

the district court concluded is it didn't have the 

ability -- that making that judgment was a political 

judgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it. 

And so it drew in the districts it was required to draw 

because Texas had two new districts. It drew in what 

it believed the Voting Rights Act required, and beyond 

that, it made as few changes as possible. 

And so the district court recognized that the 

consequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever 

partisan bias was there before is reflected in its own 

map that just neutrally carries over the preexisting 

bias. And that's why the district court found it was 

perpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to

do so, but because it was consciously restraining 

itself from doing anything to alter the partisan 

composition other than to carry over what was already 

there. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- district 24. I take 

it -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like. 

And the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to 

the record here, I'll discover a finding that the 

district court made. They said this was not an effort 

to use race to district. Is that right? 

And one of the reasons that you think that is 

because, although it's not a circle, it's not 

absolutely terrible. That -- that is a supporter of 

the ultimate conclusion they did not use race. Is that 

right? 

MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, that's -- that's 

exactly correct --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then if I -- if I --

so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what 

it says. 

Now, suppose I came to a different 

conclusion. Then you might still win on this point if 

the rationale for using race to district was because we 

want to avoid a section 2 violation. And there, you 

would lose, however, because you can't use that

rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the 

district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably 

compact. So, again, you'd have to say that this 

district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably 

compact for that other purpose. Is that right? 

MR. CRUZ: Well, although we would submit 

this district is reasonably compact. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, so I understand that. 

But -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this 

apple with your reasonably compactness. One, you want 

to say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to 

use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that, 

it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a 

reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2. 

MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, you're correct 

that if the Court concludes this district is not 

reasonably compact, then under its precedents, it 

wouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting 

rights violation, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: And is there anything I can 

look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that 

second --

MR. CRUZ: Well, the district court's finding 

was that Texas geography and population dispersion 

limit the availability of district compactness in

southern and western regions of the State, and that was 

at the Jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a. So 

that's -- there's -- there's a challenge in Texas 

because you've got these --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 

district 25. Right? 

MR. CRUZ: 25, yes. Yes, we're talking about 

25. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, 25. 

MR. CRUZ: 25 has seven whole counties and 

only two county splits, which is unusual. Most of the 

cases that this Court has struck down what it's 

perceived to be racial gerrymanders have been a number 

of county splits. In this case, the county splits --

those were mandated to -- because we have achieve 

perfect equipopulosity, so we had to get exactly, 

within one person, precise lines. But within -- in 

between the two, they are whole contiguous counties 

that are longstanding geographic units. 

The testimony is clear that the -- the 

legislature made no effort to avoid Anglo voters. It's 

not like they snaked around. And even the lean of it 

is a simple fact that the Gulf of Mexico leans like 

this, and it follows the geographic boundaries of the 

State, so that if one examines this district next to

the other districts, it follows historic lines that 

have been used in Texas. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, why wouldn't 

it be a -- at least a helpful guide to what is 

reasonably compact to compare with the preceding 

district? Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I 

understand. Wouldn't that make -- make sense if the 

reasonable compactness is -- is one of the tests? 

MR. CRUZ: One could certainly compare the 

preceding district, and with respect to the preceding 

district, the differential is -- is not great. It is 

somewhat more compact. 

But there were other policy agendas the 

district court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When you're carved out of a 

couple of preceding districts, which is the preceding 

district? I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with 

that test? 

MR. CRUZ: That -- that is a certainly a 

challenge. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose if you have a 

plaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in. 

MR. CRUZ: You know, if you compare, for 

example, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6. 

You know, if -- if one looks at, for example, the plan

1385 submitted by GI Forum, that has one plan, district

to-area score of -- of 10.0. And indeed, the district 

court found as a factual matter that the demonstration 

plan submitted by the GI Forum appellants was -- was 

less compact and critically would not perform. 

Going back to the section 2 question about 

district 23, the district court found that one district 

in the demonstration plan, district 28, had only a bare 

majority of citizen voting population, 50.3 percent, 

and there was undisputed testimony that for a district 

to perform in this region, it had to have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they have --

why did have just 50.3 percent? 

MR. CRUZ: Because the Hispanic population is 

dispersed enough that one can't -- one can't draw --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're doing that to 

make it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic 

support in that district? Is that --

MR. CRUZ: We did not ascribe motives to 

them. They -- they drew it to demonstrate that -- that 

you could draw a district with a bare majority of 

citizen voting population, although their experts also 

testified that a bare majority will not elect in this 

region because of lower voter -- voter turnout.

 JUSTICE BREYER: On the -- either it is

Vera case in the first place. And if it isn't, you 

can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a 

section 2 violation. 

MR. CRUZ: Correct, but with respect to the 

question of racial gerrymandering, this Court's 

question is, is race the predominant motivation? 

There's a direct factual finding by the district court 

that it was not. Indeed, the district court said that 

the -- that the measures of compactness, examined in 

relationship to the geography and population, reflect 

the sheer size and population distribution of this 

area, rather than a calculated stretch to find voters 

of a particular ethnic makeup. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean 25 -- the -- the 

Latino makeup of 25 is accidental? 

MR. CRUZ: It is a function of the population 

in south and west Texas. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's accidental. 

MR. CRUZ: The -- it is not accidental in the 

sense that the legislature was unaware of it, and as this 

Court has said, whenever a legislature is districting, 

it is aware of the -- the racial distribution. But it

was drawing an additional district there, and the 

district court found that in drawing those lines, it 

did not reach out to segregate voters on either side 

based on race, that that was not its intent and that 

was not the effect of what it in fact drew. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to 

Ms. Perales' argument that the -- the numbers are just 

too precise to have been reflective of anything but a 

racial motivation, and that, therefore, the -- the 

district court's finding was clearly erroneous? 

MR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that concerns 

district 23, and -- and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't they equally precise 

here? 

MR. CRUZ: No. District 25 is -- has a -- a 

large majority on Hispanic voting age population and 

also citizen voting age population. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I misspoke. Okay. 

MR. CRUZ: With respect to district 23, 

there's an unusual aspect to the GI Forum appellants' 

argument in that it's unlike a typical racial 

gerrymandering claim where they say you're -- you're 

seeking to draw lines based on race. She's arguing 

they should have been more aggressive drawing lines on 

-- based on race, which is -- which is not an argument

that sounds in the Shaw line of cases. What the 

district court found is that it was purely a political 

motivation that drew that decision, and if one is 

looking to the Voting Rights Act, under any assessment, 

the district is performing identically as it did 

before. 

And on the totality of circumstances, either 

based on the region, in which case their argument --

argument is one for maximization -- they have six of 

seven districts. They're arguing they're entitled to 

seven of seven districts -- or on a statewide basis, 

the district court found totality of the circumstances 

was met. 

With respect to district 24, the findings --

the -- two of the three findings, with respect to Anglo 

bloc voting and cohesion, the appellants have made no 

attempt to get around other than in their reply brief, 

they have -- have briefly challenged them. But it was 

their own expert who provided the information that the 

district court found credible, that there was no 

cohesion, that African Americans couldn't elect their 

candidate of choice. And it is undisputed that in new 

district 9, African Americans can elect their candidate 

of choice. And so from a statewide -- from a totality 

of circumstances perspective, the ability to elect a

candidate of choice for African Americans in the State 

is higher under this map than it was in the preceding 

map. 

In sum, the basic question here is whether 

courts or legislatures are the principal decision-

makers. If appellants' proffered rule is adopted, it 

removes the safety valve that the Constitution 

provided. It is rarely employed because it is rare 

that one finds a plan so out of step with the 

demonstrated preferences of voters for a decade. We 

are aware of no other plan that allowed a minority of 

voters who never crossed the 44 percent threshold to 

control the majority of the delegation. We're aware of 

no other map in the country. 

And so if there is a standard that this is 

impermissible, that consequence would either elevate 

courts above legislatures, contrary to the 

constitutional text and to 4 decades of this Court's 

precedents, or if it looks to substance, it would call 

into question the districts in a host of other 

districts because on any objective measure, the 

districts in Texas are fair as a partisan matter, 

compared to the other States, compared to the 

predecessor map, compared to any metric that one 

applies. Indeed, the social scientists say, based on

the seats/votes curve, that given that Republican 

voters are currently voting at roughly 60 percent for 

Republican candidates, one would expect a higher 

percentage of Republican candidates elected than --

than what this map is yielding. And so on any coherent 

measure of a substantive measure of fairness, this map 

should survive. 

If there are no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES 

MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The United States' participation in this case 

is addressed to the Voting Rights Act issues, and our 

position is that the district court properly concluded 

that the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority 

voting strength in either the Dallas/Fort Worth area or 

the south and west region of the State. The district 

court based that conclusion on factual findings that 

are entitled to great respect on appeal and that 

preclude appellants' section 2 claims under this 

Court's decisions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if you agree 

with General Cruz, that if the results of the 20 --

section -- district 23 violated section 2, it would not 

be a defense that was politically motivated? 

MR. GARRE: I -- I think that's right, 

Justice Stevens, insofar as --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And would you also agree 

with the second question I asked as to whether if it 

were a violation -- I understand you don't think it was 

-- it would not be a defense that they were able to 

create a district -- a Hispanic district in another 

part of the State. 

MR. GARRE: Well, that's true in the context 

that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we 

don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply 

to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of 

Texas in this case. And that's because in Shaw II, the 

Court found a violation in the southern part of the 

State and considered the question as to whether a 

creation of a district in a completely different part 

of the State, the middle of the State with no 

connection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and 

the Court said no. 

This case deals with a section 2 claim which 

is addressed to a particular region of the State, a

region that's marked by its high concentration of 

Hispanic citizen voting age population, as well as 

common geography and other factors. And we know that 

the claim is addressed to that particular region of the 

State because that -- that region is the focus of the 

plaintiffs' demonstration plan. Mr. Cruz referred to 

it. It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional 

statement. That's the plan that they claim they're 

entitled to under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 

and it's addressed to the entire part of the State. 

So in that situation where you've got a claim 

where you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim 

addressed to a particular region of the State, we don't 

think that the Shaw II principle would come into a play. 

Here, we don't think there's any section 2 violation 

with respect to the elimination of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that based on the 

premise that section -- that district 25 and district 

23 are in the same part of the State? 

MR. GARRE: Yes, not just the same part of 

the State, but a part of the State that falls within 

the section 2 -- within the focus of the plaintiffs' 

section 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked 

by its high concentration of minority citizen voting 

age population.

 In -- in the De Grandy case, this Court 

confronted a very similar problem where you had one 

part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida, 

which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen 

voting age population, and the State was drawing 

various districts in that part of the State. And the 

Court looked to those districts and considered whether 

there was a proportional representation of the minority 

group in that area and -- and found that, under the 

totality of the circumstances, there was, and 

therefore, there was no violation of section 2. 

Here, you have a situation where the district 

court found that the citizen voting age population in 

the south and west part of the State was 58 percent, 

and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85 

percent majority minority districts in that area, which 

is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's 

plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a 

majority of citizen voting age population. 

The decision within that area of where to 

draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and 

this Court's precedents leaves up to the States. And, 

in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in 

particular considered the situation where a district 

line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up

that neighborhood. The Court discussed it on page 1015 

of its decision. And it said that the fact that the 

district line went through that neighborhood and had an 

effect on minority voters, in terms of which district 

they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2 

violation. 

And we think the same principle would apply 

here, where the fact that the district lines separating 

district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State 

near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is, 

after all, not -- not surprising given that the large 

percentage of the population in that part of the State 

is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2 

violation. 

The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part 

of the State really sounds very much in a section 5 

retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made 

clear in the Holder v. Hall case that retrogression 

principles of section 5 are not applicable in section 2 

cases. And we certainly think that that principle 

holds here and that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases that --

that we've issued from this Court that address what 

happens in a case like this where the economic 

circumstances and many other circumstances of the two

Latino populations are very different? The border 

Hispanics and the Hispanics in Austin have very -- very 

little in common other than -- than the Latino 

background. Are there -- are there cases that address 

whether or not these populations can be combined in --

in order to satisfy the -- the Voting Rights Act 

requirements? 

MR. GARRE: Well, I don't know of a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have we talked about that? 

MR. GARRE: -- specific case that has 

addressed that concern. I suppose it would go perhaps 

to the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors. 

I mean, what -- what is clear under this 

Court's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the 

Court has to take into account the totality of the 

circumstances in the area, not just the rough 

proportion -- the existence of proportionality between 

the Hispanic population and the number of districts in 

which they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances 

that could bear on the region. 

And the district court in this case conducted 

that analysis and it found, under the totality of the 

circumstances, that there was an -- that there was not 

a section 2 violation in the south and west region of 

the State. And we certainly think that that finding is

entitled to respect under the clearly erroneous 

standard that this Court applies in reviewing findings of 

-- ultimate findings of vote dilution. The Court has 

-- has said repeatedly that it will not disturb such a 

factual finding unless it is left with the definite and 

firm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we 

don't think the record in this case would support such 

a conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim 

in the south and west or the section 2 claim in the 

Dallas/Fort Worth area. 

As we have explained in our brief, that claim 

-- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim 

-- fails because of the district court's finding that 

African American voters in old congressional district 

24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in 

that district in the sense that they would be unable, 

in a contested election, to put their candidate, the 

African American candidate, into office. That finding 

too is supported by ample record evidence and we think 

could not be set aside under the standard that this 

Court applies. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible it violates 

section 2, the following? We look at the map as it's 

drawn. We ask the question, is there a way to redraw 

this map so that, say, the minority group has a more

significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera, 

et cetera? Gingles. Answer: Of course, there is. 

It's the old way. And you say, well, why didn't you do 

it the old way? Well, the only reason you didn't do it 

the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a 

sufficient justification. 

MR. GARRE: Well, I don't think that would 

bear on the typical section 2 analysis this Court 

would apply. The -- the plaintiffs bear the burden of 

coming in in a section 2 case, which is, after all, a 

claim that the State is forced to draw a district in a 

particular way, to show the demonstration district in 

which the three Gingles factors can be met. And this 

case is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming 

up with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to 

the old district, which in itself is -- is similar to 

more of a section 5 claim. 

But with respect to that district, the 

district court failed -- failed to -- the district 

court found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first 

Gingles precondition, which is that they could not show 

in that district that they had the ability to elect the 

candidate of their choice because African Americans 

were 22 percent of the population in that district, the 

third largest racial group, and because other evidence,

including the past elections in that district and 

direct testimony of politicians with intimate 

familiarity of that district, supported the logical 

conclusion that a group that comprises only 22 percent 

of the electorate --

JUSTICE BREYER: I was thinking of district 

23. 

MR. GARRE: Oh, I'm sorry. With respect to 

district 23, again I -- I think the -- the framework 

for the plaintiffs' challenge to section 23 is the 

south and west region of the State in a claim that they 

were entitled to a seventh -- a seventh effective 

majority district in that part of the State. The 

State's plan, 2003 plan, gives them six majority 

minority districts. The plaintiffs, GI Forum --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- not 

including 23. 

MR. GARRE: Not including 23. That's right, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

They claim that they're entitled to a seventh 

majority minority district. The district court 

rejected that claim because it found that they had 

failed to show that the seventh district that they drew 

would be an effective district because it only had 50.3 

percent citizen voting age population --

MR. GARRE: The GI Forum drew. That's right. 

And again, that's at page 241 of the GI Forum 

jurisdictional statement. 

It found that that district was not effective 

because it only had a 50.3 percent citizen voting age 

population, and the district court found, based on the 

testimony that showed that Hispanics have a 

comparatively low turnout rate in elections, that a 

50.3 percentage wouldn't do the trick to give them the 

potential to elect.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH 

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276 

MR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

As I understand the State's argument, it is 

that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that 

was served in passing a new map in 2003 was to 

eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal 

district court in 2001. I submit to you that's an odd 

use of the word in a couple of different senses.

 First of all, as the experts for both sides 

found and as the court itself found, that -- the court-

drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way. It did 

not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that --

that hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members 

of Congress. So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem 

with the old map was that a minority of voters were 

controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue. 

What happened was that Republican districts 

chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of 

Congress who happened to be affiliated with the 

Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but 

that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the 

delegation. 

The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another 

way because the map that replaced it, of course, is 

terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both 

sides agreed. It totally flunks any -- any kind of 

standard analysis about bias in a map to the point 

where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of 

how anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going 

to produce majorities that are going to average about 

-- margins of victory that are about 40 percent in --

for the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain 

votes over time.

 Now, it's a dangerous road we're going down, 

I submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of 

partisan festival every couple of years adjusting the 

lines. Now, we've had three States redo their 

congressional districts already in this decade, and if 

this Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start 

seeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around 

the country. 

There's another particular aspect of this 

that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you 

get further into the decade, the census numbers get 

older and older and more and more out-of-date. And 

what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census 

numbers over here, they know where the real people are 

over here, and they can exploit that differential using 

the old census numbers. So it seems to me that even if 

you're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose 

for redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to 

require the States to come up with fresh numbers. The 

population -- one person/one vote requirements are so 

incredibly strict in the congressional area. Simply to 

sort of assume that these people can use the old 

numbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after 

the census seems -- seems mistaken to me and it does 

invite terrible abuse. There -- and there are

mechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States 

really feel it's important to do so. 

Let me then turn, if I might, quickly to 

respond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about 

what the record shows about the intent for taking the 

-- the African American community in Fort Worth and 

sending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak. That intent is 

set forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional 

statement appendix where the map-drawer himself -- his 

testimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to 

find a Republican district in the -- in the 

neighborhood that we could -- we could tack them onto 

that could sort -- that could, quote, handle that 

particular component of the current county population, 

which is to say a district sufficiently Republican that 

they would be completely disempowered for the rest of 

the decade. 

Now, there was -- there was a comment from 

Mr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a 

Anglo -- Anglo Democrat to win. The district that --

that was talked about in the testimony was the district 

drawn in 1991. What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that 

in 1996, that district was completely changed by a 

Federal district court in Bush v. Vera. The old 

district went way down into the southeast into the
