2  (10:03 a.m.)


3  JUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in


4 Rompilla against Beard. 


5  Mr. Nolas.


6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS


7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8  MR. NOLAS: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it


9 please the Court:


10  Profound mitigating evidence concerning Mr.


11 Rompilla's life history was not heard by the capital


12 sentencing jury in this case because his trial counsel did


13 not secure a single scrap of paper about his life history.


14  As to the trial prosecutor, his argument, what


15 he elicited from the defense witnesses, and what he


16 presented affirmatively sent the message to this jury of


17 future dangerousness. 


18  When the jury inquired whether in Pennsylvania


19 there is parole from a life sentence, they were not given


20 the simple, straight answer that Pennsylvania law clearly


21 indicates, no. Instead, they were told -- instead, their


22 question was not answered.


23  What I would like to do, unless the Court has


24 specific inquiries, is to make certain points about the


25 ineffectiveness issue and then turn to the sentence issue.

1  As to the ineffectiveness issue, Your Honors,


2 this Court has made very clear in Williams v. Taylor, in


3 Wiggins v. Smith, reiterating the concept established


4 originally in Strickland v. Washington, that a trial


5 defense counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough


6 investigation for mitigating evidence in a capital case. 


7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're asking us, I


8 suppose, to make a rule that you have to get paper


9 records. We've seen a number of capital cases, you know


10 -- as you know. This counsel seemed to me to be quite


11 articulate and -- and had a very sound theory of -- to


12 argue to the jury for mitigation. It didn't work, of


13 course. I -- I just don't know what constitutional rule


14 you want to ask us for, that you have to look at record


15 evidence? 


16  MR. NOLAS: We are not asking the Court to set a


17 constitutional rule that a capital defense counsel must


18 obtain records in every capital case. We are asking this


19 Court to apply the rule articulated in Strickland v.


20 Washington itself where the Court indicated that counsel


21 has a duty to make a reasonable investigation. 


22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you had three forensic


23 experts, outside experts, and they didn't seem to think


24 the papers were relevant either. 


25  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. And as to the


Page 4 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 experts themselves -- and that's actually -- the experts


2 and the family are the core of respondent's argument


3 against Mr. Simmons' claim. 


4  The simplest answer is to look at Wiggins v.


5 Smith where this Court held very clearly that the


6 retention of mental health experts sheds no light on the


7 reasonableness of counsel's life history investigation. 


8 That is especially appropriate in this case because in


9 this case the counsel who had contact with the experts


10 testified very clearly at the post-conviction hearing that


11 the experts were never asked -- never asked -- to develop


12 life history mitigating evidence. And as my friend, Ms.


13 Zapp, indicates in her brief at page 43, there was no


14 tactical decision in this case by counsel to not pursue


15 life history mitigating evidence. 


16  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel -- counsel did


17 make use of several relatives of the defendant who


18 testified. I -- I think weren't there about four


19 relatives who testified?


20  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, including his son. 


21  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And he talked to all of them


22 and talked to the defendant as well. So would a


23 reasonable person think that's enough to find out family


24 history and -- and the concerns that you had?


25  MR. NOLAS: This Court made very clear in


Page 5 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Strickland and Williams and in Wiggins that an assessment


2 of counsel's representation must be done from counsel's


3 perspective at the time. Counsel's perspective at the


4 time, as Ms. Dantos clearly testified at the hearing, was


5 that the family were not good sources of information for


6 petitioner's life history. She gave three reasons for


7 that. 


8  She said, number one, whenever life history was


9 pursued with them, they did not want to deal with it


10 because they thought he was innocent. 


11  Number two, whenever they were -­


12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that seems to me an -­


13 an extraordinary non sequitur. I don't understand. They


14 didn't want to deal with it because they thought he was


15 innocent. I -- how does that make any sense?


16  MR. NOLAS: That -- that's what she testified


17 to, Your Honor. I'm not -­


18  JUSTICE SCALIA: What she testified to makes no


19 sense. 


20  MR. NOLAS: She gave a second reason which was


21 that counsel, when they pursued life history mitigation,


22 the family would respond, we hardly know him. He was in


23 juvenile facilities as a youth, and then he was in prison


24 as an adult. We don't have any knowledge of his life


25 history. 


Page 6 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the -- the portions of


2 his life history that -- that are the most appealing are


3 the portions from his youth, before he went into the -­


4 into the juvenile institutions, and they were certainly


5 with him during that period.


6  MR. NOLAS: And third and most significantly,


7 Justice Scalia, she testified that they were not willing


8 to provide life history mitigating -- facts about his life


9 history because of, quote, whatever else was going on with


10 them, unquote. Or as Mr. Charles, the other attorney, put


11 it, these were not the type of family that would provide


12 information when asked. 


13  Bear in mind, both of these counsel knew what


14 the respondent's post-conviction rebuttal psychologist


15 testified to, that when you're dealing with abuse,


16 neglect, a dysfunctional home, people don't want to talk


17 about that. They want to withhold that. 


18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me take you back


19 to the -- to the experts. You say he did not specifically


20 ask the experts to go -- to go into his childhood


21 problems. You know, I can imagine when the expert comes


22 on the stand, the first question being asked is, now, Mr.


23 Expert, were you told by counsel to look into the


24 childhood problems? You know, as though counsel were


25 planting in the expert's mind what the expert should say. 


Page 7 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 What would anyone who hires a psychologist or a


2 psychiatrist -- what would anyone expect him to look into


3 in -- in determining whether the person is -- is mentally


4 injured but -- but the childhood? Do you really think


5 counsel could not have expected with total assurance that


6 these people would do that?


7  MR. NOLAS: Sure, because counsel themselves


8 testified to that at the post-conviction hearing and the


9 experts themselves said -- now, let me --


10  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas?


11  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. 


12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't it the case that those


13 experts were hired not primarily or even secondarily for


14 mitigation purposes? They were hired in connection with


15 the possibility of a defense at the guilt stage, number


16 one, that he was insane at the time he committed the


17 crime, in which case what he was when he was a child would


18 be irrelevant, and number two, that he was presently


19 incompetent to stand trial. So they were asked


20 specifically to inquire into his present mental situation,


21 and their testimony was relevant to the guilt phase of the


22 trial. So that's the instruction. Naturally they -- what


23 -- why are we engaging you? We're engaging you to tell us


24 do we have a basis for an insanity plea, do we have a


25 basis for an incompetent to stand trial plea.


Page 8 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and the -- the


2 respondents use the word mitigation that Ms. Dantos used


3 in her testimony. I only ask the Court to look at the


4 joint appendix at page 472 where Ms. Dantos says very


5 clearly, I explained to them the purpose for my contacting


6 them, and the purpose was to initially see if there was


7 any issue of mental infirmity or mental insanity for the


8 guilt phase and subsequently to possibly use in mitigation


9 any mental infirmity if it -- if the jury came back first


10 degree. 


11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there any indication that


12 after the guilt phase was over and before the sentencing


13 phase began -- I take it it was just a matter of hours or


14 almost days till the sentencing -- till the sentencing


15 phase began. Was there any contact with the psychiatrists


16 or with experts after the sentencing phase and the -­


17 pardon me -- after the guilt phase and before the


18 sentencing phase?


19  MR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. The record is very


20 clear that the experts were asked, as Justice Ginsburg


21 indicated, about mental infirmity at the time of the


22 offense. They reported back that they could provide no


23 assistance in that regard, and then there was not further


24 contact with them. They were also asked about competency,


25 which is not at issue before the Court.


Page 9 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  The -- the key thing to bear in mind is you can 

2 look through Ms. Dantos' entire testimony and look -- you 

3 could look through Mr. Charles' entire testimony at the 

4 hearing. Nowhere do they say we asked the experts to 

5 develop life history mitigating information. This isn't 

6 the case where the lawyers say to the doctor, Doctor, I'm 

7 looking into this man's life history, go investigate it. 

8 Tell me what there is. Tell -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what you just quoted 

10 said that they -- that they would intend it to be used in 

11 the mitigating phase. 

12  MR. NOLAS: Mental infirmity at the time of the 

13 offense at the penalty phase, not life history mitigation, 

14 not how did he do in school, was there abuse in the home, 

15 was there neglect in the home, was their mistreatment in 

16 the -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- doesn't all that 

18 bear upon mental infirmity at the time of the offense? 

19 Isn't the reason that -- that one considers these factors 

20 mitigating is that they reduce the guilt at the time of 

21 the offense? I -- I thought that that's the whole -­

22  MR. NOLAS: No, Your Honor. That is -- with all 

23 due respect, that is too constricted a view of what -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we just let him off 

25 because we're -- we're sympathetic to his present state? 

Page 10 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 I thought that mitigation means that it reduces the guilt


2 of the offense at the time that he commits it.


3  MR. NOLAS: It's -- it's not let him off, Your


4 Honor. It's a -- a request to the jury, that was out for


5 over 12 hours, that this man receive a life sentence. 


6  And you've already resolved this issue in


7 Wiggins v. Smith. In Wiggins v. Smith, counsel hired a


8 mental health expert, provided that expert 200 pages of


9 DSS records, provided a PSI, had the expert interview all


10 of Mr. Wiggins' family members, had the expert report back


11 on, quote/unquote, mitigating evidence, and this Court


12 found that counsel had failed to provide reasonably


13 diligent effective assistance because counsel had not


14 developed life history mitigating evidence. 


15  JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nolas, you haven't


16 mentioned it, but didn't one of the three experts suggest


17 that there be a -- a follow-up inquiry into the -- the


18 abuse of alcohol by the defendant? 


19  MR. NOLAS: Dr. Gross suggested that there be a


20 follow-up inquiry into -- into alcohol, and that -­


21  JUSTICE SOUTER: My understanding is that


22 nothing was done in response to that. Is that correct?


23  MR. NOLAS: In response to that, the reasonable


24 thing would be why did this man's parole records indicate


25 that he should abstain from alcohol. Let's look into his


Page 11 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 alcohol history. 


2  And to back to -- to your question, Justice -­


3  JUSTICE SOUTER: Which -- which you're saying


4 they did not do. I mean, just to get it -­


5  MR. NOLAS: They testified that what they did


6 they asked -- they asked the other experts to look into


7 it.


8  And bear in mind, all of the experts in this


9 case had less than the expert in Wiggins. All of the


10 experts in this case had less than the expert in Williams. 


11 What these lawyers gave the expert is a client that they


12 themselves said is not a reliable source of information, a


13 client who did not want to discuss his life history, a


14 client who misled counsel, a client who these lawyers said


15 we can't rely on -- on this fellow. 


16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nolas, there were some


17 records that the prosecution sought and used. Was it -­


18 the records that were in the very courthouse.


19  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, and that was, I


20 guess, the simplest way to respond to Justice Kennedy's


21 original question, which is what is the duty that these


22 lawyers have. Well, at its simplest, in Wiggins this


23 Court said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough


24 investigation for mitigating evidence, a thorough


25 investigation into the aggravation. The trial prosecutor


Page 12 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 tells these counsel, I'm going to use that information in


2 that file against your client.


3  The file was maintained in the same courthouse


4 in which this case was tried. Counsel never goes and


5 looks at that file. When the prosecutor brings it to the


6 penalty phase, they complain, we've never seen this file


7 before. In that file -­


8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What did the prosecution use? 


9 The fact of early -- early conviction and the details of


10 the crime. Right?


11  MR. NOLAS: And the transcript that's included


12 of -- in that trial of the prior offense victim's


13 testimony. 


14  But the thing is what if these lawyers what -­


15 what I -- I hope this Court would expect any lawyer to do


16 when the prosecutor says, I'm going to use that folder


17 against you. You go and you open up the folder. 


18  JUSTICE SOUTER: And what would they have found?


19  MR. NOLAS: They would have found achievement


20 test scores in that prior conviction case file indicating


21 that Mr. Rompilla had never progressed beyond the third


22 grade, indicating that he functions below 96 percent of


23 the population. He lived a nomadic life. He -- and -­


24 and test results indicating that he was elevated on scales


25 for schizophrenia, paranoia, neurosis, indicating that he


Page 13 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 grew up in a slum environment, and that he was an


2 alcoholic, bearing in mind Dr. Gross' original inquiry. 


3 These are also lawyers who knew that Mr. Rompilla had a


4 juvenile history and had a prior adult criminal history.


5  And Pennsylvania lawyers know -- we've discussed


6 this in the brief -- that PSI records, presentence reports


7 in Pennsylvania, and juvenile records are very special


8 things compared to such records in other States. In -­


9  JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nolas, are you telling us


10 that all that information would have -- was in the file


11 that described the -- the criminal history that the


12 prosecutor used in his case? 


13  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens. 


14  JUSTICE STEVENS: And they didn't even look at


15 that file?


16  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Justice Stevens, what I just


17 read to you. 


18  Now, Pennsylvania lawyers -­


19  JUSTICE BREYER: Is this the document that's on


20 the lodging at page 31-34?


21  MR. NOLAS: If I may have Your Honor's


22 indulgence for a moment. Yes, Your Honor. 


23  That -- because in this case, that prior


24 conviction court file contained records that were produced


25 when Mr. Rompilla was evaluated for that prior conviction.


Page 14 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  One point that I don't want to escape this 

2 Court's attention is in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania 

3 Supreme Court and Pennsylvania -- the Pennsylvania 

4 statutes indicate that presentence investigation reports 

5 and juvenile records have to contain information relating 

6 to, quote, educational history, psychological history, 

7 marital history, family history, military history -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you want us to adopt a 

9 constitutional rule that at least in Pennsylvania counsel 

10 have to consult these -- these records -­

11  MR. NOLAS: When -­

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as a constitutional matter. 

13  MR. NOLAS: Justice Scalia, when State law tells 

14 you that what you're going to find in juvenile and adult 

15 records is exactly what the ABA standards say capital 

16 lawyers should pursue, it's not diligent to ignore the -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So your -- your answer is yes. 

18  MR. NOLAS: Yes -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: You want a constitutional rule 

20 that in Pennsylvania counsel must look into these records. 

21  MR. NOLAS: Yes, plus. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: What about a rule that says you 

23 must consult the file of the case that's being used by the 

24 prosecutor to produce seriously aggravating circumstance, 

25 at least where that file is readily available, and you 

Page 15 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 must follow up indications in that file that suggest a 

2 significant mitigating defense? 

3  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

5  MR. NOLAS: And -­

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's nothing special to 

7 Pennsylvania if you know that the prosecutor is going to 

8 use a certain file. 

9  MR. NOLAS: The -- the only that's special to 

10 Pennsylvania is what Pennsylvania law tells you you're 

11 going to find in those files. That makes it different 

12 than, say, Georgia where there's no provision for having 

13 that material in those files. 

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --

15  JUSTICE SCALIA: For what purpose did the 

16 prosecution use the files? 

17  MR. NOLAS: The prosecution told counsel I'm 

18 going to use these files as part of my case and eventually 

19 use them for aggravation purposes. 

20  JUSTICE SCALIA: Use them for -- he did use them 

21 for aggravation. 

22  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in what respect? 

24  MR. NOLAS: He put on -- he -- he had an 

25 assistant district attorney take the stand and read the 

Page 16 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 transcript of the victim's testimony in the prior case, 

2 which was included in that folder. He also used 

3 information about when Mr. Rompilla incarcerated, paroled, 

4 et cetera that was reflected by that folder. So plainly 

5 these lawyers knew that that trial was going to be used 

6 because the prosecutor told them. 

7  One other factor on -- on the duty of the 

8 counsel. These counsel testified that they knew that Mr. 

9 Rompilla had problems in school and left school early. 

10 The school administration building in Allentown is across 

11 the street from the capital case courthouse. Ms. Zapp 

12 will confirm this. It says school administration 

13 building. You walk by it when you go into this 

14 courthouse. They knew he had problems in school. They 

15 never walked in there and asked somebody, let me look at 

16 the file. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't like to either 

18 direct your own argument or the questions from my 

19 colleagues, but the Simmons issue here -­

20  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me is important 

22 and -­

23  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honor, I will turn to 

24 that. I will to turn to that with more sentence on the 

25 ineffective issue, and that sentence is that the 

Page 17 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 respondent's argument in this case misstates, with all due


2 respect to -- to my friend, Ms. Zapp -- misstates the


3 holding of Wiggins. The respondent reads Wiggins as


4 holding only that when counsel has a lead, counsel should


5 pursue a thorough life history investigation.


6  I -- I think it's pretty clear these lawyers


7 here had leads, but even if they didn't, the holding of


8 Simmons -- the first holding of Simmons is that counsel


9 has a duty to conduct a thorough life history mitigation


10 investigation and cannot rely on rudimentary knowledge


11 from a narrow set of sources. These counsel had less of a


12 rudimentary knowledge than the counsel in Simmons because


13 they relied upon -­


14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins. 


15  MR. NOLAS: In Wiggins. I'm sorry, Your Honor. 


16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wiggins. 


17  MR. NOLAS: Because they relied upon what they


18 themselves knew was a remarkably set of sources, a family


19 and a client who were not willing to discuss the


20 information when they knew records were available that


21 would have discussed the life history.


22  Turning to the Simmons issue, Justice Kennedy,


23 the core of the Simmons issue, the core debate before the


24 Court, is what does Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion


25 in Simmons mean. The -­


Page 18 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If there had been no questions


2 from the jury, it seems to me that you wouldn't have had


3 an argument at all because the counsel was allowed -- the


4 counsel was allowed to argue this to the jury and did


5 argue it to the jury.


6  MR. NOLAS: The -- the questions are very


7 significant, Your Honor. My -- my instinct would be there


8 would be -­


9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you agree


10 that but for the questions from the jury, Simmons was


11 complied with? The counsel argued the point to the


12 jury -­


13  MR. NOLAS: The --


14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- without being -- without


15 being contradicted. 


16  MR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, the caveat is that


17 the court instructed the jury that the arguments of


18 counsel are not evidence and that the law would come from


19 the court. And in that context, how much weight did they


20 give on the passing reference in Ms. Dantos' closing


21 argument? You don't have to reach that issue in this case


22 because we know what the jury was concerned about. They


23 were concerned about parole and they were concerned about


24 that because the prosecutor -­


25  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. So now -- now we have a


Page 19 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 situation where the case, by my suggestion in any event,


2 was properly presented to the jury, and the only question


3 is what the constitutional obligation is once the jury


4 brings in a question. 


5  MR. NOLAS: The constitutional obligation under


6 Simmons itself would be to say is there something here or


7 in -- in the words of Justice O'Connor, did the State put


8 future dangerousness in issue. And in this case -­


9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it didn't expressly. I


10 mean, there -- there were arguments about his behavior,


11 but the problem I think we have with the Simmons claim


12 here is that the Kelly case had not yet been decided, and


13 you now have the AEDPA situation of trying to show that


14 the State court's resolution was objectively unreasonable. 


15 And prior to Kelly, that's a pretty tough road for you.


16  MR. NOLAS: And that may be -- that would have


17 been the case, Your Honor, had the Pennsylvania Supreme


18 Court not adopted the very interpretation of Your Honor's


19 concurrence in Simmons that Kelly adopted. The


20 Pennsylvania Supreme Court three times said Simmons means


21 you get a life without parole instruction in Pennsylvania


22 when the State puts future dangerousness at issue. The


23 construction that the respondent gives to Simmons and that


24 the court of appeals below gave to Simmons, specifically


25 that it only applies when the prosecutor argues that the


Page 20 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 death penalty should be imposed because of future


2 dangerousness, not only is not to be found in Justice


3 O'Connor's concurrence, but it is not to be found anywhere


4 in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion in this case. 


5  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the best argument


6 you have that future dangerousness was an issue?


7  MR. NOLAS: There are several factors in that


8 regard, Your Honor. As to the argument itself, the


9 prosecutor called Mr. Rompilla a very strong individual, a


10 very violent individual. He asked the jury, isn't it


11 frightening the similarity between his past crime and this


12 crime? He sent the clear signal to the -­


13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that also


14 bears on the -- on the fact of his depravity, that he was


15 just -- he just didn't learn. 


16  MR. NOLAS: He -- he sent the -­


17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know if that's


18 necessarily future dangerousness or -- it's equally


19 blameworthiness.


20  MR. NOLAS: Justice Kennedy, he sent the clear


21 signal to the jury that this is a violent, frightening


22 man, and then he tied it all together with this comment. 


23 And I think he learned a lesson from his prior -- prior


24 crime, and that lesson was don't leave any witnesses. 


25 Don't leave anybody behind that can testify against you. 


Page 21 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Don't leave any eyewitness. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that goes to his 

3 blameworthiness. He didn't learn anything in prison. I 

4 -- I suppose future dangerousness is -- in a sense is 

5 always in question, but I think our precedents say it has 

6 to be specifically or -- or clearly implied. 

7  MR. NOLAS: I would submit to the Court that 

8 that argument indicates to a reasonable jury future 

9 dangerousness as much as the argument in Simmons itself -­

10  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you imagine any capital 

11 case, if we accept that argument, in which future 

12 dangerousness is not at issue? Because whenever you show 

13 the depravity of the defendant, what a horrible crime it 

14 was, you're going to be able to make the same argument. 

15 Any jury is going to be frightened of this man and think 

16 he's going to be dangerous in the future. If that's all 

17 -- if that's all that Simmons means, we should just say in 

18 all capital cases, you assume that it's at issue. 

19  MR. NOLAS: And -- and -­

20  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that seems to be not what 

21 we've said. 

22  MR. NOLAS: And, Justice Scalia, that's not, 

23 however, the issue before the Court. What this prosecutor 

24 told the jury is this man learned a lesson that when he 

25 commits his repeated crimes, he shouldn't leave any 

Page 22 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 witnesses behind. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but that -­

3  MR. NOLAS: I -­

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that goes -- I -- I would 

5 make that argument to show how -- how horrible this crime 

6 was. He killed this person specifically in order to 

7 prevent testimony, which makes the -- the crime worse. I 

8 don't think it necessarily goes to future dangerousness 

9 any more than any of the element -- other elements of 

10 depravity or -- or the horribleness of the crime goes -­

11 goes to future dangerousness. 

12  MR. NOLAS: And -- and this is in the context of 

13 a prosecutor who elicited that Mr. Rompilla had been 

14 paroled 3 and a half months before the offense, that his 

15 niece and nephew were scared of him, that he could not 

16 rehabilitate yourself. Indeed, I -- I urge the Court to 

17 read the cross examination of the defense witnesses at the 

18 penalty phase. It's short, it's narrow, and it focuses on 

19 this guy couldn't rehabilitate himself. This guy was just 

20 paroled 3 and a half months and then goes and commits this 

21 brutal murder. And this guy's niece and nephew are afraid 

22 of him. That's the context. 

23  Also, the prior victim -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you -- you expect us 

25 in all future cases to read the prosecution's argument and 

Page 23 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 -- and say, well, has it gone over the line from just his 

2 depravity into he's future -- you know, he's going to be 

3 dangerous in the future? 

4  MR. NOLAS: But -­

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that puts too much of a 

6 burden on -- on the Federal courts. 

7  MR. NOLAS: But, Justice Scalia, it's not just 

8 the depravity argument. The argument is he learned a 

9 lesson to leave no witnesses behind. And the -- the 

10 simplest answer to your question is to compare the 

11 argument in Simmons to the argument in this case. You 

12 quoted the argument in Simmons in your Simmons dissent. 

13 It was the -- this is the prosecutor in Simmons. The 

14 defense in this case as -- the defense in this case as to 

15 the sentence is a diversion. It's putting the blame on 

16 society, on his father, on his grandmother, on whoever 

17 else he can, spreading it out to avoid his personal 

18 responsibility. But we are not concerned about how he got 

19 shaped. We are concerned about what to do with him now 

20 that he is within our midst. And that was the argument 

21 that Justice O'Connor and the plurality in Simmons cited 

22 as bringing future dangerousness to the jury's attention. 

23 To put it -­

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this prosecutor also 

25 said, before he got into isn't it frightening, I'm not 

Page 24 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 asking you for vengeance. So if he's not putting it on


2 for vengeance or the bad acts that he did, then what else


3 could it be?


4  MR. NOLAS: Future dangerousness is -- is what


5 we would submit to the Court. 


6  JUSTICE SCALIA: How about justice? I mean, is


7 that the only alternative to vengeance, is -- is future


8 dangerousness? I don't think so at all.


9  MR. NOLAS: When you tell a jury that a person


10 is a violent recidivist who learns the lesson -- he's a


11 recidivist. He's going to commit more crimes if he's out. 


12 The lesson he learns is when he commits those more crimes,


13 don't leave anybody behind. 


14  I -- I see that as an argument that -- that is


15 far beyond Simmons itself as to future dangerousness. In


16 future dangerousness, Justice Scalia, you -- you argued in


17 the dissent that the future dangerousness -- that what the


18 plurality and Justice O'Connor construed as a future


19 dangerousness argument could have had another purpose. 


20 Only in a State like Texas where you have a pure future


21 dangerousness argument, in every State where you have


22 other aggravators before the jury, of course you can


23 construe it for another -­


24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there was no


25 problem in any State but Pennsylvania because now all of


Page 25 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 them -- when the jury wants to know does life mean life,


2 the judge says yes.


3  MR. NOLAS: In all of them except Pennsylvania,


4 Your Honor. I'm not saying it's a problem, but in


5 response to Justice Scalia's question, only in a pure


6 future dangerousness State will you have a pure future


7 dangerousness argument. 


8  And just one final comment on Simmons. As a


9 prosecutor, if I'm putting on a future dangerousness case,


10 I do it just like this prosecutor do it. I put on this


11 man's significant violent criminal history. I tell the


12 jury the lessons he learned from that history is to be


13 violent and to not leave anybody behind. And I tell the


14 jury that's what he's like. That's what he learned from


15 his prior crimes. That's the message of future


16 dangerousness you send to the jury. That's the message


17 that this prosecutor sent, exactly how you would do it if


18 you were arguing future dangerousness. You know from the


19 jury's question they got that message.


20  If I may, I'd reserve the rest of my time for


21 rebuttal. 


22  JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may reserve your


23 time.


24  MR. NOLAS: Your Honor, thank you. 


25  JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Zapp.

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY ZAPP


2  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


3  MS. ZAPP: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


4 it please the Court:


5  I'll address first the Simmons issue and then


6 move on to the ineffectiveness issue, which will also be


7 addressed by the Solicitor General's office.


8  The ruling of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in


9 this case, which denied the petitioner relief under


10 Simmons v. South Carolina, was objectively reasonable and


11 therefore did not provide a basis for habeas relief.


12  Simmons could reasonably be understood to


13 require an instruction about parole ineligibility only in


14 situations where the prosecution had argued that the


15 defendant posed a future danger when it was asking the


16 jury to sentence him to death. Simmons was a narrow


17 exception to the abiding practice of this Court to allow


18 the States to make decisions about what types of


19 information the sentencing jury should receive with


20 respect to the potential for early release. 


21  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take the


22 position that the -- that the argument that the prosecutor


23 makes has got to refer explicitly to future dangerousness,


24 a kind of talismanic words criterion so that we'll have a


25 bright line rule and everyone will know where -- where he


Page 27 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 stands? 

2  MS. ZAPP: Well, I think Simmons could be 

3 understood -- and in fact did establish a bright line rule 

4 that the prosecutor had to actually argue it had to invite 

5 the -­

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But has -- has the 

7 prosecutor got to use a phrase like future dangerousness 

8 or a synonym for that phrase? 

9  MS. ZAPP: I think he had to use words that 

10 communicated that. I'm not sure there's any one 

11 particular phrase, but a prosecutor can certainly put that 

12 into issue -­

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well -­

14  MS. ZAPP: -- using different -- different 

15 words. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if we -- if we don't adopt 

17 that kind of explicit words criterion, do you deny that 

18 the -- that the argument that the prosecutor made, 

19 particularly the -- by -- by introducing the -- the 

20 evidence of -- of the prior crime for purposes of the 

21 aggravating factor and the argument that he made about how 

22 the defendant had learned from his prior crime -- do you 

23 -- do you deny that -- that those were in fact, not with 

24 the talismanic words, but that those in fact were -- were 

25 arguments that suggested future dangerousness? 

Page 28 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MS. ZAPP: I do, Your Honor. And my -- my


2 reason for that is when you look to the argument itself,


3 those words were used in a very controlled situation. 


4 They -- they did not by their tone or the overall tenor of


5 the argument or their content tell the jury to take the -­


6 the defendant's future dangerousness into account. 


7  JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't see how the -­


8 I -- I guess my -- my point is I don't see how you can


9 avoid it. The -- the argument -- I think we would all


10 agree that the argument was this person has committed


11 repeated crimes. We're asking you to bear that in mind


12 for the purposes of applying one of the three aggravating


13 factors. In the course of committing repeated crimes, he


14 has learned from past mistakes; i.e., he knows this time


15 not to leave any witnesses. 


16  How can you divide the tendency of that


17 argument, repeated crimes for purposes of aggravation,


18 from the tendency of that argument to say repeated crimes


19 in the future if he gets a chance? This is the kind of


20 guy we're dealing with. How can you draw that line?


21  MS. ZAPP: Well, I think this Court has said


22 that you can draw that line because -- and you have to


23 draw that line because in this situation -- because in


24 every situation, every capital situation, the evidence


25 that necessarily has to be discussed as part of sentencing


Page 29 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 can be -­

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but this is -- this is a 

3 special case. This is not a general argument to the 

4 effect that this is a very bad person and we can expect 

5 bad persons to be bad in the future. This is a more 

6 specific argument. This is an argument that says he's now 

7 done it twice. This is the second crime and he's getting 

8 better at it as he goes along because now he kills the 

9 witnesses. This isn't just generalized badness. This is 

10 criminal repetitiveness. It is recidivism. And it seems 

11 to me that that is a much clearer argument. It is much 

12 closer to the explicit argument that he will do it in the 

13 future. 

14  MS. ZAPP: I -- I don't think so in the specific 

15 context of this case, Your Honor, and that's again because 

16 the evidence in this situation really did not show a 

17 continuing sequence of -- of conduct and only talked about 

18 two episodes. And the fact that there was evidence in -­

19 or there were remarks in this case about how the violence 

20 had escalated did not, again, go to -- suggest and -- and 

21 clearly the tone of the prosecutor did not suggest that 

22 the jury should draw from that a conclusion that the 

23 defendant would be dangerous. 

24  JUSTICE SOUTER: What -­

25  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Zapp, I guess -- I guess 

Page 30 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 I'm confused about your case. I had thought that you were 

2 not arguing that Simmons requires a talismanic word or 

3 even that it requires much more than existed here. I 

4 thought what you were arguing is simply that Simmons could 

5 at that time have been interpreted that way. 

6  MS. ZAPP: We are, Your Honor, and -- and -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're not -- you're not 

8 making the argument. 

9  MS. ZAPP: We are not making the argument. 

10  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying the argument 

11 could have been made at -- at the time of this trial -­

12  MS. ZAPP: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and before our later 

14 jurisprudence. 

15  MS. ZAPP: Yes, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: And why would that argument 

17 have been reasonable? 

18  MS. ZAPP: Because -­

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, why -- why 

20 would we -- why would it be reasonable to assume that this 

21 Court had -- had established a constitutional rule going 

22 to jury instruction that rested on a kind of talismanic 

23 criterion? 

24  MS. ZAPP: Well, because the concurring opinion, 

25 which provides the -- this precise holding, identified 

Page 31 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 that specific conduct as triggering and could be


2 understood at the time to require that specific conduct to


3 trigger an instruction in these circumstances. 


4  JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what specific words in


5 -- in the concurring opinion gets to the talismanic point?


6  MS. ZAPP: The specific words were the -- the


7 Court's instruction that an -- about a charge on all


8 ineligibility had to be supplied, and I'm going to quote


9 from the Court's opinion where -- where the prosecution


10 argues that the defendant will pose a threat to -- to


11 society in the future. 


12  That -- that opinion -- and just a few lines


13 earlier it also said, again -- and I'm going to quote the


14 words -- if the prosecution does not argue future


15 dangerousness, the State may appropriately decide that


16 parole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration


17 even if the only sentencing alternative to death is life


18 in prison without the possibility of parole.


19  JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and you're -- you're


20 depending on the word, in effect, argue as -- as requiring


21 -- or as -- as being a basis to say the argument has got


22 to use talismanic words.


23  MS. ZAPP: Not -- not that -- not that it has to


24 use talismanic -­


25  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it has to be


Page 32 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 argued. 

2  MS. ZAPP: Exactly, that has to be argument as 

3 opposed to some other form of communication -­

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not just intimated, not 

5 just suggested, but the jury -- you have to argue that 

6 this person --

7  MS. ZAPP: But by --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is dangerous in the future. 

9  MS. ZAPP: But by contrast -­

10  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a reasonable 

11 interpretation of it I would think. 

12  MS. ZAPP: Exactly. 

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: And on that interpretation, why 

14 wasn't it an argument within the meaning of -- of your 

15 point, when the prosecutor here got up and said, isn't it 

16 frightening, he has, in effect, learned from his past 

17 experience, now he knows enough to kill the witnesses? 

18  MS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor -­

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't that an argument which 

20 -- which goes to future dangerousness? 

21  MS. ZAPP: Well, first of all, Your Honor, he 

22 did not make that argument. He never asked if it was 

23 frightening that he had learned from this. The word 

24 frightening -- again, this has been used out of context by 

25 my -- my learned colleague -- went to -- strictly went to 

Page 33 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 the discussion of similarities between the crimes, not the


2 defendant. And in this situation -­


3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but what immediately


4 follows -- first he said it's absolutely frightening


5 twice. But there is one difference, one major difference,


6 and the difference is that he has learned to leave no


7 witnesses. That is tightly connected. He says this is an


8 absolutely frightening crime, but there's something more. 


9 He's learned not to leave any witnesses. 


10  MS. ZAPP: But -- but again, Justice Ginsburg,


11 that goes to the idea that the defendant has ratcheted up


12 his crime, that instead of taking the opportunity to


13 reform his life, he's gone further and that makes this


14 crime worse and -- and more worthy of harsher treatment


15 from a punishing standpoint. 


16  MS. ZAPP: It is our position that in 1998 when


17 the State courts ruled, it was entirely reasonable for the


18 Supreme Court to view Simmons as requiring that issues of


19 future dangerousness be generated by the prosecution's


20 argument. 


21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I know you want to get to


22 the other issue in this case, but let me ask you. You've,


23 I assume, read these cases. In -- in other States where


24 this instruction is given, is the prosecutor free to say,


25 well, sure, there's life without parole, but that can


Page 34 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 change? We don't know what the law will be like 3 years


2 from now, 5. Have there been any problems along that -­


3 along those lines? Have there been any problems generally


4 in giving this instruction to the jury?


5  MS. ZAPP: Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure of the


6 practice in other States, but I can tell you that in


7 Pennsylvania -- and this is a point I need to correct from


8 my opponent's argument. The answer to the question about


9 parole eligibility is not a simple no. And that -- our


10 supreme court has said that. We have a statutory


11 prohibition in granting the -- granting parole to someone


12 who's sentenced to life, but we also have a constitutional


13 provision that allows the sentence to be commuted to,


14 among other things, parole or other forms of early


15 release. Our State supreme court has said you -- in order


16 to be entirely accurate for sentencing jury, you've got to


17 communicate both of those conducts.


18  And -- and the second part that has over the


19 years -- and this goes to respond to your question -- has


20 caused our court some pause in why we retain the rule. 


21 And that is they are very concerned. Our courts have


22 expressed the view that by letting the jury know that the


23 operation of the constitutional provision which can


24 theoretically -- and, in fact, in the past often has


25 resulted in a life sentence being commuted -- it may be


Page 35 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 skewing the jury's perception of the punishments adversely


2 to a defendant. It's one of the reasons why they have


3 made a decision not to introduce sentencing information


4 into -- early release information into the sentencing


5 process in Pennsylvania, the concern that if a jury hears


6 that there's some theoretical possibility or learns that


7 it has been -- been actual -- there's been actual early


8 release in the past, that it may -- may, out of an


9 exercise of caution, automatically choose a death


10 sentence. 


11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that explains why your


12 State is the only holdout.


13  MS. ZAPP: Well, I'm sorry. Well, that it's -­


14 they -- they have serious concerns, Your Honor, that -­


15 that this is something that is necessary to the integrity


16 of the process. 


17  And there are two other concerns they've also


18 mentioned too. They're -- they're concerns that -- that


19 the jury be deflected from the specific process that we


20 have under law which -- which is -- which is specified in


21 our law for -- for imposing a sentence and not be


22 distracted by undue speculation about whether or not the


23 defendant is ever going to be released from prison.


24  And the second -- or excuse me. The third point


25 that they're worried about is that a sentencing jury who,


Page 36 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 for whatever reason, becomes reluctant to -- to carry out


2 its duties may see this as an opportunity to shift the


3 sentencing burden to somebody like a parole board or -- or


4 other sentencing authority. And so that's why they have


5 -- they've enforced this rule because they just see it as


6 underscoring the integrity of the process.


7  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question about


8 the competence of counsel issue? One -- I'm -- I'm very


9 sympathetic to the problems of busy lawyers who have so


10 much to do and they're preparing for a penalty hearing. 


11 But one -- one aspect of this case -- I hope you'll


12 comment -- and that is, the fact that the prosecutor had


13 told the defense they were going to use certain


14 aggravating circumstances, and the files in those -­


15 relating to those circumstances were available in the


16 courthouse. And as I understand -- and you correct me if


17 I'm wrong -- counsel did not examine those files, and had


18 he examined those files, he would have opened the door to


19 a wealth of information. Isn't that a fairly serious


20 mistake by the lawyer?


21  MS. ZAPP: Not in this circumstance, Justice


22 Stevens, and -- and for this reason. The information that


23 is typically contained in those files -- and -- and again,


24 I -- I want to add some additional information for the -­


25 for the Court on this point. As Mr. Nolas says,


Page 37 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Pennsylvania law does require preparation of records,


2 including certain types of information. But as -- as is


3 often the case, the -- the -- in -- in practical -- and


4 the practical realities are not necessarily all records


5 are equal. So as a matter of practice, in Pennsylvania


6 attorneys cannot necessarily -- or would not automatically


7 have reason to think these may give them a wealth of


8 information. 


9  But in this situation we had counsel seeking to


10 obtain that very same information, in fact, had previously


11 discussed that sort of thing with the family members. And


12 so they at that point would have reasonably expected that


13 they had a fair picture of the defendant's formative


14 years -­


15  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe they -- assume


16 that's all true. They thought they knew everything -­


17  MS. ZAPP: Right. 


18  JUSTICE STEVENS: -- they needed to know. But


19 still, if you say to me I'm going to put on certain


20 exhibits, A, B, and C, and the defense says I'm not even


21 going to even take a look at them before you put them on,


22 I find that quite unusual.


23  MS. ZAPP: Well, they knew from interviewing


24 their client what his criminal history was, and at that -­


25 this point, they had every reason to believe they


Page 38 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 possessed a fair and accurate assessment of his


2 background, and the decision not to -- to go -- to -- to


3 take a look at this was -- was reasonable under the


4 circumstances. Counsel thought they already had that


5 information and no reason to expect there was anything


6 else in there based on their discussions with their own


7 client.


8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They thought they had -- it


9 was reasonable when they, on their own, suspected that


10 this man might not even be competent at the moment to


11 stand trial, that he -- that they might have a -- a basis


12 for an insanity plea, that it was reasonable for them to


13 rely just on what he told them without looking at the


14 record that was in the prosecutor's hands?


15  MS. ZAPP: Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg. 
 And again,


16 we're talking about the sequence of events here. The -­


17 this -- this came up relatively later on in the


18 proceedings after counsel had already expended much of


19 their time gathering information in the -- the information


20 about what was going to be introduced. It -- it happens,


21 in -- in terms of the time line of this case, relatively


22 late, after counsel has already talked to experts and


23 obtained information, talked to family members and -­


24 and -­


25  JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. You're


Page 39 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 repeating that point which -- so I might ask this question 

2 on this very point. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- could I find out what 

4 she said came late? I -- I didn't understand. You 

5 said -­

6  MS. ZAPP: The -- the -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it came -- what came 

8 relatively late? 

9  MS. ZAPP: The -- I'm sorry. The -- the file 

10 itself, the -- the information the file was going to be 

11 used. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Came up late. 

13  MS. ZAPP: Comparatively late over the course of 

14 this case. The counsel had already done things in that 

15 respect that would have led them to conclude that there 

16 would be no profit in -- in searching out additional 

17 records. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: My question is this, that I 

19 take it on page L31 is the record that existed in this 

20 horrendous rape '74 case with Jo, whatever, the woman, the 

21 bartender. And the prosecution was making an enormous 

22 amount out of that. We've just heard about it. That's 

23 true, isn't it? Am I right about the case? Have I got 

24 that right? 

25  MS. ZAPP: This is the record that did exist. 

Page 40 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. This is -- I'm thinking


2 of it correctly, that this is the record in the case that


3 the prosecution made a lot out of. 


4  MS. ZAPP: I believe -­


5  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I'm back with Justice


6 Stevens then and I wonder how it's possible a lawyer


7 wouldn't look at the record in that very case if only to


8 see if the prosecutor is characterizing the situation


9 accurately. And had he done so, he would have seen on the


10 next page, alcohol problems. He would have seen a


11 complete list of siblings, and he would have seen, four


12 pages later, a one-page list of criminal behavior with


13 identification of crimes that took place when he was a


14 child. That's all true. 


15  Now, if he had then noticed these early criminal


16 records when he was a 17-year-old and simply gotten the


17 record in that one, he would have come across the document


18 that is on page L44 and L45 which says, among other


19 things, Ronald comes from the notorious Rompilla family. 


20 And then there is a list of why they are called the


21 notorious Rompilla family which is fairly horrendous.


22  Now, I do not understand how any person, getting


23 the first record, wouldn't have been led to the second,


24 and I do not understand how any person who read pages 44


25 and 45 of the second would not have thought what the


Page 41 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 siblings are telling me is wrong. I better go check on a


2 few more siblings who happen to have their names and


3 addresses here right in the pieces of paper he's looking


4 at. And he would then have discovered this absolutely


5 horrendous background that Judge Sloviter mentions. So I


6 do not understand why that one incident, leaving aside all


7 the other ones, but I do not understand why that one


8 failure to consult the record that is being used by the


9 prosecutor horrendously against him is not a failure.


10  MS. ZAPP: Well, Your -- Your Honor, in response


11 to that, I would say this. It's clear from the testimony


12 of counsel in the State post-conviction proceedings that


13 they had interviewed their client in great detail about


14 his prior conviction, that they were aware of what had -­


15 what it had involved. 


16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: This sounds to me like a


17 constitutional argument for serendipity. You're held to


18 be negligent if you don't look at the record for -- for


19 one purpose and -- and discover by accident something


20 that's there for another purpose. I -- I don't know what


21 the logic of that is.


22  JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree with that?


23  MS. ZAPP: Well, I think there is -­


24  JUSTICE BREYER: No. We don't -- you agree with


25 that or not?


Page 42 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MS. ZAPP: Well, I think there's -- there is an


2 element. 


3  JUSTICE BREYER: You either agree with Justice


4 Kennedy or not.


5  MS. ZAPP: I can agree with -- I do agree with


6 it in part.


7  JUSTICE BREYER: You do agree. All right. Now,


8 if you -­


9  MS. ZAPP: I -- I do agree that there is -- that


10 there is certainly that involved in -- in this. 


11  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my question, obviously,


12 is, is not the reason that you want to examine the


13 criminal record in the case that is being used


14 horrendously against your client is to find out both as to


15 what happened at the time and also the background that


16 would be relevant in respect to your client? For example,


17 alcohol abuse, which happened to be checked. 


18  MS. ZAPP: But -- but, Justice Breyer, yes,


19 certainly looking at a record would serve those purposes. 


20 But again, the information in those records was available


21 from other sources. It was not the only source. And -­


22 and the question that we have to look at here was did


23 counsel set out on a plan to try to get the same


24 information, which clearly they did, and they -- they


25 sought to get it from people who ostensibly knew that


Page 43 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 information. 


2  Thank you. 


3  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Zapp. 


4  Ms. Lovitt.


5  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACI L. LOVITT


6  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


7  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


8  MS. LOVITT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may


9 it please the Court:


10  Petitioner's ineffectiveness argument seems to


11 be hinging on four things which are the court records in


12 the aggravation case, the charge to the expert, the family


13 members' level of cooperation, and the petitioner's level


14 of cooperation. But a fair reading of the record


15 demonstrates that counsel was reasonable with respect to


16 all. But I want to start with the court records because


17 that appears to be what's concerning the Court.


18  I think there's a misperception here that


19 counsel did nothing to prepare for the aggravation case. 


20 The record, fairly read, reflects that they received


21 through the discovery process the rap sheet and everything


22 they needed to know in order to challenge the -- the


23 aggravation case, and that's at JA664 and 667, is Attorney


24 Charles testifying that he received the rap sheet through


25 discovery and that the prosecutor, in order to try and


Page 44 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 induce a plea, was very, very clear about what he intended


2 to do in aggravation and what the aggravation case would


3 be. 


4  JUSTICE BREYER: But a rap sheet and so forth


5 will not have normally what this person is like. You're


6 dealing with a client who has serious problems of some


7 kind as the crimes themselves reveal. They're terrible.


8  MS. LOVITT: I -- I think -­


9  JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- don't you


10 think it's a reasonable -- or do you think it's a


11 reasonable constitutional requirement to say that where


12 cases of prior history of the client are being used by the


13 prosecution to say what a terrible person he is -- and he


14 may be -- that you -- the -- the lawyer in a capital case


15 at least should look at the court records in that case to


16 learn something about what this human being is like and


17 why? Because court records, but not rap sheets do contain


18 that kind of thing.


19  MS. LOVITT: I think there are two answers to


20 that question. First is that counsel was, in fact,


21 looking at the testimony that would be read at -- during


22 the aggravation and sentencing case to determine how to


23 challenge that, how best to challenge that. 


24  And second, the assumption of the question is


25 that the court records were somehow superior to the


Page 45 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 sources that counsel actually looked to. And I don't 

2 think on the record of this case, that's objectively true. 

3 Counsel is -- has -- has hired three independent experts, 

4 all of whom are specifically trained -­

5  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Experts that were hired 

6 primarily to say what is his present mental condition, not 

7 what happened in the past. 

8  MS. LOVITT: No, Justice Ginsburg, and I'm glad 

9 you brought this up because I'd like to point the Court to 

10 JA1069 and 1079 which is where Dr. Cooke testifies, as 

11 Justice Scalia anticipated, that he was, in fact, asked to 

12 -- asked to look at the mitigation evidence, and he did 

13 look at mitigation evidence. Dr. Sadoff has the same 

14 testimony -­

15  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the primary reason 

16 that those experts were engaged? 

17  MS. LOVITT: Dr. -­

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The primary reason. 

19  MS. LOVITT: Dr. Cooke's and -- Drs. Cooke and 

20 Sadoff testified that they were given an open-ended charge 

21 to look at mitigation -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is this? 

23  MS. LOVITT: First, Dr. Cooke is at JA1079 and 

24 1069. Dr. Sadoff is at 1105 and 1122. 

25  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was not 

Page 46 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 contested that in fact the primary reason why these


2 doctors were engaged was that the defense attorney wanted


3 to see if there was a basis for a plea of insanity. He


4 wanted to see if there was a basis to claim that his


5 client was incompetent to stand trial.


6  MS. LOVITT: That is -- that is definitely


7 contested with respect to Drs. Cooke and Sadoff. With


8 respect to Dr. Gross, who was the first expert that was


9 hired, he testified that his marching orders were fairly


10 limited, and I think that's where this idea is coming


11 across that all the experts were only charged to look for


12 competency to stand trial. 


13  JUSTICE SOUTER: And Dr. Gross is the one who -­


14 who in his report suggested a follow-up on alcoholism I


15 think. 


16  MS. LOVITT: Yes. 


17  JUSTICE SOUTER: And one way, at least a kind of


18 a threshold step to follow up on alcoholism, would have


19 been to look at the -- the personal history report in the


20 file of the prior case. If they had done so, they would


21 have found something on that subject. 


22  So even -- even if we forget the question of the


23 -- the scope of the expert's original brief and we look to


24 Dr. Gross' suggestion and we look to the failure to look


25 in an obvious place, i.e., the -- the personal history


Page 47 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 report and -- and the case file, which the State said it 

2 was going to use, don't we have a problem with competence 

3 of counsel? 

4  MS. LOVITT: No, because counsel looked -­

5 followed up in an objectively reasonable place. Their 

6 testimony was that they hired two more experts to look at 

7 this issue, and Dr. Gross did not conclude -­

8  JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the two other 

9 psychiatrists or psychologists? 

10  MS. LOVITT: The two -- the two other 

11 psychiatrists. Because the issue wasn't alcoholism. 

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: Wel, were they -- were they 

13 hired to -- to look into alcoholism? 

14  MS. LOVITT: No. Dr. Gross' report says he 

15 might have a violent reaction to alcohol. And he 

16 testified that was -- I was throwing that out as a theory. 

17 I have no idea. I had ruled out alcoholism. I had ruled 

18 out blackouts. And so the question to me was maybe 

19 there's something out there about violent chemical 

20 reactions to alcohol. Counsel testified that the -- that 

21 they followed up on that by hiring experts who they 

22 thought could examine that issue, and they both concluded 

23 that there was nothing there. 

24  This is not an instance where you have, you 

25 know, open inquiries that counsel didn't follow up on.

1 Every court in this case has recognized -­

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you tell me again? I'm 

3 -- I'm just afraid I missed it before. What is your 

4 justification for failing to look at the -- at the 

5 criminal files? 

6  MS. LOVITT: That they received everything they 

7 needed to challenge the aggravation case through 

8 discovery. And there's a little bit -­

9  JUSTICE STEVENS: So even if they did, would it 

10 -- you still think it would be prudent not even to look at 

11 the file? 

12  MS. LOVITT: They had everything they needed to 

13 challenge the aggravation -­

14  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't have as much 

15 as they would have had if they'd looked at the file. 

16  MS. LOVITT: But the Sixth Amendment question -­

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with that? 

18  MS. LOVITT: I -- I think that they had -­

19 obviously, in retrospect, the court files would have been 

20 helpful, but they had nothing to signal that the court 

21 files would give them more information. 

22  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that. I'm 

23 just -- I'm just asking you whether, as a matter of 

24 routine preparation for a contested hearing, it is not the 

25 duty of counsel to take -- at least glance at the exhibits 

Page 49 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 that the other side is going to offer. 

2  MS. LOVITT: They did. They received them 

3 through discovery. And this is -- there's some testimony 

4 during -- during the court proceedings, Attorney Dantos 

5 does not have the transcript with her, and she clarified 

6 in the testimony at post-conviction -­

7  JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying they did get 

8 copies of the -­

9  MS. LOVITT: Yes, yes, and that's her testimony 

10 at JA506 to 508. She says, we received it in discovery 

11 and I had it and I've looked it, but I didn't have it with 

12 me at that moment. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the it? What is the 

14 it? 

15  MS. LOVITT: The it being the transcripts of the 

16 proceedings that were used in the aggravation phase. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not everything that was 

18 in that file. 

19  MS. LOVITT: But they did not --

20  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a lot more than 

21 just the transcript of the proceedings in that file. 

22  MS. LOVITT: Exactly. Because they had 

23 conducted an objectively reasonable investigation into 

24 anything else that might be in that file. 

25  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the serious question to 

Page 50 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 me is -- is -- in many of these cases which we see, there 

2 are horrendous child abuse histories, and child abuse is a 

3 terribly difficult thing to get at and it's something that 

4 might not convince most juries of anything because they're 

5 all over the place. But nonetheless, counsel should have 

6 to make a reasonable decision about whether to take the 

7 child abuse route or to take some other route. And would 

8 it cause constitutional harm, that is, would it cause harm 

9 even from a prosecutorial point of view, if you just said, 

10 well, you should follow up and look at records of prior 

11 cases being used against you to see if you get a clue 

12 there? 

13  MS. LOVITT: Well, the testimony is clear. 

14 Counsel knew about the abuse denial dynamic and they did 

15 follow up on it by hiring three experts who were charged 

16 to ferret this out. And it would do constitutional harm 

17 to say, notwithstanding the fact that you did that, you 

18 still have to go to records because as Strickland 

19 recognizes, counsel, even where you have diligent, devoted 

20 counsel, as here, have to make decisions about resource 

21 and time allocation. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Strickland was about a 

23 strategic decision to pursue one kind of defense rather 

24 than another. 

25  The Government's brief, I must say, was candid 

Page 51 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 and, I think, useful. I'm talking about footnote 5 on


2 page 22 where you say the Federal public defenders in


3 Federal death penalty cases -- they get a mitigation


4 specialist and the mitigation specialist, of course, gets


5 records. What records? Exactly what we're talking about


6 in this case. Gets records, birth, schools, social


7 welfare, employment, jail, medical, and other records. 


8 And here, not one of those -- not one -- was sought.


9  MS. LOVITT: But this was the current -- this is


10 the current Federal practice. I think Attorney Charles


11 testifies at length that the prevailing practice in 1988


12 in Pennsylvania was not to get records, that it was, as


13 the ABA guidelines and even the Goodpaster article


14 suggests, to first sit down with your client, have an


15 extensive conversation with your client, get a


16 relationship of trust, talk to family members, talk to


17 friends, get experts, and then get a game plan together


18 about what records to go to. And in this case -­


19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: About what records to go to,


20 and here they went to none. 


21  MS. LOVITT: Because that objectively reasonable


22 investigation affirmatively indicated that the records


23 would contain nothing.


24  In hindsight, we have the benefit of hindsight


25 to know that they did contain something, but at that point


Page 52 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 you have three experts, siblings who bracket petitioner in


2 age and were living in the same household that -- during


3 the time that's at issue here, and you have extended


4 family members, including an ex-wife, who aren't subject


5 to an abuse denial dynamic, and they're all saying the


6 same thing. There's no abuse. There's no alcohol problem


7 with either him or the family. And the experts are


8 telling you he's not mentally retarded. And you have


9 experts who are specifically charged to look at the


10 mitigation case and they're not finding anything. 


11  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Lovitt.


12  Mr. Nolas, you have about 4 minutes left.


13  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BILLY H. NOLAS


14  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


15  MR. NOLAS: Yes, Your Honors. Thank you very


16 much. 


17  Justice Kennedy, you asked a question about


18 serendipity. That's why you conduct an investigation. 


19 That's why you look into records. That's why this Court


20 has said counsel has a duty to conduct a thorough,


21 diligent investigation. When I go and I look at a prior


22 conviction court file, I don't know if it's going to say


23 that my client is the worst person on the face of the


24 earth or, as in this case, that it's going to provide


25 evidence leading to mental retardation, significant mental


Page 53 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 disturbance, and a critically abusive childhood. You do


2 that investigation because the prior conviction court file


3 may contain information that reduces the weight of the


4 aggravating factor. 


5  In this case, had counsel gotten that court


6 file, as Justice Breyer summarized, they would have had


7 evidence that not only would have reduced the weight of


8 that prior aggravating factor that -- but that would have


9 provided something mitigating for this jury. Indeed, Ms.


10 Zapp quotes at page 41 the 1980 ABA standards that very


11 clearly say, please, for mercy, do not substitute for an


12 actual thorough investigation of mitigating evidence and


13 presentation of mitigating evidence. And all these


14 lawyers ended up with was an unconnected plea for mercy


15 because they didn't take the steps that reasonable counsel


16 take in a capital case. 


17  I also urge this Court not to be misled by -- by


18 some commentary today about the testimony of the lawyers. 


19 At page 506, Ms. Dantos very clearly says that she's read


20 the transcript of the penalty phase when that prior


21 conviction court file is brought in by the trial


22 prosecutor. And at that point, Mr. Charles, her co­


23 counsel, says, I object. I've never seen that before. 


24 And the trial prosecutor says, you could have walked down


25 the hall and gotten it just like I did. That's -- that's


Page 54 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 what's she referring to at page 506. 

2  As far as the doctors are concerned, I'll just 

3 read to Your Honors just from Ms. Dantos herself. She has 

4 read at pages 473 and 474 what Dr. Gross had said. I only 

5 looked at mental state at the time of the offense. Is 

6 that the purpose of the -- is that what the purpose of the 

7 evaluation was? Yes, that's what it was as to Dr. Gross. 

8  Then at page 475, Dr. Cooke, the second guy. 

9 Did the same evaluation? Yes, the same evaluation. 

10  At page 476, Dr. Sadoff, the third doctor. And 

11 is that also what Dr. Sadoff did? Yes. Page 476. 

12  All three of the mental health professionals 

13 looked at Mr. Rompilla's mental state at the time of the 

14 commission of the crime. 

15  JUSTICE SCALIA: Only? Only? Only? 

16  MR. NOLAS: That's the lawyer herself saying 

17 what she asked the doctors to do. And if you look at -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's uncontested that 

19 all three looked into that, but the point that has been 

20 made is that the last two went beyond that. Do you 

21 disagree with that? 

22  MR. NOLAS: I disagree with that, Your Honor, 

23 and you should look at those pages from Ms. Dantos and 

24 then look at the pages from Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff. 

25  This is Dr. Sadoff at page 1105. I would have 

Page 55 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 examined him, Rompilla, for competency to stand trial. I 

2 would have examined him for criminal responsibilities, and 

3 I would have examined him for possibility of mitigating 

4 circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime. 

5  There is a universal difference between that 

6 type of mental health examination and a life history 

7 mitigation examination that looks to are there factors in 

8 your life that the jury should consider as mitigating. 

9 Was there abuse? Was there neglect? Was there 

10 mistreatment in the home? Was there all the stuff that is 

11 in the records about this case that these counsel did not 

12 obtain? Not one piece of paper. Justice Kennedy, not 

13 even to rebut the aggravating factor, not even to do that. 

14 A basic duty. Even if you put a spin over mitigation, I 

15 as a lawyer want to rebut that aggravating factor. The 

16 prosecutor tells me that's the file to go look at. I go 

17 look at it. Any reasonable lawyer, I would think, would 

18 do that. 

19  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Nolas. 

20  MR. NOLAS: Your Honors, thank you very much. 

21  JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is submitted. 

22  (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

23 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
