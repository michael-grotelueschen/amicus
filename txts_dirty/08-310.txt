 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v. 

City of Valdez.

 Mr. Rothfeld.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court:

 The Valdez vessel tax violates the 

Constitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a 

charge on a privilege of trading in the port of Valdez, 

and that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed 

to tax extraterritorial values and values that do not 

have a connection to the city. That violates the Due 

Process and Commerce Clauses.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not often that we 

have disagreements as to the basic facts. The red brief 

says that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of 

the tax base, and you talk about that in the reply 

brief. Can you spend just a little bit of time at the 

outset telling us your views of this tax? And although 

it's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you 

think 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of

what's collected under this tax or under all taxes 

imposed by City of Valdez?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it means 

all taxes that are imposed not only by the City of 

Valdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the 

State of Alaska that are collected by the City of 

Valdez. The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case, that seems 

really quite irrelevant.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is our position. We 

think that's absolutely right. I think it is useful to 

focus on the nature of this tax. It is a tax that is 

directed exclusively at vessels and not on all vessels. 

It's -- by exempting small boats and all boats that are 

engaged in commercial fishing and all boats that dock 

exclusively at city-owned harbors. This is a tax, a 

property -- it's calls a property tax, but it's a tax 

that falls only on vessels and is directed at those 

vessels, that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, some -- some of those 

vessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes. Is 

that correct?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think -- I think not. I 

think that -- so far as Valdez is concerned, the vessels 

we are talking about are subject simply to this property

tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take 

the position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska 

taxed all the other property you had mentioned except 

for the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that 

that would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on 

some other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that would be 

quite a different situation than what we have here. 

Here, the city --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the reason I raised 

it was that -- in -- in your response to my first 

question, you said, well, you didn't think the city was 

taxing these other -- these other pieces of property, 

and I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are -- there's a 

huge universe of personal property that could be taxed 

in the City of Valdez. Valdez has the authority to tax 

all of this property except for a discrete category of 

oil and gas property that is subject to taxation by the 

State. So Valdez can tax all the ordinary kinds of 

personal property -- movable property, personalty --

that any jurisdiction can tax. They can tax cars and 

trucks and moving vans and refrigerators and jewelry. 

Of all those innumerable things that they could tax,

they have chosen to tax a single item. They have chosen 

to tax vessels and, as I said, not all vessels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you -- you want us 

to ignore the -- the State tax. Do you really want us 

to do that? I mean, it would be the easiest thing in 

the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing 

it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to 

do it. I don't want this case to come back here for a 

second time.

 MR. ROTHFELD: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now -- now that the 

municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used 

to impose, don't you think you have to count both of 

them?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I don't think so. The 

State of Alaska treats oil and gas property as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are going to get a 

fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds. All 

it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Not so, Your Honor, because 

State of Alaska takes very seriously it's stewardship of 

oil and gas property. That is something of tremendous 

fiscal importance to the State of Alaska. I think that 

there is little practical risk that the State is going 

to assign the right to tax that property.

JUSTICE SOUTER: How about the risk in the 

other direction, that the State will simply take over 

this tax and remit the proceeds to the city? Would the 

result on your view be the same if it did that?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The result in my view would 

be the same, but that would be a different and more 

difficult case. Here, focus on what Valdez is doing: 

It is -- it has the authority, as I said, to tax the 

universe of personalty in the City of Valdez. It has 

chosen to tax only particular types of vessels that are 

used in the export of oil. Imagine, though --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are other vessels, 

too. It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a 

few other vessels that were included?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including a -- a cruise 

ship is covered. I --

MR. ROTHFELD: There is -- there is one 

cruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net 

in the first year the tax was imposed. Otherwise the 

tax falls exclusively on what vessels that are involved 

in the export of oil -- principally tankers, also 

service vessels.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that -- why 

does that matter? I mean, do you concede that if this 

tax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would

lose?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why are we having 

all this talk about -- in other words, you think if 

there was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you 

know, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to 

pay a certain amount or whatever. Then do you lose or 

win?

 MR. ROTHFELD: If a -- if a tonnage tax --

look at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to 

do. The Framers chose the term "duty of tonnage" 

because at the time -- the time this clause was it was 

written in the late 18th century, tonnage was the 

ordinary way of valuing the value of a ship and the 

ordinary way of imposing tax on a ship.

 If -- if the City of Valdez were to impose a 

property tax measured by tonnage on everything -- on 

vans and trucks and refrigerators and ships -- that 

would be a difficult case for us. But, obviously, it 

hasn't done that. It has not imposed a tonnage tax or 

and it has not imposed a property tax on any other type 

of property except particular types of vessels.

 I think you apply the duck test: It looks 

like a duck --

MR. ROTHFELD: -- it quacks like a duck --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. I think you're 

giving up an awful lot. I mean, what if the Framers --

couldn't they be have been more concerned about making 

sure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships 

go, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less 

of a concern to them? But you're -- you're willing to 

say that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would 

call it a "tonnage tax," you lose?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I was using a 

response to the previous question, and actually they 

were imposing a property tax and they were measuring it 

in an unusual sort of way. And the Court has said that 

if there's a generally applicable property tax which 

happens to fall on vessels, the reality of that tax is 

that it is a tax on property and not a tax on vessels.

 But here we have quite the opposite. Here 

we have tax that falls only on vessels as cargo --

vessels. And you're quite right: The Framers were 

concerned with the free movement of commerce. The 

Tonnage Clause was designed to close the loophole that 

was thought to be left by the Import-Export Clause, 

which bars the taxation of imports and exports. Taxing 

vessels would be a way of circumventing that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's -- let's assume that

you're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at 

Valdez on one occasion and one occasion only. Would the 

City of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of 

its own ordinance, tax that ship?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It would, indeed, because the 

city in its code creating the tax conclusively presumed 

that a vessel was subject to the tax so long as it takes 

on cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a 

year. Oil tankers --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me just 

change the question then. If -- if it came in and sort 

of took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a 

million dollars' value, there would be no tax then. Is 

that correct?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it would have to take a 

lot less than half a tankful. I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever it would take to 

get it under the minimum.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Yes. If -- if it were not --

if it visited the port of Valdez once and took on less 

than a million dollars and never came back to the port 

of Valdez --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Under the old 

tonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century 

have been taxed?

MR. ROTHFELD: I think that they --

jurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations 

of tonnage duties. And as the Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the point that 

I am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address 

this -- one of the arguments on the other side is that 

one reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax 

is that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs. And 

the -- the implication is that not every ship that comes 

into the harbor is going to be subject to the tax; 

whereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came 

in would be. And what is -- what is your response to 

that argument?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, two responses. First, 

I think it is not the case that under the old tonnage 

laws necessarily every ship was subject to tax. Ships 

could be subject depending upon how -- how large they 

were, and some ships could be exempted. So I think it's 

not implicit in -- in the nature of a tonnage duty that 

it applies to every ship that -- that enters the harbor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where do we -- where do we 

look to find this out?

 MR. ROTHFELD: One would have to look at the 

practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. And some of 

the Court's decisions --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any source 

that we could look at to support the proposition that 

you just made?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't point you to any 

authority directly addressing the point, but I can point 

you to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is. 

I mean, it's a duty which is imposed on vessels on the 

basis of tonnage. It -- it does not have to be imposed 

on every vessel that enters the harbor. But I think 

probably the more important response to your question is 

the reality of this tax.

 Valdez knew what it was doing. It wanted to 

target -- it was commendably candid in saying what it 

was doing. It wanted to target the vessels that were 

engaged in the transport of oil. It knows how big oil 

tankers are. It knows that the tankers are always full. 

When they come in, they take a full load of oil. That's 

-- that is the whole point of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't -- you 

don't suggest that it matters, right? You -- you have 

talked to some extent in the briefs about the bad --

evil motive.

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are not 

going to suggest that the same tax could be valid or

invalid depending on why it was enacted.

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- I don't, but I --

JUSTICE BREYER: May I ask one other 

question before you leave this, which is where Justice 

Kennedy started? Suppose a State says: In our State, 

we want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how 

we do it. We assess the value of all oil and gas 

property, ships and everything else included. Then we 

impose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value, 

something like that, on all of it.

 Now, the State will collect all of it, and 

we make one exception. We define which property the 

State will directly get the money from, and then the 

city can do the rest, if it wants. Now, here's what we 

do with the State money. We give it to the city. So if 

the city wants to, it can put the same tax on that 

little bit of property left over, which is a subcategory 

of oil and gas property. And by the way, the name of 

that little bit of property left over is called "a 

ship."

 Now, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what 

Alaska has done here?

 MR. ROTHFELD: If I understand the example, 

that -- that might be a tonnage tax, depending upon the

JUSTICE BREYER: I described to you the 

entire tax. We know no more about it.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if it's a tax on 

oil and gas property, and that is the definition of the 

tax and it happens to fall on vessels as part of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The way it does is just as 

I said.  And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to 

take in. So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas 

property. That's Code section 1. Code section 2 is 

defined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) --

all of that. Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e). 

The -- the State government collects and remits it to 

the city. (G), the city can assess the same tax if it 

wishes. It doesn't have to -- and keep the money. (G) 

is ships.

 And the reason I have asked that question is 

I read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic 

and Community Development which suggested to me that 

that is Alaska's tax. I might have that wrong. I just 

read a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that 

is Alaska's tax, and --

MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if it's Alaska's tax --

It's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and 

all they do is they let the city collect some of that if 

they want, and they collect the rest of it and give it 

to the city.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, what's -- what's wrong 

with what's going on here and -- and I think this is an 

answer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the 

authority to tax an entire -- as I said, the entire 

universe of personalty. And -- and as -- as you 

described it, the City of Valdez also can impose a tax, 

although it doesn't have to, on -- on vessels. And the 

city has chosen to single out vessels out of all the 

types of property that it could tax, and it imposes a 

tax on them called a property tax.

 The reality of it is that it's a tax on 

vessels.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'd like to know is: 

Do you think what I said was a misdescription? What's 

worrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible 

need to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax 

system is. Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a 

correct description approximately and if the other side 

thinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go 

about deciding it. And if I don't, I don't know quite 

what to do.

MR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding of how 

the tax system works is that this -- this is a State 

level tax. Alaska determines what are subject to tax, 

determines the items of property that are subject to 

tax. It determines which of these vessels are subject 

to -- to the Alaska tax. It then allows the City of 

Valdez to collect the tax and to use the tax, but it is 

a tax imposed by law by the State of Alaska.

 Valdez has no discretion to tax things that 

are not oil and gas property, that are not taxed by the 

-- by -- subject to the tax at the State level by the 

State.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As you understand it, with 

reference to the tax base referred to in the red brief 

at page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax 

base, is that tax base all city-imposed?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No. My -- my understanding 

of what they are referring to is that this is -- Alaska 

tax oil and gas property, including the Alaska oil 

pipeline and the oil terminal in the City of Valdez, 

which are enormously valuable pieces of property. So I 

think that -- that we are sort of talking apples and 

oranges here.

 MR. ROTHFELD: If it's a -- a literal duty

it's difficult to see how that could really be imposed 

in terms -- on every other item of property. I suppose 

if the -- if the --

could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use 

of the port. And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause 

was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New 

York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing 

taxes on ships that bring in goods.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree entirely with 

that. The -- the effect of this tax is to tax 

essentially the charge for trading in the Port of 

Valdez, and that is exactly what the Framers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you don't dispute 

that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the 

shipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these 

vessels?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is absolutely 

right. There -- there --

what tax authority you think Valdez has?

 MR. ROTHFELD: There are two ways that 

Valdez could go about taxing these vessels. It could 

impose a user fee, and the Court has recognized in its 

Tonnage Clause decisions that even a -- a tax on cubic 

capacity, a tax on weight, would be fine if that is a 

user fee which is designed to provide -- pay for 

services that are provided specifically to vessels 

roughly equivalent to the value of the services 

provided. So that is one way Valdez could do it.

 A second way they could do it is to impose a 

nondiscriminatory property tax. If they imposed a tax 

on the citizenry of Valdez affecting some broad array of 

personal property, that would impose the kind of 

political constraints that would discourage, you know, 

abusive export of the city's tax burden, which is just 

what the Framers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much property -- you 

said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would 

be okay. Could they have some exemptions and still --

MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it may -- I -- I 

suppose the test would be if it's predominantly focused 

on vessels, that would be unconstitutional. This case 

doesn't provide an opportunity to -- to explore exactly 

how far that goes because this is, as I say, the purest

case of a tax, property tax, all the property tax, which 

applies only to vessels.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't think a daily 

-- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port 

violates the Tonnage Clause?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It would violate the Tonnage 

Clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this anything else than 

that?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree with you, 

Justice Scalia, that however ports, States, or cities go 

about trying to impose a tax on vessels for the -- I'm 

calling it the privilege of trading in the port, as 

distinct from the user fee I discussed with 

Justice Ginsburg, that would be an unconstitutional 

tonnage duty. That's what the Court has said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say, 

even if it's a flat fee?

 MR. ROTHFELD: According --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every vessel has to 

pay, you know, $1,000.

 MR. ROTHFELD: The Court has so held on 

several occasions that a flat fee violates the Tonnage 

Clause.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask 

you a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not 

the elements of discrimination? If you assume that the 

Tonnage Clause was designed to protect New Jersey from 

being exploited by New York and perhaps other States 

because they don't have their own ports, why does that 

rationale have any application to this case, because the 

only State ships oil out of Alaska is Alaska? So there 

is no other State like New Jersey who could be harmed by 

the Tonnage Clause.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if the recipients of 

the property are -- Valdez is taking it -- this is 

really --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What State is being 

discriminated against in the scenario we have before us 

today?

 MR. ROTHFELD: All of the States that are 

using the oil shipped through Valdez are paying --

ultimately paying this tax. I mean, this is what the 

Framers were concerned about. The -- the danger that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you are saying it's an 

unduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their 

tankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska.

Constitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that 

States with favorable port facilities were going to be 

imposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable 

geography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by 

the other States. That is exactly what Valdez has done.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not felt by the other 

States, felt by the consumers in other States. 

Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that 

pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of whom are going to be 

outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, 

right?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is exactly 

right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a neat tax, you know, 

get somebody else to pay your taxes.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is precisely 

right, and that's just what the Framers were concerned 

with, the Tonnage Clause in the Constitution.

apportionment issue in the case. I don't want -- I 

don't want to -- to leave behind -- the Court had 

questioned on the Tonnage Clause.

a -- maybe this doesn't matter.  I have seen the 

capacity of cargo planes described in terms of tonnage. 

Does this clause apply to those?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is an 

interesting question. It -- it was written to apply to 

ships simply because in the late 18th century, the only 

way of moving substantial amounts of cargo was by -- was 

by vessel. And I imagine that if the Framers had in 

mind airplanes and railroads --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is that we have 

an evolving Constitution, after all.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I will leave that one alone, 

Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then, do you 

know -- it's not an entirely frivolous point. I mean, 

do you know if States, localities where airports are 

located charge things that might be viewed as Tonnage 

Clauses on airplanes?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I don't know a definitive 

answer to that. Generally speaking, airplanes and other 

types of property are -- are subjected to property taxes 

on the value, and not on capacity. Although, as I said, 

the Framers, I don't think, cared about capacity as 

such. They just cared about charges that were being

imposed upon vessels that were going to be passed

purchasers or sellers of the imports and exports that 

were -- that were in the vessel.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said earlier 

or implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction, 

really, between capacity and value because tonnage in 

the 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the 

value of the ship?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's right. And I 

don't -- I hope I didn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So a value tax is going to 

run into the same problem --

MR. ROTHFELD: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- as a tonnage tax.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. And as for the 

Chief Justice's question, application to moving vans or 

cargo planes, the Court did not consider that because 

this is the purest case. It is within the plain terms 

of the Tonnage Clause, the historical application of the 

Tonnage Clause. It's the clear intent of the Framers in 

writing the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the amount of the tax 

were measured by the number of sailors who were going to 

come ashore and the number of days they would be ashore,

and a small port city wanted to recover the costs that 

they impose on municipal services, would that be --

would that be subject to the same flaw that you see 

here?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would, although it 

might be possible for the city to impose some type of 

user fee calibrated in that direction. The Court's 

cases refer to -- the tonnage principle applies to the 

number of passengers that the ship may carry or the 

number of crew members on the ship. If -- if it's not a 

proxy for particular expenses that are imposed on the 

jurisdiction, as this concededly is not, that was not 

what the -- Valdez intent in passing this tax, then it 

would be problematic under the Tonnage Clause.

 But I say again we have here the clearest, 

easiest case under the Tonnage Clause. It's a -- it is 

a tax that is designed exclusively of vessels that trade 

in the harbor.

 On the apportionment question -- and I don't 

want to give short shrift to that, because the Valdez 

tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed to impose 

a tax on values that are not present in the 

jurisdiction -- Polar's tankers spend only a small part 

of the year in Valdez. They spend the rest of the time 

on the high seas or in other ports either unloading oil

or in dry dock. And, therefore, everybody agrees the 

tax has to be apportioned.

 The ordinary way and the way that this Court 

has approved the apportionment of a tax on physical 

property -- physical property is straightforward. You 

would put in the numerator of the tax the number of days 

with the number of miles they spent in or number of 

miles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in 

the denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled 

everywhere. You multiply that fraction times the value 

of the property.

 And so, for example, if I have a 

transcontinental passenger train moving from New York to 

California that spends 20 percent of its time in 

New York, New York could tax 20 percent of the value of 

the train.

 That is not how Valdez does it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- the train 

is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike 

the ship that's going to be on the high seas.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right. But the -- the 

Valdez theory does not depend upon the taxation, the 

taxability of a ship somewhere else. Valdez is simply 

saying that we are entitled to tax, you know, not on the 

basis of physical presence in this jurisdiction at all.

We are entitled to tax on some concept of where 

productive commercial activity takes place.

 And so it does not apportion on the basis of 

amount of time spent in the jurisdiction over the course 

of the year, which is the approach that the Court 

ordinarily has used. The Valdez approach is precisely 

the equivalent of New York saying, in my 

transcontinental train example, we are going to take 

into account only time spent in New York and Los Angeles 

loading and unloading passengers, and we are going to 

discount all of the rest of the year, all the rest of 

the time that the train has spent moving the passengers 

from place to place.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who can tax for the time 

on the high seas?

 MR. ROTHFELD: This Court has held in the 

Central Railroad case that the taxing authority goes to 

the domicile. That for time --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the domicile here is 

Texas. Is that right?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The commercial domicile is 

Texas. The corporation is incorporated in Delaware.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In either case, no ships 

berth in either Delaware or Texas. Is that right?

ships berth in Texas. The ship do not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the home port might 

have had in the old days the notion that's really where 

the vessel is berthed. But, nowadays, Delaware has very 

little to do with where the vessels are berthing and 

where they are being serviced?

 MR. ROTHFELD: If I may, Your Honor, I'll --

I'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a 

little bit of time. You are right as to the physical 

location of the ship, but the -- the jurisdiction, the 

authority of a non-domicile to tax has always been 

constrained by -- under the Due Process Clause -- by the 

physical location of the property.

 And so, the fact that the property may or 

may not be subject to tax somewhere else does not give 

Valdez additional authority to tax property that's not 

present there.

 Now, the Court has said that the domicile, 

whether or not the property is present, is providing 

benefits to the owner of the property, and it's those 

benefits that justify the imposition of the tax for 

periods when it is not in any tax situs subject to tax 

by anybody else.

 And if I may, Your Honor, I will reserve.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In the Wheeling case, this Court said it is 

too well settled to question the taxes upon vessels 

based upon their value as property do not violate the 

Tonnage Clause. In fact, no ad valorem property tax has 

ever been held to violate the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it says "vessels of 

all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same 

manner as other personal property."

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely 

in the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes. 

Now let me answer the question that both you and Justice 

Breyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and --

and gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property 

in Valdez. Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas 

property, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes 

all sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction 

does. The oil and gas tax that you ask about, 

Justice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is 

imposed -- and there is no need to remand this case to 

address this. It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code.

The State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on 

property used in the oil and gas extraction, 

transportation, et cetera, business, but it also 

authorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the 

City of Valdez may impose that tax as well. It's two 

mils, it's just like every other tax that is imposed in 

Valdez. These are taxes imposed on the same basis. If 

the city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does, 

then the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is 

a direct credit, dollar for dollar credit, for the tax 

that would otherwise have to go to the State.

 So, in the first place, I think would it 

make no difference as suggested by your question, 

Justice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city 

that imposed the tax. The constitutional provision 

refers to states. States divide up their taxing 

authorities in various different ways. The fact is that 

the State of Alaska through the City of Valdez imposes a 

tax on lots of different things.

 This oil and gas tax that we are talking 

about consists of 60 to 70 percent of the revenue base 

of taxation for the City of Valdez. The -- the ship 

tax, the tax on the -- that actually applies to vessels 

which include the tankers, include barges, include a 

cruise ship, includes just Alaska ships and -- and

JUSTICE SCALIA: None of -- none of Valdez's 

fishermen have to pay this tax at all?

 MR. OLSON: They don't have to pay this tax, 

Justice Scalia, but they pay other taxes. There is tax 

on -- on the weight of fish and there is tax on the 

value of fish and there's tax -- there's -- fees, they 

use a different dock and they pay taxes there, to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer it seems 

to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms 

that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, 

suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and 

small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all 

of the latter category, you have -- you have an 

exemption. So the -- the only people that effectively 

pay the tax are the tankers.

 MR. OLSON: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I thought that that 

was the way the case was presented.

 MR. OLSON: No. Well, that is not correct,

ad valorem basis. But because of exemptions, only the 

tankers pay this tax.

 MR. OLSON: The -- there are various taxes 

imposed by Valdez on personal property and real 

property.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was my statement correct?

 MR. OLSON: Your statement is correct only 

with respect to the ordinance that -- that eliminated 

the exception. These big ships that impose enormous 

burdens on the municipality, you can only imagine what

JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different 

argument. Can we just get to --

MR. OLSON: Yes, I know. But these ships 

were exempt from taxation in Valdez until the year 1999 

when that ordinance that you are referring to, 

Justice Kennedy, was adopted. It eliminated --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So was all other personal 

property exempt from taxation, they didn't have a 

personal property tax, right?

 MR. OLSON: Except -- except, under the --

to the extent that that personal property was covered by 

the oil and gas tax, the provisions that I have referred 

to, Valdez had been imposing that tax.

well. But there is no constitutional impediment to 

targeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the 

oil equipment.

 MR. OLSON: If the Wheeling case is correct 

and the other cases that have repeatedly said this, 

there is no constitutional impediment for a city or a 

state to impose a property tax on property being 

used in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Wheeling -- Wheeling 

was, it was a general property tax. And as I read the 

case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can 

include vessels. This statute, and I think the Alaska 

Supreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one 

kind of property only, these vessels. I don't know of 

any other property tax that is confined to just one type 

of property. Is there another? Is there a comparable 

tax that is focused on a single category of property?

 MR. OLSON: There -- well, I -- I think what 

my point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is 

I don't know the answer specifically to that question, 

but we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a 

community or a state imposes on property used that 

imposes a burden on the community. Property is taxed 

for the purpose, so that the property owner will bear 

the burden of the governmental services that a city has

to impose. It -- there is no constitutional provision 

that I am aware of that says that you have to have it 

all in one statute, collected -- and there is no 

discrimination --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't -- you can't 

make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal 

governance. You can make them bear the burden of the 

services provided to them in harbor. But you cannot 

make them the instrument of funding all other municipal 

services. That's what the Tonnage Clause means.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I disagree in part with 

what you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these 

shelves pay 11 percent -- vessels pay 11 percent of the 

revenue base for the city; 11 percent. This is a city 

of 4,500 people.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you define revenue 

base?

 MR. OLSON: This is the amount of tax 

collected by the City of Valdez with respect to the ad 

valorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile 

homes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so 

forth.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state 

tax as well, right?

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state 

tax on oil equipment?

 MR. OLSON: I am -- I am saying to you that 

the State imposes a tax but the State specifically 

allows valid to impose that very tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That makes matters worse.

 MR. OLSON: Valdez imposes that tax as a 

part of its total taxation package.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose I accept just 

what Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless 

morass if we look at all taxes. Let's look at this tax. 

This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal 

property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your 

brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on 

mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and 

various types of personal property defined under State 

law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, 

supplies and maintenance equipment.

 They come back and they say, as to your 

mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all 

that's happening there is either you have exempted them 

or they are fixed in place, and they are like real 

property and that's what you are doing. As to the other 

things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. 

Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things.

And it may be that you help the State do it by providing 

them with the assessment, and it may be even that you 

could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only 

thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships.

 Now I think I have that argument right. If 

I do, what's the answer to it?

 MR. OLSON: The answer is --

JUSTICE BREYER: If I don't, what's the 

right argument?

 MR. OLSON: The answer is Section 43.56 that 

allows -- the State statute may impose that tax you just 

described. And it -- and section 29.

 JUSTICE BREYER: May impose doesn't help if 

you don't do it.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it does impose it, and 

then, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: State imposes it or --

MR. OLSON: -- section 29.45.080 says -- I am 

going to read it exactly; this seems to be an important 

point. It doesn't seem to me that it ought to make any 

difference from the Tonnage Clause standpoint whether 

it's a tax imposed by the State or a subdivision of the 

State, but this provision specifically says a 

municipality may levy and collect taxes on taxable 

property, taxable under AS 43. That's the one. The

State does impose this tax but it also allows the city 

to impose it.

 This city does impose it. And when it is 

paid, that is a credit against what might otherwise be 

owed to the State. So the city does impose that tax, it 

does collect that tax, and that tax is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute, owed to the 

State for what? What would be owed to the state? It's 

still a State tax and they are the collection agent, and 

it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their 

collections, right?

 MR. OLSON: A municipality may levy and 

collect taxes on property under this section. The city 

levies and collects those taxes. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what's it a credit 

against? I don't understand what it's a credit against.

 MR. OLSON: The State also imposes the 

liability. Any individual community in Alaska may 

impose that tax itself. If it does -- Valdez does --

then you don't have to pay it to the State, you pay it 

to the city. So it's a city tax. Now --

credit against?

to the city under this tax, doesn't have to pay $10 to 

the State under this tax because he gets a credit for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I thought it was the 

city that got the credit --

MR. OLSON: No, it is the taxpayer that gets 

the credit. The city levies the tax. The city collects 

the tax. And then the taxpayer doesn't have to pay the 

State.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that happens with all 

these other properties? That is, in Valdez, you pay the 

city -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on 

that oil and gas property that isn't shipped?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. Now, it shouldn't matter. 

The Tonnage Clause prohibits States from imposing a 

tonnage tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's exactly the 

question I wanted to ask you. Supposing the city did 

not impose any taxes on anybody except the people who 

pay this tax, and that's all. Would it -- would it be 

constitutional or unconstitutional?

 MR. OLSON: No, it would not be. In the 

first place --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would not be 

constitutional?

 MR. OLSON: It would not be -- it would not 

be unconstitutional, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, but then why is the --

what other people pay on other taxes even relevant?

 MR. OLSON: I don't think it is relevant. 

The nondiscrimination issue has been introduced by the 

Petitioner in this case. It is not in the Tonnage 

Clause. It is not in any of the cases decided by this 

Court having to do with the Tonnage Clause, having to do 

with wharfage fees, pilotage fees, other things having 

to do with commercial activity in a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So we can take as a -- as 

a given for the purpose of analyzing the issue, that 

this tax is either the only tax that's relevant to our 

analysis or that it's so much higher than all the other 

taxes, it should be treated as the functional equivalent 

as the only tax we have to look at?

 MR. OLSON: I'm saying that it would not 

make any difference if this was the only tax that the 

city imposed unless it was a tonnage tax, and the 

tonnage tax -- this Court has repeatedly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the answer to 

Justice Stevens's question is we can take this case as 

presenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than 

other property?

 MR. OLSON: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say that doesn't 

make any difference.

 MR. OLSON: No, the ships do not pay more. 

I don't think it would make any difference if -- if the 

city decided to impose a different rate of tax on motor 

vehicles than it did on homes or -- or vessels, as long 

as it was an ad valorem property tax, and this one is.

 The vessels are not based -- the tax is 

assessed every year on the replacement value of the 

vessels. A big ship that is worth less money because it

would cost less to replace it, because it doesn't have a 

double hull or a double bottom, will be taxed -- it will 

be taxed greater in proportion to its value. The value 

imposed is assessed every year.

 There's no challenge here -- it's very 

important to understand that there is no challenge by 

the Petitioners with respect to the valuations placed on 

these ships. There's no contention that the value 

placed upon these ships by this ad valorem property tax 

is based upon cubic capacity. They have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- do you -- do 

you contest the point that was made in the reply brief 

that back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was 

considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary 

mode of measuring the value of a ship?

 MR. OLSON: I do contest that, 

Justice Ginsburg. The only citation for that is Justice 

Miller. Justice Miller is cited for that in a lecture 

that he gave after he left the Court. He was on the 

court from 1862 to 1890. He joined the Court in the --

in the Inman case, the Wheeling case, the Parkersburg 

case, and here's the quote from the Inman -- from the 

Clyde Mallory case in 1935, which is quoting the Inman 

case from during that period of time. "At the time the 

Constitution was adopted, 'tonnage' was a

well-understood commercial term signifying the internal 

capacity of the vessel." This Court has said that over 

and over again. In the Wheeling case, when it said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is -- for a 

commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much 

it's worth.

 MR. OLSON: It is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The more cargo you can 

carry, the more valuable the commercial ship.

 MR. OLSON: That is not correct, 

Justice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this 

case. Experts put an assessment on these ships based 

upon their replacement value. It may have -- one factor 

may be how -- how the ship is constructed, whether it 

has a double hull. These have to be Jones Act-compliant 

ships. The newer ones are more valuable. If they move 

faster, they're more valuable. If they're more 

efficient, they have more value. One of these ships in 

this case is valued 10 times more as -- higher value --

than a ship that carries more capacity because it's 

newer.

JUSTICE SOUTER: All you're saying is that 

there are other factors that -- that preclude using

tonnage simply as a single crude measure. But isn't it 

fair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine 

capacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the 

tonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship, 

for just the reason that Justice Scalia gave? It 

determines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and 

what it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into 

the value of the ship. Isn't that true?

 MR. OLSON: Well, if -- if everything else 

was equal, the bigger, the more capacity, the more 

valuable the vessel might be, that's true. But that --

that is not the case. Different ships are different 

sizes. They are made out of different materials. They 

have different structural capabilities --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So as long as you are 

taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you 

have no Tonnage Clause problem. Is that your -- the 

Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if 

you're taxing based on the assessed value of the 

property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause. Is that your --

MR. OLSON: That is what this Court has 

said. In the Wheeling case, where we were talking about 

steamships, the Court said that same statement that you 

just made about an ad valorem tax property tax 10 times.

charge for portholes. Anyone who has a porthole who 

comes into our city pays taxed. That's not a tonnage 

tax.

 MR. OLSON: That's not a tonnage tax.

tax.

 MR. OLSON: To the extent that the tax is on 

a vessel as an instrument of commercial conveyance, what 

this Court has said --

applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has

written, the Constitution did not intend to take away 

the power from the States to impose taxes. The 

provision on the import-export prohibition on the States 

and Tonnage Clause was an instrument to protect 

commerce. It wasn't an instrument to reduce the power 

of States to impose taxes. The baseline is States have 

the power to impose taxes unless there's an explicit --

and the court has said narrow -- limitation on that tax 

power in the Constitution.

 Now, what this Court has said over and over 

again, Justice Breyer -- it hasn't had a chance to deal 

with portholes -- but it has had a chance to deal with 

most of these various earlier cases in the -- in the 

1860s and '70s had to do with tax on tonnage. And there 

was one case where New Orleans levied a tax just for the 

entry and departure of the ship, and the Court said, 

well, that's -- that's a tax on the ship as a -- as a 

commercial instrument of commerce, and that would be 

covered also. But nothing else has been covered.

 And the Court has gone out of its way to say 

that communities, States, are entitled to tax people 

that possess property within their jurisdiction because

okay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have 

adopted a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could 

just say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the 

same impact on commerce?

 MR. OLSON: Because -- because, if you are 

taxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the 

conclusion it came to. What I'm saying is not what I've 

invented; it's what the Court has said repeatedly, that 

because property may be taxed as property because the 

users and owners of property are the source of revenue 

for the communities --

have said. What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do

using a tax on a vessel qua vessel as an instrument to 

limit commerce, that is something that the Framers did

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what --

MR. OLSON: What the Framers were concerned 

about and what I was trying to say in response to the 

Chief Justice's question is that there was a limitation 

on the states' power to tax imports or exports because 

of the fact that that would put the states on the coast 

at an advantage and they would pass those burdens on to 

the inland states. The Tonnage Clause was put there as 

a specific provision to implement and -- to prevent the 

circumvention of the export/import prohibition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose you could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me ask you something 

about -- about discrimination. Let's assume that I 

think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory 

tax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not.

 If that is my position, why should I count 

as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska 

or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property 

tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right? And 

the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of

this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey. I 

mean, you know, that --

MR. OLSON: You can --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's getting somebody else 

to bear the burden of your taxation.

 MR. OLSON: If do it would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Taxing that equipment 

raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil 

goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other 

states. Why should I count that property tax as proving 

that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being 

discriminatory? Just because it -- it can't possibly 

violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it 

isn't as much discriminatory against other states.

 MR. OLSON: That then might -- that might be 

a Due Process Clause problem --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I --

MR. OLSON: But it wouldn't be a Tonnage 

Clause problem. I would submit, Justice Scalia, you 

would be very upset at the -- at Silicon Valley because 

the property tax imposed on Silicon Valley gets all put 

on those chips that we used in all of these computers, 

and everybody else in the country is using those 

computers, so the property that is taxed in that

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if -- if California 

taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in

that our own citizens are subjected to.

 MR. OLSON: And Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't let them point 

to the Silicon Valley tax.

 MR. OLSON: You would -- you would, I 

submit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property 

tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be the only way 

they can accomplish what they want to. Because as the 

Chief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in 

the 18th century the port of Boston said, "We are not 

going to charge tonnage anymore. We are simply going to 

tax on the value of the ship," that is going to have 

exactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have. 

So maybe exemption is the only way it can be done.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it's going to require an 

amendment to the Constitution because what the Framers 

talked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, we -- we have 

said it's not just tonnage. It said that the clause 

bars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not 

measured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of 

entering, trading in or lying in a port. So we have 

ruled out the position that it's got to be an 

old-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the 

assessed value of the property.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I guess I have to resort 

to the fact that every time this Court has considered 

it, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone 

out of its way to say, they were not intending to 

prohibit states from taxing the value of property, if 

it's an ad valorem tax.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but in all of 

those cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of 

property in a general moveable property, personal 

property tax. I asked you before, I think, is there any 

other tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is 

applied to one single category of property?

 MR. OLSON: If this -- this is an ad valorem 

tax, it has various different statutes and ordinances 

that it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in 

Valdez across the board for all kinds of property.

one category of property. Is there another statute like 

this one?

 MR. OLSON: Well, there -- no. This 

statute is -- every other statute in the same manner 

imposes taxes on property based upon their value. This 

was a separate ordinance that decided to remove an 

exemption that had existed for 27 years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the other, the 

State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's 

decision in this case.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think what we are 

talking about is whether or not this community can 

impose a tax on the people that own property in this 

community. There's no denial that there is a property 

tax situs here. The average length of the time in port 

of these ships was 45 days. The entire fleet has a tax 

situs in Valdez. So this property, like other property 

in the same manner, is being taxed by the City of 

Valdez.

 The Wheeling case was a case a little bit 

like this in the sense that it was West Virginia that 

passed a statute that allowed Wheeling to impose the tax 

on steam ships.

seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause 

to apply to tonnage. Interpret it, same thing as if it 

was mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, 

number of passengers, the master or owner of the 

vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause. 

That's what the paragraph seems to say.

 MR. OLSON: And what -- what the thrust of 

the overall bulk of the cases including the language by 

this Court repeatedly is that property taxation based 

upon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not 

imposing a tax on the ship. There are various ways I 

suppose one could say that every time a ship enters a 

harbor without developing a tax situs -- I think Justice

Alito's question focused on that -- this is not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a --

MR. OLSON: You don't get charged a fee for 

entering the port. Or one of those cases when --

imposes a tax because -- it called it a wharfage tax, 

but you didn't have to touch the wharf to pay the tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a 

question that I don't' think has come up, but I just 

wondered if anybody has argued this. The duty of 

tonnage, it seems to me, might refer to the cargo rather 

than the ship. So if the ship made ten voyages it might 

have ten times the tonnage of another vessel of exactly 

the same value. Has anybody argued that that's what the 

Tonnage Clause refers to?

 MR. OLSON: I think -- I think you're 

correct, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were 

concerned about was a substitute for -- export or import 

tax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage 

referred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel 

itself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have 

wanted to take away the power of the states to tax 

commercial activity using property in their communities 

in the same manner that they taxed other property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's all it applied 

to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly

okay. You can't say that was --

MR. OLSON: The wharfage tax -- the wharfage 

tax has been upheld by this Court frequently. The only 

reason why it was struck down in that case is that you 

didn't have to put into the wharf. So the Court knew it 

wasn't really a wharfage tax, but if it was really a 

wharfage tax, the Court has upheld it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor. A 

couple of quick points. First on this confusing 

question of what the State of Alaska does in the nature 

of its tax. Mr. Olson began by -- by saying the State 

of Alaska imposes this tax through the City of Valdez. 

That is right. It is a tax imposed by the State of 

Alaska that is collected by the City of Valdez. If the 

city did not collect the tax, it would go directly to 

the State of Alaska. It is an Alaska tax.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where does 

the money go? If the City of Valdez collects it, where 

does it go?

 MR. ROTHFELD: If the city collects it, it

keeps it, but it has been authorized to do that by the 

State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I think 

we ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Uh --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They collect it; 

they keep it; that sounds like a city tax.

 MR. ROTHFELD: But it -- it is imposed by 

the State. The State decides decide what subject it 

has. It identifies the property that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the 

State can regulate what cities and municipalities and 

counties can do throughout the State. That doesn't make 

everything those cities and counties do the actions of 

the State.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but this 

particular tax is a tax that is imposed by the State at 

the State level. It -- it's notable that Valdez has 

never before, until we reached this Court, said that 

this is a -- that it is taxing oil and gas property. 

The property is subject to tax by the State. The State 

authorizes Valdez to collect the tax, but it is imposed 

by the tax -- the city -- the State determines which 

items are subject to tax. So this is out of Valdez's 

discretion. Valdez chose to tax only particular types

of personal property, and that is vessels.

 Second, on the question of what the Tonnage 

Clause was designed to do and -- and the Wheeling case, 

Wheeling says that a property tax is okay when the tax 

is imposed on vessels the same as other property owned 

by its citizens. That is not what is going on here. 

Contemporaneous understanding of the rule at the time 

was that taxes that singled out vessels were 

unconstitutional. We cite authority for this 

proposition in our reply brief.

 To -- to address Justice Ginsburg's question 

as to whether there were other taxes like this, we have 

not found any other tax anywhere that has been imposed 

singling out vessels as -- for -- for property taxation. 

Either now or in the past, we have not found any case 

addressing that, not only not in this Court, but in any 

other court.

 And then finally --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- the 

broader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789? 

Did -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the 

authority at that time to tax property generally, e.g., 

real estate in the city to support the activities of the 

ports, or were they dependent solely upon things like 

import-export taxes, et cetera?

MR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding is 

that real estate certainly was subject to tax and that 

ports would have the authority to tax other types of 

property. Vessels were set aside as a particular item 

by the Tonnage Clause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the argument 

they are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax 

this, would have been an argument just as potent in the 

18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is 

now?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. ROTHFELD: And so setting aside vessels 

in a -- in a unique category when other things could be 

taxed would have been problematic --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- under your 

view, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on 

a vessel?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it should impose a tax 

by imposing a tax on personal property generally. And 

if it does, it would fall on vessels as items of 

personal property. It -- it is significant -- well, if 

I may, Your Honor, just to finish, what Valdez has -- it 

could have taxed all of that types of -- or it could 

have taxed particular types of it. But it has seized on

only one particular type of personal property to be 

subject to taxation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think 

we should resolve the tax by seeing how generally 

applicable property taxes are in Valdez?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think it's an easy 

case when, as in this situation, there is only one item 

of property that is taxed, and that's a vessel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your --

your brother suggests that other items of property are 

taxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Again, Valdez does not. The 

State does. Valdez does not. And so I think that there 

is no need for the Court to go beyond and decide how 

broadly applicable -- as I suggested earlier, our test 

would be predominantly on vessels it is 

unconstitutional, and that clearly is the case here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor.
