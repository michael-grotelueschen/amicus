 (11:18 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.

 Mr. McCreadie.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks 

punitive damages for the willful failure to pay 

maintenance and cure.

 Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr. 

Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general 

maritime law cause of action. Mr. Townsend cannot 

recover punitive damages under his general maritime law 

cause of action because those damages are unavailable 

under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.

 This Court's decision in Miles requires 

uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover 

under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman 

can recover under the guiding statutes.

 Those guiding statutes again are the Jones 

Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, in this 

case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they 

are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act? If 

we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to 

be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of 

routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory 

relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not 

get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently 

false, the allegation for example that he deserted his 

post. He says it's false. He said the allegation that 

he falsified his application for employment is false.

 Accepting the -- that to be true at this 

stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be 

taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in 

that way?

 MR. McCREADIE: First, Justice Ginsburg, 

those are just allegations. There's no evidence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but now we're 

at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the 

truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint. We're 

assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at 

the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations 

as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.

 MR. McCREADIE: Well, if -- if those 

allegations are true, there's no distinction between the

willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been 

the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure 

and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's take this out 

of the maintenance and cure spot altogether. Litigation 

generally, if a court determines that a litigant is 

abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, 

is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?

 MR. McCREADIE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there 

is a remedy. And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson 

provides. In that case this Court looked at abuse of 

the litigation process and determined that the plaintiff 

in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that all that 

was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully 

withheld maintenance and cure that was owing. The 

allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they 

just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure. They 

suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, 

standard operating procedure, makes false claims before 

a court. And my question to you is, isn't across the 

board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular 

claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?

 MR. McCREADIE: I think there's a -- there's 

a number of potential sanctions. I mean, there is Rule

11. There's the natural discretion of the court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is any of them called 

punitive damages? Do you know of any case in which a 

court has --

MR. McCREADIE: No, I do not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And punitive damages, of 

course, requires that you first find the guilty person 

to lose the case. So what if a person makes these 

terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case 

anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive 

damages.

 MR. McCREADIE: I agree with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We've got to call it 

something else, don't we?

 MR. McCREADIE: I agree with your position 

there. And what I was trying to answer the question is 

if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is 

what Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed. And it -- it 

awarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual. It 

is an exception to the American rule. And it is a 

deterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose 

with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many --

Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would

be inappropriate? I can't quite find the negative that 

you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson. True, they 

didn't talk about punitive damages. They said damages 

are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which 

is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm 

it. But there's nothing there that said punitive 

damages are inappropriate.

 MR. McCREADIE: No. The dissent mentioned 

that. But you can not speak for the majority opinion. 

But up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the 

United States there was never a holding where punitive 

damages were awarded to a Jones Act seaman for the 

failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 It was only after Vaughan v. Atkinson, after 

the dissent mentioned that concept, that the issue ever 

arose in the history of Supreme Court precedent, circuit 

precedent, in this country.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whose dissent was that? I 

have forgotten that. Whose dissent was it? Do you 

recall? Stewart?

 MR. McCREADIE: I do -- I do not believe --

it is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot 

say off the top of my head who wrote the dissent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said never in the 

history. I mean, there -- there are examples like the

ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were 

called exemplary -- but when you say never has there 

been before or after punitive awards. But there is 

precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower 

courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in 

maintenance and cure cases.

 MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I made the 

distinction between there's no case in the history of 

the United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding 

punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for 

the failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 The case that you refer to, the Amiable 

Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime 

law with respect to collisions, now with respect to 

pollution, and that's a broader context. But if we look 

at the history of general maritime law, if we look at, 

for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction 

between non-seafarers and seafarers. If we look at 

Latsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman 

and longshoremen. In those status, they define the 

class of persons that we're looking at to see whether 

they can recover punitive damages.

 And this case involves a Jones Act seaman. 

And because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the 

class of claimant that we're looking at. And when we

have a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look 

at is the Jones Act. Of course, the Jones Act 

incorporates FELA by reference. And the DOHSA, as Miles 

points out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did this Court ever hold 

that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no 

punitive damages? Do we have any holding to that 

effect?

 MR. McCREADIE: No, there is no specific 

holding, and I would point out that if there was, that 

would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.

 But that we do have is Miles, which is very 

clear and specific about what damages are available to a 

seaman; and those damages are compensatory damages. 

Miles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for 

pecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his 

pre-death pain and suffering. Because punitive damages 

are not compensatory damages, because punitive damages 

do not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because 

punitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain 

and suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act 

seaman.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that was a 

common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?

 MR. McCREADIE: Miles was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was not admiralty 

maintenance and cure.

 MR. McCREADIE: Justice Kennedy, Miles was a 

wrongful death action. But when we look at Miles and we 

question, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is 

very clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury 

action, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we 

look at the cases that have addressed that point.

 And first off, Miles does not say that the 

uniformity principle applies only to wrongful death 

actions.

 Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent, 

tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury 

and death actions for maintenance and cure under the 

Jones Act.

 In Cortes, the opposite argument was made: 

That the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for 

personal injury but not for a death action. Here, the 

Respondent is making the argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, that the 

maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the 

punitive damages claim could be made?

 MR. McCREADIE: You're absolutely correct. 

Here they are making the argument that the punitive 

damages claim could -- can proceed under the personal

injury side of the case but not the death side. And 

Cortes has already addressed that issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, there's a 

question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.

 That is, you are saying because there are no 

punitive damages available under FELA and under the 

Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under 

maintenance and cure. But if we have to answer those 

questions, whether there are punitive damages available 

under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a 

maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much 

larger question than are punitive damages available for 

willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure. We're 

deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question 

under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would 

be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that 

the law cares about particularly. But there would be a 

larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the 

Jones Act context and FELA. And to decide those 

questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under 

FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.

 MR. McCREADIE: I certainly agree with you, 

Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers 

the question of what damages are available under the 

Jones Act and -- and FELA.

But, again, if you look at Miles, which 

analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and 

Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already 

specifically stated what compensatory -- that 

compensatory damages alone are available under the death 

side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman 

and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to 

compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain 

and suffering.

 Also, if we look at another string of 

Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but 

if we look at the other string, it -- this Court has 

stated over and over that compensatory damages are what 

is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages 

are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages 

are available under DOHSA. For example, Zicherman is a 

post-Miles case, and it's written and states the 

principles very clearly: The Jones Act provides, 

permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary 

losses. And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA 

case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation 

only for pecuniary losses.

 And so, again, if we look at the history on 

the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look 

on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the

Iroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine 

times in expressing what remedies are available to 

seamen. And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act 

cases, have been decided and have been a part of our 

precedent for 60, 70, 80 years.

 And, of course, it is important to note that 

the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no 

tampering with this history. It has amended the Jones 

Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it 

has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change. 

And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's 

in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus 

for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide 

whether they agree with those policy determinations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I read your reply 

brief -- and please correct me if it's a 

misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that 

punitive damages were available historically for the 

shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and 

cure, or am I wrong about that?

 MR. McCREADIE: I -- that must have been the 

Respondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully 

was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never 

been awarded in the history of the United States for the 

willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until

after -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what about English 

admiralty, under the English precedents?

 MR. McCREADIE: The English precedents we 

did not analyze. We took Miles when it analyzes Lord 

Campbell's Act, and then that was analyzed in Vreeland, 

and from that point forward, Miles took that, that line 

of cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, in Miles --

again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not 

maintenance and cure.

 MR. McCREADIE: Miles was a wrongful death 

case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action, 

which is brought under general maritime law. We are 

looking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim 

brought under general maritime law. Both existed before 

the Jones Act, unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure, 

and again both are general maritime law claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, your 

friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by 

noting that death is different. As he puts it, we're 

all going to die, so --

MR. McCREADIE: In that case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have 

different considerations under the maintenance and cure.

MR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, that take 

us back again to Cortes, which this Court has already 

decided and analyzed. Should we distinguish between a 

death action, maintenance and cure action under the 

Jones Act, from a personal injury action? And the 

unequivocal answer from this Court is no, that you 

should not treat them differently. There's no logic for 

treating them differently. We also need to remember 

that one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by 

Moragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an 

anomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in 

State territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it 

would exist in State territorial waters, but not on the 

high seas. And that troubled the Moragne Court, that 

you would have a discrepancy between personal injury and 

death, and that's one of issues that they tried to --

tried to reconcile.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was -- it 

was on the high seas. They had DOHSA. At the time of 

Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you 

weren't on the high seas that was the gap. Wasn't that 

the case?

 MR. McCREADIE: That's correct. My point is 

there was a difference of what right you had under -- in 

territorial waters under unseaworthiness that Moragne

described as one of the anomalies. And the anomaly was 

that if the person was injured, they could get an 

unseaworthiness claim; if they died, they could not. 

And Moragne was clear that distinguishing between death 

and personal injury, it made no sense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what the 

common law was. That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act. 

That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you 

collect.

 That was fixed by statute on the high seas, 

DOHSA. Because there was the gap, there was no Lord 

Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, 

right? That's what it did in Moragne.

 MR. McCREADIE: Moragne did create some law, 

yes. Let me try to answer the question in a different 

way --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just -- and you can 

go ahead and answer that question without my 

interrupting. But my assumption from reading the amicus 

briefs in this case is that punitive damages were 

awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply 

part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out, 

but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some 

American courts, American judges, including noted 

admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages

in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne 

and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about. 

Is that incorrect?

 MR. McCREADIE: That is incorrect. If you 

read the cases cited, and they have their roots in some 

law review articles that are critical of Miles, that 

don't like the Miles decision, but if you read those 

cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking pre-Miles. 

I'm talking pre-Miles.

 MR. McCREADIE: And I'm saying the cases 

that are cited in those law review articles -- the 

purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles. Those 

cases do not stand for the proposition that they're 

presented for in the law review article and they do not 

stand for the propositions that they have been presented 

to this Court. They are not holding -- they are not 

giving an award of punitive damages for maintenance and 

cure in any of those cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- how many -- how many 

would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance 

and cure cases? About, roughly? I mean, say in the 

late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990. Have you have 

any guess at all?

maintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act 

and the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the 

leverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages, 

they are virtually included in every seaman's case --

cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we 

found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where 

they do give some punitive damages.

 MR. McCREADIE: And -- and -- and I hope I 

was clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughn. 

No one awarded it. No one thought about it, until after 

Vaughn.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I found 

about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where 

there was something given -- punitive damages being 

given for something, and there was something sort of 

like maintenance and cure in there.

 MR. McCREADIE: There -- there are some 

pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that --

that talk about punitive damages; and there are some 

cases where some seamen have not been treated very well. 

But a specific look at the cases reveals that there is 

no pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages --

JUSTICE BREYER: Over here, there is one 

called -- Unica v U.S. The master should have put the 

-- into the hospital. Given him $1,500. It was partly 

punitive. Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found 

some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to 

say. I don't know who to make of it.

 MR. McCREADIE: The Troupe is on the list.

It is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and 

again, it is a case that I can say that if you look at 

all of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a 

lot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them 

hold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay 

maintenance and cure. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: The Troop gave them $4,000. 

Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation. 

Gross neglect, mistreatment. "It is useless to parade 

more of the sickening details."

 MR. McCREADIE: And our position is that 

even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear --

but even if there was one rogue case, one individual 

case, that does not create general maritime law. 

Something more is needed. For example, a decision from 

this Court would create general maritime law.

 The Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case. 

There's an example where there are some cases on the 

subject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for 

the court to conclude that there is a general maritime 

law on that subject.

 And so returning again to this -- this 

pocket of cases, they do not stand for the 

proposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two 

of them, it's the same district court judge who is

making the noise that he would have done this or he 

might have done this. And -- and our position is that 

one district court judge does not create general 

maritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive 

damages in one case.

 We're much more comfortable relying on this 

Court's precedents, the line of cases that builds from 

Moragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're 

much more comfortable looking at the history of the 

damages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses 

the term compensatory damages -- compensation for --

over and over and over without any mention whatsoever of 

punitive damages.

 The punitive damages problem did not crop up 

until Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree 

Vaughn did not hold that punitive damages were 

available.

 I would also just like to mention all the 

circuit court cases addressing this issue hold that 

Jones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit 

court that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise 

specifically holds punitive damages are not available 

for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.

 I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

Mr. Sullivan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to start by answering the 

question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg. This 

Court does not need to reach the question of whether or 

not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act 

or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because 

maintenance and cure is different. It precedes the 

Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years, 

and it deals with a distinctly different problem.

 Maintenance and cure deals with a situation 

as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back 

to health and get him into the workforce? And the law 

has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in 

the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in 

its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman 

with medical care and to provide that seaman with a 

living allowance so that he can get better and get back 

into the work force.

 Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make 

the United States merchant marine the world's greatest 

merchant marine. He was dealing in a factual scenario

where 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic 

had sunk; 1,900 people had died.

 Virtually every member of the Senate and 

Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and 

during the intervening eight years, certain points of 

law became obvious. First of all, the people who died 

on the Titanic could not recover for anything other 

except their lost baggage. They could not recover for 

the fact that their loved ones had passed away because 

there was no cause of action.

 Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg 

and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action 

for negligence. So Senator Jones set around to correct 

these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are 

going to do is we're going to create a new class of 

beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at 

sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover 

pecuniary damages. That's the only place where 

pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law. And then it 

said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an 

additional right, a cumulative right on top of 

unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.

 It never sought out to touch maintenance and 

cure. Maintenance and cure has been something that's 

been monitored by the courts ever since its inception,

and it is a self-regulating system. Before Guevara, 

ship owners regularly provided their employees with 

medical care without asking the question. If there was 

a close call, they provided the medical care without 

running to the court. They provided maintenance.

 Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for 

the first there were no punitive damages, and now you 

have a growing problem in this country. You have a 

problem with ship owners providing less and less medical 

care without resort to the courts.

 Now our position here is that a seaman 

should be not ever have to come before a court to seek 

maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever 

have to award punitive damages.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, surely there will be 

some incidents in which the employer in good faith 

thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for 

maintenance and cure. MR. SULLIVAN: And as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: For you to tell me oh, 

this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way 

the world works.

 MR. SULLIVAN: No. And Judge, when a --

when an employer comes to the court in good faith and 

says there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and 

there -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds

in good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages. 

Then you merely have a dispute. But the situation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course there are 

going to be disputes, and the question is whether or 

not, just from the standpoint of filling professional 

responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure 

action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks 

that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been 

remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if 

we agree with your position, which changes completely 

the settlement and the bargaining aspect. But you can 

address -- you can address that.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well -- and I agree, Your 

Honor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something 

which I personally abhor doing. I mean, you should only 

plead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis 

for doing it; you believe you will survive a directed 

verdict. It should not be thrown in to every single 

complaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do 

that.

 But what I'm saying is that today, in 2009, 

in 2006, there are actually ship owners who are, as a 

regular practice, denying their seamen medical care. I 

don't know why that is. Perhaps it's because it is 

expensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.

Perhaps it is because there are safety nets that will 

allow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer 

will pay for it. Whatever the motivations are, it is a 

growing trend that we are seeing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many of these seamen 

who seek maintenance and cure are represented? I mean, 

what is the incidence of representation for maintenance 

and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act 

negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of 

large recoveries for pain and suffering?

 MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I'd be picking a 

number out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal 

evidence of this. In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who 

regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each 

other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to 

represent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case 

that's not combined with a Jones Act case. And there 

are a number of practical reasons for that.

 You have to pay all of the experts, and it 

is very expensive to bring these cases. You have to 

hire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists. 

You have to pay for the tests, and then, as an attorney, 

these are never recoverable as costs.

 And then you are working on a contingent 

hourly fee. If you win your case and you prove that

they were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying 

maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of 

your attorneys' fees back.

 Now, you may do that as a pro bono matter on 

occasion. But you cannot rely upon the fact that 

attorneys will take these cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why does 

joining it to a Jones Act case help?

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well, because when you join 

it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial 

possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict 

at the end of the case which is going to compensate the 

attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as 

a portion of it.

 And so, consequently, if somebody has a 

serious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there 

is a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will 

handle all of those together and feel adequately 

compensated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the point 

you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act 

can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent 

basis would get a piece of that.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Exactly, Your Honor.

available in maintenance and cure.

 MR. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 

pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages --

awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?

 MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, first of all, I would 

cite to you two cases: The Rolf case, which is a 1924 

Ninth Circuit case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am -- what --

which --any case from this Court?

 MR. SULLIVAN: No. No. This issue did not 

come before this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It hasn't come before 

this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the 

punitive damage question?

 MR. SULLIVAN: It hasn't -- it has not, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Rolf was not a -- Rolf was 

maintenance and cure and personal injury and 

unseaworthiness. So we don't know which aspect of the 

case led to the punitives.

 MR. SULLIVAN: We don't, but we know that 

there was outrage on behalf of the court. And,

unfortunately, in -- and I think, as Justice Souter 

pointed out --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case that we 

can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives 

were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and 

cure? I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well, Judge, I would say that 

JUSTICE BREYER: What is your best?

 MR. SULLIVAN: Yes. I would say that the 

best are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials 

of medical care where the damages were enhanced because 

of outrageous conduct. But to say that, Judge, is there 

a case that says this is maintenance and cure, we are 

going to award punitive damages, that's not been done.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So we have a history all 

the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been 

able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two 

or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't 

say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take 

maybe three or four. And they show a little ambiguity. 

But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of 

hundreds of years of history.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well, let me -- let me 

respond to that in a couple of ways. First of all,

punitive damages were part of the common law until taken 

away by Congress.

 And -- and it could be asserted that 

maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary 

because the threat was enough to -- to require 

shipowners to go ahead and provide this. And I would 

point out to the Court that this had not been a problem 

prior to Guevara. Shipowners did self-regulate. They 

didn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time 

they wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they 

have to.

 The leading scholar in this whole area is 

Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote 

the AHA brief. And his brief on pages 7 through 11 

catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or 

exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct 

involving failure to provide medical care.

 And I would suggest that those show that 

punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan. 

They were part of the common law. They -- they were 

before this Court in the Amiable Nancy even though it 

didn't involve medical care. There is no reason to 

assume that punitive damages are accepted in maritime 

law; as part of the common law, that they weren't also 

accepted for the willful, wanton, and egregious failure

to provide a seaman with medical care.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I thought that the lack 

of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal 

point or a relevant point for our decision, other than 

the representations of counsel, where would I look to 

verify that?

 MR. SULLIVAN: The existence of prior 

maintenance and cure cases?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- that there 

is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take 

maintenance and cure cases.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Yes, Judge. There is not 

empirical evidence out there. Nobody has done studies. 

I'm not aware of any. But do we really want to wait for 

the situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of 

seamen who are -- are, you know, living homeless or 

living in their cars or unable to obtain medical care 

before this Court decides that if somebody does this, it 

is something that can be punished?

 And -- and I think that's the situation 

we're at today. It is a growing problem. And it is a 

growing problem because Rivera is a relatively new case, 

and it has spread to the other circuits.

It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well, it does come up in the 

Vaughan dissent because it was not requested by the --

in the -- in the lower courts. And this Court would not 

consider a claim for punitive damages for the first time 

on appeal.

 I -- I think what Justice Stewart was saying 

is we have a question before us where somebody is 

requesting attorneys' fees in -- in derogation of the 

American Rule. The majority is saying we are going to 

find an exception to the American Rule and give 

attorneys' fees. And justice Stewart is saying, I don't

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was just sort of off the 

top of his head that he thought there should be punitive 

damages.

 MR. SULLIVAN: He was quoting from McCormick 

on damages amend some basic treatises. And I think he 

was taking the position that punitive damages are in our 

quiver of weapons that we can use to deter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they normally are, 

but the question is whether there -- whether this --

this is a different quiver.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Well, I think that he was 

saying that this is one of the weapons we have. Instead 

of creating an exception to the American Rule, let's 

give them punitive damages to account for this egregious 

conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that was not 

argued by anybody. It wasn't raised in the lower court. 

It wasn't a punitive damages case.

 MR. SULLIVAN: No, it wasn't. It wasn't. 

The first time counsel for Mr. Vaughan raised the 

question of punitive damages was on remand. And then 

the district court said, hey, look, you didn't raise it 

before. Just because Justice Stewart suggested this as 

-- as an alternative to attorneys' fees doesn't mean 

we're going to award punitive damages now.

JUSTICE BREYER: With attorneys' fees there 

is a compensatory aspect. The -- the basic obligation 

is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give 

him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical 

care. And -- and now he's going to be out that 

attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness. So I 

understand that.

 Punitives does not compensate him for 

anything. It is a policy matter for the State. He's a 

beneficiary of a windfall. And it seems a more radical 

step to make something up out of whole cloth here with 

punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I would like you to 

look at how Congress treats this problem. If you had, 

for example, a bridge-building project where a seaman, a 

longshoreman and a State worker all got injured 

identically in the same accident side by side, and the 

shipowner failed to provide medical care for the 

longshoreman, the shipowner could go to jail. If the 

shipowner provided -- or failed to provide medical care 

to the State worker, he could be, again, subject to 

criminal penalties.

 On top of the criminal penalties, Congress 

has established these administrative agencies to assure 

that those workers get medical care. On top of that, if

they don't get medical care, they lose their defense of 

workers' compensation immunity. They lose the defense 

of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and they 

are subject to personal liability, not just corporate 

liability.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it would be a good 

thing.

 MR. SULLIVAN: Yes.

it has pros and cons. I was quite moved by the brief --

the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of 

those old cases until we looked them up. And -- and

compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for 

pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was 

back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not 

quite dead yet.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is -- is this going 

to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner 

says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly 

enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive 

damages?

 MR. SULLIVAN: I would hope that would not 

be the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but it is invited, 

isn't it?

MR. SULLIVAN: Well, I don't think it is 

invited, Judge. There are reasons why that there is 

this anomaly that there are no punitive damages for 

death. And that's because in 1920 when Congress created 

the Death on the high Seas Act there were no -- any kind 

of damages. There was no recovery at all.

 And so, Congress preempted this field of 

death. And it said that death cases shall be decided 

under the Death on the High Seas Act. But Congress has 

completely stayed away from the area of maintenance and 

cure. It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because 

the Court has always been the one who has decided what's 

appropriate.

 And this Court, as a matter of its -- as 

maintaining its court docket and maintaining these 

remedies, has the right and I think the obligation to 

say we're going to keep these cases out of court by 

awarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies 

this right, when somebody willfully withholds medical 

care.

 And I think if you do that, you're going to 

see these cases are going to disappear. Seamen are 

going to start getting their medical care again. They 

are not going to be coming to the court every time they 

get injured and saying, I haven't gotten my back

surgery. I haven't gotten my rotator cuff surgery. It 

is sort of a matter of court administration to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure as 

sure -- I'm not sure I follow that. In other areas 

where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in 

the cases going away. Quite the opposite. It seems 

that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both 

sides.

 MR. SULLIVAN: This is a very narrow area of 

law, Your Honor. We are talking about are you giving 

the seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum 

medical improvement? And that's all it is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the normal 

medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of 

punitive damage litigation. I don't know why this would 

anybody different.

 MR. SULLIVAN: I think this would be 

different because all we're talking about is does the 

seaman get the surgery he needs. If he doesn't get the 

surgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay 

ill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner 

should be punished. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly makes these 

maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the 

plaintiffs' bar doesn't it? I mean, one of your

complaints is there's just no money in it. The claim is 

not for that much.

 MR. SULLIVAN: The goal here, Judge, is not 

money. The goal here, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it shouldn't be 

the goal. But we're inquiring into the question of 

whether granting punitive damages will increase or 

decrease the number of lawsuits.

 I -- I -- I would think it would be 

astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.

 MR. SULLIVAN: I think it would decrease the 

incidence when medical care is denied.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there wouldn't 

be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked 

as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor 

who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and 

medical expenses.

 MR. SULLIVAN: That's all it is, Your Honor. 

Just say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly, 

will follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a 

doctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --

I mean, you are saying there may be more claims for 

punitive damages, but there will be more awards of 

punitive damages because there won't be this willful and 

wanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.

And so, I would suggest that, in fact, in 

this narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive 

damages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves 

punishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish it were as clearcut 

as that. I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I 

should have had this very expensive treatment? And the 

ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is 

not necessary.

 Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim? 

I bet it is.

 MR. SULLIVAN: I don't think so, Judge. I 

think those kind of cases should be weeded out on 

summary judgment by the courts -- by the district court, 

because we're only talking about the willful, wanton and 

callous withholding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's going to say that was 

willful and wanton. I obviously needed this more 

expensive treatment. He just didn't want to pay the 

money.

 MR. SULLIVAN: And the court is going to 

have to -- the district courts are going to have to make 

a judgment as to the bona fides of that case. But I 

think that you are going to find that it is very rare 

when somebody is going to act callously when the

potential on the other side is that they are going to be 

awarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.

 And that, therefore, this is going to be a 

corrective mechanism that's going to do away with the 

problem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs 

even better.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it --

whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is 

still a significant and will give rise to greater costs 

on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as 

is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive 

damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.

 MR. SULLIVAN: If the punitive damages are 

awarded. But the hope, of course, is that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, even if 

they're not. In other words, you were saying, look, to 

avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make 

sure that there -- that that more expensive test is 

provided.

 MR. SULLIVAN: It's going to err on behalf 

of the seaman. Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't mean 

there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.

 MR. SULLIVAN: That's true, Judge. But here

injured and whose condition may become permanent and 

incurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as 

opposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of 

providing a doctor who is going to determine what the 

best care is. And that's all we asking for, the best 

care that medical care can currently provide to get the 

seaman to maximum cure.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I wanted 

to respond first to a question that you asked that I 

think there may have been some confusion with respect to 

the answer.

 There is pain and suffering available in a 

maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the 

maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt. That's 

what we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois 

as interpreted by Cortes.

 So, I didn't want you to be left with the 

impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was

brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage 

beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure, 

there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think 

as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that a separate cause 

of action? Or is it just part of the maintenance and 

cure act?

 MR. McCREADIE: It's -- it's maintenance and 

cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance 

and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the 

Jones Act. You can choose your cause of action. You 

just don't recover twice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you then 

disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being 

reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are 

not tied with a Jones Act claim?

 MR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, we're 

relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to 

anecdotal information. But to answer your question 

specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do 

have the right to bring a personal injury component to a 

maintenance and cure claim.

 And the other point I wanted to make in the 

Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of

Guevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been 

clearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for 

willful failure to pay. Since 1995 there's no dearth of 

cases. Those remain two of the most active circuits in 

the country for seamen's cases. And whether they are 

filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with 

the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as 

any other circuit.

 There was also a question about the Vaughan 

and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and 

reference to McCormick on damages. I think, again, it 

is a small point but it is interesting to point out that 

McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent 

referred to, specifically states that punitive damages 

are not available under FELA -- under the FELA. And, of 

course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.

 Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the 

benefit of Miles when it reached its decision. If that 

court had had the benefit, we believe they would have 

found punitive damages are not available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
