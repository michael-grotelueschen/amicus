 (10:03 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-993, Pliva, 

Incorporated v. Mensing, and the consolidated cases.

 Mr. Lefkowitz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This case involves the ordinary operation of 

the Supremacy Clause. As the government agrees, 

Hatch-Waxman's plain text requires generic drugs to have 

the same warnings as their brand-name equivalents, so 

State law can't require generic drugs to use different 

warnings. After all, generics can't simultaneously 

comply with a Federal duty to be the same and a State 

duty to be different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that makes a 

lot of sense, but we do have our Wyeth decision that 

seems to cut the other way.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the Wyeth 

decision is premised on the fundamental conclusion that 

Federal law obligates and accommodates the brand 

manufacturer to utilize a specific regulation, the CBE

regulation, in order to make a warning change, in order 

to comply with its obligations under 201.57. And, as 

the government agrees, we don't have the opportunity or 

the authority to use a CBE regulation change.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another -足

you have another route, and that's what the government 

is telling us: That you could propose a revision of the 

label, and if you did that, then you would be home free. 

You would not be subject to the State suit.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Ginsburg, the 

government agrees with us that we can't actually change 

the label. What they say is, we could have an 

obligation, or they actually, in -- for the very first 

time ever in their brief in this Court at the merit 

stage, said that there is a -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it was in the -- at 

the cert stage as well.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, I didn't 

read the cert stage as saying we had quite the same duty 

to ask the FDA, although clearly they now believe that 

we have a duty to ask the FDA. And of course that's not 

a duty that appears in any of their notice and comment 

rulemaking.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we call this the take 

steps -- is this the take-steps doctrine, for purposes

of discussion here?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy, this 

is the take-steps.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me 

whether you say that that is preempted or just that it 

was not well-pled. I'm not -- I'm not sure of your 

position on that point.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. 

We maintain that a claim that under State law a generic 

company can be liable for not asking the FDA to make a 

labeling change is preempted under this Court's 

decisions both in Buckman and in ArkLa, because what 

the -- what the Court has said is that the disclosure 

obligations between a Federal agency and a Federally 

regulated party are inherently Federal in character, and 

this is not a subject of traditional State tort law.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, why 

should -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would the -- excuse me, 

Justice.

 Would the Federally licensed drug 

manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA 

for a change?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, Your Honor, and in fact 

that was in part what was -- what came up in the

briefing in the Wyeth case. Wyeth initially said it 

didn't have the obligation and couldn't use the CBE, and 

then Ms. Levine said: Well, in that case you could have 

asked the FDA to make a change, and the Court didn't 

need to even address that issue, because the Court found 

that there actually was a regulation on point that gave 

the brand manufacturer the ability to change.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But assume there hadn't 

been. Assume there hadn't been such a regulation. Do 

you understand it to be the government's position that 

the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from 

State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to 

give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to 

change those warnings?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I -- I don't see 

anything in the history, the 27-year history of 

Hatch-Waxman, where the Federal government has ever said 

that there is a legal obligation to lobby the FDA for a 

labeling change.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. There is a 

legal obligation to advise the FDA when you have reports 

of adverse results that suggest the label may be wrong. 

Are you disavowing your -- your obligation to tell the 

FDA when something's wrong?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, Justice

Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So please describe 

what the difference between that obligation and the 

obligation to suggest a label change when you know it's 

been misbranded.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Under the FDA Regulation 

314.80 and 314.98, we have a myriad of disclosure 

obligations. Any time a generic learns about an adverse 

report, it has to report it to the FDA, it has to 

investigate it, and if it doesn't do that then it's not 

in compliance with its Federal obligations and the FDA 

has plenary authority to take all sorts of action.

 But just as the Court said in the Buckman 

decision, without dissent, when a company doesn't make 

appropriate disclosures to the FDA, even if people are 

hurt by that, even if it's -- if it causes people to be 

injured and States might otherwise want to compensate 

them for them, those disclosure obligations are up to 

the FDA with its discretion to enforce. And the Court 

looked directly to Congress in section 337.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's -- so what's 

the conflict with State law, meaning you have an 

obligation to keep your label as it is, but if you also 

have a Federal obligation to advise the FDA of 

adverse -- of adverse results and of needs for change,

why can't you then comply with a duty to warn obligation 

because you can go to the -- to the FDA?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, first of all, there's 

a little bit of a difference between reporting all of 

the adverse events, which we clearly do, and asking the 

FDA to make a determination that the FDA has said is 

only for the FDA to make with respect to generic 

companies.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you contest, 

Mr. Lefkowitz, your ability to make that request? I 

know that you contest your obligation to make that 

request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and 

make that request and set a process in motion?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, there's no 

question that we could certainly ask the FDA, and in 

fact if we had reason to believe that a label was not 

accurate, not strong enough, we would certainly do that. 

The question is whether or not there's either a Federal 

obligation or a State duty to do this, and -足

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you could go to the 

FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: 

That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to 

warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, 

that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to 

litigate that preemption defense, the question will be,

well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA 

have done? Would it in fact have required both brand 

names and generics to change the label? And if it would 

have, you would not have had -- been put in an 

impossible position.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is the 

precise set of issues that this Court addressed both in 

Buckman and in ArkLa, in a situation where all we could 

have done, and we weren't obligated to do, was ask the 

FDA. For a State to hold us liable for not asking the 

FDA is asking a State jury to put itself into the shoes 

of the FDA, to speculate how the FDA would have decided 

hypothetical issues, which ArkLa says is foreclosed in 

an area where the Federal Government, the Federal 

agency, has exclusive authority. And in Buckman, the 

Court said that would disrupt and usurp the discretion 

of the agency to decide whether to punish and how to 

punish disclosure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Buckman --

Buckman was arguably a little bit different, in that 

there's a concern expressed in that case that 

requiring allowing the State suit to go forward would 

cause manufacturers to basically inundate the agency 

with proposals and warning revisions, so that there 

would be so many things that the agency wouldn't even be

able to process them, and they would become meaningless 

to the consumers. That doesn't seem to me to be a 

concern in this case.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, Your Honor, the 

government had articulated that proposition in the 

Buckman case and again several years later in the 

Warner-Lambert case. Obviously, they're taking a 

different position here.

 But I would submit, Your Honor, that what 

lay at the core of the Buckman decision was that the 

relationship, the disclosures, between the Federal 

agency and its regulated party, are inherently Federal 

and States simply don't have a business trying to 

enforce those obligations, because that does take away 

from the authority and the discretion. And the Court 

looked to section 337 as evidence that Congress intended 

that violations of the FDCA be enforced by the Federal 

Government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Federal agency says 

that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, 

the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers 

an incentive to come forward. Everyone is interested in 

making sure that only safe drugs are marketed. So, far 

from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency 

responsible says, this helps us; it encourages

manufacturers to report.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, we know from the 

current FDA database that there were over 1600 requests 

for labeling revisions that the FDA has not acted on, 

and that's just in the aftermath of Wyeth. And there 

are far more generic manufacturers who would be burdened 

by this new obligation. But, Your Honor, I would -足

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is there any 

breakdown as to how many of those requests are generic 

and how many from branded?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, almost all of 

them I would believe are from branded manufacturers, 

because generic manufacturers until the briefing in this 

Court have never believed that they have any obligation 

to ask the FDA.

 In fact, interestingly, the FDA has 

addressed what happens in the marketplace when a brand 

exits the market and the only drugs left are the 10 or 

15 generics. And what the FDA has said, and they have 

published 52 Federal Register notices -- we cite one of 

them in our reply brief -- they have said: In such a 

situation, we will designate one of the generics to be 

the leader for purposes of establishing the label, and 

everyone else has to follow.

 But critically, what the FDA has said is:

In those situations, we, the FDA, will tell you when the 

label needs to change.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what are you supposed to 

do if your company happens by chance to come across a 

very, very high correlation between people who take your 

generic drug and who get seriously ill?

 And now what you know is that nobody else 

has really found that, but, my goodness, there you are; 

it happened that it was associated, a special group or 

something. What are you supposed to do?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, we have an 

obligation, actually, to provide all of that information 

to the FDA. Generics, unlike brand companies, aren't 

equipped in the same way, necessarily, to evaluate

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how would it 

conflict? Suppose the State said: Here is what we 

want; we notice that it says in the Federal law that you 

must keep your warnings up to date, and if you find an 

association, you must revise your warning. Now, we 

understand you can't do that without FDA approval. But 

as far as our State is concerned, we think that when you 

come across this serious problem you have to tell the 

FDA in some form or other, a reasonable form, about it. 

Would that law -- is there anything Federal that that 

law would conflict with?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: I think that law, Your 

Honor, would conflict with the Buckman principles and 

the ArkLa principles.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said you had 

to tell the FDA about it.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: If the -- I understood 

Justice Breyer's question to be asking whether -- not 

only did we have to tell the FDA, which we clearly do, 

but whether we then had some additional duty to ask the 

FDA to change the warning.

that.

wonder if that's this case. I wonder if this case is 

what they're saying is: Oh, we concede you told the FDA 

every single thing, so they were just as informed as you 

are about the risks here, but you did not add the words: 

And please change our -- your permission, so that we can 

change the warning. Is that what this case is about?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, I think that's what 

they're suggesting. But even if it were just the 

former -足

JUSTICE BREYER: When they come up here they 

might say this isn't just what this case is about.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Even if it's just the 

former, Your Honor, even if it's just the failure to 

disclose adverse reports -足

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: -- which we know we have an 

obligation to do, there is no history of State 

regulation of communications between Federal -- Federal 

agencies and the regulated parties. Those are not the 

kinds of parallel claims cases, like in Lohr v.

JUSTICE BREYER: So your argument is that if 

we run across this tremendous, really serious -- I can 

make an imaginary as serious as you want -- really a 

serious problem, and you're saying the State has no

right to say -- even if we purposely didn't tell 

anybody, they can't get involved because they can't get 

involved with our failure to tell the FDA anything 

because that's Federal, and we can't -- they can't get 

involved with our failure to try to change the warning 

because that's taken care of by our obligation to tell 

them, which we didn't fulfill?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Breyer, correct, 

because that's exactly -- remember, in Buckman what 

happened was an individual was injured because the 

company had not accurately disclosed, in fact had misled 

the agency about the purpose of marketing these bone 

screws. Clearly there was a State interest in 

protecting and providing a remedy to that consumer, a 

State interest in ensuring accurate disclosures to the 

government, and in fact an allegation that had there 

been accurate disclosures to the government, the FDA 

would have made a different safety and labeling 

determination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that if the 

claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly, 

that claim could be brought?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Not in a State court, Your 

Honor.

sorry. To disclose to the FDA?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To disclose to the FDA.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: A claim, Your Honor, of 

disclosure to the FDA relates to the inherently Federal 

relationship.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you just described 

Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to 

tell the FDA the purpose of the screws. You said that 

the State -- the State suit would lie because of that 

failure.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, I said the State suit --

I apologize. I meant to say and I thought I said the 

State suit would not lie because Buckman preempts that 

type of lawsuit. Buckman says even in that terrible 

situation, misleading to the FDA, failure to disclose 

what the FDA requires you to disclose, there is no State 

cause of action because this is a uniquely Federal area 

and States can't supplant the FDA in its enforcement 

discretion.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think 

what the Respondents would say is that you are 

mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into 

something that it's not. Their complaint is a standard 

state failure to warn claim. Now, you have a preemption

defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense 

there's going to be questions about your disclosure 

obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in 

a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's 

in a fundamentally different posture than the one that 

you're suggesting.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, I would agree 

with you that what they pled below was a traditional 

failure to warn. A failure to warn claim means you did 

not warn the public in the way that we think under State 

law you should have. And whereas in Wyeth the Congress 

through the FDA has said a brand manufacturer ultimately 

is responsible for the warnings it issues and therefore 

can change the warning and therefore can be held liable, 

we don't have -- and the government agrees with us -- we 

don't have any mechanism under law to change the 

warnings. So to the extent this is a traditional 

failure to warn claim, it has to be preempted under 

simple Supremacy Clause principles.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I agree that you don't 

have any ability yourself to change the warning, but 

here's what the FDA has said. The FDA has said if an 

ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA 

applicant -- believes new safety information should be 

added to a product's labeling, presumably because

they've gotten information that suggests that the 

product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the 

FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for 

the generic and listed drugs should be revised.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, that is exactly 

what the FDA says. They point for that to a preamble in 

1992 to a rulemaking that didn't address the relevant 

201.57 regulation, a preamble that was issued without 

notice and comment rulemaking, and a preamble that 

doesn't actually impose a duty. It says if, 

subjunctively, we believe that there should be a label 

change, we should do something, we should ask the FDA. 

Not we must, not we shall.

 And even then it said: And the FDA will 

then make a decision, which makes clear that this is not 

a decision for State juries to make. Your Honor, the 

FDA has articulated a Federal duty today in its briefing 

in this case that is very much at odds with what it has 

specifically said about what a generic's obligation is 

under 201.57. In the two notice and comment rulemakings 

at issue during the relevant time period here, in 2000 

and 2006, what the FDA said very specifically was a 

generic's obligation under 201.57 is to use the brand 

label, even if the brand label isn't the most 

up-to-date.

And the reason is the policy underlying 

Hatch-Waxman is that brand companies do safety and 

efficacy testing; generics do sameness testing. 

Generics are required to make copies of the drugs and by 

definition make copies of the labels, because it 

wouldn't make any sense to go into a drugstore to buy 

Advil and to see 15 different generic ibuprofen and to 

have 15 different sets of warnings.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think -足

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Buckman was a case -- I'm 

pronouncing it right, I think, Buckman -- where it was a 

branded manufacturer, was it not?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: It was a medical device 

manufacturer.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: A medical device 

manufacturer. So there it was -- it was an FDA process, 

and we said there's no State cause of action for saying 

that the FDA process -- that's slightly different from 

saying that you have a duty to warn the FDA. You might 

say it's a fortiori.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I do think it's 

a fortiori. Buckman involves the branded process of 

coming on with an equivalent medical device under the 

510K process. This is actually a situation where, after 

intensive back and forth with the FDA, the brand company

crafts the label that the FDA approves and the generic 

is given one responsibility by Congress. The 

responsibility is to maintain the same label as the 

brand. That's the critical difference.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you think 

Congress really intended to create a market in which 

consumers can only sue brand-named products? Because if 

that's the case, why would anybody ever take a genetic? 

And why in the world would Congress create a different, 

or even the FDA, a different obligation on brand-named 

products or generic products to give them information 

about labels when they know there's been a misbranding?

 What the government says is you start by 

instructing a jury that there had to actually have been 

information that proved a misbranding. That's the first 

step of the tort suit according to the government. So 

why should you or why would Congress or the FDA have 

intended to treat the two differently?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, I want to 

take both halves of your question. In 27 years of 

enforcement under Hatch-Waxman, the FDA has never once 

said that a generic drug that uses the brand label, as 

required under 505(j) of the statute is misbranded. And 

the -- look, I understand that from the consumer's 

perspective it may not make a lot of sense. But what

Congress specifically said is that a generic has to bear 

the same label, and it's because they do have different 

purposes, different functions. Congress said that 

whenever there is a brand drug on the market that no 

longer is protected by its patent monopoly but has been 

selling for $10 or $20 a pill, we want to have generics 

selling for pennies for the pill, and they've given 

branded and generics different obligations.

 And the different obligations are seen most 

clearly through the prism of the Wyeth case. The Wyeth 

case was -- it was critical in the Wyeth case that this 

Court found that the brand company had the ability, had 

the obligation, to use the CBE regulations to actually 

change the label, whereas here what the FDA has said 

time and time again is: We'll tell a generic when the 

generic has to change the label, because we don't assume 

that the generics are going to know when the label 

should change because they don't have the same basis of 

clinical testing and results.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a 

certain overlap, is there not? Some of the generics are 

made by the same people that make the brand-name drugs, 

isn't that so?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: That is correct, Your Honor.

people, they have the means.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, I don't know 

whether or not the -- the FDA or this Court would hold 

differently in a case where the generic at issue was an 

authorized generic, a generic manufactured by a brand 

company that had, in fact, done all the clinical safety 

testing and might have a different basis for assessing 

the occasional adverse reports that they get.

 But, again, the keys to understanding the -足

the generic industry -- generics rarely even get adverse 

reports because if a doctor prescribes a drug, the 

doctor prescribes it as the brand, and then checks off 

the box that says a generic can be issued. If a patient 

comes and tells him about an adverse report, the doctor 

has no idea which generic of the 15 that might be in the 

market actually was dispensed, so he'll actually tell 

the brand company. He'll report the adverse event to 

the brand company.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all you're 

arguing is that this rule will have little practical 

effect, that there is going to be very few lawsuits that 

could be brought against your companies because you're 

just not going to have enough information to suggest a 

label change.

is that for the FDA to impose a new Federal obligation 

that will significantly change the way generic companies 

conduct their business should go through notice and 

comment rulemaking. It should not rely on a preamble to 

a different rulemaking that didn't go through notice and 

comment. It should not rely on briefs that are filed at 

the merits stage, because this would totally change the 

way generics do business.

 Generics don't have a practice -- they're 

not even set up -- to go and figure out what label 

changes would be appropriate. They are set up to report 

adverse events to the FDA, and what Congress has said 

and what the FDA has said is violations of those 

statutes, violations of those regulations, are 

exclusively within the province of the Federal 

government. That's what Buckman says very clearly when 

it looks at Section 337.

 If I may, I would like to reserve my time.

The central issue in this case is that 

Petitioners, in the face of considerable information 

that the warnings on their products were inadequate, did 

nothing. The generic drug companies' position is that 

they -- no matter how much they know, no matter how 

grave the risk, they are under no obligation to do 

anything to warn of the dangers of the products they 

sell.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're -足

they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the 

facts which establish the grave risk, right?

 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor. 

They're obliged under -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the argument here is 

whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that 

determines whether there was a grave enough risk to 

modify the -- the label or whether that call will be 

made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would 

have done, right?

 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor, that's not 

correct. What this Court said in Wyeth v. Levine is 

that State juries are a perfectly appropriate vehicle 

for assessing whether warnings in the past were 

adequately given. We do -- we do not dispute that the

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but -- no,

the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but 

that a label change would have been approved. Otherwise 

there's no causation. Surely -足

MR. BOGRAD: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's part of your 

case, isn't it?

 MR. BOGRAD: No, it's not, Justice Scalia. 

The -- as Petitioners concede in the brief, under 

traditional State law failure to warn claim, our 

affirmative case is that the warnings that were given to 

the doctor and to the patient were inadequate, and that 

because adequate warnings weren't given, the patient was 

injured.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but their -足

their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, 

and you don't contest that. They had to give the 

warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the 

warnings must be changed, so -足

MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, I don't see how 

you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to 

give the warnings that they had to give.

it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not 

Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've 

learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; 

they must tell the FDA every detail.

 MR. BOGRAD: Well -足

JUSTICE BREYER: That sounds awfully 

familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically 

a claim of fraud on the FDA. And we said it's not up to 

the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim 

for fraud on the FDA. The FDA has to enforce their own 

stuff. And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA 

has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us 

everything you know? What's the answer to that?

 MR. BOGRAD: Well, there are two answers, 

Your Honor. First -- first, this Court's decision in 

Levine is inconsistent with that sweeping reading -足

JUSTICE BREYER: No, because Levine involves 

the Wyeth case, right?

 MR. BOGRAD: Yes. I'm sorry, I -足

JUSTICE BREYER: No. The -- the difference 

there is the difference that the SG points out: There 

is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker 

to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the 

warnings. But here the FDA tells us they have no power 

to change their warnings. They can't, unlike Levine.

They have to copy the original maker. So -- I'm -- I'm 

just referring there to the whole SG brief.

 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, let me respond to 

that in -- in two ways. First -足

JUSTICE BREYER: Be sure you answer, please, 

my original question.

 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I will, Your Honor.

 The -- to focus first on the CBE issue, one 

of the things this Court noted in Levine is that even 

under the CBE process, the ultimate decision about 

whether the labeling is changed rests with the FDA, not 

with the manufacturer. The -- the fundamental issue in 

Levine was that the primary responsibility for labeling 

rested with the manufacturer, not with the agency, 

subject to the agency's review. And we don't dispute 

that the agency has the right to review and can reject a 

label.

 The -- what was at the core and what this 

Court cited, although the -- the number has changed in 

Wyeth v. Levine, is the obligation under 21 CFR 

201.57(e), which you call 201.80(e) because they -- they 

renumbered it -- that the label warnings shall be 

revised as soon as there's reasonable evidence of an 

association of a serious hazard with the drug.

 The government says, and the regulatory

structure makes clear, that that provision applies with 

full force to generic drug manufacturers, not just to 

name-brand drug manufacturers. It is the regulatory 

implementation of the obligation under the Federal 

misbranding statute, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2) that says you 

can't sell a drug that doesn't have adequate warnings 

about its risks.

 So, when you're -- when the manufacturer is 

confronted with information that the warnings on its 

drug are not adequate, it -- the way it -- the way it 

should respond is by immediately going to the FDA and 

saying to the agency: We have this new information; we 

ask you, not that we want a different warning from the 

name brand, but we ask you to approve a stronger warning 

on both the name-brand product and its generic 

equivalents.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens -足

MR. BOGRAD: And had they done so, we would 

know -- one of two things would have happened. Either 

the agency would have approved the warning, stronger 

warnings would have been given and our clients -- my 

clients likely would not have been injured; or they 

would have said, no, we don't think there's sufficient 

information to justify this warning.

take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to 

respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that 

it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the 

label?

 MR. BOGRAD: Your Honor, as you just heard 

from Mr. Lefkowitz, generic manufacturers typically 

haven't been fulfilling this obligation and have not 

been asking the agency. But the latest data from the 

agency, and this is from its -- its web site, is that 

under -- they've been publishing performance data since 

2007, and they now say that safety labeling changes, 

which are the labeling changes required under FD -足

under FDA, are processed typically in a matter of 

months, 94 percent within 3 months.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those the ones 

that are submitted by generic manufacturers?

could be ones submitted by generic manufacturers. Those 

are ones where the information that comes to the agency 

triggers a -- a labeling revision process.

there were certainly procedures available that would 

have required an up-or-down: The citizens petition 

process, for example, the supplement process, for 

example. The -- what -- the government has represented 

that even if the request came in a more informal form, 

the government would nevertheless take a request for a

label warning seriously and act on it promptly.

and Minnesota, there is a reasonableness element in a 

failure to warn claim, but it's -- the standard is "knew 

or should have known," so that the manufacturer -足

manufacturers are typically held to the -- to the 

knowledge of an expert in the field of the products they 

manufacture. And here the -- our contention has been 

that if the generic manufacturers had merely examined 

the publicly available FDA database of adverse event 

reports, and merely paid attention to reports in the 

published literature that had since 19 -- the early 

1990s had documented a serious association between 

long-term use of metoclopramide and tardive dyskinesia, 

they would have had more than sufficient information to 

say to the agency, we need a change here.

have to be an expert in the field in which it 

manufactures?

Your Honor.

 MR. BOGRAD: No, Your Honor. In fact, in 

this particular context we're talking about a use that 

was never approved by the FDA. We're talking about use 

beyond 12 weeks, which had never been evaluated. So 

there's really no basis to assume that the name-brand 

manufacturer here had any more expertise -足

that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident 

reports?

 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, they are, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, imagine a 

company that files every adverse incident report, 

complies completely; period. Now, in your view does it 

have an additional obligation?

 MR. BOGRAD: Yes, it does, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER: Now. And that's what I -足

now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything. 

The FDA has all that information.

 MR. BOGRAD: Oh, that's -- that's incorrect, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is it?

 MR. BOGRAD: It's -- well, as this Court 

said in Levine, the FDA has 11,000 drugs it needs to 

monitor and stay on top of, and it doesn't have the 

resources necessary to pay attention to every adverse 

event report it gets and every report that is published 

in the scientific literature. The reason that 

manufacturers bear the primary responsibility is because 

they -- they need to trigger the FDA's focus on a 

particular issue here. Here this information was 

available since the mid '90s.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument, I'm 

getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the 

failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to 

require them to keep track of adverse incidents and 

other things in the -- and do their best to change the 

label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely, 

and asking them to change.

MR. BOGRAD: Exactly, Your Honor. Their 

obligation -- their obligation under State law is to 

provide a warning. What they should have done, and if 

you take -- what they should have done is go to the FDA 

and ask the FDA to approve a stronger warning. If the 

FDA had said no, they would have a preemption.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -足

could have lobbied the FDA to change the rule that says 

that the generic drug manufacturer has no obligation to

them from -- from going to the process of strengthening 

their warning label, then the State may legitimately 

enforce its obligation to protect its citizens' health 

and safety. I think it's important in this regard -足

JUSTICE ALITO: But your theory is that they 

have a duty to pursue an informal process that is 

nowhere provided for under the FDA rules; and so I don't

the rules, isn't that right?

but there is a formal obligation, both under statute, 

not to sell a misbranded drug, and under regulation, to 

revise your labeling as soon as there's reasonable 

evidence of an association of a serious hazard with the 

drug. And I think it's -足

MR. BOGRAD: Because, Your Honor, this is -足

and I should start by saying that in Buckman there was 

-- the suit was not against the manufacturer; the suit 

in Buckman was against a consultant that -- that helped 

the manufacturer get FDA approval. There was a separate 

product liability action against the manufacturer that 

had already been litigated and settled.

 The -- Buckman said: We're not talking 

about traditional causes of action, State law causes of 

action like in Lohr, or like in -- or as this Court 

again said in Wyeth v. Levine; we're talking about a 

case where the whole centrality of the claim is premised 

on the relationship between the company -- or the 

defendant and the agency.

 This is not that case. We're -- this case 

is about the -- the duty that the company owes to my 

clients and their doctors to provide them with adequate 

warnings. That duty, which is -- has been recognized by 

this Court innumerable times, complements the FDA 

statutory scheme by creating incentives for companies 

like the Petitioners to -足

respect. And in Buckman there was a -- a formal 

relationship which did not permit the cause of action, 

and it seems to me you could at least argue that a 

fortiori there should be no cause of action when there 

an informal relationship.

 MR. BOGRAD: I -- I'm not sure I follow the 

a fortiori point in this context, Your Honor. But in 

Buckman there was no relationship whatsoever between the 

consultant, the Buckman Company, and the injured person. 

The Buckman Company's dealing were -- had been 

exclusively with the agency.

 They had had no dealing whatsoever -- they 

had not failed to warn. That's why we -- the plaintiffs 

had created this bizarre cause of action, and it's -- we 

think it's a wholly distinguishable case.

 I think it's important to remember, first 

off, the world in which we live today. 70 percent of 

all prescriptions are filled with generic drugs. A 

third of generic drugs no longer have name-brand 

competitors at all, because the economic -- because the

obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when 

they think they're necessary?

 MR. BOGRAD: I -- Your Honor, that would be 

a question better directed to Mr. Kneedler, but I don't 

believe -- I don't believe that there's a -- there's a 

difference.

 Any -- we have a system today where every 

State has a drug substitution law that drives 

prescriptions to be filled with generics rather than 

name-brand products. We have a system where Medicare, 

Medicaid, and insurers force or encourage the 

substitution of generics through -- through price 

incentives. If generics are not responsible, in many of 

these cases no one is responsible.

 The -- we -- the position that the generics 

are proposing here is one in which they would be immune 

from liability for selling a product with inadequate 

warnings, even though the name-brand company selling the 

same drug with the same warnings would be liable. There 

is no suggestion anywhere in the record, Your Honor, 

anywhere in the legislative history or in the text of 

Hatch-Waxman or in FDA regulations that that distinction

 I would like to make one final point, Your 

Honor. In Bates -- and I apologize; we didn't address 

this specifically in our briefs, because I didn't notice 

it until later -- the statutory scheme at issue in 

Bates, under FIFRA, was almost identical to the -- I'm 

sorry. I see my time has expired. May I finish my 

point, Your Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

sentence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it a long sentence, 

with a lot of "ands."

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BOGRAD: There was no CBE equivalent in 

Bates in the -- under the FIFRA statutory scheme, and 

yet this Court upheld against a motion to dismiss on 

preemption grounds a failure to warn claim, admittedly 

under an express preemption provision. This Court 

upheld a claim against a pesticide manufacturer even 

though the pesticide manufacturer could not have changed 

its warning without prior EPA approval, exactly the same 

situation that confronts the generics here.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were designed to 

facilitate the entry of generic drugs onto the market. 

They do not absolve a manufacturer of his 

responsibilities after entry onto the market to maintain 

the safety of the drug and the adequacy of -- of the 

label.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, suppose 

that I'm not sure I agree with you that there is an 

obligation of the kind that you say for a generic drug 

manufacturer to come forward and request a label, but I 

do think that there's an opportunity for that 

manufacturer to come forward and ask the FDA to revise a 

label. If that's the way I read the law, does your 

result follow? Do you think, then, that State law 

claims should be able to go forward?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we do, because the 

ultimate question in the preemption case is whether 

there's a conflict. And if the -- if the manufacturer 

has an opportunity to come to FDA, even if -- even if

the Court were to conclude it didn't have an obligation

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the

changed, right? So the -- the physician taking care of

the FDA and didn't. Is there a cause of action against 

him?

situations. The whole point of the labeling -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what

against the physician because he did not take advantage 

of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label 

change.

would -- would impose an obligation on the physician to 

adequately advise the patient, but what's so different 

is, the physician relies upon the labeling. If the

physician has the information, the physician, on his own 

initiative, could tell the patient or warn the patient 

about what's going on without -- without having to go to 

FDA at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if your theory of 

the case is accepted, this is what will happen: Every 

time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident 

report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will 

be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We 

think you should consider revising the labels because of 

this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is 

completely protected from State suits?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Several things. The 

manufacturer does, of course, have the obligation to 

furnish the adverse event information that it receives.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But if -- if the standard in 

regulation 57(e) is met, where there's evidence, 

reasonable evidence, of a serious hazard, it has an 

obligation -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not 

going to take a chance. They're going to say, if you're 

the FDA, you look at it. We're just telling you what we 

know, and we think you ought to consider revising the 

label.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know that's 

what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic 

manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it 

would just add this boilerplate language at the end of 

every letter, and as I understand your theory, they 

would be protected.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It's not just boilerplate 

evidence at the bottom of the -- as part of a letter. 

What the -- what the Federal Register notice told the 

manufacturer to do was to -- was to submit the proposal 

to FDA with supporting information. In other words, 

suppose it's the sort of submission that would -- that 

would be like -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be the -- the 

prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the

that what you're relying on, that prologue?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think, to put it 

in context, these were the regulations actually 

implementing the Hatch-Waxman statute, and there was a 

proposal to allow the manufacturers to deviate from 

the -- from the NDA holders' label and put their own on 

it. And the -- and FDA said, no, you can't do that, but 

what you should do is bring it to FDA, and FDA will

 And so this was part and parcel of the 

notice and comment rulemaking: How should -- how should 

a generic manufacturer deal with a situation where it 

has information that may deviate from the NDA 

holder's -- how should it -足

JUSTICE ALITO: Has the FDA made any 

calculation of the economic consequences of imposing 

this duty on generic drug manufacturers? I don't know 

whether this is a good idea or not, but it does seem to 

me that it may significantly increase the costs for 

generic drug manufacturers, and therefore counteract one 

of the objectives of the statute, which was to provide 

generic drugs at a low cost.

 MR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, FDA has not 

done an analysis. But it's important to understand the 

duty here derives from the misbranding provisions. A 

generic drug manufacturer is not exempt from the 

misbranding requirements of the act, which prohibit 

distributing a drug that does not have adequate -足

adequate warnings, and rule 57(e) requiring a 

manufacturer to propose a warning or to make a warning 

change if there is evidence of a serious hazard 

implements that misbranding requirement. So this is not 

an imposition by FDA. This is an underlying requirement

MR. KNEEDLER: It's the standard in 57(e) if 

there's evidence of a serious hazard, we think State law 

can impose on a generic manufacturer which is putting a 

potentially dangerous product on the market the 

obligation to -- to investigate.

 I would -- I would like to talk about 

Buckman for just a minute, please, because it's -- it's 

come up. Buckman is fundamentally different. There was 

no independent State law duty to warn at issue in 

Buckman. It was solely a tort based on lying to the

existence of the FDA.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in the brief -足

and in the brief that you filed you said one of the 

concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with 

all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would 

interfere with the FDA's ability. Now you're telling 

me -- you -- you said when you started out that you 

think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely. In 

your brief it said SG language you said we're not 

prepared to predict that a ruling would do this.

 So, why is that a difference between those 

two cases?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, Buckman was a situation 

of a collateral attack on a decision that had actually 

been made by FDA. There was no independent duty --

State law or duty to warn, no relationship between the 

person submitting information to FDA. It was just a 

State making the tort to lie to the FDA, and you would 

have had the State regulating nothing but the 

relationship between the manufacturer and FDA.

 Here State law is regulating the 

relationship between the manufacturer and -- and the 

patient through the doctor, and that's a traditional 

area of State regulation, duty to warn, and, Justice 

Kagan, I think you're right, the question then is 

whether there is an affirmative defense of -- of

preemption, and the preemption comes in. It's very 

different from Buckman in that situation.

 It's up to the defendant to prove, it's not 

an element of the cause of action as in Buckman. It's 

part of the defense for the defendant to prove that -足

that it is -- that the cause of action is preempted.

 And in our view it's not preempted if the 

standard in 57(e) is met to propose a labeling change 

that is an obligation that extends to all manufacturers 

generic or not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's 

not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling 

change. It says labeling shall be revised, and the one 

thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't 

revise the labeling from the branded one.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It can't revise the labeling, 

but that doesn't mean it can do nothing. Impossibility 

preemption kicks in only when it's genuinely impossible, 

and if the manufacturer could go to FDA and propose a 

labeling change, it is not impossible for to it do that. 

At that point it's up to FDA and preemption would kick 

in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Kneedler.

 Mr. Lefkowitz, you have your 5 minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you.

 Mr. Kneedler has basically postulated a 

situation where we're going to have jury trials about 

whether a Federal duty to the FDA was breached. And 

it's interesting, he says that this isn't Buckman, but 

of course, Buckman involved the same duty not to sell a 

dangerous product, and the same issue of lack of 

disclosure to the FDA.

 Now, he says it was a collateral attack, but 

actually that was the premise of Justice Stevens' 

concurrence, where Justice Stevens said I get to the 

same result for a different reason. What the Court said 

was nothing about a collateral attack.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the difference, 

as I see it, is that they're not suing you for a failure 

to tell the FDA. They're suing you for a failure to 

tell them. It's you who are interposing a defense and 

saying I manufacture a dangerous drug, and I have no 

obligation to monitor and ensure that the label is 

accurate.

 And what the government is saying, as I 

understand it is, no, you do. Yes, we understand you

want to sell more cheaply, but not at the cost of public 

health.

 So what's wrong with that argument?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Sotomayor, 

respectfully, what's wrong with the premises, if they're 

claiming failure to warn, it's a very simple case of 

impossibility preemption. We couldn't warn, and the 

government's brief makes clear we had no ability to 

warn.

 What the government is now doing is it's 

taking a regulation, 201.57, which doesn't say the word 

"ask" in it. It actually says "revise." And it says 

revise because it's a regulation written for brand 

manufacturers that have the CBE option available to 

them, and they are then trying to incorporate the words 

"duty to ask" through this brief without, as Justice 

Alito says, taking into any account through notice and 

comment rulemaking the effect of this.

 Well, we know that there are over 1,600 

requests for labeling revisions pending at the FDA now, 

650 of them are pending for more than 6 months. And at 

the relevant time of this case, Your Honor, not only 

would we have had to ask the FDA, but then the FDA would 

have had to negotiate with the brand, because prior to 

the FDAAA amendments, the FDA couldn't order a brand to

change, so we would have had to make the request, the 

FDA would have had to negotiate the brand change, and 

then we would have had to follow.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you 

had asked, you would be in a different situation. If 

you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was 

negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we 

can right now. But you're not in that situation. You, 

in fact, have not done all you can right now to change 

the label because you never wrote that letter.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, and again just 

to pick up on -- on what Chief Justice Roberts said and 

Justice Scalia said, we have done everything we are 

required to do, which is to provide all of the 

information about adverse reports that we have and all 

of the results of our investigations to the government. 

And if the government wants to impose a new duty through 

notice and comment rulemaking saying, and now we have a 

duty to ask for a label change, in addition -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is taking 

the position that there's no clash between the 

government, the State, and Federal law. It's not saying 

that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you 

don't file this law. The government is saying, the 

question is preemption. Is there a clash between

Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you 

have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if 

either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not 

going to change the label?

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Buckman makes 

very clear that a State trying to regulate disclosure 

obligations to the Federal Government is simply off 

limits, and in fact -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the -- Buckman was 

about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought 

under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, it was a case 

brought by a plaintiff who was injured claiming that the 

company had not made proper, adequate disclosures to the 

FDA. It's the same thing here, and I just want to 

point -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree 

with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the 

government's position? I thought the government was 

saying that there was an obligation on the part of the 

generics to propose changes.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. What they are 

saying -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Otherwise, the government 

would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I

don't think they're saying that.

 MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, in a sense the 

government is really saying we -- to lobby or to propose 

changes is a -- is a very fine distinction. Clearly, 

what the government is now saying is they are reading a 

regulation that they've always interpreted as being only 

applicable to brand companies and saying now it's 

applicable to their companies and it incorporates new 

language that says not just revise but ask.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Lefkowitz. Counsel, the case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
