 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-76, Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations v. 

Brown.

 Mr. Feder.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FEDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The North Carolina Court of Appeals asserted 

jurisdiction over Petitioners in this case on claims 

that arose from a bus accident in France that was 

unrelated to any North Carolina contacts. Although the 

Petitioners are located overseas and do not conduct any 

business in North Carolina, the court held that North 

Carolina had general jurisdiction over these defendants 

based solely on the sale in North Carolina of a small 

fraction of their products.

 Under this Court's cases, the mere sale of a 

defendant's products in a State does not permit the 

State to reach out to assert judicial power over all of 

that defendant's worldwide conduct. If that were 

permissible, every significant seller of products would 

be subject to suit everywhere on any claim arising

anywhere.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one piece of this 

I don't quite comprehend. You -- there's no contest 

that there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?

 MR. FEDER: Yes, Your Honor. The parent 

company consented to jurisdiction in North Carolina. 

It's appointed an agent for service of process there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- it's based on 

consent?

 MR. FEDER: Yes. They also have other 

business that the parent does conduct in North Carolina, 

but there is no objection to jurisdiction over the 

parent here. This case solely concerns the Petitioners, 

who are corporations from Turkey, France, and 

Luxembourg.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think there is 

general jurisdiction over the parent? If the consent 

were not in the picture, is there? Does general 

jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal 

place of business?

 MR. FEDER: I think that that is a hard 

question, Your Honor. The short answer is I think the 

answer is "no," but I think that that is probably a 

close case -- again, putting aside the consent. But I 

do think that general jurisdiction is about suing a

company -- at least in the case of corporations, is 

about suing the corporation essentially where it's 

located or at home. It's always fair to bring a suit 

against the corporation there.

 I think that once you get beyond that, which 

is a situation that would be analogous to a State's 

power over a citizen or a resident of the State, I think 

you run into great difficulty finding a basis for the 

State to assert authority over claims completely 

unrelated to any business that -- or any contacts that 

the corporation has with the State.

 That said, it wasn't contested here, and 

there is a consent to service of process, which may or 

may not create general jurisdiction. There's a 

disagreement in the lower courts on that, but none of 

that is contested in this case.

 And without having to get to that particular 

question of whether in fact it's limited to -- whether 

general jurisdiction is limited to place of 

incorporation or principal place of business, first of 

all, there's much more directly controlling authority. 

In this case, the most directly relevant cases are 

Helicopteros and Consolidated Textile v. Gregory, 

working in tandem.

 In Helicopteros, which was this Court's last

corporate general jurisdiction case, the Court said that 

there was no general jurisdiction based on $4 million in 

purchases in the State and some other contacts. And the 

key is that -- on that point, is that the Court held 

that mere purchases could not provide the basis for 

general jurisdiction because the pre-International Shoe 

decision in Rosenberg was controlling on that point.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, this is 

preliminary, and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's 

question. Suppose you could help me out. I assume that 

there's general jurisdiction over the parent company. 

Then under respondeat superior, it would be liable in 

North Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents.

 MR. FEDER: I think that's a fair 

assumption.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why isn't it 

automatically liable for all the acts of its 

subsidiaries?

 MR. FEDER: Well, because I think -足

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and does that 

get -- and does that get into what in the Federal 

practice would be necessary parties?

 MR. FEDER: What -- Your Honor, I think that 

really what it gets into is the difference between a 

subsidiary and an agent, because a subsidiary is not

automatically acting as the agent of the parent company 

in a way where you'd get respondeat superior. And I 

think that part of what's going on in this case is that 

when this does go back to North Carolina for trial or 

for litigation against the parent company, I think that 

under North Carolina or whatever State's or nation's 

veil piercing or agency standards the North Carolina 

courts will apply, the plaintiffs will have great 

difficulty actually with the substantive case against 

the parent company, because you would actually have to 

show involvement in the actions that actually the claim 

arose out of here.

 The mere general control that's inherent in 

the parent-subsidiary relationship is not going to 

create liability, and here -- important to remember -足

we're talking about a tire manufactured in Turkey, 

accident in France which Goodyear Tire and Rubber 

Company -- and, now, this is outside the record, as I 

understand it -- did not have any direct connection 

with. Again, not relevant to the jurisdictional 

question here, but I -- just for sort of setting the -足

the context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are met with an 

argument that it's all one ball of wax. Parent and sub, 

they merge; it's one enterprise. And so if the subs do

something any place, the parent is -- it's all part of 

one thing, so -- and I think that was the principal 

argument made by the Respondents.

 MR. FEDER: Yes, Your Honor, and I would 

say, again, when it comes to liability in Goodyear Tire 

and Rubber, they'll be free to make that argument. That 

argument is not properly presented here. It was never 

made below.

 It was never -- it was not made in the brief 

in opposition to cert, so any argument for ignoring 

corporate distinctions or an enterprise theory -- none 

of that was made and, therefore, has been waived. I 

think that, secondly, as we indicated in our reply 

brief -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: We haven't resolved a whole 

lot if we leave that question open, have we? You want 

us to write an opinion that says, unless you -- unless 

you ignore the separate corporate existence of the 

subsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we 

express no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no 

jurisdiction in cases like this? Is that the kind of an 

opinion that the world is waiting for?

 MR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

actually in -- if the Court were to write that, it would 

be left with the important general jurisdiction question

that the court below decided incorrectly, and 

incorrectly in a few ways.

 I think that, in fact, there would be 

several ways for this Court to approach it, all of which 

would actually help to clear up the law in this area. I 

think that even if one gets past the waiver point -- and 

the reason the Court shouldn't get past the waiver point 

is, among other things, because it wasn't raised -- we, 

of course, had no opportunity to put in evidence that, 

in fact, these corporations are run separately, 

independent decision making, observation of corporate 

form, and all the other things that would normally go 

into it.

 If you want to reach it, first of all, there 

is -- even on the standards articulated in the 

Respondents' brief, there's nothing in the record to 

support it, and -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were saying 

we should not even -- not even address the situation 

where there is no special basis for ignoring the -- the 

separate incorporation. I -- of course, we should not 

get into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary 

was a sham -足

all of that, but the simple question of whether, when 

you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are 

your actions.

 MR. FEDER: That, I think, the Court -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have to reach 

that?

 MR. FEDER: You certainly do have to reach 

that, Your Honor. The Court has reached it and decided 

it before, and has said that the mere parent-subsidiary 

relationship does not create attribution one to the 

other, most recently in Keeton, in which the Court cited 

some of its older cases for that very proposition.

 And I think that in -- another way to look 

at it is, even if you wanted to treat the sales in North 

Carolina as if they were made there directly by these 

Petitioners -- in other words, even if you picked -足

assuming arguendo that you could attribute those sales 

directly to the Petitioners and not, as the court below 

found, treat them as not having been caused by them, 

that does not come close to satisfying what is required 

for general jurisdiction.

 And, in particular, in going back to 

Helicopteros and Gregory, just as the Rosenberg case was 

binding in Helicopteros on the point that mere purchases 

are not enough for general jurisdiction, here

Consolidated Textile v. Gregory is binding on the flip 

side of that, which is that mere sales in the State are 

not enough for general jurisdiction.

 Even if Gregory weren't binding, I think 

that you could look at Helicopteros and say there is no 

real basis for a distinction between mere purchases and 

mere sales. But, in fact, there is a case directly on 

point, and as well as a lot of case law from the time of 

Gregory more generally requiring much more substantial 

-- a substantial physical presence in the State. In 

terms of -- I think no personal jurisdiction argument 

should go by without talking about International Shoe, 

and if you look at just the International Shoe line of 

cases, even aside from this issue of Gregory being 

binding, the decision below is equally, if not more, 

untenable.

 International Shoe itself recognizes -- in 

sort of carving out an area for what eventually came to 

be called general jurisdiction, it recognizes the 

extraordinary nature of the State power that we're 

talking about when we talk about general jurisdiction, 

which is this power to reach out and assert State power 

over things that by hypothesis have no relationship to 

contacts with the State. International Shoe uses the 

language saying that you need continuous corporate

operations within the State and says that these 

continuous corporate operations have to be so 

substantial and of such a nature as to justify this 

jurisdiction over conduct that is entirely unconnected 

to the State.

 The one case where the Court has upheld 

general jurisdiction since International Shoe over a 

corporation is Perkins, which was a case that involved 

the corporation's principal place of business. And in 

Helicopteros, following Perkins, when the Court 

articulated the standard there, the Court said that 

we're looking to see whether there are contacts of the 

sort that we found to exist in Perkins. So -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Perkins is kind of an 

unusual case, because it was a company that at the time 

was doing business only in Ohio. It was a Philippine 

mining company, and it was World War II, so the mines 

couldn't be run. So to the extent that the corporation 

was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.

 MR. FEDER: That's right, Your Honor, and I 

guess what I would say about that is that it's 

unusual -- those are unusual facts, but not unusual in 

terms of what is required to be able to assert general 

jurisdiction.

as essentially involving the corporation's principal 

place of business, and I think that's right because in 

order for the State to be able to assert jurisdiction 

over things unrelated to the State, you need that type 

of relationship equivalent to a citizen or resident that 

gives a State authority over the corporation's actions 

worldwide and not just -- because this goes far beyond 

specific jurisdiction where the State has a manifest 

interest in an accident or a claim that arose in the 

State or connected to the State.

 Helicopteros, just to circle back on that 

point, does say we're looking for contacts of the sort 

found to exist in Perkins, and -- and as we said, said 

that even $4 million in purchases were not enough. I 

think that all of those cases help to make it clear why 

the mere sales here are not enough.

 And if there are no further questions, I'd 

like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

The North Carolina State court was wrong to 

assert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners, 

extending potentially to any claim against them arising 

out of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and 

there are several ways to see why that's wrong. Even if 

the Court were to accept the proposition that such 

contacts with North Carolina as there are in the record 

should be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts 

still don't rise to the level of what this Court has -足

has demanded in terms of continuous and systematic 

contacts.

 And even setting those more -- those more 

precedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the 

result of the North Carolina court's decision is that 

the jurisdictional consequences here would be quite 

disproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on 

which it would be based.

 So if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to 

the continuous and systematic contacts proposition, 

which this Court has certainly not elaborated in its 

case law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's 

useful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying 

to get at. And what we think the Court was trying to 

get at, particularly by -- as my friend referred to, 

particularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins

as -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous 

and systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing 

an active volitional undertaking by the -- by the 

defendant. It can't be based on the contact -- conduct 

of third parties. Obviously, the continuous concept of 

existing without interruption.

 And with respect to systematic, we think 

that that means there needs to be a plurality of 

contacts, they have to be of different kinds or 

qualities in a sense of perhaps employment as well as 

contractual as well as regulatory as well as property as 

well as sales or purchases, and that those contacts 

together have to have some interrelationship that 

results in something that might be thought of as more 

than the sum of their parts. And -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose it's just a 

corporation that's registered to do business in North 

Carolina, and the connection with that registration -足

it says: I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive 

process for any and all claims.

 MR. HORWICH: Well, as -- as Mr. Feder 

referred -- referred to, there -- there is a division in 

the lower courts on whether that sort of a consent is 

effective to permit the State general jurisdiction 

over -- over the consenting party. That -- but the

Court has, I -- I think, been -- been fairly clear in -足

in setting notions of -- of formal consent to one side 

when considering contacts-based cases. And so, in part, 

this case, therefore, doesn't present that question, and 

we don't have a position, as the Government, on that 

today with respect to whether that's effective.

 But it certainly is the case that simply 

because one entity in a Goodyear family of -- of related 

corporations has consented, that somehow that consent 

should extend to the entire enterprise. And if I can 

maybe take a minute to talk about where we think the 

Respondents' view of -- of this enterprise jurisdiction 

goes wrong, because we touched on it only -- only 

briefly in our brief, which was, of course, filed before 

theirs.

 When -- when a court confronts a -- a set of 

-- a corporate family, if you will, there seem to be two 

principles that can be usefully applied in determining 

the jurisdictional consequences of that relationship. 

One is the alter ego concept, which certainly doesn't 

seem to be supported on anything in the record here in 

the sense that there's -- that there's no sound 

suggestion in the record that -- that the European 

entities were somehow a sham, that they didn't have any 

separate existence, they were undercapitalized or any of

the other indicia that you would see.

 And so, to your point, Justice Scalia, I 

think it is certainly something the Court could say that 

the record here is no basis for that kind of a decision 

to disregard the corporate separateness.

 Then the other concept is the agency 

concept. And I think that may be what -- what 

Respondents are placing somewhat greater reliance on. 

And we certainly -- we certainly have the view that an 

agent, acting on behalf of a principal within the scope 

of its agency, can take actions that create contacts 

with the jurisdiction that are, by virtue of the agency 

relationship, attributable back to the principal.

 But there are -- there are two important 

things to realize, that that -- that that proposition is 

somewhat modest in that, first of all, simply because 

a -- a parent owns a subsidiary does not mean the 

subsidiary is the parent's agent. Plenty of parents 

simply own subsidiaries as property or for various 

business reasons. It doesn't mean the subsidiary is 

automatically always acting as the agent of the parent 

for all purposes or any at all.

 And -- and the second thing to be cautious 

about in applying the agency principle is that the 

agency relationship only runs one way; that is to say

the agent can do something that creates a contact on 

behalf of the principal, but that's not to say that 

everything the principal does in its independent 

activities says anything about what contacts its agent 

has. That's exactly backwards.

 In the -- and so, here the -- the allegation 

actually in the complaint is that the European companies 

are the agents of the parent -- of the -- of the 

Goodyear U.S. entity. That's -- that's paragraph 16 of 

the complaint at page 112 of -- 122 of the joint 

appendix. So it -- it might be -- it -- there might be 

an argument that something that the European 

subsidiaries have done, say, in Turkey is something that 

could be chargeable to the U.S. parent in a case where 

it was relevant what the parent's relationship with 

Turkey was.

 But what Respondents are asking for here, in 

effect, turns that completely around and suggests 

implicitly that the -- the -- this -- the parent of the 

Goodyear organization in the United States was somehow 

doing the bidding, acting at the direction and control 

of the European companies as principals.

kind of question? And I apologize in advance for taking 

you a little bit far afield. But -- but I wanted to ask 

you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems 

to have some relevance to -- not the general 

jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific 

jurisdiction. So this is on page 20.

 You say: "If mere 'purposeful availment' of 

commercial opportunities in a particular State" -- which 

is, of course, the test for specific jurisdiction -- if 

that purposeful availment "were sufficient to subject an 

enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's 

courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an 

independent distributor, intending that they be resold 

in all 50 States, could potentially be brought to 

judgment in any State, on any claim against it."

 So I -- I take that -- I understand that to 

read that you think that it is purposeful availment that 

subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to 

general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if 

a corporation sold its goods to an independent 

distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 

States. Am I reading that correctly?

 MR. HORWICH: No, I don't -- I don't believe 

so, in the sense that I -- I think we were sort of 

assuming arguendo a concept of purposeful availment

that -- that would be willing to attribute those -足

those contacts for purposes of a specific-jurisdiction

analysis. I don't know if that helps with the -- with 

the answer, but -足

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I was hoping that the 

answer would be "yes," actually.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's at least one 

other person in the courtroom who was hoping that, too.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was wondering why 

-- why is your interest in this case so much greater 

than it would be in -- in the other case, and this --

I've been wondering that at the outset, and this 

sentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into 

full focus.

 MR. HORWICH: Well, Justice Kennedy, let 

me -- let me put it this way. It -- it -- the 

difference in our interest in the two cases is at bottom 

just a difference in magnitude, but we think it's a 

fairly significant difference in magnitude in the 

sense -- in the sense that the jurisdictional 

consequences of an assertion of general jurisdiction are

that -- with that one determination, it is the case that 

that defendant can -- could potentially be brought to 

judgment in a forum for all -- for claims arising from 

any of its conduct anywhere in the world.

 And specific jurisdiction by construction, 

by its very nature, is only going to be a determination 

-- whatever the contours of the specific rules that are 

used, it's going to never be more than a determination 

that jurisdiction in a claim, considering the 

relationship between the defendant, the forum, and the 

particular litigation, gives rise to jurisdiction.

manufacturer to liability throughout the world because 

it uses the Internet. And -- and that -- I don't know

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COLLYN PEDDIE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. PEDDIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Goodyear Petitioners ask this Court to 

assist them in avoiding the jurisdiction of the North 

Carolina court. This Court should decline for two 

reasons. First, there's nothing new here. Ample 

evidence supports North Carolina's exercise of general 

jurisdiction over the Petitioners under very well 

established general jurisdiction and due process 

principles. And -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there's something 

very new about this, because general jurisdiction is 

all-purpose jurisdiction, and for a corporation it's 

sort of like a residence for an individual. I think Mr. 

Feder was making that point.

 What's -- what's troubling here is that the 

North Carolina court seems to be blending the two 

together: specific jurisdiction based on the claim

arising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a 

claim that has nothing to do with the forum, and its 

insertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims. And 

I do not know of any case post-International Shoe -- the 

only thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet.

 Is there -- is there any case in which this 

Court has sanctioned the assertion of general 

jurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming 

into the State, not the product that caused the injury 

abroad? I don't know of any case.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, if that's -- if 

that's the characterization of the case and that's all 

you had, then there wouldn't be a case. Our argument 

here, and I think the -- what the -- what the evidence 

in this case bears out is that is not the case here. 

The characterization of the case by both the Government 

and by Petitioners is that there is simply mere sales 

here, and they ignore how the sales occurred.

 Our focus is on how the sales occurred, and 

I think Justice Scalia made a -- a correct distinction, 

that what we're doing here is not talking about 

attribution, that -- that sort of thing, and -- and 

simply saying that because someone down the line sold 

them, without any other discussion, there's general 

jurisdiction. That's not correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, you don't 

defend the reasoning of the State supreme court?

 MS. PEDDIE: I think that the -- the State 

supreme court did a lot of things right, but, as we say 

in the brief, we think that they took a detour in using 

inappropriate stream-of-commerce language that isn't 

there. It's not that they didn't have help doing it. 

For example, the Petitioners have changed their tune 

here. They talked routinely about purposeful availment 

in their briefs to the court of appeals and to the 

supreme court. For example, page 327 of their brief 

requests that they -- that they find purposeful 

availment here. So the court had a lot of help.

 But that part of the opinion we don't really 

think is appropriate, nor is it necessary. The point 

that I'm making about there being nothing new is that 

there is ample evidence in this case to apply to the 

general jurisdiction principles that were used in 

Perkins and used in Hall and that can cause this Court 

to reach the correct result.

 As the Court is well aware, this Court can 

affirm on any basis supported in the record, and we 

believe that there is a basis in well-established rules 

supported in the record, whether it agrees with the 

court of appeals' decision or not. It's not bound by

 I'd like to address the question of waiver 

because it's -- it's come up. I think that the 

Solicitor General has correctly -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you've got -- you 

have me in suspense.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me why it is that the 

general principles of jurisdiction do apply here, and 

then we can get to waiver.

 MS. PEDDIE: Okay, okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't leave me dangling 

like that.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, as far back as -足

as Burger King, this Court recognized that commercial 

activities, when they're conducted on behalf of an 

out-of-State party, can sometimes be attributed. Even 

the Solicitor General agrees that there's a different 

jurisdictional analysis that may apply over and above 

something like Cannon or Rush v. Savchuk, if there are 

case-specific interactions between particular affiliated 

corporations as you have here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Case-specific 

is not talking about general jurisdiction.

are that there are evidentiary case-specific

conclusion of general jurisdiction and thus subjecting 

them to suit on -- in dispute-blind -- or dispute-blind 

jurisdiction.

 In addition, this Court has used in a 

variety of other areas a unitary business principle for 

local taxation in Mobil. And even as far back as 15 

years ago, the Hague Convention, our trade partners that 

are complained of here, talked about the fact that 

using -- attributing contacts or counting contacts that 

were based on conduct performed by others was 

appropriate and was not really a sticking point and that 

they were perfectly content to leave that to other 

cases.

jurisdiction here.

 MS. PEDDIE: Okay. In this case I think 

it's the part -- and, frankly, we'll use the Solicitor 

General's definition of a system, from their brief at -足

at page 23, where they talked about conduct that forms a 

system and aggregation of objects united by some form of 

regular activity or interdependent.

 Using their definition, I think you ask the 

question: Is a defendant part of a continuous business 

system or enterprise that conducts general business 

activities in the forum? And the first question you 

asked is: Is it a single system or an enterprise? This 

Court has said in Mobil Oil that a unitary business is

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Peddie, you haven't 

-- you don't have anything in the record about this 

being a unitary business. Unless you're trying to 

present some sweeping piercing-the-corporate-veil 

theory, there is nothing here that says that these 

aren't corporations that are acting separately, that 

have their own officers, have their own employees, keep 

their own books. There's nothing to show that it's all 

part of one enterprise.

 MS. PEDDIE: I disagree with that, Your 

Honor. Under the sort of traditional measures that the

Court has used in terms of -- of ownership, et cetera, I 

don't think there is anything. But even the Solicitor 

General concedes, at page 27 of their brief, that the 

court of appeals effectively treated the parent and 

subsidiary corporations as an undifferentiated entity 

for distribution of the Petitioners' product, and that 

was our position below. And I think if you look at -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question isn't 

whether they did that; the question is whether it was 

right to do that.

 MS. PEDDIE: That -- that's -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you don't make your 

point by saying that the court of appeals made a 

mistake.

 MS. PEDDIE: No, no. But I think -- I think 

what -- what -- at least as I understood her question -足

and I may have misunderstood her question -- was is 

there anything in the record where -- where they had 

done that. I think the -- the evidence in the record is 

part and parcel of the fact findings that the trial 

court made about the existence of a highly integrated 

supply and distribution system in the -- that operates 

in the State.

Petitioners manufactured in North Carolina was

determined solely by orders that were solicited in North 

Carolina by Goodyear and forecasts made by Goodyear 

based on data that they gathered there. On the 

distribution side, the testimony from Mr. Kramer was 

that they don't send tires for distribution; they don't 

do any distribution. It was an internal distribution 

system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, those 

arrangements could exist with a lot of distributors. 

You don't want to ship a distributor stuff that the 

distributor is not going to be using.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think -足

fact that you coordinate with your distributor how much 

of your product you're going to ship to him doesn't -足

doesn't really show -足

MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you are a unitary 

business with your distributor.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think this goes 

way beyond coordination. For example, Mr. Kramer 

testified that, quote, "Their job is just to be given a 

forecast or a ticket, and then they just build widgets." 

That's all they do. They were complete -- their -足

on the control and the requests from the parent. The 

requests, as he testified, quote, "emanate from the 

requests that Goodyear would make." And the production 

and supply system was the same for all of them.

 On the distribution side, the testimony was 

even more -- I think was even more limited in that he 

said the plant in Turkey doesn't control any 

distribution. They wouldn't send anything into United 

States without the approval and sanction of the parent, 

and anything else, quote, "just doesn't happen."

 So this was a closed system. It was 

dominated by -- by the Goodyear parent, and there wasn't 

a question of coordination. It was they didn't produce 

unless the parent told them to; they sent it where the 

parent said they should send it to; and when it got to 

the United States, the testimony is, is that the parent 

controlled it at that point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the "it" wasn't the 

product that caused the injury here. As I understand 

the case, the tire that allegedly caused this bus to 

turn over was designed for the European and Asian 

markets, not the U.S. market.

 MS. PEDDIE: The Goodyear Regional RHS tire 

that was on the bus and that failed was not generally 

designed for the U.S. market, although it was brought

over here under special circumstances.

 The tires we're talking about are of three 

kinds. There are passenger and bus tires that you would 

ordinarily see that would be sold individually; 

second -- a second category are tires that were sold as 

original equipment on cars and buses; and, third, and 

the predominant type that were sent to the United 

States, were specialty tires for so-called low boy 

trailers which were horse trailers, boat trailers, of 

which there are in many North Carolina.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why did -- why should 

-- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros, and he said in 

that case, it was purchases; and in this case, it's 

sales. And in the purchaser case, certainly we said no, 

there's no general jurisdiction. Why should it be any 

different?

 MS. PEDDIE: I think the distinction between 

Hall and Perkins is not so much purchases and sales, 

it's which contacts do you count? And the language that 

is sort of forgotten in Hall is the language that they 

talk about -- you needed to have the same general 

business contacts that you had in Perkins.

 I think the difference is, is that purchases 

are sort of a one-shot deal. They may be supplies, 

but -- but they're more irregular, but the core business

 I apologize for interrupting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Perkins, it was the 

home of the corporation. There was no other at the 

time, because their permanent home was not functioning 

because of the war. So there was only one place.

of that case are -- is that one officer of the 

corporation came home, and he was -- he maintained

was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.

 MS. PEDDIE: Right. And the Court 

characterized that -- I think there's a difference 

between what the Court did in Perkins and how it was 

described in Keeton. That's the language that the 

Petitioners have used.

 But the language that the Court used in 

Perkins was that the decision was based on the

supervision over, for example, the renovation of the 

factory after the war took place in the forum.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about the 

ramifications of your theory that there's general 

jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three 

subsidiaries?

 Suppose that one of the children on a bus 

was a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada. And 

had the idea that juries in North Carolina are more 

liberal than in France. Well, there wouldn't be any 

jury in France, but -- so could the Canadian come and 

sue because there's general jurisdiction in the United 

States?

 MS. PEDDIE: I think it would depend upon a 

lot of factors, Your Honor. Are you assuming that 

there's -- it's established that there's general 

jurisdiction there, or are we in the same fact pattern 

as here?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, you -- we're talking 

about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries. You say 

there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina. Those 

companies can be sued on any and all claims.

 So my question is: Could anyone on that bus 

that turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to

bring the wrongful death, or whatever, suit?

 MS. PEDDIE: I think -- I think, in theory, 

they could; I think, in practice, the case would never 

stay there because of the controls that we talked about 

on forum shopping; about, particularly, forum non 

conveniens. One of the suggestions, for example, that 

we made is one may want to consider for due -- for due 

process purposes the residence of the plaintiff. Is it 

fair, for example, to have a case in North Carolina 

where the plaintiff doesn't live in North Carolina, as 

they do here, but lives in Canada?

 So that's -- that's one limitation. And as 

this Court said in the Sinochem case, you can look at 

the forum non conveniens issue before you look at the 

jurisdictional issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's an -- that's 

an odd way to think about general jurisdiction. General 

jurisdiction is principally status -- your residence, 

the principal place of business, the place of 

incorporation. And this -- these factors that you're 

mentioning are -- in fact, some of the factors you 

mention in the brief are quite different than that.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, I think if -- if 

the limitation -- if the Court's view is basically the 

Petitioners', that you are limited to principal place of

which we don't think is the state of the law, and, 

frankly, if it were the state of the law, then we would 

have a Hague Convention now and it wouldn't have taken 

20 years to negotiate.

 If -- if that's the position that the Court 

is taking, then I don't think that -- you know, that 

this case represents something different. I think that 

the state of the law is that -- or at least the 

professed state of the law is that it is based on 

continuous and systematic contacts.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Peddie, let's assume 

that you're right, that on some level that some -- that 

it's not just the place of incorporation or the 

principal place of business, that it could be created by 

something more. The only something more here is 

Goodyear USA, so your adversary is right that what 

you're asking us to do is sort of a reverse 

principal-agent.

 You're saying that the subsidiary has used 

the principal, its owner, as its agent. That's

took possession of them when they arrived in the United 

States. They were put in warehouses and sold outside of 

those, but there were several distribution methods.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: At page 265 of the brief? 

I didn't read that many pages.

 MS. PEDDIE: No, no. Excuse me. Page 265 

of the Joint Appendix. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Peddie, this is just a 

-- this is an I'm-just-curious question: Why do you 

care? You have Goodyear USA, which has consented to 

jurisdiction. Why does it make a difference to get 

these other companies in the North Carolina courts? 

Does North Carolina not make Goodyear USA substantively 

liable for this accident?

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, North Carolina has 

particularly Draconian requirements for piercing the 

corporate veil and alter ego, some of which Petitioners 

refer to. For example, the proximate causation of the 

wrong has to be related to the domination and control, 

and so ideally it would be great if we could go back and 

simply deal with them and let them collect from their -足

JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- but what you're 

saying, then, is that North Carolina treats the parent 

and the subs very differently as a matter of substantive

law, but you would want identical treatment as a matter 

of jurisdiction?

 MS. PEDDIE: Right. They have very -- in 

most States, frankly, there's a -- a lesser requirement 

for the exercise of jurisdiction, merely allowing the 

suit to go forward, than there is for actual imputation 

of liability or imposition of liability, and so North 

Carolina, I think, is a very good example of that.

 They have a fairly liberal requirement or 

state of the law that we've cited in the Manley case, 

where general personal jurisdiction exists over a 

foreign corporation where it is controlled by or 

controls a local corporation. And that's the Wyatt 

Confectionary case that we cited in the -- excuse me -足

the Chocolate Confectionary case cited in the Manley 

case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that that 

answered -- I understood you to be saying that, 

substantively, they might not be liable for the defect 

that caused the accident. Is that it?

 MS. PEDDIE: Yes. That -- I mean, we -- I 

think you have to understand that this case is at a very 

embryonic state. We've done no discovery in this case. 

This was a -- an appeal, an interlocutory appeal from 

the denial of a motion to dismiss, and so there's been

one deposition on a very limited jurisdictional issue. 

So we've not had an opportunity to develop the facts.

 We hope we will be able to develop those 

facts, but what we're faced with here is a situation 

where North Carolina would permit the exercise of 

jurisdiction under its well-established law on general 

personal jurisdiction, but when it comes to the 

imposition of liability for substantive purposes, that 

may be a much, much -- much tougher sledding. And so in 

order to preserve the interests of our client, we've -足

we've gone down this road as well.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have any case law 

that supports your position, which, I take it -- and 

correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is 

subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long 

as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by 

the parent to the -- to buyers in the forum State?

 MS. PEDDIE: No, Your Honor, because that's 

not our position here. Our position is that if you 

participate in this kind -- not a general one, but in 

this kind of very tightly controlled system, 

distribution and supply system, then there is general 

jurisdiction in the forum over the foreign subsidiary 

that participates in this. But simply generally having

the forum, that's not what we're contending. And, 

frankly, I don't think that that would be a situation in 

which general jurisdiction would apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I see nothing in the 

North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this 

is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate 

the distinction between parent and sub.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, they do talk 

repeatedly about the existence of this highly integrated 

distribution system. I think it might be helpful to 

sort of flip it over and say what would happen if we 

adopted the Petitioners' view that you ignore the 

system, and all you look at is a -- is a few sales. I 

think that then you would end up with a situation that 

would be unfair to the State of North Carolina in terms 

of providing a forum for its residents.

 For example, if I may give a hypothetical, 

if you have a -- not a manufacturing plant in Turkey, 

but, let's say, in China that is producing a massive 

amount of tires for importation into the United States, 

thousands of tires, in this same distribution system. 

Based on their view that it has to be principal place of 

business, State of incorporation, and that mere sales 

are not -- don't count, and it has the same jurisdiction 

system, then even that -- that producer -- and, frankly,

Goodyear is one of those producers -- wouldn't be liable 

in North Carolina if the injury occurred someplace else.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's a -足

you open your brief saying something to the effect of 

this case is about outsourcing, jobs in the U.S. going 

to some subsidiary port. But then these subsidiaries 

are making tires which, on your own admission, very 

rarely come to the United States because they're 

designed specifically for vehicles in Asia and in 

Europe. And so I would think that Turkey would be the 

ideal location for -- for such a place. I don't get 

your outsourcing pitch.

 MS. PEDDIE: Your Honor, our -- our position 

here is that you will incentivize outsourcing if you 

agree with the Petitioners' view. With regard to the 

existing plants, 1,500 miles, which is the distance from 

Istanbul to Paris, is -- is not exactly local 

production. But what we're talking about is, again, 

something like the example that I gave you of a 

production in China, that you have -- and -- and it's 

based on the definition that we make of outsourcing, 

which are jobs that simply were in the United States.

here based on policy. Instead, it has to be a showing 

of unfairness -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

argument about outsourcing sounded an awful lot like a 

policy argument to me.

 MS. PEDDIE: Well, it is a policy argument, 

but I think, Your Honor, that -- in all candor, I think 

we felt the need to -- to respond to the policy 

arguments of not just the Government but also to the 

other side.

 I would -- I would say, let me -- if I might 

complete -- complete the other thought, is that all of 

those considerations, as interesting as they are, as 

compelling as they may seem, you know, are not due 

process considerations. This Court really isn't 

empowered to restrict the jurisdiction of State courts 

based on assisting the United States in negotiating 

trade treaties; instead, it has to be based on 

unfairness and a showing of undue burden.

 With regard to -- getting back to the -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it could be 

perfectly fair if you announce that you're going to 

assert jurisdiction over anybody who harms an American 

citizen anywhere in the world, and you give notice to 

every manufacturer in the world. That would be 

perfectly fair, but you have no power to do that 

under -- under accepted notions of what a sovereign can 

do.

 MS. PEDDIE: And -- and it would be tempered 

by the -- the burdens test that is articulated in Asahi 

and elsewhere, but none of that impacts, you know, 

policy considerations such as trade negotiations, 

et cetera. And the focus has been fairness and balance 

of interests. And here you have a -- a manufacturer and 

you have Petitioners who voluntarily participated in an 

enterprise that operates in the State here. And we 

think that there's nothing unfair about -- when they 

agreed to deal with this, when they made money off of 

doing this, when they do this on an ongoing basis, 

there's nothing unfair about -- about subjecting them to 

liability there.

 And particularly when you look at the Asahi 

factors, there's really no burden on the defendants 

here. One of the things that the Petitioners did not 

respond to in our -- our brief is the notion that no

matter what this Court decides, two of these Petitioners 

are going to be litigating in a foreign country 

anywhere. And the only thing that they have interjected 

as a burden is the presumptive burden of litigating in 

another country. They're going to be litigating in 

another country unless a court atomizes this case and 

says that the Petitioners have to litigate in four 

different states.

 So there's nothing -- there's nothing to 

sort of suggest that there's -- there's any burden, nor, 

therefore, a basis for restricting the jurisdiction of 

the North Carolina State courts based on due process 

concerns.

 By contrast -- and the other thing that -足

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only if you believe that 

burden is the only issue. The issue is power, not just 

burden.

 MS. PEDDIE: That's -- that's correct, but

v. Neff, that the power is tempered only by the Due 

Process Clause, not about policy concerns. And so, 

it -- as -- as -- I think the Court is correct that it 

may be perfectly fair to announce this to the world, but 

it's up to this Court to determine whether due process 

would restrict the exercise of that power, and it does

it on an enunciated set of factors, none of which 

includes assisting the United States in negotiating 

trade treaties.

 The Petitioners, I think, as we've 

suggested, have not really shown any sort of burden 

here, and they would be litigating with the same lawyers 

in the -- same lawyers in the same forum as their 

parent. And the Court has observed that even the kinds 

of litigation that would take place, the burdens on 

litigating in a foreign -- foreign forum are much 

reduced, and that was in 1957, the year that I was born.

 The primary objections here are based on 

trade. I think it's -- it's interesting that the 

Government has -- has talked about those, but I don't 

think that's a basis for restricting jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you go back? 

You -- you said something about the two of them are 

subject to suit. You said this is a question of one 

lawsuit instead of four. Could you explain that?

 MS. PEDDIE: Well, for example, the parent 

and the three Petitioners all have principal places of 

business in four different countries. And we have 

general jurisdiction over the parent in the forum. We 

have the same lawyers that are representing all the 

parties in the forum, and we intend to go forward in

 MS. PEDDIE: Well, in France the -- the 

Petitioners from Luxembourg and from Turkey -- if they 

litigate in France, they're going to be litigating in a 

foreign country as well. And so, our question is: Why 

is it somehow more convenient to litigate in France than 

it is in the United States when you've got the same 

lawyers and the -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a question of 

more convenience. It's a question that the claim arose 

there, and then, of course, there was -- just because 

the claim arose there, there would be some convenience 

factors. All the witnesses to the accident are there; 

whatever is left of the bus is there.

 MS. PEDDIE: Well, those -- those are the 

forum non conveniens issues that -- that a -- that a 

court would consider. But I'm talking about the due 

process question in terms of investigating the -- the 

actual burden on the Petitioners in litigating in the 

forum. And the only thing that they've really focused 

on is their preference for that forum, which is not a 

due process concern.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FEDER: Thank you, Your Honor.

 The purported integrated distribution that 

Respondents are pointing to as the basis for ignoring 

the corporate separation here, whatever else you could 

say about it and whether it's really any different from 

normal coordination, it only relates to the tiny 

fraction of Petitioners' business that involved tires 

going to the United States.

 So -- where they didn't normally market 

their products, and so, of course, everything that they 

sent to the United States was only when the U.S. 

affiliate reached out to get tires. That does not -足

under any theory of which I'm aware, even the most 

aggressive enterprise theory, that would not amount to a 

basis for merging the two companies and treating parent 

and sub as if they were one.

 As far as the hypothetical about China goes, 

I wanted to briefly address that. Of course, to the 

extent that there are a lot of tires sent in from China 

or anywhere else to North Carolina or any other State, 

there will be specific jurisdiction most likely in those 

cases.

Our position here is simply that the fact 

that tires are coming in, over which you may have 

specific jurisdiction, is no basis to say that you can 

also bring in North Carolina what general jurisdiction 

would allow you to bring: claims from workplace 

accidents in China, lease disputes, and whatever else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about special 

jurisdiction? Why don't -- why we decide this on the 

basis of special jurisdiction? It's an accepted basis 

of jurisdiction. Citizenship is. Countries can make it 

a crime -- in fact, I think Italy does -- to kill an 

Italian citizen abroad, and that person can be tried for 

that crime in Italy. So I assume that -- that that is 

an acceptable basis of jurisdiction.

 So why don't we say that there's a 

specialized jurisdiction when a citizen of -- of North 

Carolina is -- is injured abroad, so long as there is -足

what -- what is the word? The submission to the -- to 

the courts of North Carolina by having enough contacts 

with North Carolina. The previous case -- what's that 

crazy word that's -足

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why don't we decide 

it that way?

 MR. FEDER: Well, Your Honor, I don't -- I 

don't think our law has a concept of special 

jurisdiction like that, as consistent with the Due 

Process Clause, and I think that even -- I won't purport 

to speak for the Respondents in the other case, but I 

think that they would probably agree that if the 

accident had happened to a New Jersey citizen in France, 

that that would not create, even under their 

stream-of-commerce theory, jurisdiction.

 Under our due process precedents, you need 

purposeful availment. And for general jurisdiction, of 

course, you need quite a bit more than that. And so, 

while creative, I don't think that would quite carry the 

day.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there is a 

country that has this -- what Justice Scalia -- France, 

in the Civil Code, says that any French citizen can sue 

anybody on any claim in France. But we consider that an 

exorbitant jurisdictional rule.

obviously we wouldn't recognize that under our Due

reasons why, at least at the margins, it is important to 

be able to negotiate treaties so that we can avoid 

having that sort of jurisdiction exercised against our
