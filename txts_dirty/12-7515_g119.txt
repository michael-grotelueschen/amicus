3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We will hear 

4 argument next in Case 12-7515, Burrage v. United States. 

5 Ms. Campbell. 

6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL, 

7                 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT, 

8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9             MS. CAMPBELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

10 please the Court: 

11             Marcus Burrage is serving a 20-year 

12 mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that, 

13 according to the jury instruction that was given to the 

14 jury at the time of the trial, was not the primary cause 

15 of the death, but, rather, merely played a part in the 

16 death. 

17             This lesser standard of contributing 

18 causation was neither articulated by Congress within the 

19 words of the statute, nor was it generally accepted at 

20 the time the statute was passed, as an acceptable 

21 version of causation. 

22             Congress's selection of the word "results" 

23 instead should be interpreted to mean the traditional 

24 notions of causation; those of factual cause or but-for 

25 cause and proximate cause.

1             Now, the parties don't disagree that 

2 "results in" means causation.  That it's a causation 

3 analysis.  And regardless of whether you look to the 

4 common law or the treatises or the legal commentators, 

5 causation triggers, at the very minimum, a but-for 

6 causation analysis.  In this particular case, but for 

7 the use of the heroin, the victim would not have died. 

8             Now, the Solicitor General suggests a lesser 

9 causation standard, one that expands the notion of 

10 but-for causation.  But if we instead look to the case 

11 law and this Court's precedent, we are not actually 

12 trying to expand but-for causation in most cases, we are 

13 trying to limit it.  Because but-for causation can be 

14 extrapolated beyond what we are willing to give 

15 liability for. 

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How would you respond to 

17 the hypothetical that the government poses on 24 of its 

18 brief, that it's the three drops of poison, each 

19 defendant puts in one drop, one drop will not do it, 

20 three drops will, and none of them would be chargeable 

21 because it takes three drops? 

22             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I would disagree with 

23 the premise that they are not chargeable.  Each 

24 individual person that put the drop of poison in that 

25 cup could be charged with attempted murder if they were

1 trying to kill a person.  But under standard causation 

2 analysis, you -- you do not have but-for causation. 

3 Each individual drop of poison was not the but-for 

4 causation and so you -- you don't have causation. 

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you would if -- 

6 if you knew that there were two drops in and you added 

7 the third drop after the two drops.  Right? 

8             MS. CAMPBELL:  Then -- 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I've 

10 lost sight of this.  Is this each drop is enough or -- 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Three -- three drops. 

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It takes three. 

13             MS. CAMPBELL:  In the government's -- in the 

14 government's hypothetical, each person individually puts 

15 in one drop and you need three drops in order to -- to 

16 kill the person. 

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All right.  Well, 

18 there's but-for causation when you are the third person. 

19 Your drop caused the death, and the death would not have 

20 been caused without your drop. 

21             MS. CAMPBELL:  That would be correct, that 

22 there would be but-for causation. 

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But each one is the third 

24 person.  I mean, each one of them is the third person. 

25 It seems to me each one is a but-for cause.  And I don't

1 know why you don't say there's but-for causation there. 

2             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well -- 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  As I understand -- as I 

4 understood the evidence in this case, the experts 

5 testified they could not say that he would not have died 

6 but for the cocaine. 

7             MS. CAMPBELL:  That's -- 

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's quite different from 

9 this case where what is put to you is he -- you could 

10 say he would not have died but for the drop that each 

11 one of them put in. 

12             MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, you could say that. 

13 And that -- and -- 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So why isn't that but-for 

15 causation? 

16             MS. CAMPBELL:  It's a form of but-for 

17 causation that I think -- 

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't care if it's a form 

19 of but-for causation.  It's but-for causation. 

20             MS. CAMPBELL:  It -- it can be.  And I think 

21 that certain -- that specific hypothetical, while it 

22 warrants special consideration by this Court, whether or 

23 not in criminal context, we're going to expand the 

24 criminal liability to that is not this case, Justice 

25 Scalia.

1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I thought the 

2 hypothetical was a bit different.  I thought it only 

3 takes two drops to kill him.  And that's what creates 

4 the problem where you don't have but-for causation 

5 because you don't know whether you are the extraneous 

6 drop or whether you were the drop that actually killed 

7 him. 

8             MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.  If there is a 

9 hypothetical that changes it just slightly, you would 

10 not have but-for causation in that circumstance, because 

11 each individual drop was not the but-for cause.  And 

12 that's more like our hypothetical. 

13             And, again, with a poison hypothetical, 

14 because it's an intentional act by the defendant, you 

15 would still have liability, criminal liability for 

16 attempt or assault or something along those lines, but 

17 you would not have each individual person liable for the 

18 actual death. 

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  But part of your argument is 

20 that but-for causation isn't sufficient, right?  It also 

21 has to be foreseeable. 

22             MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct. 

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that your argument? 

24             MS. CAMPBELL:  That is our argument. 

25             JUSTICE ALITO:  Now, give me an example of a

1 situation where a heroin dealer deals -- sells drugs to 

2 somebody, and foresees that the drugs that are sold will 

3 cause death? 

4             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I think you can look to 

5 the actual case law.  There is, for those types of 

6 hypotheticals, when the heroin dealer is actually using 

7 with the particular purchaser of the heroin and knows 

8 that he is overdosing.  If the heroin dealer is the one 

9 injecting the drugs into the system, certainly those 

10 circumstances are foreseeable.  And the government -- 

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Those are very unusual 

12 circumstances.  In all other circumstances where 

13 somebody is just selling heroin there wouldn't be 

14 foreseeable, so the statute wouldn't -- foreseeability; 

15 the statute wouldn't apply? 

16             MS. CAMPBELL:  No, I disagree with that. 

17 Foreseeability could be read into those circumstances 

18 where you simply have a heroin dealer that is selling 

19 heroin and you would take that foreseeability question, 

20 the proximate cause question, and you would charge it to 

21 the jury. 

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think "foreseeability" is 

23 the wrong word.  I don't think, you know, in tort law 

24 we -- we use the word "foreseeability" for Palsgraf. 

25 It's a matter of scope of the risk.  It may not be



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 foreseeable.  It may be an unusual situation that will 

2 cause it, but it's within the scope of the risk.  And 

3 when you sell drugs, you know that one of the things 

4 that can happen is that the drugs will produce an 

5 overdose. 

6             I'm not sure -- I wouldn't call it 

7 foreseeability.  I would call it scope of the risk. 

8             MS. CAMPBELL:  Both scope in the risk and 

9 foreseeability are versions of saying proximate cause. 

10 And either standard in this circumstance would be better 

11 than the contributing cause standard that was given to 

12 the jury, because it did not use scope of the risk 

13 language.  It didn't use foreseeability language.  It 

14 didn't use reasonably probable -- 

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think this is all 

16 being sort of tied up together.  I always thought 

17 foreseeability and proximate cause were the same. 

18             I think the issue doesn't do with either 

19 foreseeability, scope of risk, or proximate cause.  It 

20 has to do with what you started with, which is what's 

21 the level of factual causation that we want to set. 

22 What definition are we going to give for the legal 

23 causation standard.  And you're saying that it has to be 

24 but-for. 

25             MS. CAMPBELL:  Our position is -- I agree



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 with you, Justice Sotomayor, that the main issue is this 

2 but-for causation issue, that if we are correct that 

3 but-for causation should be read into a criminal 

4 statute, as we believe it should in these 

5 circumstances under this statute, that the appropriate 

6 question is whether, but for the heroin, they would have 

7 died. 

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  Let's assume 

9 that we are troubled by the examples that have been 

10 given.  If two people or three people come together and 

11 each puts in a drop of blood, either knowing that only 

12 one drop is necessary or that all three drops are 

13 necessary, if we don't want to let that person off because 

14 it doesn't seem logical, okay, what would save your case anyway? 

15             Is there a 

16 different proximate cause standard but not involving 

17 but-for that would still get you what you are looking 

18 for? 

19             MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, and I don't think you 

20 need to look to causation to get to that answer. 

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And what do we look to 

22 if we are not looking to causation? 

23             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, if each individual 

24 person in the poison hypothetical is working together 

25 and knows about the other people, then you have



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 conspiracy liability.  And they would be liable for the 

2 actions of the other people -- of the other person that 

3 has put the poison in and you can still -- 

4             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Why does it matter if 

5 you know that three people have -- three people hate 

6 someone and they are acting independently, each one 

7 intended to kill the guy and, you know, that the other 

8 two joined in was lovely, but we don't know which drop 

9 did it.  We don't particularly care, do we? 

10             MS. CAMPBELL:  In that particular 

11 hypothetical then the -- 

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There is no conspiracy. 

13             MS. CAMPBELL:  There's no conspiracy. 

14             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we save this 

15 case if there is no conspiracy? 

16             MS. CAMPBELL:  Then you have attempt 

17 liability, and those people would still all be 

18 criminally liable for attempted murder. 

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  The Model Penal Code, the 

20 Brown Commission, everybody says this is a famous law 

21 school hypothetical, I thought you would never find it 

22 in reality.  They say certainly there is liability where 

23 two people strike, each strikes a mortal blow 

24 independently, and everyone seems to agree there is 

25 liability there.  And even though no blow -- neither



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1 blow is in fact a but-for condition, because in the 

2 absence of blow A he would be dead anyway from blow B. 

3             All right.  So we start with that, I 

4 thought.  And now starting with that -- you can say I 

5 don't want to start with that.  I think that all 

6 Professor Wechsler and Professor Hall and all these 

7 people famous in my day were wrong.  Okay.  That's up to 

8 you.  But if you do take that as a basic assumption, 

9 then how do you win?  I think that was the question, and 

10 there may be an answer to that. 

11             MS. CAMPBELL:  Yes, Justice Breyer, there is 

12 an answer to that.  The hypotheticals that are posed by 

13 Professor LaFave, which is the one that you are citing, 

14 actually can be answered by the use of the substantial 

15 factor language.  Now, when you have two independently 

16 sufficient causes which act upon an individual causing 

17 the death, you have a but-for problem because but for 

18 the actor A, B's blow would still kill the person. 

19             In that limited circumstance, the common law 

20 already addresses that and you use the substantial 

21 factor language, which we did at the time of the trial, 

22 tried to incorporate into our jury instruction, which 

23 was rejected by the trial court.  And so that is limited 

24 to those circumstances where you have two -- 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What is substantial factor?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1 I mean, I don't follow you.  I don't see how it gets you 

2 to where you want to be unless "substantial factor" 

3 means that it would have been a but-for cause. 

4             MS. CAMPBELL:  That is our position, that 

5 substantial factor is appropriate when it would have 

6 been a but-for cause.  You either need independently 

7 sufficient cause or but-for causes only failing by 

8 another independently sufficient cause. 

9             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So when you use that 

10 language of "substantial factor," what you really mean 

11 to point to is independent sufficiency?  Two people 

12 shoot, either one would have killed the person, but you 

13 can't say -- 

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right. 

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- that either is the but- 

16 for cause because of the fortuity of the second happening? 

17             MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct.  That is the 

18 traditional reason why you would use the substantial 

19 factor instruction. 

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So you don't mean that to go 

21 any further than independent sufficiency? 

22             MS. CAMPBELL:  We do not mean it to go any 

23 further, and I don't believe that the case law or the 

24 treatises take it any further.  There is this other 

25 hypothetical --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a strange terminology 

2 for it.  I mean, they really ought to get another 

3 terminology if that's what they mean. 

4             MS. CAMPBELL:  We agree. 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You can be a substantial 

6 factor without being independently sufficient. 

7             MS. CAMPBELL:  You could under the common 

8 use of the word "substantial factor," but at least 

9 "substantial factor" would have been better language 

10 than "contributes to" or "plays a part in" that this 

11 jury heard. 

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Marginally. 

13             MS. CAMPBELL:  It would at least give us the 

14 opportunity to argue that the heroin was not the 

15 substantial factor to a jury in a factual question if 

16 "substantial factor" does not mean independently 

17 sufficient cause.  But it's our position that at the 

18 time of the passing of this particular provision, 

19 "substantial factor" meant to address the circumstance 

20 where you have two independently sufficient causes. 

21             So regardless of whether you use 

22 "substantial factor" as being independently sufficient 

23 cause or some other sort of formulation of the language 

24 of "substantial factor," you still have this problem 

25 that the jury was not instructed on even substantial



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

15

1 factor.  They were instructed on contributing cause, 

2 that -- 

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You do agree that, that 

4 an overdose -- there is a foreseeable risk that someone 

5 who purchases heroin will overdose, there is a 

6 foreseeable risk of that? 

7             MS. CAMPBELL:  I concede that in a heroin 

8 case, that is a question for the jury, that you would 

9 charge foreseeability or proximate cause to the jury in 

10 those circumstances. 

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess here's what the 

12 government might say back to you.  They might say, you 

13 know, in these drug cases, people often take drugs in 

14 combination and then they overdose, and it's really 

15 impossible for anybody to be able to say what you are 

16 requiring an expert to say.  In other words, it's 

17 impossible to say it was the heroin, not the cocaine, it 

18 was the cocaine and not the heroin, it was both, it was 

19 neither. 

20             It's just -- it's all we can talk about is 

21 likelihoods.  You know, just as this expert did.  They 

22 say the fact that he took the heroin made it much more 

23 likely that he would die.  And that's all we are going 

24 to be able to show in a case like that, this, and 

25 because of that, we -- that's got to be enough.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1             MS. CAMPBELL:  And I would agree that that's 

2 their argument and that's an argument that should be 

3 presented to Congress to amend the statute to 

4 incorporate language that addresses that.  Congress 

5 knows how to address a contributing cause standard. 

6 They’ve said it in numerous other statutes that a certain 

7 act contributes to a death, that the result is in whole 

8 or in part a result of the defendant's action.  They've 

9 said it.  They know how to say it and they could say it 

10 again in this statute if they wanted to. 

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let's compare what -- 

12 the situation that Justice Kagan just described with 

13 this situation.  The heroin dealer sells a user, I don't 

14 know, a three-day supply or four-day supply, whatever it 

15 is.  And tells the -- the user, now, you should only use 

16 this much per day.  But the user goes off and injects 

17 the whole amount and -- and dies as a result of an 

18 overdose. 

19             Now, why would Congress want to punish that 

20 person where the overdose -- where the heroin sold is 

21 the but-for cause of death and not the situation where 

22 there's the -- the multidrug cocktail? 

23             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, in the absence of 

24 language to the contrary, this statute actually says, 

25 the use of this substance, the substance sold by the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

17

1 defendant results in a death. 

2             And so when we start by looking at the words 

3 of the statute, they -- they don't say these common 

4 words that you could use to encompass those 

5 circumstances. 

6             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I understand that. 

7 That's a textual argument and maybe the text can be read 

8 both ways.  Assuming it can be read both ways, why would 

9 Congress want to attach these severe consequences in the 

10 overdose case and not in the drug cocktail case? 

11             MS. CAMPBELL:  Because Congress would want 

12 to target a situation where there has been proof beyond 

13 a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions were the 

14 cause of the death. 

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, for -- for any crime, 

16 there are two things.  We punish the intent, the 

17 wickedness, and in both cases, the party is equally 

18 wicked, but we also punish the consequence.  In one 

19 case, the party dies because of that person's act.  And 

20 in the other case, nobody dies just because of that 

21 person's act.  I don't know why you have to run away 

22 from that. 

23             It's -- it's common in the criminal law 

24 that -- that two acts that are equally unlawful, equally 

25 nefarious, one happens to kill somebody, the other one

1 doesn't.  We punish one person, we don't punish the 

2 other. 

3             MS. CAMPBELL:  That would be true.  And what 

4 I was addressing in Justice -- the justice's 

5 hypothetical was that you can't read congressional 

6 intent into the selection of the words within this 

7 statute.  And if Congress intended to punish multiple 

8 drug cocktails all equally, they would instead have 

9 written the statute to address the cocktail. 

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it said -- the 

11 statute says results, right? 

12             MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct. 

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And so we're asking about 

14 results.  Justice Alito's hypothetical, he gives a 

15 three-day supply.  Suppose he gives a year's supply and 

16 he overdoses the next day, what result? 

17             MS. CAMPBELL:  I believe that would be a 

18 jury question. 

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no, no.  As a matter 

20 of law, is that a violation? 

21             MS. CAMPBELL:  It would be if he takes the 

22 heroin, and the heroin is the cause of the death, then, 

23 yes, it's a but-for cause.  We would then add that you 

24 should have a proximate cause analysis, which is the 

25 juries are in -- in a unique position to determine



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

19

1 whether or not foreseeability is appropriate in that 

2 circumstance. 

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  All right.  Suppose we go 

4 back to Justice Alito's example and it's just a two-day 

5 supply and there are statistics that 1 percent of heroin 

6 users overdose.  Is that sufficient to establish 

7 liability under your foreseeability standard? 

8             MS. CAMPBELL:  Not as a matter of law and 

9 not to the degree that the Solicitor General urges that 

10 it's a per se foreseeability.  Foreseeability is still 

11 always going to be instructed to the jury in that 

12 circumstance.  And they can argue that certainly 

13 1 percent is sufficient, and the defense can argue 

14 1 percent chance is not sufficient and can attack the -- 

15 the numbers. 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the question is what 

17 the legal standard is.  I'm the juror.  I said -- I want 

18 to know does this suffice to impose liability?  And you 

19 say well, if you say it is.  Does it or doesn't it? 

20 That's a -- that's a fair question.  Just -- you can't 

21 say, oh, well, it's up to the jury.  We don't know.  I 

22 want to know what the rule is.  The juries have to 

23 follow a rule. 

24             MS. CAMPBELL:  The rule is the language of 

25 the proximate cause instruction that you give them.  And



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

20

1 while there are different formulations of that proximate 

2 cause instruction, you would instruct the jury whether a 

3 reasonable person in the position of the defendant would 

4 be able to foresee that consequence. 

5             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I would say, my 

6 goodness, if only 1 percent overdose, that -- that isn't 

7 very foreseeable.  I -- you know, I don't think you have 

8 to submit that to the jury.  I think that's one of the 

9 reasons we -- we banned these drugs, because they are 

10 risky, and anybody should know that if somebody dies 

11 from it, it's within the scope of the risk when you sold 

12 the cocaine. 

13             Now, I guess it's different if you're 

14 selling, I don't know, sleeping pills, okay?  Which are 

15 part of a cocktail that -- that causes somebody to die. 

16 That's the situation that worries me.  It seems to me if 

17 the cocaine -- the person selling the cocaine can be 

18 liable for the cocktail death, I guess the person who 

19 sold the sleeping pills could, as well. 

20             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, in that circumstance, 

21 in our specific factual circumstance, each individual 

22 person that supplied any of the drugs to the victim in 

23 this case would be equally liable. 

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, one was -- the 

25 heroin was illegal -- was not -- the selling of a



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 sleeping pill is not illegal.  It's perfectly lawful. 

2 Selling heroin is illegal.  Doesn't that make a 

3 difference? 

4             MS. CAMPBELL:  Selling sleeping pills can be 

5 illegal if they're sold to someone that does not have a 

6 prescription, if they're sold on the street.  The 

7 OxyContin that was used in this case was not procured 

8 legally.  The marijuana in this case was not procured 

9 legally.  The -- there was no evidence whether or not 

10 the other prescription drugs, the multitude of 

11 prescription drugs he had in his house were procured 

12 legally. 

13             So assuming that the conduct of the person 

14 distributing the drugs were each individually violating 

15 the other provisions of the statute, it would be equally 

16 liable under the theory that they only had to contribute 

17 to the death of the individual. 

18             JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't see how this 

19 foreseeability test would work.  Well, you'd have 

20 testimony what, this particular user looked -- looked 

21 like a healthy person, so there wasn't -- it wasn't 

22 foreseeable that that person was going to overdose. 

23 This other one looked kind of shaky and irresponsible 

24 and who knows what the person might do.  That's what 

25 we -- that's what the jury would have to evaluate?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1             MS. CAMPBELL:  There are certain facts that 

2 could be read to a jury.  In each individual case, they 

3 would differ.  And you can look at the case law, 

4 especially regarding this death-- 

5             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what sort of facts? 

6 Suppose you -- you have the heroin dealer, you have the 

7 responsible heroin dealer. 

8             (Laughter.) 

9             JUSTICE ALITO:  And he wants to sell heroin 

10 but doesn't want to cause anybody to die.  What would be 

11 kind of the checklist that the person would go through? 

12 All right, I'm going to sell this.  I take the risk of a 

13 drug conviction, but I don't want this death results 

14 business.  So a person is well-dressed.  Person is -- 

15 what would be the factors? 

16             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I think you could look 

17 directly to the Eighth Circuit's opinion in the 

18 Macintosh case and the factors in that case where that 

19 particular person manufactured methamphetamine and 

20 specifically said, I do not want my methamphetamine to 

21 go to this person.  None of the meth should go to this 

22 person.  But his meth ended up going to that person and 

23 that person overdosed and died. 

24             In that circumstance, that would be a fact 

25 that we could argue to the jury on the defendant's



Official

23

1 behalf using the appropriate proximate cause standard 

2 that that was not foreseeable and not intended -- 

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  No.  But I want my -- I want 

4 the checklist for my responsible heroin dealer on the 

5 street corner.  What does this person go through? 

6             MS. CAMPBELL:  Well, I -- I don't think 

7 there can be a checklist.  That's why proximate cause 

8 and foreseeability is always charged to a jury.  Why 

9 it's -- it's uniquely a jury question.  Whether there's 

10 an experience with this particular user, whether the 

11 person that is selling the drugs knows the user has 

12 overdosed in the past, whether there's something within 

13 that particular drug that is stronger than normal 

14 heroin. 

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you have any -- 

16 what type of heroin user is more likely to overdose and 

17 suffer death?  A first-time heroin user or an 

18 experienced heroin user? 

19             MS. CAMPBELL:  There are no facts in the 

20 record that reflect that.  The evidence within the 

21 record indicates that this particular user was an 

22 experienced heroin user and that people who use heroin 

23 on a -- on a regular basis actually develop tolerance to 

24 heroin, so it would take a higher amount of heroin for 

25 that person to overdose.  That's what's in the record.

1             Now, the -- the studies that are cited by 

2 the Solicitor General indicate that there have been some 

3 sort of research -- we don't have access to all of those 

4 documents -- but some sort of research regarding heroin 

5 addicts.  And -- and when you're dealing with heroin 

6 addicts, that number is less than 1 percent using 

7 their -- their research.  Heroin addicts are less than 

8 1 percent likely to die. 

9             Those types of factors could be used in 

10 formulating a foreseeability analysis.  But, of course, 

11 you can't just rely on the foreseeability analysis, you 

12 should always incorporate this but-for analysis.  And in 

13 a but-for analysis, you would also be dealing with a 

14 situation where you have multiple drugs.  And so it not 

15 only informs our discussion about whether or not the 

16 heroin was the but-for cause of the death, but also 

17 whether, in this particular circumstance, this 

18 particular defendant could foresee that this particular 

19 person -- 

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I -- I just want to get 

21 your position as -- as a matter of law. 

22             Let's assume 1 percent of heroin users 

23 overdose.  Dealer sells to an addict he's never seen 

24 before.  Doesn't know anything about his age, background 

25 or anything.  Just sells him the drug.  The heroin

1 addict overdoses.  Liability or not?  Can there be 

2 liability under those facts? 

3             MS. CAMPBELL:  It would be our position that 

4 there could be liability if properly instructed to a 

5 jury. 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it's just up to the 

7 jury to decide whether it was foreseeable or not. 

8             MS. CAMPBELL:  Correct. 

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And you cannot say, as I -- 

10 as I think I say, that if you sell cocaine and if it is 

11 without a doubt the but-for cause of somebody's death, 

12 you're liable under this statute.  You don't think 

13 that's the case. 

14             MS. CAMPBELL:  We disagree.  And, 

15 Justice Scalia, I would point actually to the -- this 

16 Court's precedent in the civil context where you -- you 

17 read proximate cause and foreseeability into almost 

18 exact same language. 

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, but in the 

20 civil -- 

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, but in a civil 

22 context -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice. 

23             In the civil context, you have strict -- you 

24 have strict liability.  This is in a way strict 

25 liability and seems to me quite proper.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1             MS. CAMPBELL:  In a civil context, when it's 

2 explicit -- 

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  A drug company if it -- if 

4 it doesn't take proper steps, it is liable even if 

5 1 percent of the users are adversely affected. 

6             Excuse me, Chief. 

7             MS. CAMPBELL:  You -- in a strict liability 

8 circumstance would have a statute which writes in strict 

9 liability.  This statute doesn't write in strict 

10 liability. 

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  May I just clarify before 

12 you're finished.  You have used the words 

13 "foreseeability," "but for."  Are you saying, to make it 

14 very simple, that unless the government proves that the 

15 heroin independently would cause death, then no 

16 conviction?  The heroin must independently cause the 

17 death.  Is that -- 

18             MS. CAMPBELL:  Only in the circumstance 

19 where you have two independently sufficient causes do 

20 you -- do you reach that question.  We don't think you 

21 need to reach that question here.  That's why we didn't 

22 argue that at the motion for judgment of acquittal 

23 stage, because you don't have standard but-for 

24 causation.  And that failure was not as a result of two 

25 independently sufficient causes.

4 except for the heroin ingestion, the death would not 

5 have occurred? 

6             MS. CAMPBELL:  The -- that's the primary 

7 argument, that except for the heroin that -- the factual 

8 basis of this case is that, if you remove the heroin, 

9 the doctors are saying he still might have died.  And 

10 that is what defeats the but-for causation. 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

16             MR. HORWICH:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

17 please the Court: 

18        The situation here is very much what Congress had 

19 in mind when it sought to hold drug traffickers 

20 responsible for the results of the use of the dangerous 

21 substances in which they deal.  It's perfectly ordinary 

22 to speak of a drug as contributing to an overdose.  And 

23 in the context of the Controlled Substances Act, there 

24 is no room to argue that a heroin user's overdose death 

25 comes as a surprise.

1             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So Mr. -- 

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So one little -- one 

3 little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body, 

4 and that person's going away for whatever it is, 

5 20 years? 

6             MR. HORWICH:  No, I don't think so, 

7 Mr. Chief Justice.  And let me explain, because I think 

8 the concern that arises with your hypothetical, which 

9 doesn't arise on these facts, presents a different issue 

10 than what's in dispute before the Court right now.  The 

11 dispute between the parties is what kinds of -- on the 

12 causation in fact side of the case, the dispute is 

13 between what kinds of causes can qualify at all.  Do 

14 they have to be but-for causes or can a contributing 

15 cause count? 

16             Now, there is a separate principle which is 

17 reflected in jury instructions and reflected in the 

18 substantial factor concept and so forth that causes that 

19 are causes in fact but are too insignificant or not 

20 important enough or too insubstantial are not properly 

21 the basis for criminal responsibility. 

22             Now, that's -- that's not the dispute before 

23 this Court. 

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Mr. Horwich, I mean, 

25 it seems to me that the dispute before this Court is



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1 this:  You have somebody he’s taken five drugs.  One of 

2 them is heroin.  And the -- the experts get on the 

3 stand, and they say:  Did the heroin cause the death? 

4 And the experts say:  Really can't say whether the 

5 heroin caused the death in the sense that if the -- if 

6 he hadn't taken the heroin, he wouldn't have died. 

7             So they say:  Well, what can you say?  He 

8 said:  Well, what I can say is that if he hadn't -- is 

9 that the heroin made it more likely that he died. 

10             Well, how much more likely did the heroin 

11 make it?  Well, the heroin made it 50 percent more 

12 likely that death resulted.  Would that be sufficient? 

13             MR. HORWICH:  I -- I think probably yes, 

14 although let me -- let me explain that we -- why we see 

15 the nature of the expert testimony as actually different 

16 than what you're describing there.  Because -- 

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, take mine. 

18             MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because I think that that's 

20 actually -- 

21             MR. HORWICH:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean 

22 the expert testimony in this case, but in general what 

23 experts are testifying to when they're testifying to 

24 that.  They are not testifying to some uncertainty about 

25 whether the defendant's drugs played any role at all.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1 This isn't the question of say, yeah, he bought heroin 

2 from two different dealers.  He took one of them, and he 

3 died, but we don't know which dealer it was. 

4             In that case we totally agree that that sort 

5 of uncertainty means no liability.  What the experts 

6 testified to in these cases is that the primary cause of 

7 death, which is essentially central nervous system 

8 depression that leads to asphyxiating on stomach 

9 contents or saliva or something like that, was a process 

10 to which a number of substances contributed. 

11             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, and he might have died 

12 even without the heroin, because all the other 

13 substances might have been perfectly adequate to cause 

14 death.  So I really can't tell you that the heroin 

15 played -- even -- you know, even to use your language, I 

16 can't tell you whether the heroin contributed.  All I 

17 can tell you is a likelihood, a probability that the 

18 heroin led to death. 

19             MR. HORWICH:  Well, the experts here of 

20 course did testify specifically that the heroin did 

21 contribute to the death.  So -- 

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, again, that’s a question 

23 of words, the experts were very careful to say:  "I 

24 cannot tell you that in the absence of the heroin he 

25 wouldn't have died.  He might have died even without the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1 heroin, the experts said.  The only thing I can tell you 

2 is that the heroin made it more likely that he died. 

3             MR. HORWICH:  I guess -- maybe I can respond 

4 to that with a perhaps more conventional hypothetical. 

5 If you imagine that -- if you imagine that you have 

6 three assailants who independently simultaneously set 

7 upon the victim and beat him to death, and the victim 

8 could have survived any one of them.  In that situation, 

9 you might well have testimony from a doctor that says, 

10 Well, I can't tell you -- he probably would have died -- 

11 even I can be sure he would have died from the other two 

12 guys.  But I think in that -- in that scenario we would 

13 certainly recognize that the -- that each of the 

14 assailants is responsible for the victim's death.  We 

15 wouldn't say oh, well, he -- 

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a bad sign when you're 

17 using the hypotheticals rather than the facts of your 

18 case, you know?  The facts of your case are that the 

19 expert gets on the stand and says:  I can't tell you 

20 that the heroin was responsible for the death.  I cannot 

21 tell you that in the absence of the heroin he wouldn't 

22 have died.  What I can tell you is that the heroin 

23 was -- what I can do is to give you essentially a 

24 probability that the heroin caused the death. 

25             And you're saying that's enough, even if the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 probability is as small as 50 percent. 

2             MR. HORWICH:  I don't think -- the experts 

3 here did not testify in probability figures in that way. 

4 What they testified to was that -- was that the heroin 

5 contributed to the set of drugs that were responsible 

6 for the actual primary cause of death. 

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  They said it contributed to 

8 the set of drugs, but they didn't say that it 

9 contributed to the death.  They had no idea whether it 

10 contributed to the death.  All that they were able to 

11 say is:  There are five drugs; here are some 

12 probabilities; here are some likelihoods.  If you don't 

13 like the probability language:  Here is the likelihood. 

14 Using heroin made it more likely that he would die, but 

15 we can't say that using heroin killed him. 

16             MR. HORWICH:  That -- and it is that aspect 

17 of the testimony which is why we concede that if you 

18 apply a but-for test, that testimony does not establish 

19 a but-for test. 

20             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, how much more likely 

21 does it have to make it that he would die?  50 percent? 

22             MR. HORWICH:  It's not a -- 

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about 30 percent? 

24             MR. HORWICH:  The relevant question is in a 

25 contributing cause analysis, at least in the first



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1 instance, setting aside the substantiality question that 

2 the Chief Justice's hypothetical raised, the basic 

3 question of the contributing cause analysis is whether 

4 the drug in a case like this contributed to the physio 

5 -- the internal physiological effects that culminated in 

6 the death. 

7             And I would make a distinction here, for 

8 example.  If you -- consider the marijuana in this case. 

9 The testimony here does not even establish the marijuana 

10 as being a contributing cause, because the 

11 toxicologists -- the toxicologist testifies -- this is 

12 at Joint Appendix 193, that the -- "Every drug on this 

13 list, with the exception of the constituents of 

14 marijuana, have central nervous system depressant 

15 effects," and then goes on to explain why it's those 

16 effects that are -- that's what's going on in the body 

17 that's leading to the death. 

18             So again -- so we would agree that if you 

19 apply -- that if you insist on a but-for test, then, 

20 correct, these sort of probabilities don't get the 

21 government even to the jury.  That's a directed verdict. 

22             But I want to -- but I would like to point 

23 out though -- so I guess what I would like to discuss is 

24 why the but-for test is not the right test to be 

25 applying here.

1             JUSTICE ALITO:  Before -- Mr. Horwich, 

2 before we leave this hypothetical -- 

3             MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  -- may I ask you this.  If 

5 I were a member of a legislative body considering what I 

6 would want to happen in this situation -- it's kind of a 

7 frightening thought.  But if that were, I would want to 

8 know what kind of testimony medical experts can 

9 reasonably be expected to provide in cases like this, 

10 where there is the ingestion of multiple drugs.  If it 

11 is possible in most cases, many cases, all cases, a high 

12 percentage of cases, for them to break this down 

13 probabilistically, there was a 50 -- this made it 

14 50 percent more likely, 90 percent more likely, 

15 10 percent more likely, I might want to go down that 

16 road.  But if it's not reasonable in a lot of these 

17 cases to go further than what the experts did in this 

18 case, that would make a difference. 

19             Now, can you tell us what, realistically, 

20 can they do in these cases where there is the ingestion 

21 of multiple drugs and the consequence is death? 

22             MR. HORWICH:  I -- I can't represent to be 

23 informed enough about sort of the range of cases, but I 

24 think the testimony in this case is actually informative 

25 on that point, because there are a number of

1 uncertainties to which the -- the -- the experts 

2 testified that show why it is, from -- why it is, from 

3 their point of view, essentially impossible to 

4 disentangle the effect of one drug and another drug when 

5 they're having the same effect on the body.  They're 

6 doing the same thing to the -- the victim's central 

7 nervous system. 

8             And so, it is -- it's the sort of thing that 

9 it's meaningless to speak of one drug versus the other 

10 as being "the cause," because they're all in the body, 

11 they're all doing the same thing in the same way that -- 

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So Congress -- Congress 

13 supposedly knew that and -- and could have written a 

14 statute so that you're -- you're liable if you are a 

15 contributing cause of -- of the death.  It didn't do so. 

16 It said -- it says it has to result in the death. 

17 And -- and I take that to mean at least, at least 

18 but-for causality. 

19             MR. HORWICH:  Well, we -- we -- 

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why should "result 

21 in" not -- not mean but-for causality? 

22             MR. HORWICH:  Well, we -- we would take 

23 Congress to have been incorporating the rules settled on 

24 generally in the criminal context -- 

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

36

1             MR. HORWICH:  -- for this sort of problem. 

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why -- why does "result in" 

3 refer -- refer to what -- what we do in the common law? 

4 I mean, I apply common law rules when -- when Congress 

5 adopts a common law crime, yes.  It -- it brings along 

6 the -- the soil that goes with that crime, right?  But 

7 this is not a common law crime, and -- and Congress used 

8 the English language "results in," and I would take that 

9 to mean causes. 

10             MR. HORWICH:  Well, we do take it to mean 

11 causes.  But courts applying the concept of cause -- so 

12 that's why we think that Congress would be intending to 

13 borrow courts' approaches to causation in common law 

14 cases.  And I think there's a key insight in those 

15 cases.  Now, we cite a number of them going back 100, 

16 120 years in our -- in our brief at pages 19 and 20, 21, 

17 25 and 26. 

18             And the key insight in those cases, which I 

19 think Justice Sotomayor touched on, which is that if 

20 your test for causation, say a but-for test, is 

21 producing a result in a case that nothing and nobody was 

22 the cause of the victim's death, you need to rethink 

23 your test for causation.  It's not producing sound 

24 results. 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  I accept that.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

37

1             MR. HORWICH:  And so, Justice Breyer, that's 

2 what's going on in -- in the treatises that then say, 

3 well, in these other cases, we're going to -- we're 

4 going to say, well, these independently sufficient 

5 tests, that applies as well. 

6             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, here -- here I 

7 accept that -- first of all, there's no problem with 

8 intent for me for the reason Justice Scalia pointed out, 

9 that anyone who sells heroin to someone is reckless, at 

10 least, in respect to the possibility of a death 

11 resulting.  So I think that's enough to bring them 

12 within the intent problem.  Also, there was a death 

13 here; fine.  But still you have to show cause. 

14             And this is this unusual situation, which 

15 the Brown Commission expresses itself upon and which the 

16 model Penal Code didn't. 

17             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think -- 

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  And the model Penal Code 

19 did express itself on what they call, in the Brown 

20 Commission, concurrent causes, all right?  It has to be 

21 a but-for or a concurrent cause.  But a concurrent cause 

22 is the situation where there are two people striking a 

23 mortal blow.  Therefore, either is sufficient.  And if, 

24 in fact, the second wasn't sufficient, then the first is 

25 a necessary condition.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

38

1             MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right?  So here we have 

3 the separate problem which has been pointed out that not 

4 only -- we don't know if the others were sufficient, nor 

5 do we know if this was a necessary condition.  And Brown 

6 and 5 States tell you what to do in such situation to 

7 fall within the definition of cause.  And the model 

8 Penal Code where you had Professor Wechsler debating 

9 Professor Hall with Dean Griswald throwing in the odd 

10 comment decided not to tell us its view.  Okay? 

11             So that's where I stand.  And you can 

12 correct that if you want, but I'm beginning to think 

13 that probably, at least it should be important in such a 

14 situation, and that the word "substantial" better 

15 connotes the idea of it being an important factor than 

16 the word "contributing," which means picks up all kinds 

17 of quite unimportant factors.  That's where my thinking 

18 is, and anything -- I just say that in case you want to 

19 respond to that. 

20             MR. HORWICH:  I do.  I have, I think, two 

21 very important things to say in response to that.  One 

22 of them is, as -- as I was sort of suggesting with the 

23 Chief Justice, if the dispute is over whether it should 

24 be a substantial contributing cause, then I think we're 

25 happy to argue that the jury instruction gets in that



Official

39

1 direction, and at a minimum, there's harmless error 

2 here.  So -- 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It depends on what you mean 

4 by substantial. 

5             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think -- 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Opposing counsel says 

7 substantial means that it would independently have 

8 sufficed. 

9             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think -- I think 

10 that's right. 

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  If that's what you mean by 

12 it, we'll all cheer.  But -- but I suspect that's not 

13 what you mean. 

14             MR. HORWICH:  Well, it's not what -- it's 

15 not what we mean -- 

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not what was found 

17 in this case, right? 

18             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would point out -- I 

19 would point out that -- I mean, I'm reading from the 

20 Washington State Christman decision, which is the only 

21 decision that the parties have cited that's actually -- 

22 factually deals with this scenario and it says, "Under 

23 the substantial factor test, all parties whose actions 

24 contributed to the outcome are held liable."  So I think 

25 that's -- that's very much in line with what we're



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 saying. 

2             I'd also say that the Brown Commission and 

3 those -- 

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's what you 

5 call a substantial factor?  If it all contributed to the 

6 outcome?  The one grain of heroin would -- would -- 

7             MR. HORWICH:  No, because we think it 

8 does -- we think it does have to be substantial.  I 

9 think that's -- that's why the word "substantial" -- 

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then -- then you 

11 don't agree with that -- that stuff that you just read 

12 point. 

13             MR. HORWICH:  Well, all parties whose 

14 actions substantially contributed to the outcome. 

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So then you -- you're 

16 saying that the government's position is that 

17 contributing factor should be a substantial contributing 

18 factor; you're happy with that. 

19             MR. HORWICH:  I think -- I think we would 

20 not -- we wouldn't have an objection if the Court states 

21 that as the law.  Now, if the Court does that, it would 

22 be appropriate, I suppose, to ask the court of appeals 

23 to examine the record here. 

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what is substantial? 

25 What do you think is substantial?  10 percent,



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

41

1 20 percent -- 

2             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think substantial -- 

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  5 percent, what? 

4             MR. HORWICH:  -- substantial -- I wouldn't 

5 put it -- well, I would put it in relative terms, right? 

6 The question would be:  Is this cause substantial 

7 relative to what?  Well, relative to the other causes at 

8 issue.  And we have here overwhelming testimony that the 

9 heroin -- 

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So is that the question? 

11 Is -- in other words, is the heroin more likely to have 

12 caused the death than the cocaine, than the marijuana, 

13 than the sleeping pills?  So we can't really say that 

14 the heroin caused the death, but it's more likely to 

15 have caused the death than anything else he took?  Is 

16 that the -- is that the question? 

17             MR. HORWICH:  Well, we know that it can -- 

18 we know two things; one, it causally contributed in a 

19 way that, say, the marijuana did not contribute to what 

20 the experts are testifying was the physiological 

21 process.  And two -- 

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But -- but maybe not to the 

23 death. 

24             MR. HORWICH:  -- of the things that 

25 contributed to that, we would agree that the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1 insubstantial, the one pill out of a thousand 

2 hypothetical, would certainly not be substantial.  How 

3 substantial, I guess, is going to be very fact-specific. 

4 Here it's -- 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, one question 

6 is -- is how this all relates to the "beyond a 

7 reasonable doubt" instruction in criminal cases?  I 

8 mean, the idea of a test which focuses in the way yours 

9 does on probabilities and likelihoods, and then we go 

10 tell the jury, find beyond a reasonable doubt that this 

11 was more likely to have caused the death than anything 

12 else, or find beyond a reasonable doubt that this 

13 increased the likelihood of death by 50 percent. 

14             I mean, that seems a very odd kind of 

15 question for a jury to consider, but that's exactly what 

16 you would be asking a jury to consider. 

17             MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that.  Because 

18 what we're asking the jury to decide is beyond a 

19 reasonable doubt, did this drug have the physiological 

20 effects that the medical examiners described as being 

21 the integral process that resulted in death. 

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the statute -- the 

23 statute says did it result in death.  It did not -- the 

24 statute does not say -- does not criminalize a drug that 

25 has physiological effects.  It criminalizes a drug when



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

43

1 it results in death.  And you can't say anything about 

2 resulting in death except as -- except by reference to 

3 probabilities and likelihoods. 

4             MR. HORWICH:  I -- I think that there is 

5 going to be testimony about probabilities and 

6 likelihoods that will inform the substantiality 

7 question, but it's not a question of likelihood that 

8 it -- that it contributed to the central nervous system 

9 depression that killed the victim here.  That -- that is 

10 unequivocal in the testimony. 

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If you wanted to 

12 incorporate in the statute your friend's understanding 

13 of but-for cause, what word would you use that would be 

14 better than "results"? 

15             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I would -- you could use 

16 but for or except. 

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I know.  But 

18 you want -- you want a word that's going to be readily 

19 understandable. 

20             MR. HORWICH:  Or solely.  I guess I would 

21 refer the Court to the -- the jury instructions that the 

22 Petitioner proposed here, which are on 238, which say 

23 that, that the -- the proximate cause must be one that 

24 except for the cause the death would not have occurred. 

25 That's the instructions that are proposed there.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1             And our point is that the insight in -- in 

2 these sources, it's an insight that's in the Brown 

3 Commission report, it's an insight that's in the 

4 numerous cases we have cited going back, is that that is 

5 not the only test that is used. 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Horwich, just if 

7 I could get back, that is the instruction on proximate 

8 cause. 

9             MR. HORWICH:  Well -- 

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about the 

11 but-for cause? 

12             MR. HORWICH:  Well, the way they are 

13 structured for -- in Petitioner's submission, it's -- 

14 it's sort of built into the proximate cause instruction. 

15 They weren't separated in the way Petitioner did it.  So 

16 there's -- the first part of the second sentence on 238, 

17 the "direct result or reasonably probable consequence" 

18 gets at what we would more conventionally describe as 

19 proximate cause.  But the second part is classic 

20 causation in fact:  "Except for the cause the death 

21 would not have occurred."  So what Petitioner here is 

22 trying to defend is a test that produces -- 

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but it doesn't say -- 

24 the one they quote in their brief, all they wanted the 

25 judge to say was it could be -- they say, you are right,



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 proximate cause, but they're interested here in is it a 

2 cause at all.  And they say:  "As long as the subject 

3 cause contributes substantially to producing the death." 

4 That's all they wanted him to say.  And he didn't say 

5 it. 

6             And actually when I read that, I thought, 

7 well, what they want is to say that it's an important 

8 factor, rather than just saying it's some unimportant 

9 factor.  And they seem, I don't know what these words 

10 really mean, but it seems they are closer to what you're 

11 saying really should be the law than you are. 

12             MR. HORWICH:  That is a convenient excerpt 

13 from the instruction on 238, but the other part of the 

14 instruction insists that except for the cause the death 

15 would not have occurred.  So I agree with you the 

16 language -- 

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Their position now is not that it's enough 

18 if it's an important factor.  Rather, and I would like 

19 to know your view on this, your opposing counsel 

20 contends that the courts and commentators who use the 

21 "substantial factor" terminology mean by "a substantial 

22 factor" a factor that would by itself have been 

23 sufficient. 

24             MR. HORWICH:  Well, certainly, certainly 

25 they can pull up cases that say that.  But what I would



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 emphasize for this Court is that in four briefs to this 

2 Court Petitioner has not cited a single case that does 

3 what he's asking this Court to do, which is reject a 

4 contributing cause approach and exonerate him under a 

5 but-for test that applied to this case would lead to the 

6 conclusion that nothing and nobody caused the victim to 

7 die here. 

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Just to get back to 

9 it, you were reading from the proximate cause 

10 instruction.  They've got -- the very next instruction 

11 says:  You have to find that he died as a result of 

12 using the heroin distributed by the defendant.  So I 

13 think it's a little unfair to suggest that they were 

14 willing to go with the same concept of cause that you 

15 were proposing. 

16             MR. HORWICH:  Well, we wouldn't -- we don't 

17 disagree that a court could just use the unadorned 

18 statutory language.  That -- that -- that would not be 

19 error to do so.  Our point is only -- our point is only 

20 that a contributing cause, as these courts have 

21 recognized for a long time, can be a cause in fact, 

22 particularly in these scenarios where otherwise they are 

23 going to conclude there was no cause at all. 

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  What do you want us to say? 

25 You know what's actually worrying me about this case?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1 It took quite a long time, and there are like three 

2 levels of complexity, and we are from but for into 

3 concurrent and then the sufficient condition and the 

4 necessary condition.  And we are trying to argue whether 

5 this thing that the Model Penal Code wouldn't even pick 

6 up in Brown ought to be the Federal law of the United 

7 States. 

8             And Professor Wechsler's reaction was: 

9 Look, this is -- this is going to arise so infrequently, 

10 it's so complicated to talk about, that you are going to 

11 mix everybody up once we start to write on this. 

12             And that is worrying me as a real problem. 

13 Once we start to write in this area, we are going to get 

14 people so mixed up no matter what we say -- 

15             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I think the Court -- 

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  -- that I hesitate to go 

17 backwards from the very vague and open language, 

18 substantive, substantial versus contributing, and just 

19 sort of why not just say substantial and leave it there 

20 and let the lower courts figure it out, so we don't 

21 confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and 

22 everyone. 

23             MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  If Your Honor is 

24 concerned about that -- 

25             JUSTICE BREYER:  I am.

48

1             MR. HORWICH:  -- I think you could write a 

2 decision that says the right instruction here is 

3 substantial factor.  The test -- the cause does not have 

4 to be a but-for test, but we are not going to go on to 

5 define "substantial factor." 

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Because of that 

7 imprecision, some poor devils will have to go to jail 

8 for a longer period than otherwise, you know.  Tough 

9 luck. 

10             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I this isn't -- I think 

11 this isn't something that would catch Congress by 

12 surprise.  The problem of multiple drug use is a well 

13 recognized situation. 

14             If I might turn to foreseeability. 

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Horwich, I guess I don't 

16 understand what "substantial factor" means in the way 

17 you are using it.  I understood what Ms. Campbell said, 

18 because she said "substantial factor" just means 

19 independently sufficient.  But you are saying 

20 "substantial factor" can mean more than that, but it 

21 doesn't have to mean a but-for cause.  How is something 

22 a is a substantial factor in a death without their 

23 being able to say that it was a but-for cause of the 

24 death? 

25             MR. HORWICH:  The situations that we're



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

49

1 talking about here are ones in which nothing would be a 

2 but-for cause of the death and nothing would be 

3 independently sufficient to cause the death.  So in some 

4 sense -- 

5             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it's not a substantial 

6 factor in causing the death, because that assumes that 

7 it actually played a role in causing the death and you 

8 can't say whether it played a role in causing the death. 

9 That's what creates this problem. 

10             MR. HORWICH:  I disagree with that.  It 

11 absolutely played a role in causing it.  That's exactly 

12 what the toxicologist -- 

13             JUSTICE KAGAN:  It played a role in the sense of if it hadn't 

14 been there, the death would not have occurred. 

15             MR. HORWICH:  That's true. 

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You can't say that, that's 

17 the point. 

18             MR. HORWICH:  Well, that's true, but I don't 

19 think, to take my example of the assailants, the three 

20 assailants beating the victim to death, I think it would 

21 be very strange to say that none of those assailants 

22 played a role in the victim dying, none of them 

23 contributed to the victim dying.  That seems -- that 

24 seems to be contrary to ordinary usage and ordinary 

25 intuitions about cause and effect.

1             Now, I agree in this situation because we 

2 are talking about something that happens at a molecular 

3 level, it's perhaps less -- it's less part of common 

4 experience and we have to rely on the doctors.  But what 

5 they are saying is no different than saying that he had 

6 three drugs in there and they were each knocking him 

7 down to a state of unable to -- to repress his gag 

8 reflex, essentially. 

9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The problem with 

10 your hypothetical, it's the sort of thing where there's 

11 no way that a doctor could say three people beat the guy 

12 up, which one threw the fatal punch.  But here we have a 

13 situation where the experts could tell you:  Yes, the 

14 heroin alone would have killed him.  Or, as in this 

15 case, I can't tell you the heroin alone would have 

16 killed him. 

17             MR. HORWICH:  Yes, I think that's right, but 

18 I can imagine a doctor similarly testifying in the three 

19 assailants situation to exactly that point.  I can't 

20 tell you which is the fatal punch, precisely.  I agree 

21 with that. 

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But if you can't put 

23 -- but my point is that they would not be able to tell 

24 you in any case, where here they can tell you in every 

25 case whether it's clear that the heroin caused the death



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1 or not. 

2             MR. HORWICH:  That may be true, but there 

3 will be cases in which no single drug caused the death 

4 and yet the victim died.  That's what produces the 

5 problem here. 

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  But this 

7 statute does not say if you die from taking drugs, then 

8 the person who gave you drugs, who gave you any kind of 

9 drug is responsible.  It says the heroin has to result, 

10 death has to result from the heroin. 

11             MR. HORWICH:  It does.  And I think it's 

12 ordinarily -- I think it's an ordinary usage of language 

13 to describe this as resulting from the heroin and some 

14 other things, too.  But the testimony is certainly to 

15 the effect that it resulted from the heroin. 

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What result if a heroin 

17 dealer persuades a first time user to please try heroin, 

18 it's wonderful.  He does.  Three days later the addict, 

19 the new addict, the new user buys heroin from a 

20 different dealer and overdoses and dies?  Does the first 

21 dealer contribute, as a substantial contributing cause? 

22             MR. HORWICH:  Contributing cause there?  I 

23 guess -- I guess I would need to know more medically.  I 

24 suspect that yes. 

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  The heroin has

1 disappeared, but he has become addicted. 

2             MR. HORWICH:  Okay.  So he's become 

3 addicted.  I think possibly yes.  I am skeptical that 

4 that would be a substantial contributing cause.  And 

5 then there would be -- there would be in our view 

6 questions about proximate cause that would be raised in 

7 that situation as well. 

8             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about you give 

9 the guy a heroin and he drives away, but as a result of 

10 using it he's driving under the influence, has an 

11 accident and is killed?  Is that -- does his death 

12 result from the heroin in that case? 

13             MR. HORWICH:  We think in that situation, 

14 certainly factually, causation in fact, it does.  In 

15 that situation we are lying farther away from the 

16 central harms that the Controlled Substances Act is 

17 addressing, and so we think you would get into some sort 

18 of proximate cause inquiry there as well, that you 

19 wouldn't here. 

20             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  Now I'm 

21 really confused.  I thought you were putting the 

22 causation, the factual causation, into proximate cause. 

23 You are saying there's a difference.  So what do you 

24 think gets it folded into proximate cause? 

25             MR. HORWICH:  So in proximate cause, our



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

53

1 basic point on proximate cause in an overdose situation 

2 is that you already have the indicia you need to know 

3 that this is the harm for which Congress wants to hold 

4 the defendant responsible.  In the Chief Justice's -- 

5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  In one other case -- 

6 there has been one other case, but you are suggesting 

7 that there are cases in which there might be a proximate 

8 cause problem, you just -- 

9             MR. HORWICH:  Absolutely. 

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- as you just said to 

11 Justice Kennedy.  In what other case have we said that 

12 you don't have to charge a jury on an element of the 

13 crime on proximate causation?  Is there any in which we 

14 have ever said that? 

15             MR. HORWICH:  Well, I -- I have to 

16 disagree with -- 

17             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because in -- in the 

18 vast majority of cases, it won't be a problem. 

19             MR. HORWICH:  I guess I have to -- I guess 

20 my answer to your hypothetical has to be to disagree 

21 with the idea that this is an element.  We're not 

22 dispensing with an element.  The element is that a death 

23 resulted.  The question is how, in a particular case, 

24 should a district judge explicate the scope of harms for 

25 which defendants should be held responsible?

54

1             And sometimes you can do that with a 

2 foreseeability instruction.  Sometimes you might do it 

3 with an intervening or superseding cause instruction or 

4 other proximate cause concepts. 

5             But in a case where you know there's an 

6 overdose at issue, and we're talking about heroin here, 

7 which is controlled, in large part, precisely because it 

8 kills people -- 

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So foreseeability -- 

10             MR. HORWICH:  -- you don't need -- 

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- is an element in only 

12 some ways of killing people, in which some people die. 

13             MR. HORWICH:  It is necessary to instruct on 

14 it if we're in a situation where we're worried about 

15 consequences running out to infinity.  That's the usual 

16 concern, the Palsgraf-type concern about foreseeability, 

17 but this is not running out to infinity.  This is 

18 just -- 

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, I'm having a 

20 really hard time because of Carolene, where you 

21 basically admit that proximate cause, i.e., 

22 foreseeability, because I see them -- 

23             MR. HORWICH:  Yes. 

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- as almost 

25 interchangeable, is almost always to be charged, is



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

55

1 almost always an element that is required when you have 

2 a -- results from -- 

3             MR. HORWICH:  Yes.  To be clear, we're not 

4 saying there's no proximate cause requirement.  We're 

5 saying that there is a sufficient assurance that the 

6 function of proximate cause, of limiting defendant's 

7 responsibility to the matters about which Congress is 

8 concerned, is served in an overdose case when you know 

9 that you have a substance that is controlled in large 

10 part because of precisely this risk, that then it causes 

11 exactly that harm. 

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

13             Ms. Campbell, you have three minutes 

14 remaining. 

15         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANGELA L. CAMPBELL, 

16                 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT, 

17                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

18             MS. CAMPBELL:  It's our position that 

19 but-for cause is the first question, and only when you 

20 reach a point where there is no but-for cause do you 

21 then go on to say, is this one of these circumstances 

22 where there is a -- two independently sufficient harms. 

23 If no, end of question, which was the motion for 

24 judgment of acquittal at the time of trial.  There was 

25 no but-for cause.  We made the motion for judgment of



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

56

1 acquittal on but-for cause.  You don't need to make that 

2 inquiry in this particular case.  There may be cases 

3 where you make that inquiry. 

4             Of course, we didn't win, so we had to keep 

5 going along, and we asked for a substantial factor test 

6 because we thought maybe we could influence the judge to 

7 give us a better instruction, like the substantial 

8 factor test that the Eighth Circuit had already 

9 approved, and he rejected it and gave them a 

10 contributing cause instruction, which is clearly not 

11 encompassed within the common law standards of 

12 causation.  But-for cause is substantial factor. 

13             Now, to address the concerns about letting 

14 defendants go free, that just simply doesn't play a part 

15 in this analysis.  Every criminal defendant in any of 

16 these hypotheticals would have some sort of criminal 

17 liability, either a lesser included offense.  This 

18 particular defendant, Mr. Burrage, could go to prison 

19 for 20 years for the lesser included offense.  You have 

20 accomplice liability.  You have conspiracy.  You have 

21 attempt. 

22             All of these individuals are going to be 

23 punished.  You have sentencing discretion.  The judge 

24 can look at the fact that there was a death -- well, 

25 maybe not a primary cause in the death -- there was a



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

57

1 death, and enhance the sentence under the -- beyond the 

2 guideline range. 

3             All of those concerns are already addressed 

4 in the criminal law, and we do not need to change the 

5 criminal law of causation and relax it to encompass more 

6 harms.  Because if we aren't willing to do that in a 

7 civil context where you have contributing negligence and 

8 shifting of burdens of -- shifting of the costs in 

9 having -- your hypothetical, you have different 

10 percentages' likelihood of causing the harm.  So maybe 

11 you give 5 percent to the marijuana dealer and 

12 10 percent to the oxycodone dealer and 20 percent to the 

13 heroin dealer.  We don't have that in criminal law. 

14 That's a -- that's a policy consideration that is 

15 different between civil law and criminal law. 

16             In criminal law, the person's going to go to 

17 prison under a mandatory minimum sentence, and in some 

18 cases for life with no parole based on this relaxed 

19 causation standard that the government is asking this 

20 Court to incorporate into a statute where it doesn't say 

21 it. 

22             And so we would respectfully ask for the 

23 Court not to engage in that process, not to relax 

24 causation for the criminal -- criminal statute at play 

25 here and in all of the criminal statutes that use

58

1 "result in," and instead rely upon the general notions 

2 of causation that are already established in the law. 

3             Thank you. 

4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel. 

5             The case is submitted.
