CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1553, Kawasaki 

Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit Corporation, and the 

consolidated case. 

Mr. Ballenger. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. BALLENGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

From its enactment in 1906 until very 

recently, it has been settled law for a century that the 

Carmack Amendment does not apply to the inland leg of an 

import through shipment. This Court had a factually 

identical --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you taking -- are 

you taking a position different than the U.S., that it 

applies to exports but not imports? I think the -- the 

Solicitor General's position is that it doesn't apply to 

any import or export. 

Is it yours that it doesn't apply to 

imports? 

MR. BALLENGER: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. I think both of our position is that the current

scope of Carmack is consistent with its historic scope, 

which had a very limited, special application to exports 

to Canada and Mexico. Other than that, it doesn't apply 

to foreign trade at all. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me 

something? Is there -- do you know if there’s a 

railroad line from the U.S. through to -- through 

Mexico? I know there is one from New York to Canada, a 

freight line. 

MR. BALLENGER: There certainly are rail 

connections between the United States and Mexico, yes, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are? 

MR. BALLENGER: Yes, absolutely. 

This Court had a factually identical import 

case just a few years ago in Kirby, and, although it did 

not discuss the Carmack Amendment, this Court agreed 

unanimously on both reasoning and a result that are 

flatly inconsistent with Respondents’ arguments here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the government 

told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in 

the case because it was either waived or something. But 

the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand, 

COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States. 

MR. BALLENGER: That's correct, Justice.

The United States represented to this Court that -- that 

Carmack was not in the case, either because it was 

waived or because the traffic was moving under 49 U.S.C. 

section 10709, which of course is true here as well. 

Our view has always been that this Court 

wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of 

a waiver. But in any event, this Court's reasoning in 

Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and 

to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but uniformity is 

one thing when you’re talking about 50 States and 

another when it's just two Federal statutes. 

MR. BALLENGER: That's absolutely true, Your 

Honor. But the -- for more than a century, the relevant 

Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to 

overlap in this particular situation. Foreign ocean 

commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods at Sea 

Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed 

purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and 

Mexico. 

Now, Respondents say that the settled 

meaning of that statute changed dramatically in 1978, 

but Congress said that it didn't. And it's not really 

that hard to read the present language --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if --

what if Congress was wrong? I mean, the language that 

they adopted sure looks quite different to me than what 

was applicable prior to 1978, and the boilerplate 

provision that, oh, when we codify this, we don't mean to 

change anything -- I mean, which prevails, the actual 

language they used or that boilerplate? 

MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, I think that 

this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as 

a whole, which includes that language that Your Honor 

characterizes as boilerplate and also includes the 

language that we are here to construe. And you would 

want to read it all together if possible. 

So let's look at the -- at the present 

language. It appears at the back of Union Pacific's 

reply brief at page 6a. Just like it always has, 

Carmack distinguishes between receiving carriers, 

delivering carriers, and connecting carriers. 

The simplest way to resolve this case is 

that I believe even Respondents would concede that for 

Carmack to apply, you need a receiving carrier that 

is a rail carrier. "K" Line is the receiving carrier 

here, and they are not a rail carrier. Numerous decisions 

of this Court and the Interstate Commerce Commission 

confirm what the statute plainly says, which is that a 

rail carrier is a party providing common carrier railroad

transportation, not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are -- those 

are two different arguments, right; your rail carrier 

argument and your pre-1978 argument? 

MR. BALLENGER: They are, Your Honor. The 

simplest way to resolve this case is that the present 

language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving 

carrier that is a rail carrier. 

"K" Line is the receiving carrier here. 

They are not a rail carrier. This Court and the ICC 

have long held that merely subcontracting for common 

carrier service does not make you a common carrier. 

This Court held that in the American Railway Express 

case. The ICC made this crystal clear in the 

CSX/Sea-Land matter in 1987, where they held that the 

ocean carrier Sea-Land was not a rail carrier simply 

because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation 

and provided carrier containers to the inland rail 

carrier. So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your -- I'm sorry. 

I'm a little confused. Your position is that "K" Line 

-- you’re representing whom here? 

MR. BALLENGER: I -- my client is Union 

Pacific, but I am here today speaking for both of the 

Petitioners, "K" Line and Union Pacific.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have a bit of a --

MR. BALLENGER: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- conflict, don't you? 

Because isn't "K" Line taking the position it's not a rail 

line? And who are you speaking for when you say it's --

MR. BALLENGER: For both of us, Your Honor, 

because that resolves -- actually resolves the case for 

both "K" Line and Union Pacific. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it's considered what? 

If it's considered --

MR. BALLENGER: "K" Line -- the statute 

requires -- to be triggered, it requires a receiving 

carrier that is a rail carrier. "K" Line is the 

receiving carrier here, and they are not a rail carrier. 

So then the question becomes -- Union Pacific certainly 

is a rail carrier. The question becomes: Can you treat 

Union Pacific as the receiving carrier? You can't. The 

receiving carrier language has been in the statute since 

1906. It has never changed. And for a century it has 

always meant the carrier that receives the property from 

the shipper at the point of origin. The current 

language --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is that defined in 

Carmack? Where in the pre-1978 provisions or in the 

current statute is that to be read?

MR. BALLENGER: Well, there are -- there is 

not an explicit definition of the term "receiving 

carrier," Your Honor. It appears in the first sentence 

of 11706, where it has always appeared in the first 

sentence of Carmack, and then there are implications 

in -- throughout the rest of Carmack, which I'm happy to 

talk about. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I’m trying to 

find it, statutorily. 

MR. BALLENGER: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what case says that? 

MR. BALLENGER: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What case of ours defines 

a -- a receiving carrier in that particular way? 

MR. BALLENGER: Well, let's start with the 

statutory language, if we may. The first sentence of 

Carmack says that "A rail carrier providing 

transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of 

the Board under this part shall issue a receipt or bill 

of lading for property it receives for 

transportation under this part.” 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The only one who’s in --

MR. BALLENGER: That's how --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The only one who has --

the board has jurisdiction over is the railroad. It

doesn't have jurisdiction over the ocean carrier 

receiving. 

MR. BALLENGER: That -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. And then the question is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so you are the --

you have to be the person -- the railroad has to be the 

person receiving the goods, correct? 

MR. BALLENGER: No, Your Honor. The 

receiving carrier has always been the party at the point 

of origin of the shipment. And you can see if you look at 

the venue provision in the current language --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you’re not reading 

the language. Doesn't the language say the person who 

receives under the jurisdiction of the board? 

MR. BALLENGER: No, Your Honor. It's --

it's two separate requirements. It's always been 

understood as two separate requirements. Carmack 

requires that the receiving -- a receiving carrier is 

subject to the jurisdiction of the board, and then it 

also has to be the receiving carrier. The receiving 

carrier is the originating carrier. If you look at the 

venue provision --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I keep going back 

to: What language tells me that particular point in the 

statute?

MR. BALLENGER: Because otherwise the -- the 

whole structure of the statute doesn't work. Carmack draws 

a distinction between receiving carriers, delivering 

carriers, and connecting carriers. 

If receiving property directly from another 

common carrier and merely moving it for a portion of the 

journey and connecting that were enough to make you a 

receiving carrier -- and, of course, it is in common 

parlance; you are receiving goods in that circumstance. 

But this receiving --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my problem. 

MR. BALLENGER: "Receiving carrier" has 

always been a term of art in this statute. If that were 

enough to make you a receiving carrier, then the 

statutory structure would fall apart, because every 

interim carrier in the line would be a receiving 

carrier. Every single one of them receives property --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but not --

MR. BALLENGER: -- property for transportation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not every -- where you are 

dealing with -- with intermodal transportation, not every 

receiving -- not every rail carrier would be the receiving 

rail carrier. I mean, this --

rail carrier to receive, right? 

MR. BALLENGER: It's not how -- that's not 

how the statute is worded, Justice Scalia. The 

statute --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is this the language? It 

says the -- see if it helps with Justice Scalia's question. 

The language says "a rail carrier providing transportation 

or service subject to the jurisdiction of” the STB “shall 

issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it 

receives." 

MR. BALLENGER: Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And so that's what it has 

to do, is a bill of lading for property it receives. 

And you are saying "receives" means receives from the 

shipper. 

MR. BALLENGER: It has always meant --

JUSTICE BREYER: It does not mean receives 

from another carrier. 

MR. BALLENGER: It has always meant that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? 

MR. BALLENGER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

It has always meant that. It has to mean that, because 

otherwise, if you read it to mean receives from another 

carrier, then every single connecting carrier or delivering 

carrier in the chain would be a receiving carrier as

well as a connecting or delivering carrier and required 

to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the 

historic purposes of Carmack on its head. 

The purpose of Carmack was to require the 

first carrier in the chain to issue a single through 

bill of lading to the destination that would govern the 

whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms. 

No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of 

lading, so there’s only one receiving carrier. It's 

the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper. 

If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the 

statute uses the term "originating carrier" 

interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it 

provides venue over that carrier only at the point of 

origin of the shipment. That would make absolutely no 

sense if someone downstream could be the receiving 

carrier. In this circumstance you would say, I suppose, 

that Union Pacific was the receiving carrier --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I always thought 

that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail 

responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it 

was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad 

connections. If that was the purpose of Carmack --

MR. BALLENGER: That's not quite correct, 

Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. 

MR. BALLENGER: Historically, this Court 

explained in Atlantic Coast Line v. Riverside Mills and 

in the Ward case, the purpose of Carmack was to require through 

transportation, a through bill of lading, from the 

originating point to the destination point, a single 

bill of lading under consistent terms, so that the 

shipper does not have to prove where damage occurred. 

The point of Carmack --

there is a -- if you want to take a look at it. 

MR. BALLENGER: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It is in page 99a of 

your petition. It reads: "If the loss, damage, or

a carrier by water, that liability" -- "the 

liability of such carrier shall be determined by the 

bill of lading of the carrier by water and by and under 

the laws applicable to transportation by water." 

MR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor. That --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --

MR. BALLENGER: That provision was 

introduced in the Transportation Act of 1920. It's 

talking about domestic water carriers. And it's still 

there in the statute. It's just in the -- the Carmack 

provision -- when Congress split Carmack into three in 

1995, it moved that provision to 14706(c)(2). And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain to me what 

happens in domestic water cases. It says that you can 

have a different bill of lading for the water transport. 

That bill of lading controls your damage on the water, 

and it separates that out from damage on the rail side? 

MR. BALLENGER: In domestic -- Congress drew 

a distinction between foreign and domestic commerce for 

a very long time, Your Honor. In domestic commerce, the 

rule has been that a rail carrier could interconnect 

with a domestic water carrier and the domestic water 

carrier could carry it for a leg of the trip, and the 

whole trip would still be governed by the Carmack 

through bill of lading. But if there was damage during

the water portion, it would be governed by the water 

law, which is the Harter Act. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the railroad is 

covered by any damage that occurs on land? 

MR. BALLENGER: The railroad is liable on a 

through transportation basis for the entire trip, but if 

the damage occurred during the water leg, its liability 

is limited and confined by the law that governs the 

water leg. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there already is 

domestically two different forms of liability 

protection? 

MR. BALLENGER: Congress made that 

compromise, because Congress was forced to choose 

between not having through bills of lading at all 

domestically or making -- or essentially repealing the 

Harter Act in circumstances where rail carriers interact 

with them. Congress made the choice to compromise and 

have kind of a hybrid arrangement. 

But in foreign trade -- the geographics of 

Carmack was always confined -- that Carmack did not apply 

to imports at all, and it did not apply to exports except 

for exports to adjacent foreign countries --

1978. If I think you lose on that question under the law

as happens to be currently codified, but would prevail 

under the pre-1978 law, what -- what is your strongest 

case for the proposition that what I referred to earlier 

as the boilerplate language trumps the plain language of 

the currently codified version? 

MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, we don't think 

that this Court has ever interpreted language of that 

nature. But in a different context with a much weaker 

statutory language, the Fourco Glass line of cases, this 

Court applies a strong thumb on the scale that Congress 

didn't intend to change the law. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a 

difficult -- I mean, if you’re a shipper and you’re 

trying to figure out, okay, let's ship some goods, and 

you pick up the law and it says, well, this is what the 

law says, who's going to tell you that, well, that you 

may think that's what the law says, but you’re really 

governed by the pre-1978 law. 

MR. BALLENGER: Well, Your Honor, we don't 

-- we don’t think that it’s -- it is necessary for this 

Court to read the statute in a counter-textual way. 

You just have to do what this Court has always done and 

read the statute as a whole, including giving some weight 

to that provision, which is in the text of the statute, and 

reading the rest of the statute in light of it.

pre-1978 law with the current law. Union Pacific can’t 

be a receiving carrier because it didn't receive the 

goods at the point of origin. "K" Line isn't a rail 

carrier. That's enough to resolve this case, and this 

Court doesn't need to go any farther. Actually, that 

would, as a practical matter, mostly resolve the 

commercial problem that this Court granted certiorari to 

resolve. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question. I 

know that it’s -- your white light is on. Can I assume 

that whether we rule for Petitioners or Respondents in 

this case, the shipping world, the cargo world, will 

immediately adjust to our decision? It's not going to 

be a problem. There are insurers, there are freight 

forwarders, there are form contracts. People will know 

exactly what to do. They will adjust in 1 week to what we 

do. Am I right about that? Or can you say that if we 

adopt the Respondents’ position, it will be disruptive to 

the shipping trade and so forth? 

MR. BALLENGER: Not exactly, Your Honor, 

because of course Respondents’ position is that Carmack 

is a mandatory regime; there’s no way to contract 

around it if it applies. So Respondents’ position is

that Carmack mandatorily must govern the inland leg of 

any of these through shipments. The practical 

consequence of that is that true through bills of 

lading -- unity of responsibility in one shipper under 

consistent terms for the entire voyage -- will become 

impossible in foreign trade. So there won't be a way to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF 

OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I’d like to address a few of the 

questions that have come up already. Justice Sotomayor, 

you asked what Supreme Court decision addresses the 

receiving carrier. There’s a series of decisions which 

address receiving carriers and the nature of the 

receiving carrier as the initial carrier that receives 

goods from the shipper. I would -- Mexican Light and 

Power Company, 1947, is probably the best, but that 

traces its way back all the way to the 1910s, Galveston 

Wharf Company, Ward, Starbird, Blish Milling, Riverside

Mills. These cases are largely cited at our brief at 

page 27 to 28, footnote 10. 

Regarding the geographic scope of Carmack on 

the current text, we believe that the current text, 

which is reproduced in the petition appendix at 69a --

if you look at the combination of both the first and the 

third sentences of Carmack, we believe that that 

reproduces the historic scope as encompassing only 

domestic transportation, purely domestic transportation, 

and transportation to an adjacent foreign country when 

it's an export. 

The first sentence requires that the rail 

carrier be providing transportation or service subject 

to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or 

bill of lading. The very purpose of Carmack from the 

very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper 

to sue the initial carrier. The initial carrier was 

responsible for the entire shipment. All the connecting 

carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier, 

and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the 

shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that 

carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier 

to sue. That --

exclusively on the pre-1978 language. 

MR. YANG: Our brief addressed the first 

sentence briefly in, I believe, the prior page. Page 20 

to 21 deals with the first sentence, and then 22 deals 

with the third. But our point is that the first sentence 

sets an anchor in the United States as the -- as the 

origin of the shipment. 

Part A jurisdiction -- this is reproduced at 

page 62a of the petition appendix. It does cover 

shipments that themselves transit United States and 

foreign countries. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what are 

you referring to now? 

MR. YANG: 62a of the petition appendix. 

This is section 10501, which defines Part A jurisdiction 

of the STB. And then I'm looking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Union Pacific 

petition appendix? 

MR. YANG: They’re both -- both of them are 

actually the same. Both the petition appendices are the 

same. 

So I'm looking down at -- (a)(2) provides 

that the jurisdiction of the STB applies only to 

transportation into the United States when that's 

between -- you know, part of a larger transit between

the U.S. and a foreign country or even purely 

domestically. 

So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is 

subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this 

U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading. 

So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a 

carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring 

suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper 

dealt with. And that's now reflected in section -- the 

forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(2), 

it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be 

brought against the originating rail carrier in the 

judicial district in which the point of origin is 

located. Those -- and the prior provision says that 

that's a U.S. district court or a State court. 

Carmack itself anchors the transportation 

as starting in the United States. 

And then the third sentence explains the 

remainder of the historic scope. The third sentence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- we’re looking 

where, now? 

MR. YANG: This is back to 69(a). It’s 

Carmack, third sentence in subsection (b). It defines 

the liability under Carmack. It says the liability 

under this section is for damage “caused by the receiving

carrier, the delivering carrier, or another rail carrier 

over whose line or route the property is transited in 

the United States or from a place in the United States 

to a place in an adjacent foreign country.” 

So, what that does is that provides the 

center for the two bookends. The first bookend is the 

originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives 

the goods in the United States, provides the bill of 

lading to the shipper. 

The second bookend is the delivering 

carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended 

to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole. The 

in-between is transportation in the United States or 

export transportation from the United States to a point 

in a foreign country. 

We believe that that text, read as a whole, 

reflects the historic scope of Carmack that's existed 

since 1915 when it was extended beyond purely domestic 

transportation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why doesn't the 

(2), (a)(2), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you 

say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier 

delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country. 

MR. YANG: Correct.

(a)(3), which now looks like it's in (a)(3), the “over

“transported” actually applies to the receiving and 

delivering rail carrier. 

If you would turn to page 5a and 6a of the

comparison. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Wait a minute now.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. YANG: The current version is reflected 

on the facing page. There was no paragraph indentation 

in 1978. And in 1995, when Congress changed the text, it 

did include a paragraph indentation, but the committee 

report -- the conference report is very clear that 

Carmack was not changed. Also --

3 is just wrong, right? 

MR. YANG: Well, I don't know -- you mean 

the indentation? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The indentation. 

MR. YANG: The indentation was inadvertent. 

And I would actually direct the Court to page 73a, which 

is the other part of Carmack that now exists for motor 

transportation and freight forwarders. There is no 

indentation. The current version of the other half of 

Carmack does not provide the indentation. The 

indentation is inadvertent. And in '95 -- the '95 Act, 

which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm losing you. 73a? 

MR. YANG: 73a -- (a)(1) reproduces what we 

were just looking for -- looking at in the rail carrier 

context. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. YANG: It's a single paragraph. That's 

the way it's existed since, you know, 1915, basically, 

or 1927 when they added receiving carriers. 

So, what the Court can do -- it's true, 

Carmack is less clear than it used to be. It was made 

somewhat less clear in '78 and in '95. But we believe

that when you take the text as a whole, particularly 

when read in light of the context of this Court's 

decision and the long-standing practice in the United States 

reflected in the STB -- the STB's decisions, that is the 

ICC's decisions, the predecessor, that at least the 

provision is ambiguous. 

And if the provision is ambiguous, section 

3(a), the mandate that the statute should not be construed 

to make a substantive change in the law, should control. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This may not have 

anything to do with anything. Is there a reason the STB

brief --

taken a position about the current scope of Carmack and, 

therefore, decided not to join our brief.

MR. YANG: No. I would say, though, that 

the ICC's decisions remain binding. This is 1995. The

ICC's orders and determinations would remain binding 

unless changed by the STB. The STB just did not, at 

this point, come on record and take a position about the 

scope of Carmack. 

JUSTICE BREYER: We don't even get into this 

problem if -- unless the ship line is a rail carrier? 

MR. YANG: In part. There's -- if you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it says, “A rail 

carrier providing transportation or service subject to” 

the STB “shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading.” 

That's what leads us into the problem. 

MR. YANG: That would take care of the 

initial carrier, what we believe is the initial 

receiving carrier in the case, "K" Line. However, I 

believe the argument is being made that Carmack could 

suddenly apply mid-carriage at the border. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But mid-carriage -- it only 

talks about -- they use that word "received." That's 

why I thought possibly it didn't because it says --

MR. YANG: I believe the argument is that 

the first carrier who receives property in the United 

States would be deemed the receiving carrier.

the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents. 

The case is controlled by the plain language 

of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted 

to, to some extent. But I would like to point out to 

the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief, 

starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not 

only cite the full language in full of the Carmack 

Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB, 

but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier 

within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the 

plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the 

loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of 

the property; and the train derailment which was caused 

by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the 

Carmack Amendment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Then under that view, I 

guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all 

the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a 

single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United 

States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of 

lading must issue? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. In fact, this Carmack 

Amendment --

"Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not 

affect the liability of a rail carrier." Carmack --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so you're saying 

they don't have to issue --

MR. FREDERICK: They do not have to issue a 

separate --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If they don't have 

to issue a separate receipt, what we’re talking about 

is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if that's 

correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do 

that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is 

a person providing common carrier rail transport. And 

then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used 

by or in connection with a railroad. And my 

understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction 

if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is 

providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection 

with a railroad. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And it's the words "used by 

or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to 

apply those words here seems to me to bring every 

international shipment in the world, no matter how small

the American portion by rail and no matter how big the 

foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within 

Carmack. And it means that the bill of ladings issued 

by people throughout the world are all going to have to 

apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which 

had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and 

that's going to be a nightmare. 

MR. FREDERICK: No, it won't, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, first, is it true what 

I said? And, second, if it is true why isn't it way 

contrary to the purpose and a nightmare? 

MR. FREDERICK: It is not -- it is true and 

not true, but for different reasons. And if I could 

take a moment to explain, because I think it is 

important. 

In 1978, the plain language of the statute 

defined what the STB's jurisdiction is. They do not 

dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional 

provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment 

is in, quote, "between the United States and a place in 

a foreign country," but the STB only has jurisdiction to 

the extent the transportation occurs in the United 

States. 

So it is true that imports into the United

States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to 

the extent of the transportation being within the United 

States. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but why don't they have to 

issue a bill of lading? That's what they say. So every 

company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, 

every shipowner, even if he’s never been to the 

United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every 

one of those is going to have to issue a bill of 

lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are 

there, and we know at least one requirement you think 

applies. 

MR. FREDERICK: Let me go back -- let me go 

back to the international point, Justice Breyer, because 

the railroads argued against an international uniform 

rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland 

carriage in the Rotterdam rules. And they made the 

representation to the international community: You don't 

need to have a uniform rule that applies to both ocean 

carriage and inland carriage, because we have this thing 

called the Carmack Amendment. 

And they made the representation that the 

Carmack Amendment would apply to imports, as this Court, 

in the Woodbury case written by Justice Brandeis, decided 

in 1920, and a month earlier --

occur on land, and the European nations have acceded to

decided in the Second Circuit, Union Pacific went right 

out and changed the contracts that they have with ocean 

carriers to ensure that the ocean carriers would 

indemnify them if they were liable and did not get the 

full benefits of contractual extensions. What we're 

talking about here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don’t --

MR. FREDERICK: -- is whether there's an 

American forum for American cargo interests for an 

American train that is derailed in the United States. 

That's what we are talking about. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But part of your 

argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain 

language argument when it comes to deciding that these 

huge ocean vessels are rail carriers. 

MR. FREDERICK: Let me go to that point now, 

Mr. Chief Justice. The Port of Long Beach is situated 

more than 20 miles from Los Angeles, and the port has 

60 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal 

facilities that get the cargo containers which "K" Line 

owns on chassis that "K" Line owns, and they have to get 

from the Port of Long Beach 20 miles away to the Los 

Angeles train depot where Union Pacific picks them up. 

Now, under "K" Line's theory of the case, 

they get to have a donut hole in the Carmack Amendment

liability provision for that 20-mile transport. We 

would submit as a factual matter, which of course would 

need to be done on remand, that there are facts that can 

be adduced to establish the functionality test which the 

ICC has long administered to look at the functions being 

performed as well as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's a little 

bit different from your argument that they are a rail 

carrier because their bill of lading would cover the 

train ride to Chicago. 

MR. FREDERICK: We didn't make that 

argument. Our argument was that, based on the functions 

and them holding themselves out to be a rail carrier, 

which they have done, they qualify under the normal ICC 

method of determining rail carrier. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it weren't -- if 

it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to 

Los Angeles, you would say then they’re not a rail 

carrier? 

MR. FREDERICK: The argument, as the ICC has 

defined it, also looks at things like the multimodal 

facilities, like the containers, and -- and the holding 

themselves out as a rail carrier in their advertising. 

Those are important parts of the functionality test.

the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language 

of the statute? They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and 

it -- there’s a railroad track right by -- by the 

wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are -- there are 

two ways to read the text and resolve the case. One is 

to say "K" Line is the receiving rail carrier when it 

transfers from the international ocean carriage 

corporation to the American multimodal transportation 

operation and gets the goods from the Port of Long Beach 

up to Los Angeles, and then treat UP, Union Pacific, as 

the delivering rail carrier. Under the statute, UP is 

not required -- although the first part says you’re 

supposed to issue a bill of lading, their liability for 

the train derailment does not turn on whether they 

issued a bill of lading or not. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your case -- does 

your case end if we hold that "K" Line is not a railroad 

carrier? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 

MR. FREDERICK: "K" Line gets out of the 

case. We would have to go to Tokyo to pursue "K" Line 

under the bill of lading. But we could continue our 

suit against Union Pacific as a delivering rail carrier

MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless we 

hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they 

can opt out under 10709. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, you would need to 

reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage 

under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's a 

different question with respect to liability and claims 

and with respect to venue.

that, if I might.

Amendment. And in fact, when Union Pacific removed this 

case from State court to Federal court, the Federal 

question was they said: There is a Carmack Amendment 

claim being asserted against us. That's how we get from 

State court to Federal court. 

And when they -- when they sought to transfer 

the case from California to New York, they did so on the 

basis of the convenience of 28 of the 32 witnesses to their 

train derailment being American citizens. 

So it's not like there needs to be some 

special -- there’s a special cause of action within the 

Carmack Amendment, Justice Sotomayor, that provides a 

means of redress for damaged cargo interests to go 

directly against the railroad. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Perhaps --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Regardless of whether 

the shipment was by them directly or not? 

MR. FREDERICK: Correct, if they caused the 

damage. That's the whole point of the Carmack 

Amendment.

between claims and liability and venue.

deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for 

certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done 

with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove 

the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage. 

And the reason for that is that, in both 

situations, the rail carrier has to provide an 

opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to 

the shipper. If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502, 

10502(e) says that the carrier must provide 

Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of 

the exemption and contract under the exemption. 10709 

provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier 

provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest 

could ship under. 

Here, because the transportation is exempt 

under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff 

that is applicable. And that's why the STB has said if 

there’s no common carrier tariff applicable under 

11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract 

carriage. To do otherwise would be to make the statute 

a complete deregulation statute. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a 

little -- I mean, the -- I’m looking at page 64a of the 

petition appendix, where they’re saying you can't exempt 

through contractual terms for liability and claims.

don't understand I'm just trying to get clear. In the 

first part, 706(a), it talks about -- in the definition 

of "rail carrier" -- 102(6), I guess. It says railroad 

includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal 

-- intermodal equipment transport used in connection 

with a railroad.

What is intermodal equipment? 

MR. FREDERICK: Those are the chassis. They 

are the containers that are used to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So now, if we read 

it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce 

the worst example that frightens me the most. There is 

3 miles of railroad transport in the United States, 

but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, 

which has come all over the world, from all over the 

world. And if we read this with no limitation, this 

definition makes the ships that carried it from other 

places railroads, and once that's railroad 

transportation, we’re into Carmack. 

And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is 

the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt 

an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability 

provisions. And it means the ships that had to issue the 

bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits --

now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would 

think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, 

and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even 

on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for 

something that happens within the United States.

provision of COGSA that you are looking for is the 

definition of "carriage," which is set forth in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Good. 

MR. FREDERICK: -- page 48a of the petition 

appendix, and it is 1(e). “The term ‘carriage of goods’ 

covers the period from the time when the goods are 

loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the

there are thousands of "K" Line containers all over the 

United States right now where "K" Line is performing 

services, motor carriage and rail carriage services, here 

in the United States.

level, Mr. Chief Justice, it's sort of academic, because

bit confused now. Now, back to being confused. 

You’re suggesting that from the landing --

it's an ocean carrier -- and the minute that the 

containers are unloaded from the vessel and put on land, 

it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery 

contract may have ended at that point? 

MR. FREDERICK: If its delivery contract 

ended at that point, it did not hold itself out --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Right. So what about --

MR. FREDERICK: -- as a rail carrier --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what about -- what is 

it that you're arguing makes them a railroad carrier 

once they put it there. Let's assume the reverse of the 

hypothetical that you -- that you posited. They deliver 

to the dock, and Union Pacific is the one that owns 

those 3 to 6 miles of connection to its main railroad. 

It's the one who’s going to provide the motor carriage. 

It's the one who’s going to take it from the -- the dock 

and bring it in. 

MR. FREDERICK: And can I just add to the 

hypothetical the fact, which is an important fact: Did 

the ocean carrier hold itself out to the public as a rail 

carrier in making the contract with the original 

shipper? Because that is an important fact that does

not help us resolve your particular hypothetical, 

Justice Sotomayor. 

If UP is picking up the goods with its 

equipment, the ocean carrier is not a rail carrier under 

our theory of the case. There has to be functions being 

performed that are multimodal functions, and the ocean 

carrier has to hold --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not merely that 

it has possession of the container that it has dropped 

somewhere. It has to transport it in some way in 

relationship to the railroad? 

MR. FREDERICK: I think that's the best way 

to understand the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back one more 

second? Can you just give me the citation in Carmack --

not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal 

shipment out of the board's jurisdiction? 

Because what I'm thinking about is the 

intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii. 

Okay? Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what 

gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam 

or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack?

MR. FREDERICK: Now, it is not true that the 

law was settled prior to 1978. The Woodbury case 

applied the Carmack Amendment to imports. Union 

Pacific v. Burke applied it to imports. And in those 

cases, this Court made the determination that the words 

"from" and "to" were also meaning "between." And 

Congress, when it cleaned up the statute in 1978 and 

provided words that are very easy to understand now, was 

not changing what had been a well-settled practice of 

goods that were getting -- arriving at a port in the 

United States and then being transported by land means. 

And it's important to understand the context 

in which this arose, because I think our fundamental 

disagreement with the Solicitor General's presentation 

is that it ignores the container revolution that was 

occurring between the late 1950s and the '70s, when 

this Act was codified and cleaned up. And in that 

container revolution, prior to the time when containers 

were used for multimodal transportation, it was common 

for goods to be repackaged at ports in the United 

States. They were taken off ships; they were 

repackaged, put onto trains or trucks, and that required 

a separate contractual arrangement. 

Now, this Court, in Woodbury and Burke, had 

said it is not so important whether or not there is a

separate contract, so long as the function and the intent 

is clear that it is being moved by rail or road in the 

United States. 

The Carmack Amendment will apply, Justice 

Sotomayor. You are completely correct that the purpose 

of the Carmack Amendment was to hold railroads and motor 

carriers responsible for the liabilities caused by their 

loss. But when Congress then cleaned that up and put it in 

section 3, it was not intending to obviate the clear and 

unambiguous language of the statute. It was simply 

providing, you know, some boilerplate that I think is 

very difficult to cause the Court to override the 

plain language of the statute today. 

And in 1995, when Congress eliminated --

terminated the ICC and enacted the ICC Termination Act, 

it reenacted that language. It did not encompass 

section 3 at that time, so the statute as it presently 

exists does not have a statutory pointer as to how you 

are to interpret the language. And under the normal 

canons that this Court has instructed for courts and the 

bar, the easiest way to practice law in this area is to 

look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to 

go back, not just through the last iteration of the 

statute, but the one before that, and not just to be 

able to look at what was in the U.S. Code, but to have

to go back to the Statutes at Large to see what other 

statutory provisions Congress had put into the statute. 

That would make the practice of law extremely difficult. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question 

about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a 

rail carrier? Suppose it's not 3 to 5 miles. 

Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is 

waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these 

wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay? 

And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the 

shipping company. And a crane takes the -- the 

goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that 

rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards. 

Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad? 

MR. FREDERICK: I would -- I would concede 

the point of interchange at the port, Justice Scalia. I 

don't think it's necessary for the Court to reach that. 

I will concede that point, so long as, you know, we are 

talking about an immediate nexus between the vessel and 

the ship. And -- and that is not -- not a point that we 

have to prevail on to win in this case.

MR. FREDERICK: Well, there was no discovery 

because this was decided on the pleadings as a matter of 

law. We believe that once discovery is permitted, if 

you allow the case to go back for factual development, 

that the facts would reveal that "K" Line was engaging 

in significant rail operations that at least get us 

beyond -- into the realm of legitimate advocacy. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When you say "engaging 

in," are you talking about vis-à-vis this shipment? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or is it just in 

general? Vis-à-vis you? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. That's correct. 

When my colleague here says that we take 

the position that Carmack cannot be contracted around, 

that is not true. Our point here is that when there is 

exempt carriage, the STB has already defined this as 

something that can be provided by contract, but we believe 

that 10502(e) says that they have to provide 

Carmack-compliant terms. 

The industry will adapt to a decision by 

this Court in setting the background rules. We would 

submit that the simpler regime and the one that the 

railroad had advocated in the international community 

was there -- was for there to be a U.S. statute that

applies and not to allow complete deregulation through 

contracts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they 

can't contract around liability for an event such as the 

one that happened here. Because they have to offer 

Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods 

has the option of accepting those, they can't contract 

around that. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And -- and 

the point here about the forum is an important one, 

because Union Pacific has never thought that in these 

ocean bills of lading that that entitled American cargo 

interests to have to go to a foreign country under the 

ocean carrier's bill of lading in order to vindicate the 

interests in damage to their cargo. That was an 

invention by "K" Line in this case after UP sought to 

remove it under the Carmack Amendment and transfer it to 

New York, and UP joined that motion and has argued 

throughout that the Carmack Amendment applies. 

It would be unusual, to say the least, to 

allow UP now to take advantage of a contractual 

extension of COGSA where section 12 of COGSA, by its 

plain terms, in language that is completely ignored by 

the other side, says COGSA stops basically at the 

tackle-to-tackle period and does -- otherwise does not

specific reference in section 12 to the Harter Act and 

any other applicable law. And in 1936, when Congress 

enacted COGSA to implement the United States -- of the 

Hague rules, it was aware of the Carmack Amendment. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Ballenger, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. BALLENGER: Thank you, Your Honor. 

Even Respondents can't really bring 

themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving 

carrier here. It's obviously not. They say that 

somehow, UP could be liable as the delivering carrier 

under Carmack. But of course, if "K" Line is not a rail 

carrier, there is no receiving carrier who is obligated 

to issue a bill of lading under Carmack. No one is 

liable to under Carmack. 

That is how the statute always worked from 1906 

to 1978. If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack, 

as it was not in any import case and in any export case except 

for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to 

anyone. You can't parachute in midstream into the 

middle of a big movement and impose Carmack obligations at

the midpoint, because that would turn the historic purpose 

of Carmack completely upside down. It would read Carmack 

as mandating the commercial problem that Carmack was designed 

to solve. 

The point of Carmack and of through bills 

under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility 

under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one 

person. 

And the reason is that in order to recover 

from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the 

goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you 

break the chain of the through bill, then you would have 

to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union 

Pacific, for instance, received the property in good 

order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union 

Pacific gets is a sealed container. It has no idea at 

that point. 

And -- and so the shipper would be left in a 

position at the end of the day; it opens the container, 

there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there’s 

-- there’s no source of law, no source of fact to 

figure out where the damage occurred. 

Respondents raise a lot of questions about 

some track that they say "K" Line owns from Long Beach 

to Los Angeles. None of this is in the record, and it's

waived at this point, Your Honor. It's not actually 

true. That's not "K" Line; it's an affiliate, and they 

don't provide rail transportation. It's a Union Pacific 

subsidiary that provides the rail transportation. 

But the real point is that all of this is 

far too late. This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3) 

motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower 

courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are 

confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you 

are required to at least come forward with any factual 

disputes that you think need to be resolved before the 

district court can grant or deny that motion. It's far 

too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United 

States, and say we have discovered some X number of 

miles of track --

JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how do you get out 

of the language that says that a rail carrier providing 

transportation “shall issue a receipt” for property it 

receives? 

Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail 

carrier under the definition. 

MR. BALLENGER: The --

JUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, it should 

have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving 

character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued

a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as 

I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain 

things in it that they say aren't there. 

MR. BALLENGER: Under the definitions, a rail 

carrier is a party providing railroad transportation. 

And this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, yes, right; and now we 

see a rail carrier --

MR. BALLENGER: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can get the definition 

there, and it includes somebody who provides intermodal 

equipment. And you look at transportation, and transportation 

includes services related to that equipment. 

MR. BALLENGER: The definitions of “railroad” 

and “transportation” have always been defined to include 

all of the equipment used by a real railroad. But that 

doesn't mean that anyone who happens to own that 

equipment is also a railroad. For instance, the 

purpose --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, now all right. Fine. 

MR. BALLENGER: The purpose of those definitions 

from 1906 on was to make sure that railroads couldn't evade 

rate regulation by overcharging for the use of a bridge that 

it owned.

what they did here, the ship, is it took a container and 

put it on the train. Okay? So that's inter-service 

equipment. What's the language that does it your way? 

MR. BALLENGER: A party providing rail 

common carrier transportation, the scope of the -- of 

that transportation is defined to include a container. 

But that doesn't mean that everyone who owns a container 

is -- meets the first part of the definition of 

providing railroad transportation. Otherwise, for 

instance, everyone who owned a bridge or a track or 

provided rail cars would be providing railroad 

transportation.
