CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-184, Kloeckner v. Solis. 

Mr. Schnapper. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2) 

provides that district courts have jurisdiction over all 

mixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive 

here. 

The second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which 

the Government relies is a statute of limitations, and 

it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts. 

That subsection is set out at pages 16a to 

17a of the Government's brief. The first sentence 

provides that for a described category of cases, they 

are to be, quote, "filed under one of the listed Federal 

antidiscrimination statutes." 

As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of 

those are statutes which authorize jurisdiction 

and claims in district courts. Indeed, in Title VII and 

the ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is

authorized to hear the cases. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, could you 

clarify what the district court, as you see it, does? 

Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does 

it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: With regard to the -- when 

the case gets to district court, there may be two 

substantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA 

claim. Your question, I take it, is about the former. 

Our view is that the claim is filed and 

pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a 

discrimination case; in this case, under several 

different statutes. And the complaint here reads very 

much like an ordinary discrimination complaint. 

The Government may raise the -- that sort of 

procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would 

be free to do so here. And that -- that happens on a 

number of occasions. 

For example, if there were a case in which 

the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations, 

appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt 

of the agency decision, the Government could move to 

dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call 

exhaustion grounds. And the lower courts have 

repeatedly sustained those motions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Schnapper --

MR. SCHNAPPER: -- but that's a 

determinative defense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the critical 

point, I gather, is what standard of review the district 

court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the 

bar question, right? 

I assume you think that the standard review 

in the district court is going to be more favorable to 

your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and 

capricious standard that would be applicable in the 

Federal circuit? 

I guess --

MR. SCHNAPPER: When it's come up, 

Your Honor, it has generally been a question of law, 

like whether the 30-day rule had applied. If you had 

something that was -- if it were a factual issue, our 

contention is then those Section 7703(c) factual issues 

have to be decided de novo. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why don't we take this --

this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the 

claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it 

as an affirmative defense. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: And the first question would 

be whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our

position would be that it is not. Not everything that 

could go awry in the internal procedure is an 

affirmative defense. 

One of the central principles of the 

1972 amendments to Title VII was to create an exhaustion 

regime which is precise, simple and short. And if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, can I back 

you up a minute to join the two questions that my 

colleague posed to you? 

Let's assume there's a merits-based decision 

on the CSRA and one on the discrimination. In the 

normal course, assuming you are not barred by being 

untimely, you could go to the district court, and the 

district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if 

one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both 

questions. 

What's the standard of review that a court 

would apply to each of those claims independently or 

together? I mean --

MR. SCHNAPPER: They're there --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that that's --

MR. SCHNAPPER: -- it's -- yeah, I totally 

understand the question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can then fight about 

whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and

exhaustion should be subject to one or the other 

standard of review, but what are the standards of 

review? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: They -- they are 

different. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the discrimination 

claim is dealt with de novo. The intent of Congress 

was that it would generally be treated like a private 

discrimination claim. 

However, the CSRA claim is dealt with under 

the same standard that would apply in the Federal 

circuit. And that's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could you tell me 

what --

MR. SCHNAPPER: -- well established. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 

interrupt you. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: That's what the lower courts 

have been doing. And we don't -- we think that's 

correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you finish your prior 

answer? You -- you started to say --

change? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. I was 

talking about the amendments to the 19 -- to Title VII 

in 1972. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Prior to that, courts were 

applying the -- judicially fashioned exhaustion 

requirements. And the -- Congress made a decision to 

replace that. 

As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown 

v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the 

Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary 

to exhaust were not clear. 

So the regime established by Section 717 of 

Title VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an 

exhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and 

limited in time. It requires the plaintiff to file a 

complaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that 

point, the plaintiff was done and could go to district 

court. 

Plaintiff also had the option at that point 

of going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting 

180 days. But as long as a timely complaint was filed, 

that was all that was required of the plaintiff. And 

that was a fundamental change in the way this had been

dealt with. 

The ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974, 

was actually even simpler, although it's been changed a 

little bit since. The plaintiff to exhaust had to do 

only one of two things, either file a complaint with the 

EEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff 

was going to sue and wait 30 days. 

As the Government pointed out in its brief 

in Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't 

-- didn't in any way address what happened after the 

complaint was filed. It simply said, file the 

complaint. 

That is the fundamental principle that's 

animated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title 

VII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was 

written to change that. 

Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it 

doesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference 

those statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo 

exhaustion requirement. It actually shortened the 

period of time that plaintiff has to wait for these 

cases. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- you're talking 

about the discrimination claim. In your view, could the 

plaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget

4  MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor. The Plaintiff 

can do that. The --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then that would take 

7 care of the whole thing you discussed before about the 

8 affirmative defense and the Government. It would be the 

9 plaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's 

it. 

11  MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. The 

12 affirmative defenses could still be raised. It's just 

13 that the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would 

14 be abandoned. And that's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what provision --

16  MR. SCHNAPPER: -- that's what happened 

17 here. It's not uncommon. 

18  The CSRA claim involves a right that is much 

19 more valuable to the plaintiff in the administrative 

process.

22 the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim

JUSTICE ALITO: "Cases of discrimination" --

MR. SCHNAPPER: "Cases of discrimination 

subject to 7702." And 7702 --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. It says, "shall be 

filed under Title VII." 

So you are saying that a nondiscrimination 

claim can be filed under Title VII? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: No. The way the courts have 

read this, and I think correctly, is this: If -- so 

this is just one case. It's a little bit like 

supplemental jurisdiction. So long as the plaintiff is 

asserting a discrimination claim, the CSRA claim comes 

along with it. 

If the plaintiff were to abandon the 

discrimination claim, then the case would have to go to 

the Federal Circuit. That's the way the courts have 

interpreted that. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that a 

lot of courts have read it that way. I find it 

difficult to see how it fits in the statutory language. 

And in particular, since the second sentence of 

subsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it 

seems strange to have a district court review the 

timeliness of the filing before the MSPB. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the second point you

make is really separate from the first, because even if 

only a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can 

insert an affirmative defense, and one possible 

affirmative defense which the Government has repeatedly 

asserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was 

untimely. So that happens either way. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you give up 

your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. It's because --

because the discrimination statutes themselves have two 

requirements. You have to have filed the complaint or 

an appeal, depending on where you are in the process. 

You have to wait a certain amount of time if you don't 

have a decision. 

The statutes themselves don't --

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't understand why 

you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't 

see any provision that says that -- that specifies what 

the standard of review in the district court is for a 

nondiscrimination claim. 

(C) sets out the standard of review in the 

Federal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it 

pointedly says nothing about the district court. 

Doesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the 

district court?

MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, that question, 

of course, isn't here because we haven't asserted a CSRA 

claim. And if you have doubts about it, I think I would 

reserve that for another case. But, we think the -- the 

courts have treated this as -- the statute doesn't say 

claims of discrimination subject to 7702. It says 

"cases of discrimination." 

And if you look at section 7702, which is 

set out at page 8(a) of the Government's brief, it 

describes the cases involved as cases which contain 

these two elements. They are treated as one case in the 

administrative process. And it would be highly peculiar 

for the Government -- for the statute to take one 

administrative proceeding and then split it in half. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the 

Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about 

-- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age 

Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth. What 

would the situation be? Wouldn't you have a right to go 

to district court? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Title VII and all the 

statutes authorize that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, to prevent you from 

going to district court under those statutes, you have 

to find a repealer contained somewhere -­

MR. SCHNAPPER: In that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the Civil Service 

Reform Act, correct? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: That's exactly right. And 

we think this is a classic example of -- for application 

of the rule that implied repeals are disfavored. This 

-- this statute is quite precise when -- when it's 

changing something, it's very specific. The second 

section, section 7703(b)(2), begins with the words 

"notwithstanding," because it is changing the statute of 

limitations that would otherwise apply. It's changing 

it from 90 days in Title VII to 30 days. 

So when Congress wanted to change something, 

it was very specific. But the whole thrust of this 

statute is to leave in place, except where very 

specifically it does otherwise, the regime that existed 

under Title VII in the ADEA. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I 

understand something that you said, Mr. Schnapper. When 

you talk about the affirmative defenses that the 

Government can raise, that is -- those are exhaustion 

defenses under the applicable anti-discrimination 

statute, right? It's whatever exhaustion requirements 

Title VII sets out or whatever exhaustion requirements 

the ADEA sets out; is that correct?

MR. SCHNAPPER: Not -- that's not entirely 

correct, Your Honor. There are -- there are exhaustion 

premises in the statute, but these statutes do not 

contain a time period within which a charge or a 

complaint must be filed with the agency, and they don't 

contain a time period within which an appeal must be 

taken. Those time periods are in the regulations. 

The lower courts have taken the position 

that those time periods also have to be complied with, 

and we think that's correct. 

In the case of --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Those time periods relevant 

to the MSPB? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: And there are also time 

periods relevant to filing a -- complaint at the agency 

level. It's an -- in the case of a private 

discrimination claim, that time period is specified by 

Title VII. 

But Section 717 about Federal employees is 

simply silent. Congress didn't deal with it. But it 

did authorize the EEOC and the MSPB to write 

regulations. They have both written regulations that --

with regard to the agency, it is the EEOC regulations 

which set up the time period within which a complaint 

must be filed. With regard to appeals to the MSPB, both

the EEOC and the MSPB have regulations which are the 

same. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a 

repealer of what would otherwise be the law under all 

these civil rights statutes? Why isn't that a repealer 

of what would otherwise be their right to go to district 

court? 

You are saying, no, you can't go to district 

court because of these time limits, not even established 

by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by 

regulation. You think that that's -- that's an 

effective repealer of the right to go to district court? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: We don't -- we think not, 

Your Honor. 

Again, this doesn't go to subject matter 

jurisdiction, which is specified in the statute. The 

statute creates a regime. It doesn't set up time 

periods. 

We think Congress -- the statute should be 

read to -- to mean that the authority of the Government, 

of the agencies to write regulations, includes 

regulations setting up time periods. It's just 

inconceivable that --

would have forever to do these things. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And would that put the 

employee who has a mixed case in the same position as an 

employee who has a straight anti-discrimination case? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Non-mixed case. Yes. Yes. 

There are regulations governing both. 

The non-mixed case claim would only be 

governed by the EEOC regulation. The mixed case claim 

is governed as well by the time limit in the MSPB 

regulation, but that is the same as the time limit in 

the EEOC regulation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I've probably led a 

charmed life, but I've never heard of mixed case until 

this matter came before us. And I was -- I suppose you 

have to adopt the phrase, but the statute 7703 just say 

"cases," "cases of discrimination," which is what this 

is. 

We don't usually think of cases that we call 

a discrimination case based on whether or not it 

contains other issues. It's a case. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, the -- you 

have led a charmed life. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I think that helps 

you.

affects it. The phrase mixed case is in the 

regulations, both of the EEOC. It also was in currency 

prior to 1978. When Congress was working on this 

problem, it was already calling these kinds of cases 

mixed cases. 

And, of course, we haven't touched on this. 

A mixed case is a case which involves -- has two 

elements. First, it involves what's called, under the 

Civil Service Reform Act, an appealable issue. That is 

an issue which can be appealed to the MSPB, not --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can't an employee take a 

mixed case appeal to the Federal circuit? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: You could not take that case 

to the Federal circuit without waiving your 

antidiscrimination claim. That is what the -- that's 

the way we read the law and that is the way the MSPB 

reads the law. The MSPB regulation expressly provides 

that if you want to go to the Federal circuit you must 

waive that right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, can you 

explain something about the MSPB's role? That is, once 

you have a final decision from the agency, you could go 

right to court. You don't -- on the discrimination 

claim, right? You don't need to go to the MSPB. You 

don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get

claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be 

if you stopped at the agency level? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it's our view that 

once you appeal to the MSPB, and putting aside the 

unusual situation of people who withdraw the appeal, you 

then must wait, under the statute, 120 days or until you 

have a decision. So you are ready, all set, and you 

could go to court after the district court decision, but 

if you appeal to the MSPB, you then have to wait until 

120 days have passed or you have a decision. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are -- what are your 

advantages? You are deciding -- you have the final 

agency decision, you could go right to court on the 

discrimination claim. What do you gain by invoking the 

MSPB's authority? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: What you gain are the rights 

in Section 7701(c), which are set out on page 3(a) of 

the Government's brief. In the appeal to the MSPB with 

regard to the Civil -- the CSRA claim, the burden is on 

the Government to establish by a preponderance of the 

evidence that its decision was correct. If you bypass 

the MSPB and go to district court, then your claim is 

only a claim under section 7703(c), which requires the

plaintiff to establish that there wasn't even 

substantial evidence to support the decision. So, 

plaintiff --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose -- I'm 

sorry. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: The CSRA claim is much more 

valuable at the MSPB. In terms of discrimination claim, 

in the real world that's probably not why people go to 

the MSPB. The MSPB, according to the only study I've 

been able to find, out of 2,000 mixed cases the MSPB 

actually only found discrimination in four. But a much 

higher percentage of CSRA claims are successful there. 

So that's why people go there. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose if you 

say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency 

says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent, 

you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and 

if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent, 

they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and 

you don't need to proceed with the discrimination --

MR. SCHNAPPER: Sure. And that's why people 

go there. That's why people go there. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You argued that you were 

exceeding the dismissals on the basis of jurisdiction

MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, that was not our

the Tenth Circuit in Harms--

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, but when you argued 

it below you argued the exception, you didn't argue the 

jurisdictional rule. Are you abandoning that 

distinction? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Our view is that all 

mixed cases go to the district court. That is the view 

of the MSPB and of the EEOC and the regulations --

distinction between procedural and jurisdictional --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually the 7512 

argument has more legs, I think. The point is that 

you're only permitted to go to district court on issues 

of discrimination that are within the Board's 

jurisdiction. So if --

MR. SCHNAPPER: It's somewhat stronger, but 

there are a couple of reasons why we think this 

distinction doesn't make sense. The first one is if

would have an -- a really bizarre problem of -- of 

splitting the claim, and here's why: If, under the EEOC 

regulations which the Government has referred to, if the 

MSPB holds that it didn't have jurisdiction in a mixed 

case, the discrimination claim doesn't die. Under the 

regulations it goes back to the agency, which then 

processes it as a non-mixed case. But the plaintiff is 

still free to challenge the decision of the MSPB that it 

had no jurisdiction. In the Government's view, that 

would go to the Federal circuit. So the case would then 

be pending in two different places. And if the 

plaintiff came to the end of the line in the -- at the 

agency level and lost, the plaintiff clearly would go to 

district court. So the case would then be pending in 

two different places. On our view, everything goes to 

the district court. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree 

with everything that you just said, I can still rule for 

you in this case, right? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: You can, and you don't need 

to address what I just said. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Because there does seem to 

be a good deal of difference between the question, what 

happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and 

alternatively, the question of whether something is a

mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about 

an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB. 

And one could think that questions about what can be 

appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit 

under this statutory language in a way that questions 

that are involved in this case do not. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, you don't need 

to rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify 

another problem before my time runs out. There is --

and it comes up in two ways. Sometimes whether a case 

is appealable depends on whether there was 

discrimination. There is a district court decision in 

Barrow v. Louisiana in which that problem arose. I will 

spare you --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that just makes the 

next case very complicated but it has nothing to do with 

this case; is that correct? 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. But that's why I 

think if you have doubts about it, you should stay away 

from it because that's very bad. In addition, in a 

constructive discharge case based on sexual harassment, 

whether there's jurisdiction, the MSPB in deciding 

whether there is jurisdiction has to decide whether 

there was sexual harassment. It seems to me you would 

not want that going to the Federal circuit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

I would like to start if I could with 

Justice Scalia's -- I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you abandoning the 

jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your 

brief? Are you telling us to rule either completely for 

you or against you? 

MS. HARRINGTON: That's always been our 

position, Justice Sotomayor. Our position has 

consistently been that the only decisions of the MSPB 

that can get review in a district court are decisions on 

the issue of discrimination. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are prepared on 

behalf of the Government to say that if we rule that 

procedural dismissals can go to the district court, then 

you -- then the Government will concede that 

jurisdictional dismissal should as well? 

MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under 7512. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Again, we don't think any 

of them should and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have to reach 

that question in this case, but your brief seemed to 

make the argument that there was no basis for the 

distinction between procedural and jurisdictional. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I agree that there is no 

basis for the distinction and part of that is because, 

as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC 

regulation providing that when the board dismisses a 

case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to 

the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final 

decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district 

court. So if the whole point is to find a way for an 

employee to get into district court on her 

discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care 

of in jurisdictional dismissal cases. So the action 

really here is with procedural dismissals. 

And if -- I would like to start with 

Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there 

has been a repeal of the right to go to district court 

on discrimination claims. And I think our starting 

point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is 

28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB

decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit. This 

court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in 

various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that 

that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of 

jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final 

decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the 

only exception to that is for the subset of final board 

decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2). And if you 

look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board 

decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's 

brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section 

7702. Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase 

judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that 

is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase 

is only ever used either in or in reference to section 

7702. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, does that mean 

that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is 

thrown out on a procedural ground. 

MS. HARRINGTON: It means that it's not a 

judicially reviewable action under 7702. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I 

mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural 

objections all the time and we think of those as 

judicially reviewable. It's -- it's a real stretch to

say simply because it says "judicially reviewable" it 

means judicially reviewable on the merits. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in our view, again, 

because it uses the phrase "judicially reviewable 

action" under 7702 and that phrase "judicially 

reviewable action" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever 

used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our 

view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this 

context. 

So although dismissal on procedural grounds 

is a board action subject to judicial review, in our 

view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702. 

And so you need to look at 7702 to see how --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you say that 

again? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A little more 

slowly. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. A procedural 

dismissal by the board is a final board action that's 

subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's subject 

to judicial review.

that an action subject to judicial review in one section 

is not judicially reviewable in another. That's right?

MS. HARRINGTON: This is going to happen a

thought I heard you to say, and this is what I 

understood your brief to say, that an action that is 

subject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable 

under 7703(b)(2).

MS. HARRINGTON: -- review. 

It's a tough statute. In our view, our 

argument is the best reading of the overall statute. 

And again, because we think "judicially reviewable 

action" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in 

7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase 

"judicially reviewable action" is used by Congress in 

that statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a 

and 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's 

brief. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you a couple 

questions? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the Federal Circuit 

was created, this language preexisted its creation, 

correct? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me how 

when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the 

system that you are advocating when it had no idea that 

it would ever create the Federal Circuit? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I have two answers. 

The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases 

where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl 

and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has

interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it 

exists today directs review of board decisions to the 

Federal Circuit. 

But the second answer is, even for that 

brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the 

Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken 

away jurisdiction from district courts over board 

decisions and had directed them to the courts of 

appeals. And this Court recognized in Fausto that that 

-- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted 

the CSRA. It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction 

in all the district courts throughout the country over 

Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a 

layer of review and direct them to fewer courts. Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That still doesn't 

answer my question, which is: Assuming there is no 

Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists 

in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable 

judicial review, used not in the manner that you're 

describing. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I disagree, Your Honor. 

mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would 

indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB 

final decisions reviewed in district court. And again, 

we don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't

exist today because it does, and that's how this Court 

has construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever 

since the --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Harrington, go back 

to the question that the Chief Justice asked you, 

because the question was: Should we read "judicially 

reviewable action" as something different from action 

subject to judicial review, which is how you would 

normally read that language, as something different from 

just final agency action that you can take to a court. 

Not saying which court, that you can just take to a 

court. 

And you're asking us -- you said it's a term 

of art. So I guess the next question is: How do you 

get the definition of the term of art that you say 

exists in this statute? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you look at 7702, and 

let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's 

a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that 

it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702. 

That's in the text of 7703(b)(2). 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, it has to be an action 

that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a 

certain number of days to take it to a court. So that's 

the normal way you would read that language.

MS. HARRINGTON: But --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But you say no, it really, 

you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not 

other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that 

it's really a switch as to which court you get to take 

the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to 

read this language. 

So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you 

find the definition of the term of art? And I think 

what your answer is going to be is this notion the board 

shall decide the issue of discrimination and the 

applicable action; is that correct. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Can I just take you 

back one sentence to say, the point is not just that 

the board is done, the point is that the board is done 

under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702, 

and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that 

provision Congress specifies various points at which a 

final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially 

reviewable action. 

The one that's relevant in this case is in 

subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of 

the page there. It says: "Any decision of the board 

under paragraph (1)" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- "of this 

subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action,

either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek 

EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case." 

So in our view there are two indications in 

(a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the 

issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially 

reviewable action -- action under section 7702. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't the language 

that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the 

board within 120 days decide both the issue of 

discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the 

board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination 

and the appealable action, not that it must actually 

adjudicate those two issues? 

What if you have a threshold, you have a 

threshold timeliness issue that is completely 

dispositive? You're saying that this language means the 

board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the 

discrimination issue? 

MS. HARRINGTON: No. I'm glad you asked 

that question. The directive in section -- that you're 

referring to is at the bottom of page 8a. The directive 

is that the board shall decide both the issue of 

discrimination and the appealable action in accordance 

with the board's appellate procedures. 

In this case the board complied with that

directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination 

because the appeal was untimely. And I know that sounds 

a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you 

an analogous example. Imagine a State law that directed 

the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in 

accordance -- in accordance with the procedures 

governing such applications. If the DMV required that 

driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit 

to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have 

to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with 

those requirements. In that case the DMV would comply 

with the directive that it issue a license in accordance 

with its procedures by not issuing a license at all. 

And it's the same thing here. Here the 

board complied with the directive that it decide the 

issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate 

procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination 

and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to read it 

that way, do you? I mean, look, it says in (a), it 

says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, 

and then it says "alleges that the basis for the action 

was discrimination," okay. In that case the board shall 

within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination 

and the appealable action. So they decided it. They

They decided da, da, da. 

I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an 

issue that a person raises in court and we don't 

normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court. 

It decided it. It decided it was untimely. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But I think normally when a 

court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't 

think of it as deciding the issue. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, I see. The

I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide 

the merits or you could read it as saying, there could 

be several claims that went on below. Heard them, 

decide the discrimination one. Now, you decide the 

discrimination one. And I agree they used the word 

"issue" instead of saying decide the discrimination 

claim, that it says here, he alleges. They could have 

said, decide the allegation. They could have said, 

decide that part of the case. 

But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 

hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word 

issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a 

new jurisprudence arising.

allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to 

really make out discrimination? It was partial summary 

judgment. It was a dismissal on the basis of the 

statement in the complaint. It was -- I mean, we can 

think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to 

be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, 

jurisdictional or on the merits. 

And why do we want to get courts into that, when 

the simplest thing is the person says, I allege 

discrimination. There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of 

his paper. The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on 

that particular one, and now we go to the district 

court. That's just so simple. 

MS. HARRINGTON: That would certainly be 

simpler. And if it were up to us to make up the rules, 

maybe that's what we would decide. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. All we're 

doing is interpreting what you've said is the word 

issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on 

the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're 

interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he 

has raised that he was discriminated against. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But what we're trying to do 

is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted 

to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's

exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions. 

In our view, its choice of the word issue is 

important, because it's not just deciding the case that 

alleges discrimination. It's the issue of 

discrimination. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3), 

and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the 

direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3), 

another hint that Congress was really talking about 

cases where the board decides the issue of 

discrimination. 

In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a), 

Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action 

becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when 

the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or 

when the EEOC decides not to take the case. 

Now, the only types of decisions from the 

board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach 

an issue of discrimination. And so it would be strange 

to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC 

could review if you're talking about decisions that 

don't involve the issue of discrimination.

just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, 

and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit 

agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, 

that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim 

would never be heard then. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, the plaintiffs 

could then file a suit in district court and seek 

equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file 

from the date of the final agency decision. 

And, in fact, that was one of the 

alternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in 

the district court below in this case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the Plaintiff then 

goes to the district court, then what position does the 

Government take? 

MS. HARRINGTON: It depends on the case. In 

this case, we argued against equitable tolling because, 

in our view, she had missed the deadlines through her 

own fault. But if there was some reason to think that 

it wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for 

appealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the 

MSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault, 

then we might not resist equitable tolling.

Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that 

it didn't go to the Federal circuit?

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Excellent. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even if I accept 

your argument that that's not the same as subject to 

judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get 

to your position? 

This is not something about -- a provision 

about what's judicially reviewable and what's not. It's 

a notice provision. It says these actions have to be 

filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, but some --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then you say 

that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that 

bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence 

about notice. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But it's in a provision 

that's describing the exception to the general rule 

that's set out in 7703. 

So the general rule in 7703 is that when 

you're talking about final board decisions, judicial 

review of those decisions is in the Federal circuit. 

And this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's 

brief. It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2). 

So when you're looking to (b)(2), you're 

wondering -- you're asking what subset of final board 

actions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's

1 their language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final 

2 orders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection 

3 Board fall within (b)(2). 

4  Now, in (b)(2), the only types of final 

orders that are described there is at the end of the 

6 section, judicially reviewable action under section 

7 7702. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, that's 

9 where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way 

to establish that that is the critical element that 

11 tells you which provisions you can take forward when it 

12 just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of 

13 judicial review. 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: Under --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And here the 

16 Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that 

17 does not mean subject to judicial review. Judicially 

18 reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.

the term of art --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: -- part of our argument, and all 

23 you look at is the last two words of that sentence,

decision could be subject to judicial review. 

And the relevant place for this case where 

it did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a. 

And there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that 

the Board decide the issue of discrimination. So it 

says a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially 

reviewable. If a decision does not reach the issue of 

discrimination, it is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As of. See, it 

shall be reviewable action as of. Again, it's just 

going to the timeliness. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But again -- but 

the two time triggers would only come into play if a 

decision reached an issue of discrimination, because the 

EEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on 

jurisdictional or procedural grounds. It can only --

the EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision 

is limited to its review of the board's interpretation 

of an anti-discrimination law or its application of 

those laws to a particular case. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, would you 

agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress 

trying to accomplish this objective? I mean, if 

Congress were really saying we don't want procedural 

determinations to go to the district court, that's a

very easy thing to say. Congress does not need to send 

you -- you know, involve six different cross-references 

and unnatural reading of statutory language. 

And, you know, in the end, your argument 

just is based on this notion that Congress used the word 

decide rather than dispose of in this single provision. 

The argument would completely collapse if that were not 

the case. It just seems like if Congress wanted what 

you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in 

this extremely complicated and backhanded way. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I'm not going to 

resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated. I 

mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they 

have remarked about how it is a complex statutory 

scheme. 

But I think Congress did accomplish in a 

pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing 

that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal 

circuit, and it did that by making that the background 

rule. 

In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final 

decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal 

circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2). 

And then the question is, well, which of those decisions 

fall within (b)(2).

In our view, you should not read that 

exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate 

employees' rights to have their discrimination claims 

determined de novo in district court. 

Here, the board decision, it decided two 

things. First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board 

timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her 

untimeliness. There is no reason to think that Congress 

would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed 

anywhere other than the Federal circuit. The whole 

point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified 

body of law governing certain things in the country that 

Congress really thought should be directed to one place, 

and that included board decisions. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not -- the 

Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these 

statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it 

would have been taken to the various courts of appeals, 

and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Right, but you would have 

had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases 

had continued to go to the district court, which is 

what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and 

Congress specifically wanted to stop that process.

with your opposing counsel's position that once the 

Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination 

claim, the district court reviews both? 

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Alito was 

questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that. 

MS. HARRINGTON: We don't quarrel with it. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the lack of 

uniformity is inherent in this structure. You just want 

to carve out one piece of it that --

MS. HARRINGTON: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you say deserves 

more uniformity. 

MS. HARRINGTON: It is -- it is true that a 

small range of procedural issues governing the board's 

procedures might be heard in district court, but it is 

truly a very small universe of issues bordering on 

non-existent, and let me explain why. As suggested 

here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up 

is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a 

defense of exhaustion. But then generally speaking it 

would have to be a procedural issue that the Government, 

that the agency raised before the board and the board 

rejected. 

Now, the board's own regulations allow the

board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory 

requirements, including timeliness, for good cause. And 

so the Government would have to argue in the district 

court that essentially the board abused its discretion 

by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very 

high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very 

many cases in which that's going to come up, where the 

Government's going to make that kind of argument. So 

although there's -- there's potential, there's a 

potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under 

our view, it is really a small universe of issues that 

could go to district court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything you want 

to say on the question of which is worse? That is to 

say, I get your point on the word "issue," and I think 

you can read the word "issue" to say there is a 

contested point as to whether there was discrimination 

or to say there is a contested point between the parties 

as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a --

has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower --

the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination. 

The latter way favors your opponent, the 

former favors you; okay. So we could do either, I 

guess. 

The one way, if you win, there will be a

body of law about what counts as procedural and what 

doesn't. That sounds confusing to me. If you lose, I 

quite agree with you that there will then be different 

courts deciding different procedural matters, where 

you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit. 

Okay. Do you have anything to say about which of those 

two evils is worse? Is there any reason --

MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Have we any way of knowing? 

MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think Congress 

made the determination. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- going back to the 

language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think 

the language at best might be read, that word "issue," 

the way you say, but need not be. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But I think you can resolve 

the ambiguity in the use of the word "issue" by looking 

at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision 

under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC. I don't 

think there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review 

board decisions that involve an issue of discrimination, 

either an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or 

an application of such a law to the facts of the case.

because to accept your reading is to say that judicially

reviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape 

hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work, 

it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the 

provisions you are relying on do. Under your reading 

both should be given identical meaning, because they 

both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, 

we shouldn't have that absurd result. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But not because --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that if 

you concede that there is an absurd result in applying 

your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition, 

your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, so just to be clear, 

we think the phrase "judicially reviewable action" 

should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it 

is given elsewhere in 7702. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the board --

the escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just 

intended to prevent employees from being held hostage by 

board inaction. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Right, but Justice Sotomayor 

is right, that when you define "judicially reviewable 

action" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes 

nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting 

additional language, by saying, you know, "and other" --

"and other kinds of action." 

MS. HARRINGTON: No, it only becomes 

nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that 

are no longer pending before the board under section 

7702. In our view, once the board issued a decision --

the decision in this case, it issued a decision under 

section 7701 which is the general provision governing 

board decisions, and then the case was no longer pending 

under section 7702. And so it wouldn't make sense to 

apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it wouldn't make 

sense, but it's what the language would command if 

"judicially reviewable action" means what you say 

"judicially reviewable action" means. 

MS. HARRINGTON: It is true that our 

commonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the 

text of the statute. But I think once the -- once the 

50

1 case has been decided under section 7701 on procedural 

2 grounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board. 

3 And so there is just no reason to think that subsection 

4 (e) would apply in the -- in that situation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still have an 

6 exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to 

7 the district court? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we raised that 

9 exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the 

district court. The district court construed this case 

11 as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking 

12 review of the agency's decision. Petitioner did not 

13 challenge that district court holding before the eighth 

14 circuit in her opening brief. She didn't flag that as 

issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although 

16 now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case --

17 this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's 

18 seeking review of the agency decision instead of the 

19 board decision, in our view that's not really a question 

that is presented in -- in the case any longer. In our 

21 view she is seeking review over the board decision, the 

22 board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, 

23 that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness. 

24 There is no indication anywhere in the statute that 

Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision

clearer. The question is which mixed-cases go to the 

district court? Our answer is all. The Government's 

answer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has 

confounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those 

problems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the 

rule in the Government's brief. There are more than 

half a dozen of these problems. 

First, the courts are divided below, as is 

the Government's brief, about whether the Government's 

rule applies to all procedural issues or only to 

procedural issues that arise before the court reaches 

the merits. For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB, 

after the court had resolved the merits, there was a 

dispute about counsel fees and an argument that the 

counsel fee application was untimely. The Government 

took the position that that timeliness issue belonged in 

the district court. 

Secondly, the lower courts are divided as is 

the Government's brief about whether a procedural issue 

that is related to or intertwined with the merits goes 

to the district court or the court of appeals. There is 

a line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB 

holds there is no jurisdiction because the 

discrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural 

jurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue. And if you

look at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air 

Force, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law, 

in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a 

decision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no 

jurisdiction. 

Third, it is unclear what constitutes the 

line between a merits decision and a procedural decision 

issue. Some things are really neither. For example, 

there are recurring disputes about whether a settlement 

was voluntary. Well, it's not the merits of the 

discrimination case, but it's not procedural in any 

normal sense of the word. 

Fourth, there are cases which involve 

several claims resolved on several different bases. We 

noted some of them in our reply brief. One -- one claim 

was rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was 

rejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by 

the board on the merits. It's unclear how that would 

go. 

There are also situations in which two cases 

get filed, one of which -- and they are related cases, 

and they go to the same judge, and one -- one involved 

an MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the 

merits. The court in that case just thought it ought to 

just keep them both. It's not clear how that comes out.

Fourth -- some, sorry, fifth. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Fifth. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Sometimes within the MSPB --

you have the point. I don't mean to belabor. Thank 

you, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I -- I just 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Oh, that was -- I didn't 

mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He was just keeping score. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I 

think -- I think we are at six. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Checking them off. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: The MS -- the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are on number 

five. 

MR. SCHNAPPER: Okay. The -- the -- an 

MSPB, ALJ, or the board itself could resolve a claim on 

alternative grounds, as judges do all the time, and say, 

well, we think this is time barred, but we also find 

that it lacks the merits. I know where that goes. 

There is also a problem, which the briefs 

address, about factual disputes that arise with regard 

to jurisdiction or procedure. The -- 7703(c) says,

"Questions of fact get decided de novo." What does that 

mean? 

If there -- let's take, for example, a case 

in which the claim is that a charge wasn't filed on time 

with the agency. That's a question of fact. The agency 

might find that it was timely -- there could be a 

dispute of fact about when the violation occurred which 

triggers the limitation period. The agency would make a 

finding of fact. The MSPB might affirm that finding. 

The Government tells us they would affirm whatever the 

agency did. The statute seems to say that's got to be 

decided de novo, the Federal circuit can't do that. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
