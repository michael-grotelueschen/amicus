 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Burton versus Stewart.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit 

opinion that first decided the question that's before 

you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting: 

"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the 

maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the 

basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was 

not clear until the Blakely decision itself." The Ninth 

Circuit is simply wrong. In this Court's Apprendi 

decision it laid down precisely that rule. At page 483 

of that decision this Court described the statutory 

maximum concept as, quote, "the maximum a defendant 

would receive if punished according to the facts 

reflected in the jury verdict alone" -- virtually the 

identical language.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, you know, 

assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a

basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get 

to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would 

comment on it at the beginning of the argument. That is 

-- or I'll put it in the form of a question.

 Is the decision which the judge makes here 

to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a 

decision that requires the finding of any fact about the 

commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances 

of those crimes or about the defendant's character?

 Does the judge have to make or does the 

fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any 

of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of 

the defendant?

 MR. FISHER: Yes, he does, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is that fact?

 MR. FISHER: It's precisely the same kind of 

fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself. 

Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the 

statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively 

in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively, 

refers the judge back to the very same provision that 

was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating 

factors provision of Washington, which was formerly 

codified at section 390 and is now codified at section 

400.

JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought the only fact 

that had to be found was that, given the classification 

sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in 

effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless 

there were consecutive sentencing. That's not a fact 

that falls within any of those categories of crime, 

character, or circumstances.

 MR. FISHER: That would be a fact, Justice 

Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law 

works. It is colloquially known as the free crime 

aggravator. But in the Washington Supreme Court 

decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our 

reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that 

to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that 

there was extraordinarily serious culpability or 

extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the 

multiple offenses.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a misnomer to say 

it's a mere free crime criterion? It's free crime plus 

some further fact?

 MR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court's 

decision -- I'm sorry. The Washington Supreme Court 

decision in Hughes clearly lays that out. If you have 

any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work 

in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to

a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that 

considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same 

way that Mr. Burton's was. That is to say, they are run 

consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor. 

That case is called State versus Washington and it was 

just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606. The 

Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a 

sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does 

trigger and violate Blakely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the extra fact then is a 

lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel 

aggravator? I mean, it's comparable to it?

 MR. FISHER: Exactly, it's part of the same 

list. And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that 

extra culpability, which is one of the ways this 

aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of 

element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable 

doubt .

 JUSTICE BREYER: When you say extra 

culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime? 

Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same 

time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping.

 They're all very serious crimes. And if you 

sentence them consecutively, you will take into account 

that there were three. If you sentence them

concurrently, it doesn't matter. The Washington court 

says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or 

rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to 

sentence consecutively if do you more than that. You 

have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special 

kind of kidnapping.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Breyer. 

In section -- the current section is section 589 of 

the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run 

concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of 

exactly the same type the judge is required to find in 

Blakely. And if you look at Blakely itself, remember 

Blakely involved concurrent sentences. And so what Washington 

is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently 

unless there's an extra fact, something about the 

additional crimes that would otherwise be running 

concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above 

and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish 

those crimes separately.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But could the nature of the 

additional crimes themselves satisfy it? In other 

words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might 

be one thing if one were serious and the other two were 

trivial, but all of these three are very serious. Now, 

that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of

discrete fact. Could that value judgment satisfy the 

extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must 

be in addition to free crime.

 MR. FISHER: No, it couldn't, and the 

Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you 

with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an 

aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under 

Blakely itself, there has to be something above and 

beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes 

themselves. It can't simply be -- I'm sorry. It can't 

simply be that there were three crimes committed 

and all three of them are very serious. 

It has to be something about the crime, the additional 

crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary 

commission of that crime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Fisher, even if 

it's true that there are other examples out there that 

might qualify for that example, it's not true of this 

case?

 MR. FISHER: I'm not sure I follow, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In this particular case, 

there was -- it was necessary to make an additional 

finding of fact, even though there may be cases out 

there in which you could get consecutive sentences

without an additional finding of fact?

 MR. FISHER: You're certainly right that in 

this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact. 

There are some situations under the Washington Code and 

I believe in the majority of other States where it is up 

to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences 

concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that 

Justice Souter described. So what Washington does in 

its respondent's brief is it cites these other State 

decisions, from other States that simply have different 

sentencing systems than we have in Washington.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I 

understand that. I mean, we have not held, for example, 

that the fact of a prior conviction is something that 

has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely. Why, if 

you're determining that sentences run consecutively, 

isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous 

conviction and saying they're going to run 

consecutively?

 MR. FISHER: Under some State systems that 

might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice. However, in 

Washington the way that the code works is that judges 

are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences 

shall run consecutively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you'd have --

MR. FISHER: Unless they make the exact kind 

of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same 

statute that was at issue in Blakely itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're saying 

that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a 

conviction for a particular serious crime that's going 

to go unpunished otherwise?

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under this system 

if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder 

and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get 

an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence, 

that would not contravene Blakely. But if you're 

convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those 

two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does 

violate Blakely.

 MR. FISHER: If the judge needs to make an 

extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two 

crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate 

Blakely.

 THE COURT: But we've never held that? 

We've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment 

of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by 

Blakely?

Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive 

sentences. But what you've done is laid down a rule 

from the very State that we're dealing with here that 

says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding 

beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and 

beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of 

guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be 

proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. That's why 

in this case that line, that rule, is triggered.

 The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk 

about any of this. What it said, as I mentioned, is 

that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic 

rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to 

the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever 

the State happened to label as the statutory maximum. 

In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times, 

that the statutory maximum concept was triggered 

according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict. 

And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply 

ignored that language in this Court's opinion.

 Lest there be any doubt about the way that 

concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi 

itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but 

one of effect: Does the required finding take a 

defendant to a higher sentence level than would

otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed 

in the jury verdict?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, there's 

another potential impediment in this case and I would 

like you to comment on it. That is the petition from 

the sentence, it was second in time. There was a prior 

petition that challenged just the conviction, and under 

the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've 

got to get permission from the court of appeals and it 

has to meet stringent criteria.

 How do you get past that? You went out 

concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence 

which is a second petition.

 MR. FISHER: This is the very first petition 

that Mr. Burton has filed against the 1998 judgment. He 

did file earlier a petition against the original 

judgment of 1994. In the joint appendix at page 34, 

that is where that petition is reprinted. He says quite 

clearly that he is challenging the 1994 judgment in that 

petition, whereas here this is his first petition 

against the 1998 judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So did -- then you are 

bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is 

not the sentence. You are saying there's an earlier 

judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a

civil case, if you have a determination of liability, 

that doesn't give you a final judgment. The judgment 

will come at the end of the case when damages are 

determined.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 

And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to 

say that we don't have any judgment at all until the 

sentence is final, then all you get from that is that 

Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed 

and the court could have gotten it dismissed. But we 

submit what you can't do from that is retroactively 

change the first petition that he explicitly told the 

court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told 

the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that 

his sentence was still on direct review. You can't 

retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment 

into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.

 One is that if the State is right, the 

district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that 

1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either, 

because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that 

sentence was still on direct review. But even if you 

get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro 

decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially 

retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that

the petitioner himself said was against one judgment as 

against another.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think there can 

always be two petitions, one -- of sentences on review?

 MR. FISHER: No, there can't, Justice 

Kennedy. And so what should have happened according to 

the state's theory, is that the first petition should, 

should simply have been dismissed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Bit is that also your 

theory?

 MR. FISHER: I think that's -- this Court 

hasn't laid down a solid decision. But I think that's a 

better reading.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you -- are you 

asking us to say that while the sentence is still under 

review, there can be no habeas petition filing?

 MR. FISHER: Am I asking --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that up to the 

option of the petitioner? He can take his chances or he 

can wait.

 MR. FISHER: I think that is a fair 

characterization, Justice Kennedy. But what Mr. Burton 

did is he want to the district court saying I'm 

challenging the 1994 judgment. And as I was saying, 

under Castro before that gets recharacterized --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it is your 

position whether or not he properly can do that?

 MR. FISHER: I don't think so. But I'm just 

recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that 

this Court would decide for itself. But assuming that 

he can't do that, what the district court would have had 

to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge 

the 1994 judgment. And let's assume for the moment he 

could have challenged the 1998 judgment. The district 

judge would have said, "Now Mr. Burton, you're only 

challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment. You 

need to wait until you're ready to challenge your 

sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment." 

Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference 

especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted, 

since he told the district court that he was challenging 

his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at 

that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it 

and wait until I can challenge my sentence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the first proceeding 

was not in fact jurisdictionally barred, then you would 

lose under the second and successive objection in this 

case, right?

 MR. FISHER: I don't know that we would, 

Justice Souter.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?

 MR. FISHER: Because it is a common rule 

that -- this Court hasn't had a case exactly like this, 

but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth 

Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply 

brief is one of them. Where, it is a common practice 

for a petitioner to bring one petition against a 

judgment and then be partially successful, and then 

bring a new petition against something in the new 

judgment. And that's essentially what happened here. 

And it may --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't those cases in which 

the first judgment is complete, he simply does not 

attack everything that was a predicate for the first 

judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial, 

and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility 

arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment 

was not complete.

 MR. FISHER: No, you put your finger on it 

exactly. And so, but we still think that, that, either 

the court had jurisdiction or it didn't. And if it had 

jurisdiction, then it must be -- fall in somehow into 

the category that you're talking about.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not necessarily 

true. Isn't it also possible if, at the time of the

first judgment the judge could have said, well you really 

haven't exhausted your remedies because it is not final 

until the whole thing is over. But nevertheless, 

because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm 

going to go ahead and decide it.

 MR. FISHER: Could a district judge have 

done that?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. FISHER: I think what would have needed 

to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and 

40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm 

still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under 

AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would 

have needed to say, you need either to renounce that 

appeal from the State court or renounce this one. You 

couldn't do both at the same time.

 Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it 

is fair to say, could have gone into district court and 

said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to 

challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no 

intention of challenging my sentence through State court 

proceedings. And perhaps he could have done that. But 

that would be a very different situation than what we 

have here.

question, another angle at this is not simply to look at 

the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we 

submit told a State court in this situation all it would 

have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to 

look behind that and look at the statutes that were in 

play in New Jersey and in Washington. And even if you 

did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a 

district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is, 

would have known that Apprendi applied here.

 What you had in New Jersey was essentially 

two statutes. One that said an ordinary commission of a 

crime is punishable up to 10 years. And a second 

statute that said if you commit that crime with some 

kind of extra -- extra bad circumstance, there a hate 

crime, then you get -- you can get a higher sentence.

 Exactly the same thing was true in 

Washington. We had one statute that said this is what 

the, this is what the punishment is for the ordinary 

commission of this crime. And we had an extra statute 

that said, but if you commit that crime with extra bad

was a list of circumstances, not just a single one --

but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances, 

then you can get extra punishment.

 And the analogy that the respondents want to

draw between the Washington sentencing system and the 

Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think Blakely 

was not a new rule but Booker was?

 MR. FISHER: I think that's fair to say, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Because in Blakely all you needed to 

do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two 

different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold 

for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is 

the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the 

facts in the jury verdict. To decide Booker this Court 

had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to 

a different type of threshold, which was as this Court 

put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment.

 So under -- under the system that this Court 

reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory 

maximum. And then you had to decide whether the 

Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal 

sentencing guidelines. And if there is any confusion on 

that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself 

where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made 

clear that there was unique status of the Federal 

sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult 

question.

 However, here where you didn't have anything

like that, we had just a simple situation where there 

were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime, 

and then an additional maximum for the crime being 

committed with aggravating circumstances. And so it was 

a very clear map line.  And that's what this Court said 

in Blakely, of course. It said, it didn't break any new 

ground in the decision in Blakely. It simply said that, 

took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our 

precedents on this point are clear. And it just simply 

quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum 

for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the 

maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts 

and the jury verdict alone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were decisions 

going the other way.

 MR. FISHER: There were lower court 

decisions?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. FISHER: Yes, there were. And I think, 

if we want to talk about these, it is important first to 

be clear about what we are talking about. There were, 

there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to 

the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its 

sentencing guidelines system could not stand. And then 

you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of

Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a 

couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some 

in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.

 But I think it is very telling, Justice 

Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme --

I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court 

decisions, because none of them -- not a single one --

quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in 

Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of 

effect. And there's several passages in Apprendi that 

said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed 

based on the facts in the jury verdict. So once you 

take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas 

Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion 

that you can reach. The only way those lower courts 

were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to 

pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and 

not acknowledge the rest of the opinion. And of course, 

the rest of the opinion where this Court has these 

passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the 

building blocks of the opinion itself. It is where the 

Court canvasses the historical rule that was 

incorporated into our constitutional system. And so it 

is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or 

loose language that this Court had in its opinion. It

was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.

 And we submit that, in a Teague analysis 

where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a 

reasonable jurist would have found something, not just 

the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable 

jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you 

take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only 

one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come 

to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that doesn't 

make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.

 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think, 

as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the 

dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi 

itself was a bad idea. And that Apprendi really wasn't 

dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. I see 

almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents 

of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law, 

we can distinguish it from the facts in this case. 

There was nothing of that in the dissents.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course you have to show 

that the result was dictated by the prior precedent. 

That's a strong phrase. We said it in Stringer --

Stringer versus Black. But if it has a new application, 

that's -- that's new. Even though the principle is the

same.

 MR. FISHER: I think the Stringer test is 

helpful because there, of course, this Court said that 

one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because 

even though there was a different State sentencing 

system that slightly different before the Court in the 

subsequent case, the principle from the prior case 

dictated only one result. And I think once you go back 

to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say, 

with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in 

Booker, I think again it is telling, because the 

dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a 

possible way to distinguish one case from the other; 

whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't 

have to extend it this far. We can limit to it to true 

statutes and not go this far. So there is a difference.

 Really what this case, I think one way to 

phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether 

when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that 

has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust 

reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a 

certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in 

this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court 

and say I don't know if the Court really means what it 

says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely

dissent.

 We think that, we submit what this Court 

should say is that when we say something is the law, 

that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at 

least until we tell them somehow that the law is 

different.

 If there are no more questions on the new 

rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument. 

Because if for some reason this Court adopted the 

state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly 

formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and 

that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have 

evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be 

considered a watershed exception -- a watershed rule. 

And the reason why is because, is because of an error 

that runs throughout the state's brief.

 And the state's position is basically that 

this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely 

deal with circumstances where a defendant has already 

been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is 

what sentence ought to be imposed. But, of course, that 

-- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and 

Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant 

is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury 

actually found him guilty of. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This argument, this 

argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or 

not it is a new rule.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's right, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have --

don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that 

question?

 MR. FISHER: In the watershed realm?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it 

doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a 

point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters 

whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA 

2254(d)(1) by its terms.

 MR. FISHER: If this Court concluded in the 

Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then 

of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get 

us home here. But as this case comes to the Court, as I 

understand it, this Court is considering this case in a 

posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks 

where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is 

supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a 

threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is 

satisfied. And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned 

the watershed exception itself.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg 

began, with the issue of successive petitions. We 

believe that the petition before this Court is a 

successive petition barred under AEDPA. Now my brother, 

Mr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition 

because the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment. 

But that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts 

of this case.

 A new judgment was entered in March of 1998. 

That judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's 

conviction being affirmed and his sentence being 

reversed. So when he was in custody, when he filed his 

first petition, he was in custody pursuant to that

amended judgment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that is the only 

judgment that could be attacked on habeas?

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. So he 

has an amended judgment filed in March of 1998. He 

files his first petition challenging his conviction 

under that petition. Later, in 2002, he files a second 

petition challenging his sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter --

I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment 

of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.

 MR. COLLINS: He does put that in, Your 

Honor, but I don't think that's determinative. If you 

take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you 

appeal from the judgment of conviction? Answer, yes. 

If you did appeal, answer the following. And it lays 

out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was 

affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new 

judgment is entered in March of 1998.

 He is not in custody pursuant to the 1994 

judgment. He is in custody --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it say a 

new judgment was issued in March of '98?

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, that's in the 

joint appendix at page 3, which shows that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I thought you 

meant it was in his petition.

 MR. COLLINS: No, no, it wasn't in his 

petition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact 

that he was looking back at his conviction, original 

conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down, 

doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was 

the judgment under which he was in custody, because it 

simply wasn't. The original 1994 judgment no longer 

existed because a new judgment had been entered. So 

because -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree 

about in this is which judgment, if the first petition 

went to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the 

second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would 

agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.

 On the other hand, I believe I heard him say 

that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in 

existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998 

judgment. Then he's filed a successive petition with 

regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing 

with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the 

sentence.

 So since it's a successive petition and 

Mr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function 

that AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court

had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that 

this Court does not have jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The fact is, we're looking 

at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the 

first petition that was filed; is that right?

 MR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you look at it and it 

says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you 

said. Then it says date of judgment of conviction, 

December 16, 1994. So looking at that, you'd think that 

is what he was attacking. Where does it say he's 

attacking anything else?

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, it doesn't 

say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with 

that is that when he filed this petition, he was not 

being confined --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I imagine there 

are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal 

system. And I would think that judges when they're 

trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate 

looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking, 

he has to figure that out often for statute of 

limitations purposes, or some other purpose. He'd look 

over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd 

think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,

unless of course there's some indication that it's

 I've never heard of this before. Is there 

any precedent on that where even though the petition 

refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest 

anything other than date A, because it turns out that 

there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being 

held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're 

attacking date B.

 Is there any precedent that says that's how 

it's read?

 MR. COLLINS: I'm not aware of any 

precedent.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. So this might be the 

first time. I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read 

the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the 

judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it 

refers to.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think you 

have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the 

judgment by which he's being confined. I mean, he --

court which have date A, and somebody is going to go

a little nervous about it.  If you're not nervous, 

you're the ones in charge.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it 

your position that, number one, the only judgment that he 

can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the 

time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92 

judgment that follows the resentencing? But he may in 

attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction 

which occurred earlier?

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if he chooses to attack 

only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the 

later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other 

issue. And when he comes in later and tries to raise 

the issue that he could have attacked under the '92 

judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas, 

it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do 

it.

 MR. COLLINS: That's exactly right, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And further, I 

thought you told me that the petition goes on to 

indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the

 Next I would like to go briefly to the 

question that Justice Souter asked about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be sure I 

understand one thing about that? So you're saying at 

the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he 

had already had, the second judgment had already been 

entered by the Washington Supreme Court?

 MR. COLLINS: It had been entered by the 

trial court, Your Honor, so he --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Pursuant to the reversal 

of the --

MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor. That 

sentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the 

joint appendix, that is the second amended judgment 

filed in the superior court in Washington on March 16, 

1998, and he was confined under the authority of this 

judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does it make any less 

sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the 

conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow 

separate appeals to this Court from each of those? And 

once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only 

from final judgment, but you can bring here on 

certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though 

proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think 

we're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there 

the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A fortiori, we have a lot 

more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable 

remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our 

jurisdictional statute under certiorari.

 Why does it make any more sense for habeas 

purposes to insist that he await the final sentence 

before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, 

namely the conviction?

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I'm sorry.

 I think that a couple things are being 

confused here.

this a successive -- is this a successive petition, and 

we would say it is, because he filed the first one and 

then the second one.

 Now the question of whether he can get 

relief under the first -- under his first habeas 

petition does not depend on the entry of a final 

judgment. In fact, under the facts of this case, the 

judgment was entered in March of 1998. In December of 

1998, he filed his first petition. And in fact, the 

first petition was denied in April of 2000 on the 

merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to 

wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and 

because they were ripe, because they -- the factual 

predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that 

was all that was required for him to bring those claims. 

He didn't have to wait for a final judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying he can't 

later bring any claim about the sentence?

 MR. COLLINS: That's because Congress in 

AEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your 

claims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then 

your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless 

you go through the gatekeeping solution.

second and successive requirement comparable to the 

AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put 

would be exactly like this case?

 MR. COLLINS: I believe so, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. COLLINS: So I just briefly want to go, 

Justice Souter, to where you started about the 

consecutive sentence issue.

 We believe that consecutive sentence is 

quite different than, from what exists in Blakely and 

that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings 

of fact. I think you referred to about the crime, about 

the circumstances, about the character. In fact, in 

this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial 

court in order to justify the exceptional sentence --

this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of 

fact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant 

to a standard range sentence on each count run 

concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if 

he had committed only the rape in the first degree. 

This would effectively result in the free crimes 

of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first 

degree because he would receive no additional penalty 

for those crimes. Now --

this. I'm sorry. Is that sufficient, as you understand

me?

 MR. COLLINS: I believe it is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the law was 

that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the 

unless is that the judge makes an additional finding, 

the very same kind of finding that he would make in 

determining aggravating factor.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the sentence could 

have been run consecutively because of an aggravating 

factor. In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in 

fact, had three independent and separate reasons for 

running the sentence consecutively. Two of those would 

be, I think we would say aggravating factors that the 

Blakely reasoning would apply to. But the court of 

appeals when it considered this case only looked at the 

free crimes element to make that decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can give me just 

a little more help on this. The finding number 18 that 

you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing 

him on the basis of the jury verdict he won't get --

he'll get a free pass. But it doesn't say the judge 

can -- could therefore increase the sentence. It seems

to me there had to be additional findings that justify a 

result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of 

justice.

 MR. COLLINS: No, Your Honor. I don't think 

that's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think that just having 

pointed out that he would get a pass would have been 

sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?

 MR. COLLINS: I think it would, and the 

State supreme court affirmed this decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but he did make 

additional findings. It goes on. In fact, 19 and 20 

are additional findings.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think -- I mean, 

I agree with you that he did make additional findings. 

But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It nowhere says they're 

unnecessary either.

 MR. COLLINS: That's true, Your Honor. But 

if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which 

is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the 

court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court 

of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court 

concluded that the multiple offender policy alone 

justified the exceptional sentence. The fact that the

Sentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial 

and compelling reason and justification for imposing the 

exceptional sentence here."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That is to say that that 

would have been sufficient.

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in fact that is not 

what the trial court premised its decision on, because, 

as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings 

19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication 

and planning, and so on. Having been through those 

findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the 

court now makes the following conclusions of law.

 It seems to me as though the trial court was 

basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as 

upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, I think that the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess what I'm saying is 

the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake 

of argument that the trial court might on the basis 

simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced 

consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got, 

because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on

cruelty, sophistication, and so on.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I believe 

that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive 

sentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would 

have been sufficient.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to take you 

up. Let me just have one on the merits, one. I mean, 

the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in 

my dissent. I was trying as hard as I could to show why 

I thought this case was wrong. I start the dissent by 

saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two 

sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that 

increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must 

be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum, 

again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts 

reflected in the jury verdict." Okay.

 Then at the end of the opinion I say: 

"Until now I would have thought the Court might have 

limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't 

cause so much harm." Now, the next sentence of course I 

explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but 

somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I 

guess I couldn't think of it.

 So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I 

didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I

couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi, 

and they read Apprendi to mean what it said. Now, you 

tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't 

think of that would have limited Apprendi?

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

you could have said that the definition of "statutory 

maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was 

at issue in Apprendi. And in fact in the Apprendi 

decision the Court specifically, I think in response to 

Justice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus 

Arizona was still good law. And as you know, in Walton 

the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first 

degree murder, but they could not receive the death 

penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a 

hearing.

 And it seemed to say that the statutory 

maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings 

would not take you above that statutory maximum. I 

think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that overturned in 

Ring?

 MR. COLLINS: It was overturned in Ring, 

Your Honor. But when you had lower court appellate 

judges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing 

the fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it

was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every 

single court did except for Kansas, that the definition 

of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory 

maximum that was in Apprendi.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Was it logical for them to 

conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the 

hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it 

had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in 

Apprendi? It's one thing to say that if you draw no 

further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain 

result. It's another thing to say but maybe they will 

draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they 

will, and hence not apply Apprendi.

 Weren't the other appellate courts to which 

you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call 

the exercise of hope?

 MR. COLLINS: I'm not sure that I would 

agree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think 

Justice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two 

ways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would 

result in upholding guideline systems which are now 

invalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite 

different from Apprendi because those systems involve 

what you would call guided discretion. That is, in 

Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but doesn't that

Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in 

Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a 

jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range 

increases.

 Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust 

your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in 

mind and that they had in mind a distinction which 

simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been 

something new as opposed to merely an application of 

what was implicit in Apprendi?

please the Court:

 If I could begin by addressing the issues 

that you were just talking about, there was a 

distinction that the Court could have drawn between 

Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could 

have drawn and did draw. One was the formal distinction 

that you were discussing before with the State, which 

was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an 

interpretation in her dissent and the majority not 

responding to that, that that distinction was contrary 

to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting 

the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and 

saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference, 

that the Apprendi rule still was important.

 The second -- and in addition to that, that 

distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was 

consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of 

Walton. And you have to look at what reasonable jurists 

could have interpreted looking at that decision at the 

time with those distinctions and what the Court said in 

Apprendi.

 But in addition to that, there was more than 

a formal distinction that could have been drawn between 

the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines 

system. That's the distinction that we proposed in our

amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that 

sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to 

channel but not to eliminate the discretion that 

sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise 

applicable limits. And in the Washington system the 

sentencing judge retained a significant degree of 

discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized 

to traditional sentencing systems that aren't 

constrained by Apprendi.

 The facts, the facts on which the judge 

could rely to go above the guidelines, were not 

specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the 

legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the 

judge himself or herself to determine what facts the 

judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in 

addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher 

sentence. The judge had to look at those facts and make 

the additional determination that those facts rose to 

the level of substantial and compelling reasons that 

justified the higher sentence.

 In that respect, the judge had a degree of 

sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it 

and whether it was in fact justified.

 Now, of course, this Court rejected those 

distinctions in Blakely. But the question is whether a

reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions 

and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could 

have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Roberts, do you 

have a position on whether we have a successive petition 

problem here?

 MR. ROBERTS: We don't have a position on 

that precise, on that particular issue here, because it 

can't arise for Federal prisoners. But let me explain 

why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps 

that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the 

issue. In the Federal system, it's well established 

that the conviction and the sentence are part of a 

unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't 

become final until the conviction and the sentence have 

both been fully adjudicated.

 That understanding is reflected in the 

language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that 

authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners. 

That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is 

motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence. So 

it's clear from that that it's not authorizing 

collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the 

attendant sentence. And I think that could shed some 

guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a

parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for 

Federal prisoners.

 I would also make a point on the other sort 

of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the 

consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact 

that the judge said that the multiple offense policy 

standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence 

here and that the court of appeals relied on that in 

upholding that.

 But the court of appeals went further, 

because petitioner had made a separate challenge to --

and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix. 

Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two 

aggravating factors. Petitioner argued that the 

district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me, 

the trial court couldn't rely on those two other 

aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in 

the original sentencing and this was a resentencing.

 The court of appeals rejected that challenge 

and it rejected that challenge because it said the 

sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense 

policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and 

then on page 53 it said: "The sentencing court did not 

rely on the additional aggravating factors for imposing 

an exceptional sentence." So I think these --

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, that is how --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm mean, I'm sure you're 

reading correctly, but is that in fact true? Because, 

having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having 

spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, 

on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the 

following conclusions of law.

 MR. ROBERTS: The trial court said each of 

the three standing alone was sufficient. But what the 

court of appeals said is these other two have been 

challenged, but these other two are -- we're not going 

to deal with this challenge to these other two 

factors because they're out of the case. So I think 

that this Court has to take the case as coming from --

coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts 

essentially said is those other two are not in the case 

any more.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So we can treat it in 

effect -- and this may be the way to do it -- we can 

treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington 

appellate court and that's what they said?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, what the Washington 

appellate court essentially, they could have said 

petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors

couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the 

standing alone. What they chose to do is, we're going 

to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on 

the one. And that was the basis for responding to that 

claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to 

take this case as coming on that basis.

 If I could turn to the issue of Blakely 

retroactivity for a few minutes. In addition to the 

points that I made before about why Blakely was a new 

rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a 

watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's 

essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if 

they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of 

Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance 

for three reasons. First, the right to counsel 

pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but 

Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the 

punishment of defendants who have already been found 

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a 

crime.

 Second, a felony trial in which the 

defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but 

it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance 

standard to find facts that determine the extent of 

punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use

of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have 

as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by 

Blakely. Those include facts that trigger mandatory 

minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence 

within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which 

a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in 

advisory guideline systems.

 Third, counsel is so essential to a fair 

trial that deprivation of the right can never be 

discounted as harmless error. But this Court held in 

Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in 

reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that 

Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal 

trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for 

determining guilt or innocence.

 That conclusion seems to strongly suggest 

that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair 

trial.

 If the Court has no further questions --

merits. On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right 

that this rarely happens in the Federal system. It 

rarely happens in the State system. We can't find any 

other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the 

State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and 

saying: "I'm challenging this judgment."

 But what happened here was just that. 

Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 

judgment. And under this Court's Castro decision, when 

a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one 

thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it 

can't be converted into something else which is a first 

habeas petition without advising the petitioner. And 

here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but 

the State in its own answer, which we attached to our 

reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 

conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he 

can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.

 So it's way too late in the day for the 

State to stand up to you now and say this pro se 

petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an 

improper petition.

 On the merits, I don't want to elaborate 

beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look 

at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington

decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear 

that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the 

only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly 

too lenient factor. Hughes makes it crystal clear that 

a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, "extraordinarily 

serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple 

offenses." And to the extent that the State stands 

before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's 

case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that 

finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas 

petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge 

needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the 

judge didn't do so.

 Let me finally turn to a discussion about 

whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi 

could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to 

distinguish the system at issue in Blakely. We don't 

think it could because this Court didn't simply say in 

Apprendi that Walton stands. It explicitly said the 

reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand 

it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system 

that is permissible under Williams against New York.

 It's one where on the basis of the jury's 

finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible 

without anything else. And so the only disagreement

between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was 

as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that 

would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the 

majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as 

the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.

 That is exactly the kind of system that was 

not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full 

well realized.

 And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed 

out, once it became clear to this Court the way that 

Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this 

Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule 

and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too. 

And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the 

dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.

 If this Court has no further questions, I'll 

submit the case.
