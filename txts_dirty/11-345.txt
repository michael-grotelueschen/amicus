3  MR. REIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

4 please the Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I get to say 

6 that this is Case Number 11-345, Fisher against the 

7 University of Texas at Austin. And you get to say --

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. REIN: Mr. -- Mr. -- General Suter 

11 trained me too well. 

12  Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court, 

13 and may it please the Court: 

14  The central issue here is whether the 

University of Texas at Austin can carry its burden 

16 approving that its use of race as an admissions-plus 

17 factor in the consequent denial of equal treatment, 

18 which is the central mandate of the Equal Protection 

19 Clause, to Abigail Fisher met the two tests of strict 

scrutiny which are applicable. 

21  First --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rein, before we get 

23 to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on 

24 its own, the question of -- of standing. The injury --

if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas,

1 and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not 

2 have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the 

3 affirmative action program? 

4  MR. REIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the first 

injury that was before the Court was the use of a system 

6 which denied equal treatment. It was a Constitutional 

7 injury, and part of the damage claim was premised 

8 directly on the Constitutional issue. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you get past 

Texas v. Lesage with that injury --

11  MR. REIN: Lesage --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which says that mere 

13 use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for 

14 standing.

 MR. REIN: Lesage was litigated on its 

16 merits, and the question was whether Lesage could carry 

17 his case when -- on summary judgment, when it was 

18 apparent that his complaint, which was that he was 

19 denied access to the graduate program at the University 

of Texas, was not sustainable. 

21  As I said -- and there are several factors 

22 in this case that are quite different. First, there is 

23 a Constitutional injury as such, and the Court has 

24 recognized it.

 Second, the fact premise, she could not have

1 been allowed in under any circumstance, was never tested 

2 below, wasn't raised below. It comes up in a footnote 

3 in --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go to another 

side? She's graduated. 

6  MR. REIN: Correct. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She disclaimed the 

8 desire, after her application, to go to the school at 

9 all. She was permitted to apply for the summer program 

and get in automatically, and she didn't, correct? 

11  MR. REIN: No, that's not correct, 

12 Your Honor. She -- she was not automatically admitted. 

13 She was considered for the summer program and rejected. 

14  You are talking about the CAP program, where 

she could have attended a different university in the 

16 Texas system, and had she been able to achieve --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But she's graduated. 

18  MR. REIN: She has graduated. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Injunctive relief, she's 

not going to get. So what measure of damages will she 

21 get or will she be entitled to? 

22  MR. REIN: Well, that issue, of course, is 

23 bifurcated, and we've reserved the ability to --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to claim an 

injury. So what's the injury --

1  MR. REIN: Well --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you're claiming 

3 that would sustain a claim of damages? 

4  MR. REIN: The -- the denial of her right to 

equal treatment is a Constitutional injury in and of 

6 itself, and we had claimed certain damages on that. 

7 We -- we started the case before it was clear whether 

8 she would or wouldn't be admitted. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't 

answered how Lesage gets away from that --

11  MR. REIN: Well, Lesage --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but if there's a --

13 give me another --

14  MR. REIN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- damages question. 

16  MR. REIN: On the -- if we then, on remand, 

17 were to assert damages contingent upon the fact that she 

18 should have been admitted to UT and was not admitted, we 

19 would then have to prove that, but for the use of race, 

she would be admitted. That's the thrust of Lesage. 

21  Whether we can prove it or can't prove it is 

22 something you can't tell on this record. It's merely 

23 asserted. And I would point out that Texas said below, 

24 there was no way to determine that issue without --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What damages --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: We've had cases involving 

2 alleged discrimination in state -- state contracting. 

3 And we haven't required the person who was discriminated 

4 against because of race to prove that he would have 

gotten the contract otherwise, have we? 

6  MR. REIN: No, sir. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's been enough 

8 that there was a denial of equal protection. 

9  MR. REIN: That is our correct, and that is 

our first premise. And I would say that the same issue 

11 was raised in Bakke. And in Bakke, the contention was 

12 he couldn't have gotten into the medical school; 

13 therefore, he has no case. The Court said, in footnote 

14 14 to Justice Powell's opinion, that's a matter of 

merits; it is not a matter of standing. 

16  I think in -- in Parents Involved, the same 

17 type of contention was made with respect to the 

18 Louisville class plaintiffs, whose son had been admitted 

19 to the school of his choice, and the Court said damages 

are enough to sustain standing. There is a live damages 

21 claim here, and I don't think there is a question of 

22 standing. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Her claim is not 

24 necessarily that she would have been -- would have been 

admitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the

1 admission lottery. Just as when a person is denied 

2 participation in the contracting lottery, he has 

3 suffered an injury. 

4  MR. REIN: Yes, Justice Scalia, I agree with 

that. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: If you are going to the --

7 to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to --

8 or are asking us to overrule Grutter. Grutter said it 

9 would be good law for at least 25 years. And I know 

that time flies, but I think only nine of those years 

11 have passed. 

12  (Laughter.) 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: And so, are you? And, if 

14 so, why overrule a case into which so much thought and 

effort went and so many people across the country have 

16 depended on? 

17  MR. REIN: Justice Breyer, we had said, very 

18 carefully, we were not trying to change the Court's 

19 disposition of the issue in Grutter. Could there be a 

legitimate -- a compelling interest in -- in moving --

21 in using race to establish a diverse class. 

22  What -- the problem that we've encountered 

23 throughout the case is there are varying understandings, 

24 not of the legitimacy of the interest, but how you get 

there; is it necessary to use race to achieve that

1 interest; what does a critical mass --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: So your question is 

3 whether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter? 

4 Is that what you're arguing?

 MR. REIN: We litigated it on that basis,
 

6 yes.
 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how do you want to
 

8 argue it right now in the next ten minutes? I'm
 

9 interested because I have a very short time to get my
 

question out, and I need to know how you are going to 

11 argue it. 

12  MR. REIN: Well, Justice Breyer, our 

13 argument is we can satisfy Grutter if it's properly 

14 read. What we've seen --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you on that 

16 specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution. 

17 Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the 

18 Court now, no 10 percent. This is the exclusive way 

19 that the University is attempting to increase minority 

enrollment. 

21  Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, 

22 under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable? 

23  MR. REIN: Well, I think that there would be 

24 flaws under Grutter, even if you assumed away something 

that can't be assumed away because it is a matter of

1 Texas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program, 

2 and that --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then the -- the 

4 question is can you have both? But it seems to me that 

this program is certainly no more aggressive than the 

6 one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest. 

7  MR. REIN: Well, I don't agree with that, 

8 and let me explain why. 

9  In order to satisfy Grutter, you first have 

to say that you are not just using race gratuitously, 

11 but it is in the interest of producing a critical mass 

12 of otherwise underrepresented students. And so to -- to 

13 be within Grutter framework, the first question is, 

14 absent the use of race, would we be generating a 

critical mass? 

16  To answer that question, you start -- you've 

17 got to examine in context the so-called soft factors 

18 that are in Grutter -- you know, are -- is there an 

19 isolation on campus? Do members of minority feel that 

they cannot speak out? 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The one social studies 

22 that this University did said that minority students, 

23 overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are 

24 feeling isolated. So what do -- why isn't that even 

under your test?

1  We can go back to whether substantial 

2 evidence is adequate, is necessary, or not. Why does 

3 their test fail? 

4  MR. REIN: Well, the survey was -- a random 

survey. It's not reported in any systematic way. They 

6 evidently interviewed students. And it was all about 

7 classroom isolation. It wasn't about --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it -- was it done 

9 before or after they announced the decision to 

reinstitute racial --

11  MR. REIN: It was done after 

12 President Faulkner had made the declaration they were 

13 going to do it. It was done before --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which came almost 

immediately after our decision in Grutter. 

16  MR. REIN: On the -- I believe, on the same 

17 day. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: And by the way, do you 

19 think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's 

question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is 

21 no more affirmative action in higher education after 

22 2028? 

23  MR. REIN: No, I don't. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that the holding of 

Grutter?

Official 

1  MR. REIN: That was -- that was not --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a scary -- that's a 

3 scary --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: I agree it might, but I 

want to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to 

6 pinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to 

7 me, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're 

8 arguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly 

9 understood, as you say that. In looking up, we have a 

two-court rule. 

11  And two courts have found, it seems to me, 

12 that here, there is a certain thing -- there is no 

13 quota. It is individualized. It is time limited. It 

14 was adopted after the consideration of race-neutral 

means. Each applicant receives individual 

16 consideration, and race did not become the predominant 

17 factor. 

18  So I take those as a given. And then I want 

19 to know what precisely it is that Grutter required in 

your opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in 

21 that it was not satisfied here? The ones I listed, two 

22 courts say are the same. So maybe there's some others. 

23  MR. REIN: I'm not sure we agree with those 

24 courts in their method of analysis.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But we have a rule that if 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something
 

2 connected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's
 

3 why I mention that.
 

4  MR. REIN: Well -- and -- particularly in
 

the case of considering alternatives that have worked 

6 about as well, I think that's a legal question this 

7 Court is free to act on. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: There are facts, and there 

are facts, aren't there? 

11  MR. REIN: So if I might try to answer your 

12 question, there was no effort in this case to establish 

13 a -- even a working target for critical mass. They 

14 simply ignored it. They just used words, and they said, 

we've got to do more. So they never answered the 

16 predicate question, which Grutter asks: Absent the use 

17 of race, can we generate a critical mass? 

18  So -- I mean, that's -- that's a flaw we 

19 think is in Grutter. We think it's necessary for this 

Court to restate that principle. Now, whether that --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a normal 

22 fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether 

23 there is -- is or is not a critical mass? 

24  MR. REIN: No. I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a weird kind of a

1 fact. 

2  MR. REIN: And I'm -- I'm not saying --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's an estimation, isn't 

4 it? A judgment?

 MR. REIN: Well, Justice Scalia, that is 

6 correct. And in addition, the courts didn't find 

7 whether a critical mass --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me 

9 what a critical mass was? I'm looking at the number of 

blacks in the University of Texas system. Pre-Grutter, 

11 when the state was indisputably still segregating, it 

12 was 4 percent. Today, under the post-Grutter system, 

13 it's 6 percent. The 2 percent increase is enough for 

14 you, even though the state population is at 12 percent? 

Somehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the 

16 2 percent increase? 

17  MR. REIN: Well, we don't believe that 

18 demographics are the key to underrepresentation of 

19 critical mass.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -- putting aside -- I 

21 don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if 

22 demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat 

23 concerned. But you can't seriously suggest that 

24 demographics aren't a factor to be looked at in 

combination with how isolated or not isolated your

1 student body is actually reporting itself to feel? 

2  MR. REIN: Well, I think, if you start to 

3 split out subgroups of minorities, you mistake, I 

4 think -- what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter, 

or at least ought to be. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might be insulting --

7 it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why don't you 

9 seriously suggest that? Why don't you seriously suggest 

that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the 

11 state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels 

12 isolated, that if you're in a state that is only 

13 1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not 

14 isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?

 MR. REIN: Certainly -- racial balance --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would take that 

17 position because it seems, to me, right. 

18  MR. REIN: Well, Justice Scalia, racial 

19 balancing is not a permissible interest. And we have 

constantly -- this Court has constantly held not a 

21 permissible interest. And that is something we 

22 certainly agree with. 

23  Trying to respond to Justice Sotomayor 

24 and -- and in the framework of Grutter, what you're 

looking at is, do you -- does this person, member of a

Official 

1 so-called underrepresented minority -- it's a concept we 

2 don't necessarily accept, but it's Texas' concept -- are 

3 they isolated? Are they unable to speak out? 

4  And I think we've always said, if you have a 

very large number, as Texas did in 2004, when they 

6 ostensibly made the decision to reinstitute race, they 

7 had a 21 percent admission percentage of what they 

8 called the underrepresented minorities. 

9  They also had about an 18 percent admission 

ratio of Asian Americans. So on campus, you're talking 

11 about -- about 40 percent of the class being minorities. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, but the test is -- the 

13 test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the 

14 opinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass 

is, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out. 

16 That's the test. And that wasn't in Grutter or was in 

17 Grutter? And in your opinion, it was in Grutter? 

18  MR. REIN: Yes. It said expressly in 

19 Grutter --

JUSTICE BREYER: Isolated. And the reason 

21 it was satisfied there and not here is? 

22  MR. REIN: In Grutter, the Court assumed 

23 that the very small number of admissions -- minority 

24 admissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked 

at as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have

1 yielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a 

2 class of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what are you telling 

4 us is the standard of critical mass? At what point does 

a district court or a university know that it doesn't 

6 have to do any more to equalize the desegregation that 

7 has happened in that particular state over decades, that 

8 it's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has 

9 to change its rules. What's that fixed number?

 MR. REIN: We -- it's not our burden to 

11 establish the number. It was the burden of the 

12 University of Texas to determine whether --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they told -- they 

14 told the district court. They took a study of students. 

They analyzed the composition of their classes, and they 

16 determined in their educational judgment that greater 

17 diversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of 

18 their educational program and one that includes 

19 diversifying classes.

 So what more proof do you require? 

21  MR. REIN: Well, if you are allowed to state 

22 all the grounds that need to be proved, you will always 

23 prove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor. 

24  The question is, they have --

1 in the evidence, what more do you think they needed? I 

2 think I hear all you saying in your brief is the 

3 number's fixed now, they got enough, no more is 

4 necessary.

 MR. REIN: What we're saying in the brief 

6 was they were generating, in fact, a very substantial 

7 number of minority presence on campus. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's enough now. 

9  MR. REIN: And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what you're 

11 saying? 

12  MR. REIN: No. And that immediately thrust 

13 upon them the responsibility, if they wanted to -- you 

14 know, essentially move away from equal treatment, they 

had to establish, we have a purpose, we are trying to 

16 generate a critical mass of minorities that otherwise 

17 could not be achieved. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me -- all right. 

19 Tell me what about their use of race did not fit the 

narrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've 

21 defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter 

22 required? How is race used by them in a way that 

23 violated the terms of Grutter? 

24  MR. REIN: And for this purpose --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming that the need

1 is there. I know you're challenging the need. 

2  MR. REIN: Well, put -- put aside whether 

3 this was necessary and whether it was an appropriate 

4 last resort in -- in a quest for diversity and critical 

mass because Grutter's not without limits. But I'll put 

6 that aside, and let me come directly to your question. 

7  First of all, if you think about narrow 

8 tailoring, you can't tailor to the unknown. If you have 

9 no range of evaluation, if you have no understanding of 

what critical mass means, you can't tailor to it. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have to set a 

12 quota for critical mass? 

13  MR. REIN: No. There's -- there's a huge 

14 difference, and it's an important one that is not well 

put out by the University of Texas. Having a range, a 

16 view as to what would be an appropriate level of 

17 comfort, critical mass, as defined in Grutter, allows 

18 you to evaluate where you are --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we won't call it a 

quota, we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you 

21 shouldn't have. 

22  MR. REIN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think 

23 it's very important to distinguish between the operative 

24 use of that range. In other words, that's where we are, 

and we're going to use race until we get there, every

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Boy, it sounds awfully 

4 like a quota to me, that Grutter said you should not be 

doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you 

6 shouldn't be setting quotas. You should be setting an 

7 individualized assessment of the applicants. 

8  Tell me how this system doesn't do that. 

9  MR. REIN: This system doesn't -- I mean, 

it's not narrowly tailored because it doesn't fit. 

11 There are certain forms of Grutter that it follows. 

12 It --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Rein, do you understand 

14 what the University of Texas thinks is the definition of 

a critical mass? Because I don't. 

16  MR. REIN: I -- well, it simply reiterated 

17 the language of Grutter. They have no definition. They 

18 can't fit --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Rein, it seems 

to me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are 

21 relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough. They 

22 don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so 

23 they don't need any more. And I tried to get you 

24 rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan. This 

is the entire plan.

1  MR. REIN: Well, let me tell you that, if 

2 you look outside the top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI 

3 admits only -- forget the top 10 for a minute, they were 

4 generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions 

outside the top 10, which is in -- above what the target 

6 was in Grutter. So this is not Grutter on its facts. 

7 It's vastly different. This is a --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because of the 

9 10 percent.

 MR. REIN: No, it was -- I'm talking about 

11 only the non-top 10 percent admissions. 15 percent of 

12 those were so-called underrepresented minorities. This 

13 is without the top 10. Now, the top 10 is also a major 

14 generator of admissions for underrepresented minorities.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this was -- and this 

16 was before the adoption of the plan. 

17  MR. REIN: That is correct. Those are the 

18 numbers --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. 

Now, I'm confused. I thought the 15 percent figure was 

21 the one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan. 

22  MR. REIN: No. With the 10 percent plan, 

23 it's much higher. In 2004, it was 21 percent for just 

24 Hispanics and African Americans, and these are the 

categories they used. If you add in Asians, it was over

1 38 percent. 

2  But I'm isolating -- in response to Justice 

3 Ginsburg, I'm isolating to the non-top 10 admissions. 

4 Those are over 15 percent in that year, and they average 

very close to that over time. 

6  So the -- the total generation of minority 

7 presence is a combination of the two in fact, but the 

8 AI/PAI system -- which was adopted in response to 

9 Hopwood, it was -- as Texas says, it was the first thing 

they tried to accommodate to their loss of the ability 

11 to use race directly, which came up in Hopwood. 

12  So that was their first response, to look at 

13 a more balanced admission program between Academic Index 

14 and Personal Achievement Index. So it is not a system 

which just excludes minorities. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on 

17 this -- and then I hope we can get back to 

18 Justice Alito's question. 

19  You argue that the University's 

race-conscious admission plan is not necessary to 

21 achieve a diverse student body because it admits so few 

22 people -- so few minorities. And I had trouble with 

23 that, reading the brief. I said, well, if it's so few, 

24 then what's the problem?

 MR. REIN: Well, it's a question --

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then -- let's assume --

2  MR. REIN: Excuse me, Justice. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that it resulted in the 

4 admission of many minorities. Then you'd come back and 

say, oh, well, this is -- this shows that we -- we were 

6 probably wrongly excluded. I --

7  MR. REIN: Well --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see an inconsistency 

9 here.

 MR. REIN: Well --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- are you saying 

12 that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, 

13 generally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the 

14 point?

 MR. REIN: Well, yes, that's part of it. 

16 The second is the question of reasonably available 

17 alternatives. If we take Texas at its word, and it says 

18 they are satisfied, they are happy going on with the way 

19 they apply race today, we tried to measure, well, what 

difference is it making? And could you achieve the same 

21 thing with a reasonably available race-neutral 

22 alternative? 

23  That's a question that was asked in Grutter. 

24 They were supposed to analyze that. They didn't look at 

it. But it --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is the -- the
 

2 race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?
 

3  MR. REIN: The race-neutral alternative
 

4 includes an extension of the 10 percent plan because
 

it's a major generator of minority admissions. And 

6 right now, that ranges at 30. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say, and that's 

8 okay because it's -- it's race-neutral. But is it 

9 really? The -- the only reason that they instituted the 

10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment. 

11  MR. REIN: Well, we say --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it -- and that -- the 

13 only way it works is if you have heavily separated 

14 schools. And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you 

want to go to the University of Texas under the 

16 10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school, 

17 you don't take challenging courses, because that's how 

18 you'll get into the 10 percent. 

19  So maybe the University is concerned that 

that is an inadequate way to deal with it. 

21  MR. REIN: But, Justice Ginsburg, let -- let 

22 me say that -- that a lot of that is speculative. There 

23 is nothing in the record to support it. We don't know. 

24 They've never surveyed the top 10 admits, the minority 

admits, to see, well, did you --

4  MR. REIN: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to say this -- this is 

6 not good for education because people will take easy 

7 courses. It's imposed by state law, isn't it? 

8  MR. REIN: Correct. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Anybody who is in the top 

10 percent of any school in the state gets into the 

11 University of Texas. 

12  MR. REIN: Yes. And even the Fifth Circuit 

13 said you can't disregard its consequences because it's a 

14 matter of law. I'm simply saying they could choose to 

extend it beyond where it is because it's capped today 

16 at 75 percent. 

17  But that's not the only option. That's not 

18 the only alternative. And -- and certainly, one simple 

19 alternative is they could look at the yield, that is, 

what percentage of the admitted minorities are they 

21 actually encouraging and -- and enrolling. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Or they could -- this is 

23 what is underlying my thing here. I want to get you 

24 directly to answer it. I did look up the figures. And 

before Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the

1 African American side, that it averaged about 5 --

2 5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily. 

3  Then after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went 

4 down a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about 

3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe.  And then they 

6 introduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent. 

7  MR. REIN: No --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, is that a lot? 

9 Is that a little? There are several thousand admissions 

officers in the United States, several thousand 

11 universities, and what is it we're going to say here 

12 that wasn't already said in Grutter, that isn't going to 

13 take hundreds or thousands of these people and have 

14 Federal judges dictating the policy of admission of all 

these universities? You see why I'm looking for some 

16 certainty? 

17  MR. REIN: Well, Justice --

19 saw the numbers.

 Sorry. Go ahead.

2  MR. REIN: No, I am perfectly happy to -- to

4  I think that the increase in 

African American admissions that you're looking at was 

6 pre-Grutter. It -- it was generated before 2004. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 

8  MR. REIN: So I just want to make clear the 

9 record doesn't depend -- they don't depend on race to do 

it. It's minimal change with the use of race. And 

11 that's why we say there is an alternative, which would 

12 serve it about as well in increasing yield or, indeed, 

13 in reweighting the -- the PAI, which is a critical 

14 element here, so that you put more emphasis on the 

socioeconomic factors and less emphasis on the essays, 

16 which are an academic measure within the PAI. 

17  So there are lots that they could do --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now, we're going to 

19 tell the universities how to run and how to weigh 

qualifications, too? 

21  MR. REIN: It's not the job of the Court to 

22 tell them how to do it. It's their job to examine the 

23 alternatives available to them and see if they couldn't 

24 achieve the same thing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me,

1 again, how race and their use of race overwhelms those 

2 other factors in their system as it's created? 

3  MR. REIN: I -- the question is not whether 

4 it overwhelms them. They're -- but they -- they say --

they admit, it is effective. There are admissions that 

6 would not have taken place, but for; somebody else would 

7 have had that place, but for the use of race. 

8  And I think, Justice Kennedy, just to answer 

9 your question fully, you have to analyze race-neutral 

alternatives. And if you look at Parents Involved, 

11 that -- that was the critical question. The out -- the 

12 outcomes were so small, that there were readily 

13 available alternatives. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps you could 

summarize by saying -- by telling us, from your point of 

16 view, this plan fails strict scrutiny on one or two or 

17 both levels, A, because the objective is inappropriate 

18 or ill-defined, and, B, because of the implementation is 

19 defective. Which or both of those are you arguing?

 MR. REIN: We have argued both, and we 

21 continue to argue both. It is not a necessary --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in what respect does 

23 this plan fail strict scrutiny under either of those --

24 under both of those categories?

 MR. REIN: Okay. Under the category -- the

1 first category, was it a necessary means of pursuing a 

2 compelling interest, we don't believe they've shown any 

3 necessity for doing what they were doing. And 

4 certainly, it -- race should have been a last resort. 

It was a first resort. That's, in a nutshell, that 

6 prong of it. And in order -- and they failed in every 

7 respect. 

8  If you go to narrow tailoring, what we are 

9 saying is they didn't consider alternatives, and their 

treatment of, as we have pointed out, Asian Americans 

11 and Hispanics makes a -- an incomprehensible 

12 distinction. They say, we don't worry about Asians, 

13 there are a lot of Asians, it's a demographic measure, 

14 which is a forbidden measure.

 They are in excess of their share of the 

16 Texas population. But if you are trying to find 

17 individual comfort levels, if you are breaking it down 

18 between African Americans and -- and Hispanics, the --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you are the one 

who, in your brief, has assumed that they are valuing 

21 different races differently. But Asian numbers have 

22 gone up, under however they have structured this PAI. 

23 And as I understand their position, race is balanced 

24 against other issues like socioeconomics, the strength 

of the classes people took. It's never a standalone.

1  So even a white student, I presume, who goes 

2 to an -- an entirely black or an entirely Latino school, 

3 who becomes class president, would get some points 

4 because he has or she has proven that they foster or can 

deal in a diverse environment. That's how I understood 

6 their plan, that it's not just giving you a plus because 

7 of race. It's combining that with other factors. 

8  MR. REIN: There is a plus because of race. 

9 There are many other factors in the decision. And might 

I say that this -- the white student president of the 

11 class in an ethnically different school is a measure of 

12 leadership. 

13  Leadership is an independent factor in the 

14 PAI. It isn't -- he is not getting that point because 

he's -- because of his race; he's getting that point 

16 because of his leadership. That's a race-neutral 

17 criteria could work for anybody. 

18  So race is an independent add-on. It -- it 

19 is something they can use to boost the PAI score, the 

PAS element in any way they like, because they say they 

21 contextualize it. And we've said it's not necessary, 

22 it's not narrowly tailored, it ignores available 

23 alternatives, it treats -- gives disparate treatment to 

24 Asian Americans because they are minorities as well.

 And to the extent it depends on the

14  MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

16  For two overriding reasons, the -- the 

17 admissions plan before you is Constitutional under this 

18 Court's precedents. First, it is indistinguishable in 

19 terms of how it operates in taking race into account as 

only one modest factor among many for the individualized 

21 considerations of applicants in their totality from 

22 plans that this Court has upheld in Grutter and plans 

23 that this Court approved in Bakke and the Harvard

1 narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored 

2 the way Grutter did -- said, not the necessity prong and 

3 not the need prong -- not the necessity prong. I think 

4 most of his argument has been centered on that, so --

MR. GARRE: That's right. And so that's the 

6 second point I was going to make, which is that the 

7 holistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary 

8 counterpart to the state's top 10 percent Law and works 

9 to systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of 

that law in achieving an interest that is indisputably 

11 compelling, the university's interest in assembling a 

12 broadly diverse student body. 

13  In the interest --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before -- I 

need to figure out exactly what these numbers mean. 

16 Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the 

17 Hispanic box or some different box? 

18  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, there is a 

19 multiracial box. Students check boxes based on their 

own determination. Now, this is true under the Common 

21 Application --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose a 

23 person who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own

Hispanic.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, that was -- they --

6 they would make that self-determination, Your Honor. 

7 If -- if anyone, in any part of the application, 

8 violated some honor code then that could come out --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it violate the 

honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and 

11 says, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box? 

12  MR. GARRE: I don't think -- I don't think 

13 it would, Your Honor. I don't think that that issue 

14 would be any different than the plan upheld in Grutter 

or the Harvard plan or in Bakke --

17 any way, the racial identification? 

18  MR. GARRE: We do not, Your Honor, and no 

19 college in America, the Ivy Leagues, the Little Ivy 

Leagues, that I'm aware of.

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have to 

7 self-identify? 

8  MR. GARRE: They do not, Your Honor. Every 

9 year people do not, and many of those applicants are 

admitted. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And how do they decide? 

12 You know, it's -- they want not just a critical mass in 

13 the school at large, but class by class? How do they 

14 figure out that particular classes don't have enough? 

What -- are they -- somebody walks in the room and looks 

16 them over to see who looks -- who looks Asian, who looks 

17 black, who looks Hispanic? Is that -- is that how it's 

18 done? 

19  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and let me try 

to be clear on this. The university has never asserted 

21 a compelling interest in any specific diversity in every 

22 single classroom. It has simply looked to classroom 

23 diversity as one dimension of student body diversity.

3 individual classroom diversity or not? And if so, how 

4 do they decide when classes are diverse?

 MR. GARRE: This Court in Grutter, Your 

6 Honor -- and maybe the most important thing that was 

7 said during the first 30 minutes is, when given an 

8 opportunity to challenge Grutter, I understood my friend 

9 not to ask this Court to overrule it.

 This Court in Grutter recognized the obvious 

11 fact that the classroom is one of the most important 

12 environments where the educational benefits of diversity 

13 are realized. And so the University of Texas, in 

14 determining whether or not it had reached a critical 

mass, looked to the classroom, along with --

17 did they look to the classroom? 

18  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --

require everybody to check a box or they have somebody 

21 figure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic, and 

22 that's enough?

are taking its classes. And one can then, if you want 

16 to gauge diversity in the classrooms, go back --

3 I do want to be clear on this classroom diversity study. 

4 This was only one of many information points that the 

university looked to. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the classroom 

7 diversity, how does the non-top 10 percent part of the 

8 plan further classroom diversity? My understanding is 

9 that the university had over 5,000 classes that 

qualified as small, and the total number of African 

11 Americans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part 

12 of the plan that is challenged was just a little over 

13 200. 

14  So how does that -- how does that -- how can 

that possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to 

16 increase classroom diversity? 

17  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, first, I think 

18 that 200 number is erroneous. There have been many more 

19 minority candidates in --

JUSTICE ALITO: Per class? 

21  MR. GARRE: No, not -- not on a per-class 

22 basis.

6 specifically at that determination. What we did -- in 

7 other words, to try to find whether there were holistic 

8 admits or percentage admits, we did conclude in 2004 --

9 and, again, this was before -- we did the classroom 

study before the plan at issue was adopted, and at that 

11 time, there were no holistic admits taking race into 

12 account.

3  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, at the time --

4  JUSTICE ALITO: And what is the value of C 

per class? 

6  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't know the 

7 answer to that question, and let me try to explain why 

8 the university didn't look specifically at -- to that. 

9 Because at the time that the classroom diversity study 

was conducted, it was before the holistic admissions 

11 process at issue here was adopted in 2003-2004. 

12  And so that determination wouldn't have been 

13 as important as just finding out are African Americans 

14 or Hispanics, underrepresented minorities, present at 

the university in such numbers that we are not 

16 experiencing racial -- racial isolation in the 

17 classroom. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is that number? 

19 What is the critical mass of African Americans and 

Hispanics at the university that you are working toward? 

21  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, we don't have one. 

22 And -- and this Court in Grutter --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how are we 

24 supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored 

to that goal?

1  MR. GARRE: To look to the same criteria of 

2 this Court in Grutter. This Court in Grutter 

3 specifically rejected the notion that you could come up 

4 with a fixed percentage. Now --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does critical mass vary from 

6 -- from group to group? Does it vary from state to 

7 state? 

8  MR. GARRE: It certainly is contextual. I 

9 think it could vary, Your Honor. I think -- let me 

first say that my friends have -- throughout this 

11 litigation, not in this Court, asserted 20 percent as a 

12 critical mass, and that's lumping together different 

13 minority groups. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: No. But could you answer my 

question? What does the University of Texas -- the 

16 University of Texas think about those questions? 

17  MR. GARRE: We --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Is the critical mass for the 

19 University of Texas dependent on the breakdown of the 

population of Texas? 

21  MR. GARRE: No, it's not at all. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: It's not. 

23  MR. GARRE: It's not at all. It's looking 

24 to -- to the educational benefits of diversity on 

campus, and I think we actually agree on what that means

1 and what Grutter said it meant, in terms of --

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, could you 

3 explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what 

4 seems to me the critical question in this case: Why 

didn't the 10 percent solution suffice? There were a 

6 substantial number of minority members admitted as a 

7 result of the 10 percent solution. Why wasn't that 

8 enough to achieve diversity? 

9  MR. GARRE: Well, let me make a couple of 

points, Your Honor. First, if you just looked at the 

11 numbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you 

12 looked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity 

13 among these groups at the University of Texas had 

14 remained stagnant or worse. 2002, African American 

enrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent. That's 

16 one part of it. 

17  The other part of it is, if you look at the 

18 admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the --

19 the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high 

school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper, 

21 but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces 

22 educational benefits on campus. And that's one of the 

23 considerations that the university took into account as 

24 well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.

Official 

1 Why? Why -- why doesn't it? 

2  MR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, as is true 

3 for any group -- and the Harvard plan that this Court 

4 approved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you 

would want representatives and different viewpoints from 

6 individuals within the same -- the same racial group, 

7 just as you would from individuals outside of that. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: What kind of viewpoints? I 

9 mean, are they political viewpoints?

 MR. GARRE: Well, anyone's experiences, 

11 where they grew up, the situations that they -- that 

12 they experience in their lives are going to affect their 

13 viewpoints. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this has nothing to 

do with, with racial diversity. I mean, you're talking 

16 about something else. 

17  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think it directly 

18 impacts the educational benefits of diversity in this 

19 sense, that the minority candidate who has shown that --

that he or she has succeeded in an integrated 

21 environment, has shown leadership, community service, 

22 the other factors that we looked at in holistic review, 

23 is precisely the kind of candidate that's going to 

24 come -- come on campus, help to break down racial 

barriers, work across racial lines, dispel --

1 stereotypes --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Also, the kind that is 

3 likely to be included within the 10 percent rule. And, 

4 incidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule 

adopted? 

6  MR. GARRE: 1998, Your Honor. 

7  But, but with respect to your -- your 

8 factual point, that's absolutely wrong, Your Honor. If 

9 you look at the admissions data that we cite on page 34 

of our brief, it shows the breakdown of applicants under 

11 the holistic plan and the percentage plan. 

12  And I don't think it's been seriously 

13 disputed in this -- this case to this point that, 

14 although the percentage plan certainly helps with 

minority admissions, by and large, the -- the minorities 

16 who are admitted tend to come from segregated, 

17 racially-identifiable schools. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought that the 

19 whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students 

who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make 

21 a very different argument that I don't think I've ever 

22 seen before. 

23  The top 10 percent plan admits lots of 

24 African Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number 

of African Americans. But you say, well, it's -- it's

1 faulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans 

2 and Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds. And 

3 you specifically have the example of the child of 

4 successful professionals in Dallas.

 Now, that's your -- that's your argument? 

6 If you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are 

7 -- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your 

8 law firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another 

9 corporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in 

the top 

11 1 percent of earners in the country, and they have --

12 parents both have graduate degrees. 

13  They deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an 

14 Asian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely 

average in terms of education and income? 

16  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. And let me --

17 let me answer the question. First of all, the example 

18 comes almost word for word from the Harvard plan that 

19 this Court approved in Grutter and that Justice Powell 

held out in Bakke. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can the answer to 

22 that question be no, because being an African American 

23 or being a Hispanic is a plus factor. 

24  MR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, our point 

is, is that we want minorities from different

1 backgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities 

2 from disadvantaged backgrounds. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So what you're saying is 

4 that what counts is race above all?

 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, what counts is 

6 different experiences --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the 

8 necessary -- that's the necessary response to 

9 Justice Alito's question.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, what we want 

11 is different experiences that are going to -- that are 

12 going to come on campus --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want underprivileged 

14 of a certain race and privileged of a certain race. So 

that's race. 

16  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honors, it's -- it's 

17 not race. It's just the opposite. I mean, in the LUAC 

18 decision, for example, this Court said that failing to 

19 take into account differences among members of the same 

race does a disservice --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the reason 

22 you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of 

23 that race who are privileged can be representative, and 

24 that's race. I just --

background or perspective, you would want people from
 

6 different perspectives.
 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

8  MR. GARRE: And that's -- that's the
 

9 interests that we're discussing here. It's the
 

interests that -- that the Harvard plan specifically 

11 adopts and lays out --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand my job, 

13 under our precedents, to determine if your use of race 

14 is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest. The 

compelling interest you identify is attaining a critical 

16 mass of minority students at the University of Texas, 

17 but you won't tell me what the critical mass is. How am 

18 I supposed to do the job that our precedents say I 

19 should do?

21 Court's precedents say is a critical mass is an 

22 environment in which students of underrepresented --

4 is the logical end point? When will I know that you've 

reached a critical mass? 

6  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, this question, of 

7 course, implicates Grutter itself. And, again, I 

8 understood my friend not to challenge that. They 

9 haven't challenged that diversity is a compelling 

interest at all. 

11  What -- what we look to, and we think that 

12 courts can review this determination, one, we look to 

13 feedback directly from students about racial isolation 

14 that they experience. Do they feel like spokespersons 

for their race.

17 conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially 

18 isolated?

looked at. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's the basis

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. What are the

1 others? 

2  MR. GARRE: Another is that we did look to 

3 enrollment data, which showed, for example, among 

4 African Americans, that African American enrollment at 

the University of Texas dropped to 3 percent in 2002 

6 under the percentage plan. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At what level will 

8 it satisfy the critical mass? 

9  MR. GARRE: Well, I think we all agree that 

3 percent is not a critical mass. It's -- it's well 

11 beyond that. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but at what 

13 level will it satisfy the requirement of critical mass? 

14  MR. GARRE: When we have an environment in 

which African Americans do not --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When -- how am I 

17 supposed to decide whether you have an environment 

18 within particular minorities who don't feel isolated? 

19  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, part of this is a --

is a judgment that the admin -- the educators are going 

21 to make, but you would look to the same criteria --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I say -- when 

23 you tell me, that's good enough. 

24  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, not at all. You 

would look to the criteria that we looked at, the -- the

1 enrollment data, the feedback from the students. We 

2 also took into account diversity in the classroom. We 

3 took into account the racial climate on campus. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: But would 3 percent be 

enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the 

6 African American population is around 2 percent? 

7  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't think it 

8 would. I mean, our concept to critical mass isn't tied 

9 to demographic. It's undisputed in this case that we 

are not pursuing any demographic goal. That's on page 

11 138 of the Joint Appendix. 

12  All of -- I think many key facts are 

13 undisputed here. It's undisputed that race is only a 

14 modest factor. It's undisputed that we're taking race 

into account only to consider individuals in their 

16 totality. This is a --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, I think that 

18 the issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what 

19 point and when do we stop deferring to the University's 

judgment that race is still necessary? That's the 

21 bottom line of this case. And you're saying, and I 

22 think rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a 

23 quota, because that's what our cases say you can't do. 

24  So if we're not going to set a quota, what 

do you think is the standard we apply to make a

25

Official 

1 judgment? 

2  MR. GARRE: I think the standard you would 

3 apply is the one set forth in Grutter, and it comes from 

4 Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, that you would look 

to whether or not the University reached an environment 

6 in which members of underrepresented minorities, African 

7 Americans and Hispanics, do not feel like spokespersons 

8 for their race, members -- an environment where 

9 cross-racial understanding is promoted, an environment 

where the benefit -- educational benefits of diversity 

11 are realized. 

12  And the reason why the University of Texas 

13 concluded that that environment was not met here, it 

14 laid out in several different information points that 

this Court can review and --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that -- that 

17 holds for only -- only another what, 16 years, right? 

18 Sixteen more years, and you're going to call it all off. 

19  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, we don't read 

Grutter as establishing that kind of time clock. We are 

21 looking at this --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're appealing to 

23 Grutter, and that's what it said.

11  MR. GARRE: Well, I don't know that I've 

12 disagreed with anything it said. It --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, before your 

14 time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you 

to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, 

16 that the gain is just too small to warrant using a 

17 racial criteria. 

18  MR. GARRE: Your Honor --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Once you have the 

10 percent, you don't need more. So how do you answer 

21 the argument of the gain is too small? 

22  MR. GARRE: First I'd point to my friend's 

23 own concessions, that the consideration of race has 

24 increased racial diversity at Hispanic and helps with 

minority enrollment. That's on page 138 of the Joint

2  Secondly, I'd point to the fact that African 

3 American and Hispanics' admissions did increase. 

4 African American admissions doubled from the period of 

2002 and 2004. So this has had a real important impact 

6 on diversity at the University of Texas. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in terms of diversity, 

8 how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans? 

9 Do you think -- do you have a critical mass of Filipino 

Americans? 

11  MR. GARRE: Your Honor --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Cambodian Americans --

13 Cambodian Americans? 

14  MR. GARRE: -- the common form that's used 

has Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form 

16 that says country of origin where that can be spelled 

17 out. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: And do you have a critical 

19 mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this 

enormous group of Asian Americans? 

21  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, we've looked to 

22 whether or not we have a critical mass of 

23 underrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the

1 pages 415 and 416 of the Joint Appendix, where it makes 

2 clear that Ms. Fisher would not have been admitted to 

3 the fall 2008 class at University of Texas no matter 

4 what her race, because her --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear, 

6 are you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an 

7 Article III sense? 

8  MR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. And I think --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You address that in 

your brief in one footnote, right? We have an 

11 obligation to consider it in every case, and what you 

12 gave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to 

13 see how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction. 

14  MR. GARRE: And there is another part of 

that that comes from the brief in opposition, Your 

16 Honor, which goes to the relief that she has requested. 

17 The declaratory and injunctive release -- relief that 

18 this case began with, that request has fallen out, and 

19 that's undisputed. So the only thing that is live in 

this case is a request for monetary damages. That 

21 request is on page 79 of the Joint Appendix, and it's 

22 focused exclusively on a request for the return of 

23 admissions fees. And the reason why that is not enough 

24 to confer standing is that she would have paid the 

admissions fee no matter what policy the university

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

3 about our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to 

4 be forced to be part of a process in which there is 

race-conscious evaluation?
 

6  MR. GARRE: Texas v. Lesage says that
 

7 that -- that injury is not sufficient in a
 

8 backward-looking case like this, where you only have
 

9 monetary damages. In Jacksonville and all the other
 

cases, they involved forward-looking claims for 

11 declaratory injunctive reliefs where people who were 

12 going to go out and get contracts again. So Texas --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

14 friend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues 

and damages issues had been segregated out of the 

16 process and are still available for remand. 

17  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, that is not an 

18 answer to jurisdiction for this reason: It's true that 

19 it is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove 

damages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only 

21 request for monetary damages is a request for admissions 

22 fees. That -- it says that explicitly. And this Court 

23 has said that relief that does not remedy the injury 

24 suffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into Federal 

court. That is the very essence of the redressability

7 an admissions fee for a process in which she was not

9  MR. GARRE: And the reason why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't she get her 

11 money back? 

12  MR. GARRE: The reason why the payment of 

13 that fee doesn't redress the injury, Your Honor, is that 

14 she would have paid it even if Texas didn't consider 

race at all; and, therefore, the payment of the 

16 application fee back doesn't remedy the injury that she

9 Ivy Leagues that have filed amicus briefs are using it. 

And this Court recognized in Grutter that the best 

11 universities, many of the best universities in America, 

12 have been using these plans for 30 years or more. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Since we are asking 

14 questions about just curiosity, I am curious to know how 

many -- this is a very ambitious racial program here at 

16 the University of Texas. How many people are there in 

17 the affirmative action department of the University of 

18 Texas? Do you have any idea? I mean, there must be a 

19 lot of people to, you know, to monitor all these classes 

and do all of this assessment of race throughout the 

21 thing. There would be a large number of people be out 

22 of a job, wouldn't we, wouldn't they, if we suddenly 

23 went to just 10 percent? 

24  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, one of the things 

that the University of Texas does monitor is the racial

13  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

14  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

17 may it please the Court: 

18  In resolving this case, it is important to 

19 focus on what is, or more precisely, what is not at 

issue. 

21  Petitioner is not challenging Grutter's 

22 reaffirmation of the principle of Justice Powell's 

23 opinion in Bakke that student body diversity is a 

24 compelling interest that can justify the consideration 

of race in university admissions. Colleges and

1 universities across the country have relied on that 

2 principle in shaping their admissions policies, and it 

3 is of vital interest to the United States that they 

4 continue to be able to do so.

 The core of our interest is in ensuring that 

6 the Nation's universities produce graduates who are 

7 going to be effective citizens and effective leaders in 

8 an increasingly diverse society, and effective 

9 competitors in diverse global markets.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Does the United States agree 

11 with Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic 

12 applicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a 

13 preference? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: I understand that 

differently, Justice Alito. Here's how we understand 

16 what is going on with respect to the admissions process 

17 in the University of Texas, and I am going to address it 

18 directly. I just think it needs a bit of context to do 

19 so.

 The top 10 percent plan certainly does 

21 produce some ethnic diversity. Significant numbers get 

22 in. The problem is the university can't control that 

23 diversity in the same way it can with respect to the 

24 25 percent of the class that is admitted through the 

holistic process.

1  So my understanding of what the university 

2 here is looking to do, and what universities generally 

3 are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant 

4 a preference for privilege, but to make individualized 

decisions about applicants who will directly further the 

6 educational mission. For example, they will look for 

7 individuals who will play against racial stereotypes 

8 just by what they bring: The African American fencer; 

9 the Hispanic who has -- who has mastered classical 

Greek. They can also look for people who have a 

11 demonstrated track record of --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: If you have two applicants 

13 who are absolutely the same in every respect: They both 

14 come from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents. 

One falls within two of the groups that are given a 

16 preference, the other doesn't. It's a marginal case. 

17 It's the last -- the last position available in the 

18 class. Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't 

19 get in. Now, do you agree with that or not?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I think the -- in 

21 the --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree with -- do you 

23 agree that that is an incorrect statement of the facts, 

24 or do you agree that that's an incorrect understanding 

of the Equal Protection Clause?

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's both. I 

2 think the -- there is no automatic preference in Texas. 

3 And I think this is right in the -- it says at page 398a 

4 of the Joint Appendix -- the -- they describe the 

process as saying, "An applicant's race is considered 

6 only to the extent that the applicant, viewed 

7 holistically, will contribute to the broader vision of 

8 diversity desired by the university." 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the 

hypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the 

11 same in all other respects. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. But the point --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: And if -- if the ability to 

14 give a racial preference means anything at all, it 

certainly has to mean that, in the -- in the 

16 hypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the 

17 minority student gets in and the other one doesn't. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I disagree, 

19 Justice Scalia. What the -- Texas, I think, has made 

clear -- and I think this is a common feature of these 

21 kinds of holistic approaches -- that not everyone in an 

22 underrepresented group gets a preference, gets a plus 

23 factor. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of not 

everyone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all

1 other respects. 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: And what does the racial 

4 preference mean if it doesn't mean that in that 

situation the minority applicant wins and the other one 

6 loses? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: There may not be a racial 

8 preference in that situation. It's going to depend on a 

9 holistic, individualized consideration of the applicant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, they're already 

11 talking --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand 

13 this argument. I thought that the whole point is that 

14 sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are 

saying that it isn't. Well, then, we should just go 

16 away. Then -- then we should just say you can't use 

17 race, don't worry about it. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it's a 

19 tie-breaker. I think it functions more subtly than 

that, Justice Kennedy. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't function 

22 more subtly in every case. We have findings by both 

23 courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of 

24 appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33.

 "The district court found that race is

1 indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a 

2 difference in the evaluation of a student's 

3 application." If it doesn't make a difference, then we 

4 have a clear case; they're using race in a way that 

doesn't make a difference. The supposition has to be 

6 that race is a determining factor. 

7  We've heard a lot about holistic and all 

8 that. That's fine. But unless it's a determining 

9 factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't 

serve the purpose at all. That can't be the situation. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: It can make a difference. 

12 It just doesn't invariably make a difference with 

13 respect to every minority applicant, and that's the 

14 key here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to agree 

16 that it makes a difference in some cases. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, it does. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: But it doesn't 

necessarily make a difference in the situation that 

21 Justice Alito posited in the hypothetical --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the same --

23 the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in 

24 some cases it's going to make a difference. The same 

would be true under Grutter. The same would be true

1 under the policies now in existence at the military 

2 academies. 

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that is exactly 

4 right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not 

a mechanical factor. 

6  Now, with respect to the implementation 

7 of -- and the narrow tailoring inquiry, with respect to 

8 the University's implementation of this -- of its 

9 compelling interest, I do think it's clear that, 

although the Petitioner says she's challenging 

11 implementation, that this plan meets every requirement 

12 of Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy 

13 that you raised in dissent in Grutter. Whether Texas 

14 had to or not, it did address that concern.

 There's no quota. Everyone competes against 

16 everyone else. Race is not a mechanical automatic 

17 factor. It's an holistic individualized consideration. 

18 And because of the way the process is structured, they 

19 do not monitor the racial composition on an ongoing 

basis. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I think, as I 

22 take your answer, is that the supposition of 

23 Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this 

24 system. There are not two identical candidates because 

there are not identical mechanical factors that --

1 except the 10 percent plan. 

2  Under the PIA, the factors are so varied, so 

3 contextually set, that no two applicants ever could be 

4 identical in the sense that they hypothesize.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. They
 

6 make specific individualized judgments about each
 

7 applicant --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because no two people
 

9 can be the same --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back to 

11 what we're talking about, you -- as I understand it, 

12 race by itself is taken into account, right? That's the 

13 only thing on the cover of the application; they take 

14 race into account.

 And the district court found -- and you're 

16 not challenging -- that race makes a difference in some 

17 cases, right? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. But the key, 

19 Mr. Chief Justice, is the way it makes a difference. 

And it makes a difference by casting the accomplishments 

21 of the individual applicant in a particular light, or 

22 the potential of an individual applicant in a particular 

23 light.

1 consideration is what is this individual going to

3 on that because it can have a bearing on evaluating what 

4 they've accomplished, and it can have a bearing for the 

reasons I tried to identify earlier to Justice Alito on 

6 what they can bring to the table, what they can bring to 

7 that freshman seminar, what they can bring to the 

8 student government, what they can bring to the campus 

9 environment --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so. But it is 

11 the correct answer to Justice Alito's -- if there are 

12 ever two applicants where the GPA, the test -- the 

13 grades, the SA1, SA2, leadership, activities, awards, 

14 work experience, community service, family's economic 

status, school's socioeconomic status, family's 

16 responsibility, single-parent home, languages other than 

17 English spoken at home, and SAT score relative to 

18 school's average race, if you had a situation where 

19 those -- all those things were absolutely identical, 

than the person would be admitted on the bounds of race.

this other plan on top of the top 10 percent plan?

17 effectiveness depends on a pipeline of well-qualified 

18 and well-prepared candidates from diverse backgrounds 

19 who are comfortable exercising leadership in diverse 

settings, and --

2 interested in ROTC. Maybe if race is taken into 

3 account, the candidate gets in. Maybe if it isn't, he 

4 doesn't get in. How does that impact the military?

 The candidate will then probably go to Texas 

6 A&M or Texas Tech? Is it your position that he will be 

7 an inferior military officer if he went to one of those 

8 schools? 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand the 

11 argument. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: The point of educational 

13 diversity, the point of what the University of Texas is 

14 trying to achieve is to create an environment in which 

everyone develops an appropriate sense of citizenship, 

16 everyone develops the capacity to lead in a racially 

17 diverse society, and so it will benefit every ROTC 

18 applicant from the University of Texas. 

19  And 43 percent of the Officer Corps comes 

from the ROTC. It's a very significant source of our 

21 military leadership.

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm hearing a 

lot about what it's not. I'd like to know what it is 

6 because our responsibility is to decide whether this use 

7 of race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this 

8 University's view, critical mass. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: May I answer, 

Mr. Chief Justice? 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes.

13  I think -- I don't think that this is a 

14 situation in which the Court simply affords complete 

deference to the University's judgment that it hasn't 

16 yet achieved the level of diversity that it needs to 

17 accomplish its educational mission. 

18  I think that the Court ought to -- has to 

19 make its own independent judgment. I think the way the 

Court would go about making that independent judgment is 

21 to look at the kind of information that the university 

22 considered. That could be information about the 

23 composition of the class. It could be information about 

24 classroom diversity. It could be information about 

retention and graduation rates. It can be information

1 about -- that's specific to the university's context in 

2 history. Is it a university that has had a history of 

3 racial incidents and trouble or not? A series of 

4 factors.

 And then what the Court's got to do is 

6 satisfy itself that the University has substantiated its 

7 conclusion based on that -- based on the information 

8 it's considered, that it needs to consider race to 

9 further advance the educational goals that Grutter has 

identified as a compelling interest. 

11  And I will say, I do think, as the number of 

12 minority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the 

13 university to do that is going to get harder to meet. 

14 But I don't think -- I don't think there is a number, 

and I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to 

16 suggest that there is a number, because it would raise 

17 exactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think 

18 Justice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of 

19 creating hydraulic pressure towards that number.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We should probably stop 

21 calling it critical mass then, because mass, you know, 

22 assumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight.

9  If I may just add one word in conclusion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you. 

12  I think it is important, Your Honors, not 

13 just to the government, but to the country, that our 

14 universities have the flexibility to shape their 

environments and their educational experience to make a 

16 reality of the principle that Justice Kennedy identified 

17 in Parents Involved, that our strength comes from people 

18 of different races, different creeds, different 

19 cultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to 

more a perfect union.

for Abby Fisher. So it's most apt at this point. 

11  There's just three things I want to touch

14 relates to merits. And I just want to make clear that 

we do not accept the premise of that footnote, that she

17 they've asserted that, but, in fact, she was considered 

18 for the summer program, which is --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your complaint 

limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100? 

21 As written, is that what it's limited to?

2 speculative. Is what you actually see what I said: 

3 Injunctive relief and the return of the $100. 

4  MR. REIN: And what I'm saying is that we 

never had the opportunity to develop the full damages --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In --

7  MR. REIN: -- because of --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In Arizonans and Alvarez 

9 we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact. 

Did you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100, 

11 specifically? 

12  MR. REIN: The only specific number in the 

13 complaint, because of the point in time when it was 

14 filed was the application fee, which we believe --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you would have paid 

16 that no matter what; under any system of admission you 

17 would have paid the same $100. 

18  MR. REIN: You would have paid the fee in 

19 return for a fair processing of the application, which 

she did not receive, and we think that is a claim that 

21 will be sustained. It is not tested at this point. 

22  And the second thing is, because of the way 

23 the case was bifurcated, with the agreement of all and 

24 the district court as well, we did not develop the 

additional damages here. We reserved the right to

4  MR. REIN: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then how do you get 

6 around Arizonans? 

7  MR. REIN: Because as -- as in the BIO, what 

8 UT pointed out was there are other kinds of financial 

9 injuries which were not ascertainable at the time the 

complaint was filed because we were trying to put her 

11 into the university. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She was going to get a 

13 better job because she went to a different university? 

14  MR. REIN: That's one of the things they 

suggested. There are differences in cost between the --

16 what she paid at LSU and what she would have paid at UT. 

17 I'm just saying, these are all reserved questions and 

18 they don't go to standing. The Court made that clear in 

19 Bakke.

 Let me go to another issue that, you know, I 

21 think I never completed my answer to Justice Breyer. 

22 Where we stand on what you should do about Grutter is as 

23 follows. 

24  We recognize, as in the words of -- that the 

Solicitor General just issued -- that there is an

1 interest which is cognizable in diversity. That is --

2 that was the root question in Grutter, could you 

3 recognize it at all. But what we are concerned about, 

4 as you are seeing here, is universities like UT and many 

others have read it to be green light, use race, no end 

6 point, no discernible target, no critical mass written, 

7 you know, in circumstances reduced to something that can 

8 be reviewed. 

9  And as long as you don't cross two lines, 

determinative points and fixed quotas -- "quotas" 

11 meaning we will fill this quota exclusively with who we 

12 deem to be under-represented -- you are okay. We don't 

13 think that's the way Grutter was intended. Grutter was 

14 intended to say this is an area of great caution; using 

race itself raises all kinds of red flags, so before you 

16 use race make a determination whether really, your 

17 interest in critical mass -- that is, in the dialogue 

18 and interchange, the educational interest, is that --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not suggesting 

that if every minority student that got into a 

21 university got into only the physical education program; 

22 and in this particular university that -- that physical 

23 education program includes all the star athletes; so 

24 every star athlete in the school happens to be black or

3  MR. REIN: Well, I think you are talking 

4 about --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the holistic way that 

6 Grutter permits? 

7  MR. REIN: Well, if you are saying there's a 

8 -- a differentiated department of physical education, 

9 which is like a separate college, you have changed the 

nature of the hypothetical. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it's just that every 

12 one of their students who happens to be a minority is 

13 going to end up in that program. You don't think the 

14 university could consider that it needs a different 

diversity in its other departments? 

16  MR. REIN: Well, if that were the case, 

17 remember the factor that is causing it, and you are 

18 assuming, is choice. You have a critical mass of 

19 students. They choose to major in different things, and 

that's one of the base problems with the classroom 

21 diversity concept. They never asked the question why, 

22 if 40 percent of our students are minorities, are they 

23 not in the small classrooms? Why does that happen? 

24 Statistically you would say that's an aberration. You 

might ask the question what's causing it? Because in

1 order to fit --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't they saying the 

3 same thing when they say, when we are looking at the 

4 holistic measure, we are looking for that student who 

is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear 

6 scientist? 

7  MR. REIN: No. Because they don't take into 

8 account your interests, they don't ask you, are you 

9 going to join ROTC, they don't ask you are you going to 

major -- major in physics. And when it comes time in 

11 the UT system to allocate access to different majors, 

12 they do that in a way that is basically premised on 

13 academic index. 

14  So they have a two-tiered admission system. 

They are only here focused -- their preference goes to 

16 admission as such, it doesn't go to sorting people out 

17 by majors. 

18  And if I might then say to Justice Breyer, I 

19 think our answer is, when we see what UT is doing, what 

we that -- Grutter's -- you know, it has been perceived 

21 as a green light; go ahead and use race, race which is 

22 otherwise really a highly questionable, an abominable 

23 kind of sorting out. That unchecked use of race, which 

24 we think is -- has been spawned by misreading of 

Grutter, needs to be corralled. So what we --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it any more unchecked 

2 than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off 

3 in 1978, decided by Justice Powell? Is it any different 

4 from how race is used in our military academies?

 MR. REIN: Well, I mean, they are two 

6 different questions. The Harvard plan is a very 

7 different world. It's a plan of wholly individualized 

8 admission comparing individuals one on one, to establish 

9 the platonic ideal of the class as the educational 

mission. This is not what is going on at UT. 

11  This is not an individualized, I will look 

12 at you. I will score you. I will score you 

13 individually. But as they keep saying, at the point of 

14 admission, I am not admitting people; I am admitting 

categories, boxes; and that relates to Justice Alito's 

16 question. 

17  I thought your hypothetical, Justice Alito, 

18 was entirely fair, because in the way they do their 

19 system, in the PAI scoring, you can figure out that two 

people would have had the same PAI score but for race. 

21 It's an add-on. It allows them to boost the PAS 

22 component of the PAI score. So -- it is not infrequent. 

23 There are many, many candidates who will score the same 

24 PAI, may even have the same AI, and then you boost some 

of them.

1  Now, what UT says is, well, we don't boost 

2 all the minorities. And that -- as they've stood here 

3 today, and they said in their briefs, we want to boost 

4 the ones we like. We want those affluent minorities who 

we think will improve, in our view, dialogue. That is 

6 contrary indeed to the fact that they give points in the 

7 same system for socioeconomic disadvantage. It's at 

8 odds with itself. 

9  But it's purely race, and it comes to the 

ultimate question then, which, Chief Justice, you were 

11 asking: Where is the end point? If you have nothing to 

12 gauge the success of the program, if you can't even say 

13 at the beginning we don't have critical mass because we 

14 don't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is, 

there is no judicial supervision, there is no strict 

16 scrutiny and there is no end point to what they are 

17 doing. 

18  So what we have said, and it comes right 

19 back to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can 

clarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies, 

21 requires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our 

22 brief that would be satisfactory. But to the extent 

23 that you then have it surviving side by side, there 

24 could be enormous confusion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what you want me to do

1 is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what 

2 the underlying determinations of critical mass were 

3 there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas --

4 which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will 

then find enough of a difference that I can write some 

6 words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a 

7 thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with 

8 programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that 

9 right?

 MR. REIN: Well, I'm saying if you clarify 

11 the needs and the necessity point, if you then look at 

12 some of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the 

13 consideration of reasonably available alternatives as a 

14 necessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute 

the weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of 

16 those factors, I think you can fashion a result in this 

17 case which may or may not have to, quote, "overrule" 

18 Grutter. 

19  It's really a matter, what do you -- do you 

want to clearly restate what it is that allows the use 

21 of this odious classification? That's what we are 

22 talking about, it's a narrow window; and it should be 

23 stated as a narrow window. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you don't want to 

overrule Grutter, you just want to gut it.

1  MR. REIN: Excuse me? 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just want to gut it. 

3 You don't want to overrule it, but you just want to gut 

4 it.

 MR. REIN: Well --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now you want to tell 

7 universities that once you reach a certain number, then 

8 you can't use race anymore. 

9  MR. REIN: Justice Sotomayor, I don't want 

to gut it. And the only way one could reach that 

11 conclusion is to assume that Grutter is an unlimited 

12 mandate without end point to just use race to your own 

13 satisfaction and to be deferred to in your use of race. 

14 That is unacceptable. That is the invasion of Abigail 

Fisher's rights to equal protection of the law. 

16 Thank you.
