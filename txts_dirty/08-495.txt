 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Nijhawan v. Holder.

 Mr. Moseley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MOSELEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 At issue in this case is an aggravated 

felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that 

serves both as a ground of deportation and as an 

integral part of a Federal criminal statute.

 For the Court's convenient reference, 

because I suspect we will return to this and the other 

definitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory 

appendix in the government's brief: 3a gives (M)(i); 6a 

gives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the 

underlying criminal statute in which this aggravated 

felony definition forms an integral part.

 Now, Congress has required -- for 

deportation, Congress has required conviction of this 

defined offense, in a definition that says absolutely 

nothing about the word "tether" utilized by the Third 

Circuit below, and the definition begins with a

restrictive clause, "that," to require conviction of 

both the fraud and deceit element and also the loss 

amount as an integral part of this definition.

 Since Congress required conviction, the 

time-honored categorical approach really should be the 

governing standard, and I submit that there's nothing in 

the plain language of the statute, the underlying 

statute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored 

approach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being 

presumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the 

stay standards that this Court discussed very recently 

in the Nken case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Another --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, please.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the time-honored 

approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not 

necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount 

involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of 

the time-honored approach and then the statute would be 

fulfilled?

 MR. MOSELEY: I -- under those 

circumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes. But here the jury 

was specifically instructed that they did not have to 

make any finding with respect to loss in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in that connection, 

at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little 

early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd 

like to know either anecdotally from your experience or 

-- or because it's written somewhere, how often do 

juries give special verdicts? It actually applies in 

the second case we're to hear as well. And has that 

changed in the light of -- of Apprendi? In -- in my 

experience, we just didn't know many of the features of 

the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just 

would like to know if that's changed in this day and 

age.

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, I -- I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you may reach that 

after you've talked about the statute.

 MR. MOSELEY: Yes, but let me -- certainly 

among the State statutes that we cite, the State 

statutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an 

element, the jury is going to be instructed they have to 

return that, and they do. The -- the special verdict 

opportunity here is in effect, I would submit, a kind of 

lifeline, if you will, that we're giving to the 

government in these -- in these more general fraud 

statutes, where the government has that -- certainly has 

that opportunity or that option to do. But there

certainly have been -- and I know we cite them in our 

brief -- cases --

JUSTICE ALITO: And if you -- if you do 

extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you 

conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element 

of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not 

necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the 

offense?

 MR. MOSELEY: No, Justice Alito. What I am 

saying is that this statute -- and again, (M)(i) was 

enacted as part of a number of criminal statutes --

excuse me -- as a number of provisions that were 

addressed to white collar offenses, of which this is 

just one, and it also encompasses the State -- it also 

encompasses the State statutes where this clearly is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you a 

concrete example. Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud 

case. Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases, 

and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order 

to convict under the mail fraud statute. In the first 

case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also 

return -- or together with that they answer a special 

interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000. 

In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and 

admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more

than $10,000. Would there be a problem in those cases?

 MR. MOSELEY: In those cases, no. In those 

cases, that would have satisfied the traditional 

categorical approach.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this --

JUSTICE ALITO: And then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case, how many of 

the defendants were alien? You're -- the jury is given 

a charge that covers all of the defendants.  They're all 

charged with the same crime. How many of them were 

aliens?

 MR. MOSELEY: I believe two in addition to 

Mr. Nijhawan, Justice Ginsburg. I believe two or three 

more were. This case -- this case involved roughly 15 

defendants. There are only five who went to trial. The 

number who -- the number who are aliens, in addition to 

Mr. Nijhawan, I believe were two.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the judge wouldn't 

distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for 

the defendants who were not aliens because it would have 

no consequences for them. So why should the judge --

even if the question could be asked, why should the 

judge -- the judge takes a position: It's not an 

element of the crime. Therefore, I'm not going to 

charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by

saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to 

find the amount.

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, under -- under those --

under those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr. 

Nijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with --

with respect to loss. I don't think -- I don't think 

there's an issue of jury confusion here, and indeed 

under -- under -- ironically under this Court's -- well, 

this would have been a situation in which a request was 

-- could have been made. I don't think there would have 

been -- there certainly wouldn't have been jury 

confusion to have requested it here.

 But I think you have to put this in -- in 

the larger picture of a statute of a set of aggravated 

felony definitions that were enacted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you go on to 

that, we're talking about (M)(i). It's coupled with 

another provision that's an offense that is described in 

section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion --

in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 

10,000. So it's the same "in which" construction, and 

there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax 

evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, actually, Justice 

Ginsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a

deficiency is indeed a necessary element of that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: A deficiency, but not the 

amount of the deficiency.

 MR. MOSELEY: But -- no. A -- a deficiency 

is a necessary element of that offense. That's --

that's where, for example, the Babaisakov decision got 

that point flatly wrong. And this is, I think, the 

classic --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is the amount --

there's a deficiency. The jury has to find in order to 

find tax evasion there is a deficiency. Does it have to 

find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds 

$10,000?

 MR. MOSELEY: No, it doesn't have to find 

that, but it may. And this is a classic example of the 

application of the modified categorical approach, where 

this statute sweeps broadly to include both loss amounts 

or, in this case, revenue loss amounts that would exceed 

$10,000 and those that would be less than $10,000. Most 

of these cases, most of the tax cases, as the 

government's own materials that we cite indicate, are 

resolved by guilty pleas with respect to where those 

amounts are designated. And I think it's important here 

to realize that by pairing these two statutes, by 

pairing these two provisions, (M)(i) and (M)(ii),

Congress in effect I submit sent the signal with that 

language in (M)(ii) that we're talking about the kind --

we're talking about the application of the modified 

categorical --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- What is the 

difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty 

plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more 

than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for 

sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?

 MR. MOSELEY: Because, Justice Alito, in the 

sentencing context we're truly dealing with a 

post-verdict situation where the government in terms of 

having to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount 

-- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the 

evidence standard. And the defendant under those 

circumstances --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if he's admitting it, 

what does the standard of the evidence matter?

 MR. MOSELEY: He's admitting it here, 

Justice Souter, under these circumstances. He's 

admitting it here only in the context of a resolution of 

the sentencing issue. If you go back to the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he's not saying, I 

admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that 

it was over 10,000. He's saying, period, over 10,000.

The burden of proof, the standard of proof doesn't 

matter.

 MR. MOSELEY: No, but he's -- but he's doing 

this in the context of resolving, of resolving a 

disputed issue with respect to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And he definitively 

resolves it by admission.

 MR. MOSELEY: But he does so certainly in 

the context of reserving, of reserving his right to 

contest that and to make the arguments that we're making 

here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I understand the facts 

of this case. I was commenting on your answer to 

Justice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that 

the answer to the question is there is no difference.

 MR. MOSELEY: No, I submit -- I submit that 

there -- there really is a -- a profound difference 

under the circumstances of someone being in a situation 

before, before conviction, and then someone being in a 

postconviction situation. And then I think we should 

come back in terms -- we should come back to the 

underlying, to the underlying requirement that the 

person had been -- the person under the statute be 

convicted of the loss.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, that really gets

to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I 

don't see how the modified categorical approach is 

something that you could admit would be sufficient 

because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in 

part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical 

construction -- you're saying that in the definition 

"The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that" --

and you emphasize the "that," the restrictive nature of 

the "that" clause -- "involves fraud or deceit in which 

the loss exceeds $10,000."

 if I understand your restrictive clause argument, 

the definition of the offense has got to include the 

element of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy 

your, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you 

were arguing for based on the restrictive clause. So it 

seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you 

get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an 

element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000. Am 

I wrong?

 MR. MOSELEY: I don't think necessarily. 

Well, under these circumstances, Justice Souter, what I 

would say is that there may be statutes, there may be 

statutes in which, there are statutes, there are State 

statutes, where you have a range of conduct that may 

include $10,000, may not include $10,000, and the

modified categorical approach would apply under those.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, how about this one. 

You were arguing based on this statute and you make an 

argument based on the restrictive nature of a "that" 

modifying clause, and if you're going to make the 

restrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got 

to go the whole hog and say the element of the offense 

has got to include the loss in excess of $10,000.

 MR. MOSELEY: Certainly if it does, then 

under the statutes involved here we would prevail.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yeah, you would 

prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the 

expense of this objection, and the government makes it. 

There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that 

define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of 

$10,000. My recollection from the government's brief is 

that they come up with three.

 The fact is also that this provision, the 

$10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time 

when Congress was trying to expand the category of 

deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing 

strange in that context to define the offense by 

reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the 

offense which would cut it down, which would cut the 

compass of the statute down to three offenses. What is

your response to that?

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, I think the government 

vastly understates the statutory provisions that were 

involved here. Even if you look at the State statutes, 

a majority of the State statutes, as I think we make 

clear in our reply brief, a majority of States have 

statutes, generally the theft by deception statutes and 

others which have loss thresholds that will get you over 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, once you get into the 

State statutes you get into the further problem of an 

utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory 

reference to which this would apply. If you -- if you 

steal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the 

country. If you steal it across the State line in State 

B, you stay home. I mean, I can't imagine that Congress 

would have enacted that kind of scheme.

 MR. MOSELEY: But what Congress has done 

here is to provide for a uniform test, in effect.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: A uniform test that 

produces both unjust results and I would suppose 

strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted 

to expand the concept of deportable offense.

 MR. MOSELEY: But what -- but what -- if I 

can just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the

original premise that it under all circumstances has to 

be an element. There are certainly statutes, even 

Federal statutes, for example, the theft from Federal --

federally funded programs, which give specific loss 

amounts of 5,000 or more, which would -- which -- excuse 

me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem is that 

there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter 

made. If we take your position that there are a number 

of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, 

some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to 

when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you 

have these unequal results within the Federal system and 

in the States, so when you think -- would it make any 

sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if 

the State happens to make -- to have the "in which" or 

if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?

 MR. MOSELEY: What -- Justice Ginsburg, I 

think what Congress did here was to create a uniform 

test, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if --

if someone has been convicted of both these 

requirements, fraud or deceit or the loss. That 

certainly produces far more uniformity than had --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's treating people 

who do the identical thing differently.

MR. MOSELEY: But Congress chose under these 

circumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances 

to -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes 

in addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to 

encompassing the Federal statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what you're saying is 

you're not denying that people who commit the identical 

theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently 

depending on whether the statute under which they're 

convicted has this "in which" clause?

 MR. MOSELEY: What I believe, what I believe 

that I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with 

any of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it 

will determine -- it will be determined on the basis of 

how the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to 

charge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Moseley --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Moseley, can I get 

your help on a question I really have difficulty with. 

It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it 

in one of two ways: It involves fraud or deceit in 

which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000. 

In that case you would lose. Or it could be read to say 

involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the 

crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of

$10,000. You would lose under that also because it is 

not an element of the crime.

 So you are relying on a modified approach, 

and under your modified approach what does the statute 

say?

 MR. MOSELEY: The -- the statute -- the 

statute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of 

both these aspects, both of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the statute doesn't 

say anything about conviction.

 MR. MOSELEY: If, Justice Stevens, if you 

read it in conjunction with the conviction 

requirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable, 

to be deportable, that's in -- in 6a. Someone who has 

been convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable; 

and also someone who has been convicted of an aggravated 

felony is subject to, under -- under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand how you squeeze your -- your modified 

categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex 

machina which is intended to blunt the government's 

argument that very few statutes would be covered by 

this. I don't see how you get that out of the word 

"convicted."

more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the 

jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you 

guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory 

the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than

that? You are convicted of what you are charged with. 

You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not --

not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the 

jury to be questioned about.

 MR. MOSELEY: I think under those 

circumstances, though, particularly if you look at the 

statutes which make gradations of sentencing on the 

basis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of 

that. It is -- because that's a necessary element 

that's going to -- that's a necessary fact that's going 

to have to be found to put you in a particular 

sentencing range. So you -- so you definitely would be 

-- you would be under those circumstances convicted of 

that amount.

 But I think it's important to -- to 

recognize what -- that Congress -- that Congress in 

enacting the statute and in predicating removal upon 

conviction used language that sharply distinguishes --

that is sharply distinguished from the position that the 

government advocates here that loss should be something

to be determined in separate -- in -- in separate 

removal proceedings.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to my 

question, which I don't think you've fully answered? 

And that's the tax evasion situation. For any tax -- a 

person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial 

and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, 

as I understand it under your reading, because the jury 

is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, the jury -- under those 

circumstances, it will depend upon how the government 

chooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case. And 

if the government chooses to prosecute the case by 

seeking a determination of the deficiency amount in a 

jury charge, then -- then, yes -- then, yes, indeed, 

they would. But again, the vast majority of these cases 

are resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know. You told me that 

most of them admit it at the plea stage. But going to 

trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me 

they are meant to operate the same way.

 MR. MOSELEY: Well, they -- they are -- they 

are meant to operate the same way. But I think that 

what we have here is a situation where the fact that 

deficiency is a requirement and that deficiency in most

cases will be established by a plea, and that this is a 

statute that sweeps broadly; that this is a statute that 

sweeps -- excuse me -- sweeps broadly to encompass both 

a loss in excess of 10,000 -- a deficiency in excess of 

$10,000 or a deficiency under $10,000.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Did you have any authority 

for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal 

case should ask the jury to answer a special 

interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing 

on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future 

immigration status of the defendant, which is what 

you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?

 MR. MOSELEY: What -- what I am suggesting 

in the tax case is that it would be perfectly 

appropriate for the government to seek such a special 

interrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss, 

which is an element of the -- which is a necessary 

component of the offense, if they wanted to establish it 

-- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes --

for whatever purpose they wanted to establish it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I can see that if 

there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the 

defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's 

inflammatory.

again, that is going to depend on -- that's going to 

depend upon how the government chooses to -- to 

prosecute under these particular --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all that just 

underscores the fact that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- your earlier -- your 

earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that --

that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount 

specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true. I 

mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines 

are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury 

determination. We've said they are discretionary.

 MR. MOSELEY: No, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So if you don't have a jury 

determination, you can still sentence on the basis of 

the amount taken, even though that was not found by the 

jury.

 MR. MOSELEY: I -- I understand. But my --

my point, Justice Scalia, on this one is that -- on 

(M)(ii) is that it is -- it is a statute in which -- in 

which loss can or is required to be shown, some 

deficiency is required to be shown, and this may -- and 

this may well be done by the modified -- the modified 

categorical approach, particularly in -- in --

particularly in situations in which, as in most cases,

it's resolved by a plea.

 Now, if -- if -- but -- and also, this 

statute was enacted against the backdrop of -- of the 

categorical approach, and the act was amended -- has 

been amended roughly four times during this period with 

no indication that Congress certainly intended to 

jettison this. And I think it's also important here to 

note the structure of the act in terms of how Congress 

sharply distinguished between what would happen with 

conviction and -- and what would happen with sentence.

 They did enact specific provisions, 

101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix 

and (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk 

about -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make 

that sharp distinction.

 But I think we should not also lose sight of 

the overarching fact here that this provision is an 

integral part of a Federal criminal statute, 1326(b), so 

that any ambiguity in the -- so that an ambiguity in the 

construction and application of this statute should as 

-- similarly to -- to what this Court held in Leocal, 

should be resolved in favor of the -- in favor of the 

alien, because it's the classic multiple or dual use 

statute that has both civil and criminal applications, 

and very severe criminal applications as well.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner's reading of subparagraph (M)(i) 

implausibly excludes the mainstays of Federal fraud 

prosecutions and applies at best to a tiny handful of 

outlying offenses: Thefts of major works of art, 

extreme cases of government contract fraud, and some 

frauds obtaining confidential phone records and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except -- except for 

his modified hangout. His modified -- his modified 

categorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?

Scalia, that he does offer this -- this variation on a 

so-called modified categorical approach by saying that 

we could use extraneous facts in guilty pleas in order 

to satisfy the categorical approach. But we think that 

that doesn't work for both practical reasons and for the 

types of reasons that -- that several of the questions 

raised in the first half of the argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And also interrogatories to 

the jury.

 MR. GANNON: He does seem to contemplate 

that interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the 

same purpose. But as Justice Alito was pointing out, 

there -- there is little reason to believe that a judge 

is going to permit such extraneous questions to be put 

to a jury that are -- that are not necessary for the 

criminal proceeding that is actually being held at that 

point. It's unlikely that the government wants to make 

the entire -- wants to imply that the conviction needs 

to turn on that.

 And obviously, both with the -- the special 

interrogatories and the guilty pleas, there are 

practical problems, because this could only apply 

prospectively, even though Congress's definition of 

aggravated felonies is intended to apply to convictions 

that predated the enactment of IIRIRA. It -- I just

mean that it would not be until we knew that this was 

the rule, that we could implement such -- such a rule. 

And it's not clear why any alien who would be contesting 

his removability in the civil removal proceedings would 

concede in the -- in a guilty plea or to a fact that is 

extraneous to that conviction that would ultimately --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- but this 

defendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge.

 MR. GANNON: Well, he did not ask the judge 

for a finding of loss. He -- he asked for an 

instruction -- for a special interrogatory as to "the 

amount of money my client is responsible for." That's 

on page 14a of his opening brief. And that's not the 

relevant question for purposes of the loss threshold in 

subparagraph (M)(i), which is actually about the -- the 

loss to the victims from the offense involving fraud or 

deceit, not how much any individual defendant might have 

been responsible for. And even now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then you 

just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll 

have a little debate about what the special 

interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection 

there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.

 MR. GANNON: Well, and at that point he --

he -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove

up a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes 

of the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well 

become relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did 

become relevant here, and there was a sentencing 

stipulation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and why would you 

be reluctant to do that? Would you just spell that out 

a little bit?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that it 

could confuse the jury. Even if it were clear that it 

had nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that 

would be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to 

thrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require 

the jury to make findings about facts that are truly 

extraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding 

that is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt 

purposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to 

find that.

 And as -- as the questions before were 

making clear, the reason this Court has applied the 

modified categorical approach is to determine what is 

necessary for the underlying conviction. That's why 

it's tied to an investigation into what really were the 

elements of the underlying offense. And interrogatories 

about facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the

conviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced 

into guilty pleas do not change the fact that that 

particular attribute was not necessary for the 

conviction.

 And so, we think that it makes sense, in 

context of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the 

definition of aggravated felonies, where it is 

indisputable that there are multiple provisions that 

include both an element that needs to be evaluated as an 

element of the offense and some other limiting factor 

that need not be an element of the offense; that it 

makes sense to construe the loss threshold in 

subparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an 

element, because the consequences of Petitioner's 

approach would be to read out virtually all Federal 

fraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail 

fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government, 

bank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here.

 And he does offer a patchwork of some State 

offenses that could be satisfied. But even there, 

there -- there's not any particular consistency to it. 

He invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation 

scheme for theft by deception offenses. And although 

the BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception 

offenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud

offenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next 

chapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices 

have a consistent gradation scheme.

 So even in the States that Petitioner cites 

in his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary 

thresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for 

health care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary 

thresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud, 

and so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not 

be treated consistently, depending upon which State it 

was committed in and even which type of fraud it was in 

an individual State, if the State --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this, does 

this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here, 

but does the government have a theory about how the loss 

is measured for purposes of this statute? Under the 

sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated 

calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and 

lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and 

here we just have the statute.

 MR. GANNON: Yes, we think that it is not 

necessarily the same as the loss determination that 

would be made for sentencing. And so, the board has 

made it very clear that even though a restitution order, 

for example, can be sufficient evidence of loss to the

victim, that it needs to be assessed with an eye to 

exactly what losses were determined in the underlying 

restitution order and with regard to the burden of proof 

there. And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if you have somebody 

who participates in a -- in a scheme involving 

$100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this 

person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this 

would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a 

minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would 

that come out?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think that the text of 

the statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an 

offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss 

to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000. And so, we 

think that the loss threshold is tied to the offense 

that involves fraud or deceit, not to the individual 

defendant's role.

 If he's convicted of a $100 million fraud or 

in this case what may well have been a $683 million 

fraud, he is -- that -- that is the offense of which he 

was convicted, and it is an offense in which the loss to 

the victims exceeded $10,000. And so we think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the judge, when he 

arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to

say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an 

accountant with the company that was committing the 

fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except 

the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him 

from the restitution order?

 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in 

general the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to 

adjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of 

the facts of the underlying offense. And that's --

that's one of the reasons why I think the board has been 

sensitive to the idea that the restitution order does 

not necessarily determine what the amount of loss is 

going to be for purposes of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you wouldn't allow 

that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would 

you?

 MR. GANNON: It would depend upon the facts 

of the underlying case. If the underlying fraud was one 

in which the victims lost nor than $10,000 and we could 

prove that by clear and convincing evidence in the 

removal proceeding, then -- then we think that we would 

not be bound by the judge's discretionary refusal to 

impose a restitution requirement on the particular 

defendant.

hypothetical --

MR. GANNON: Depending upon the facts of the 

case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we 

can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the 

amount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more 

than $10,000, we think that would satisfy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even though this 

defendant did not pocket any gain?

 MR. GANNON: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

It's not a pecuniary gain threshold. It's a loss to the 

victim threshold. And -- and although the judge may 

well take that into account for purposes of restitution, 

it doesn't change the metric that Congress chose to 

determine which types of frauds are serious enough to be 

considered aggravated felonies.

 In 1994, they -- they picked a threshold of 

$200,000. In 1996, they dropped that to 5 percent of 

that value, to $10,000. I think Congress's judgment 

here is that if the fraud is so severe that it --

that -- that somebody -- that the victims lost $10,000, 

then -- then that is a qualifying offense for purposes 

of subparagraph (M)(i), even if the original criminal 

sentencing judge, on the basis of all sorts of factors 

associated with the case and under the restitution 

standards, decided that the defendant was not

necessarily liable to pay restitution in that amount.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

defendant's argument that at least as far as his 

admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only 

because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a 

downward departure?

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- I think that we are 

not taking the position that the -- the stipulation for 

sentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the 

guidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not 

arguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the 

civil removal proceeding. We're arguing that it's 

persuasive evidence of the amount of loss here.

 And so, he's -- he is certainly able to say 

before the board or before the immigration judge that --

that for some reason the amount that he admitted to 

isn't really the -- the actual amount of loss associated 

with the case. That's not what he has done here. He 

has -- he has consistently tried to establish that --

that this -- these -- this gargantuan loss amount was --

was not one that was found by the jury, not that it was 

not in fact the loss that actually accrued in 

association with the --

in this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud 

case, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30, 

and that's all the trial established, but as a matter of 

fact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just 

like the one we've got here, in which millions of 

dollars were lost, you could prove that independently 

and he would still be required to be deported?

 MR. GANNON: Not necessarily, Justice 

Stevens. If the conviction was for the entire scheme, 

then we could bring in the amounts that were relevant to 

the scheme. But if --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the scheme -- the 

evidence of the scheme consisted of just two mailings, 

say. They allege a scheme and say it's a broad -- a 

broad scheme, but they don't describe the amount. They 

merely prove two mailings that involved $25 apiece. But 

the scheme itself, because you proved it in other cases, 

you have the facts, actually was a big scheme like we 

have here. Could they rely on that for -- for 

immigration purposes in a proceeding like this?

 MR. GANNON: It's possible. I think it 

would depend upon exactly what we could determine had 

actually been associated with the original --

amount of evidence in this case, we had sentencing 

stipulations and all sorts of determinations at the time 

of the sentencing where the defendant did not even try 

to argue that this wasn't actually the amount of loss 

associated with his offense and conviction, then we 

probably would be able to establish by clear and 

convincing that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I -- I'm losing 

you. I would -- I would have thought that you have to 

have convicted him of the larger scheme.

 MR. GANNON: I -- I thought, Justice Scalia, 

that that was the premise of Justice Stevens' question. 

That that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, it was.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I didn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it didn't describe the 

dimensions of the scheme. As far as the record shows, 

it only affected -- it was one scheme that was as large 

as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only 

required you to prove two or three mailings involving 

small amounts of money. But then later on you proved 

before the immigration judge there really was a big 

scheme, and that's the one he was convicted of. Isn't 

that enough?

unlikely if we didn't have the evidence contemporaneous 

with the trial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You had the evidence, but 

you didn't need it.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I -- if it were like 

this, we had the evidence contemporaneous with 

sentencing, with $100 million stipulations and things 

like that, and that makes it obviously much easier for 

us to prove the extent of the underlying fraud.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's easy; I'm 

wondering if it's necessary. I -- I think under your 

theory, it would not be necessary. As long as the 

evidence is out there, you can use it in a de novo 

proceeding before the immigration judge.

 MR. GANNON: If -- if that were, in fact, 

the scope of the conviction, because it was for -- for 

the entire fraudulent scheme, then that may well be so. 

Obviously, that -- the cases that have applied the --

the tethered approach, to use the word that Petitioners 

invoked here, are cases in which the -- the courts and 

the BIA have recognized that sometimes it is necessary 

to recognize that there's a distinction between what the 

defendant actually pleaded guilty to. If the defendant 

pleads guilty to only an individual account, that's

involved in the scheme --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, my -- he pleads guilty 

to the mammoth scheme proved, the evidence before the 

court or on the plea colloquy, whatever is described is 

enough to show that he was guilty.

 MR. GANNON: Well I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But then as I understand 

it, you can prove the size of the scheme later on.

 MR. GANNON: I -- in those circumstances I 

-- I think that we may well be able to prove that in the 

second proceeding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would -- I thought 

that was the whole case we had before us, Where you 

haven't proved either as an element or -- or by a 

separate jury finding how much money was involved. Your 

point is you don't have to.

 MR. GANNON: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can establish that 

later.

 MR. GANNON: Yes, that's right, Justice 

Scalia, and as long as it is the scope of the scheme 

that -- that he was convicted --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose your answer, 

it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.

 MR. GANNON: Yes, yes, Justice Kennedy.

purposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't 

retry him for those other -- for that additional loss, 

then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's 

included within the offense for which he was convicted.

 MR. GANNON: As long as the offense were in 

fact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a 

mailing, that's correct; and so I think that that --

that that is consistent with Justice Stevens' 

hypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be 

able to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing 

evidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss 

associated with the offense, which was the scheme rather 

than just an individual mailing, then -- then we would 

be able to prove that. Given --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your position is that in 

ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove 

that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured 

by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against 

multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?

 MR. GANNON: Well, with -- here it's --

we're not trying to prove a separate criminal offense. 

We're trying to prove that the offense --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's my point.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that that's your 

whole argument.

 MR. GANNON: Yes, that it -- this is the 

offense of conviction. This is just like the domestic 

relationship prong of the misdemeanor crime of domestic 

violence that the Court decided in its recent decision 

in United States v Hayes, that -- that there is a prior 

conviction, some aspects of which were elements of the 

underlying offense, and in order to establish whether 

the prior conviction needs the statutory definition in 

the subsequent proceeding, the government will need to 

bear the appropriate burden of proof for that 

proceeding. Whether it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the appropriate 

burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt. That is 

in the second proceeding, the recidivist, the multiple 

offender proceeding --

MR. GANNON: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the relationship, 

domestic relationship had to be proved beyond a 

reasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA 

used.

 MR. GANNON: I -- I think it was beyond the 

reasonable doubt in the context of the 922(g)(9) 

prosecution --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.

 MR. GANNON: We think that if this 

definition were -- were to be applied in the criminal 

context, then we would need to prove this aspect, the 

loss threshold.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you're 

talking about, the alien who is convicted of a 

qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries --

then comes back illegally. The difference between two 

years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to 

prove beyond a reasonable doubt?

 MR. GANNON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to 

be clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory 

maximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior 

conviction for a felony. I think that's something that 

can easily be established through the categorical 

approach and we would not need to have a "beyond a 

reasonable doubt" determination in the illegal reentry 

proceeding under 1326 to determine it's a felony.

 But in order to determine that it is an 

aggravated felony, as long as we could not satisfy 

through a categorical approach to demonstrate that it

was an element of the offense in the original 

proceeding, then, yes, I agree; we would need to meet 

the relevant burden of proof in the 1326(b)(2) 

proceeding.

 Now, as it happens, this -- the extra 

10-year statutory maximum at issue in 1326(b)(2) 

effectively never gets litigated because the sentencing 

guidelines arrange for aggravated felony enhancements in 

that context for crimes like subparagraph (M)(1), ranges 

from 21 months on the low end with no criminal history 

to 5 months on the high end with criminal history of 6. 

And so this effectively -- the extra 10 years of 

statutory range is never employed by -- by judges for 

these types of crimes.

 In the last three years, according to 

sentencing commission data, there isn't a single 

defendant in the 1326 proceeding who received a sentence 

of more than 10 years and had an increase on the basis 

of an aggravated felony that would include the category 

that we're dealing with here in subparagraph (M)(1).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gannon, we're 

dealing with the definition of a particular term, 

aggravated felony. And yet you say the only thing that 

you have to prove under the protections of criminal law 

to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it

involved fraud or deceit. Now, the other elements --

the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses, 

child pornography offenses, national security offenses, 

but here it's fraud or deceit. I mean, it's a felony, 

but there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's 

particularly an aggravated felony.

 MR. GANNON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet that's all 

you have to prove with the protections of the criminal 

law as opposed to the civil.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I think we have to prove 

for purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're 

trying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that 

it also exceeded the $10,000 threshold.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not subject to 

the protections of criminal law that you have to show.

 MR. GANNON: No more --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Beyond the 

reasonable doubt, with the jury protections.

 MR. GANNON: Well, we would need to prove 

that if it were relevant to a criminal proceeding, but 

in the civil removal proceeding those protections aren't 

there. And so we --

I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated,

the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are 

aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to 

approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable 

doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit. And as I said, 

there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it 

doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.

 MR. GANNON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there 

are several other statutes here that have extra limiting 

factors that are necessary to make the crime an 

aggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony, 

but don't have to be proved as an element of the 

original offense. Congress has established --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just --

I think that's kind of begging the question. You assume 

that those elements, those provisions also don't have to 

be proved as elements. And what I'm suggesting, I 

guess, is that if the only thing that makes it 

aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove 

beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to 

look, well, is that really aggravated?

 MR. GANNON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And when you're 

talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, 

yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of 

a run of the mine felony.

MR. GANNON: Well, but for many of the 

offenses it's things that as Petitioner acknowledges, 

would never be proved as elements of the offense. It's 

the notion that a crime of violence is one in which the 

term of imprisonment is at least one year. There are 

other ones that depend on the actual sentence that was 

imposed.

 There is a second or subsequent offense 

that's referred to in subparagraph (J); there is an 

exception for purely political offenses from the 

definition of -- of crime of violence. There are 

affirmative defenses --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I 

don't understand how that's responsive. It's -- it's --

MR. GANNON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- part of violence. 

In other words it seems to me you're already in the 

aggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what 

you have to prove.

 MR. GANNON: But not according to Congress. 

It is only in the area, if it is not a purely political 

offense, and if the term of imprisonment is at least one 

year. And so by definition, it already can't be an 

aggravated felony according to Congress if it doesn't 

meet other factors that we would not have expected the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess I don't 

understand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's --

MR. GANNON: Well, I'm the one that's sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I'm hard to get 

through.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It just -- you're 

saying is that there are exceptions, but I don't see 

that that detracts from the point that "crime of 

violence" -- you think right away, well, that's 

aggravated; national security crimes, that's aggravated; 

firearms offenses, that's aggravated. They're sort of 

on their own without respect to these other things that 

you say you only have to prove by the civil -- pursuant 

to the civil burden requirements. Fraud or deceit -- as 

I guess I've already said, that doesn't strike me as 

particularly aggravated.

 MR. GANNON: Well -- and I think that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What makes it 

aggravated is something as to which you have a much 

lighter burden.

clear and convincing evidence, and -- and it is, in --

in a subsequent criminal proceeding, there will be all 

the constitutional protections that you're talking 

about, just like the domestic relationship prong of the 

-- of the crime that the Court considered in Hayes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I would have thought 

you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a 

crime of violence is an aggravated felony.

 MR. GANNON: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't.

 MR. GANNON: I tried to explain that it is 

not as long as there isn't a sentence that is imposed of 

at least 1 year according to Congress's way of 

determining what is an aggravated felony, and Congress 

has determined that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but the Chief 

Justice points out that the facts that make the fraud 

aggravated are facts that you do not have to prove 

beyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your 

opponent's argument. Therefore, you were not convicted 

by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the aggravated 

felony that's the basis for the immigration order.

 MR. GANNON: Well, that's correct, Justice 

Stevens, but in -- in that regard --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you were not convicted 

of the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this 

case.

 MR. GANNON: Well, no, we think that you 

were convicted of the offense, which is an offense that 

involves fraud or deceit, and then there is the further 

limitation that Congress has imposed, not as an element 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- but you hadn't 

been convicted of the aggravated offense until you 

established its aggravation by proof of less -- not 

under a reasonable doubt. So the word "convicted" 

really is pretty important.

 MR. GANNON: But it -- it can't have that 

same meaning with regard to all of these other things in 

all of these other offenses in which Congress has 

determined they're not an aggravated felony until those 

other criteria are also satisfied. I mean -- so we 

think that in a statute that indisputably involves 

individual offenses that have both elements of the 

offense and nonelement limiting factors in order to 

limit the category to those that Congress would have 

deemed to be aggravated, that it makes sense to not have 

to find as an element of the offense those extra factors 

that generally wouldn't be for most of the other

provisions. And here we know if that reading is imposed 

on this statute, that it reads out all the mainstays of 

Federal fraud prosecutions and brings in a haphazard 

patchwork of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how you read 

the language. I guess -- I guess grammatically it could 

be read either way. You can read it: an offense that 

involves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss 

to the victim exceeds $10,000. Or you could read it: 

convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit, 

in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.

 I mean, "convicted" doesn't necessarily 

apply to the last -- to the last phrase.

 MR. GANNON: And we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's basically 

what we're arguing about.

 MR. GANNON: And we think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the word 

"convicted" -- the question is whether the word 

"convicted" applies to the word "aggravated." That's 

the point, as I understand the Chief Justice's 

questioning, which goes to the burden of proof. So you 

would win even under that approach if you said you had a 

proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors.

 But the thing that creates the -- the

missing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud 

to aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view 

by a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under 

your view, by only clear and convincing evidence.

 MR. GANNON: Well, for purposes of a civil 

removal proceeding, that's true, and that's no different 

from the limiting factors in several of the other 

provisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the 

potential sentence -- whether there was an exception for 

a first offense that involved family members, for the 

alien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and 

(P).

 And the -- this also is a reading that we 

can't impose on subparagraph (M)(ii), where we know that 

there is no loss requirement there, that the government 

have a revenue loss of more than $10,000 for a crime in 

which the loss to the government is $10,000. The "in 

whiches" here are parallel to the "for whiches" 

elsewhere in --in the statute.

 And although Petitioner invokes the guilty 

plea practice in the context of tax evasion offenses for 

purposes of section 7201, this -- this doesn't help his 

argument for the same reason that he cannot use 

extraneous elements and guilty pleas generally to 

establish that something was necessary for a conviction.

But if you look at the criminal tax manual that he 

invokes, it makes clear by referring to relevant conduct 

and the need for the loss amount there to include all of 

the losses for all of the years in the indictment, even 

if the defendant has pleaded guilty to an individual 

count for a single year of tax evasion, that the loss 

amounts that is typically included in guilty pleas in 

7201 cases is not the loss amount that is relevant here. 

It is in fact directly parallel to the sentencing 

stipulation that -- that the Petitioner entered into 

here.

 If the Court has no further questions --

Gannon.

affirmed.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MOSELEY: With respect to the issue of 

deference, the fact that this is part of a Federal 

criminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off 

the inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here. 

We deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and

criminal applications, so that under these 

circumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal 

and in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to 

Babaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be 

triggered.

 I think, moreover, it's important to note 

that the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the 

requirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong 

the fact that there were no statutes involved where 

fraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would 

be an element.

 Finally, I think the government's reading of 

this statute might make sense if Congress had said that 

-- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or 

deceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal 

proceedings in excess of $10,000. But that's not the 

language that Congress employed here, and under these 

circumstances, even if the statute is perceived to be 

ambiguous, that ambiguity should be resolved in the 

Petitioner's favor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To come back to the 

deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the 

criminal conviction? He's convicted criminally 

regardless of how you read that. You acknowledge it 

doesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to

MR. MOSELEY: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?

 MR. MOSELEY: But what the government has 

said, if they're going to do a prosecution under 8 

U.S.C. 1326(b), that they would seek to prove this 

amount de novo in the underlying criminal proceeding. 

So it will form -- it would form part of a -- it would 

form part of a criminal prosecution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in that later 

criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it 

undoubtedly --

MR. MOSELEY: Right, and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But this is not a later 

criminal proceeding; this is an administrative 

proceeding. And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA 

initially to determine how to interpret this language 

for purposes of the deportation laws?

 MR. MOSELEY: It shouldn't, Justice Scalia, 

because we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court 

Leocal, which indeed was also a civil removal 

proceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal 

proceedings. Leocal involved 18 U.S.C. 16 -- 16(b), and

JUSTICE SCALIA: But there -- was it not 

true that there the interpretation placed upon the 

statute by BIA would also be the interpretation 

necessary to secure the criminal conviction? And that's 

not the case here.

 MR. MOSELEY: But it was -- but in 

Lopez-Gonzalez, there was a -- there was a Board of 

Immigration Appeals decision, Matter of Yanez, which was 

directly opposite to what this Court held and ultimately 

rejected in that decision. There -- this clearly is a 

statute, I submit, that implicates -- that implicates a 

Federal criminal prosecution later. And indeed if the 

government, as the government's brief, says that they're 

going to prove this amount in some subsequent illegal 

reentry prosecution, that I submit raises more far more 

concerns with respect to practicality.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I frankly couldn't 

understand the government's concession on that point. I 

thought the -- the offense on illegal entry was to enter 

illegally after you've been deported. It's a -- there's 

a defense if the original deportation was flawed?

 MR. MOSELEY: No --
