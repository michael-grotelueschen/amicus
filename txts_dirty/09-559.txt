(10:11 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed, 

Washington Secretary of State. 

Mr. Bopp. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. BOPP: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

No person should suffer harassment for 

participating in our political system, and the First 

Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting 

from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs 

and their private associations. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about 

requiring disclosure of campaign contributions? 

MR. BOPP: Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that is 

unconstitutional? 

MR. BOPP: This Court has upheld the 

disclosure in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Now, why doesn't 

that fall within your principle that no person should be 

exposed to criticism for --

MR. BOPP: Well, it could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- his political beliefs? 

MR. BOPP: It could potentially, and -- but 

this Court subjected those requirements to the 

appropriate constitutional First Amendment analysis, 

found that there was sufficiently important governmental 

interest, some of which are not present when we’re 

talking about a referendum or initiative, and then also 

created an exception from even a generally valid statute 

where there is a reasonable probability of harassment of 

that particular individual or -- or group. 

So the First Amendment analysis regarding 

the privacy of association, the privacy of identity and 

beliefs, the potential of -- of intimidation are all 

elements of the analysis that was employed by the Court 

in Buckley. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I’m -- I'm trying to separate 

out the harassment aspects of this case from the working 

proposition that there’s some sort of freedom of 

association, of privacy. 

Your theory, putting harassment aside, would 

invalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure 

of voter registration lists, correct? All of those 

States like New York that permit public review of voter 

registration lists and party affiliations, et cetera --

that's illegal? 

MR. BOPP: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's unconstitutional? 

MR. BOPP: No. We believe they would not. 

They would certainly be subject to First Amendment 

analysis. But in -- in those -- in the instance of 

voter registration, there are other governmental 

interests that are not present in petition signings for 

referendums. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain to me the 

difference. And -- well, one other aspect of State 

legislative -- I can only work from New York because I 

know it intimately, but it is a State that also permits 

or requires that petitions for candidate listing on the 

ballot be public as well. New York relies in part, as 

this State does, on the public reviewing those 

petitions. Would that be invalid as well, for a 

candidate's running? 

MR. BOPP: Well, we believe it would be 

subject to First Amendment analysis. But, again, there 

are different governmental interests when you have 

candidates involved. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain to me what 

the difference is in those three situations. 

MR. BOPP: Well, one is you have candidates

involved --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With -- with the State's 

interest. 

MR. BOPP: One is you have candidates 

involved. And this Court recognized in Buckley that 

there were disclosure interests that related 

specifically, and actually only, to candidates. For 

instance, people who contribute to a candidate, that 

information, to the voter, can signal the interests that 

the candidate, once he or she takes office, will be 

responsive to. 

When we have an initiative, we know what the 

law is that is being voted upon. It's not a matter 

of -- of electing a representative. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that --

putting aside this kind of referendum, just a 

hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax 

scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested 

in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are 

interested in that particular tax benefit or not? 

MR. BOPP: Well, a few -- few might be, but 

we think this is marginal information. First, they are 

adopting a law. And so we know what the law is. And --

and while it might be marginal information for a few 

people, once the measure qualifies for the ballot, this

is only -- the petition signature and distribution is 

only for a very limited governmental interest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

MR. BOPP: And that -- and that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, go ahead 

and finish your answer. 

MR. BOPP: And that limited governmental 

interest is to preserve State money, to not conduct an 

election on the matter unless there is sufficient public 

support. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, counsel, the 

responses you have given to a couple of the questions 

has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply. 

But given you have a facial challenge, is that enough? 

Don't you have to indicate that the First Amendment 

analysis would prevail in either all of the other cases, 

most of the other cases, a significant portion? 

This is a facial challenge. And if the 

challenge is going to fail in some of those other cases, 

I think your facial challenge fails as well. 

MR. BOPP: Well, we’re only challenging the 

application of the Public Records Act to petitions and 

referendum petitions. We're not challenging it as it 

would be applied to petitions to put people on the 

ballot.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to decide, 

in assessing your claim that, no matter what the 

referendum issue was, that there's a significant 

intrusion on First Amendment rights? 

MR. BOPP: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if, for 

example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to 

which people may have particular views, but they’re not 

going to get terribly excited about it, we’d still have to 

say that that’s protected under the First Amendment? 

MR. BOPP: Well, actually, under -- with 

modern technology, it only takes a few dedicated 

supporters, and a computer, who are willing to map -- to 

put this information on the Internet, MapQuest it, as 

they did with respect to the contributors of 

Proposition 8, which resulted in -- and then encourage 

people to harass and intimidate them, which resulted in 

hundreds of examples of harassment --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, my point is, 

though, you’re not likely to get that with respect to, 

you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from 

0.8 percent to 0.9 percent. You’re not going to get a 

crowd outside your house because you signed that 

petition. 

MR. BOPP: Well, it may not manifest itself

in -- in any particular initiative. We agree with that, 

but we think the potential is there, and there is 

usually a group of supporters of any measure that, you 

know, are passionate about that particular issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but don't you 

have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the 

complaint. 

MR. BOPP: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Count 2 would be the 

counterpart to the exception that’s made from the 

disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with 

certain organizations whose members might be harassed. 

MR. BOPP: Well, with this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- that's not --

that would still be open if you lose the first part of 

this case. 

So going back to the question you were 

asked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia 

asked -- how does this differ from the contributor who 

says, well, I might be harassed? The contributor 

would have an opportunity to show that. 

MR. BOPP: Buckley dealt with that exact 

question. And first -- the first step of the analysis 

is whether or not the law is -- is valid under the First 

Amendment. And then there is an exception to even a

valid constitutional -- a constitutionally valid law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's why I’m asking 

you why, on the first part, should it be any different, 

as long as you have the door open to show that if you 

were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an 

exception would have to be made? 

MR. BOPP: Well, we don't think that the exception 

is a substitute for considering the initial validity of 

the law, which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask you 

one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in 

the Secretary's brief. Is this list available to 

Project Marriage? And specifically on page 34 of 

Secretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the 

sponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these 

lists. They use them for fundraising purposes. So that 

would be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one 

side. Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses 

these lists? 

MR. BOPP: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes? 

MR. BOPP: Yes, this is an act of private 

association. The petition signers are associating with 

the referendum committee for purposes of placing this 

measure on the ballot --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They don't say: Now, I 

agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes. But 

that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the 

petition that the --

MR. BOPP: Well, what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- signature collector 

can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising 

purposes? 

MR. BOPP: What is implicit is they are 

associating with this group for a purpose, and that is 

support for, in this case, Referendum 71. And so they 

use those names for valid purposes. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bopp, do you have any 

case in which we have held that the First Amendment 

applies to activity that consists of the process of 

legislation, of legislating --

MR. BOPP: Yes, Buckley II. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or of adopting legislation? 

What is that? 

MR. BOPP: Buckley II. You struck down the 

requirement that the person who is soliciting signatures 

self-identify. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is --

MR. BOPP: That is a process --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Soliciting signatures is not

taking part in the process of legislating. 

MR. BOPP: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The person who requests a 

referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of 

signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in 

that. 

And in light of the fact that for the first 

century of our existence, even voting was public -- you 

either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later, 

you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so 

that people knew which party you were voting for -- the 

fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount 

of civic courage. And the First Amendment does not 

protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls 

when you exercise your political rights to legislate or 

to take part in the legislative process. 

MR. BOPP: Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are asking us to enter 

into a whole new field where we’ve never gone before. 

MR. BOPP: Well, with all due respect, you 

have already opined in Buckley II that the person on the 

other side of the clipboard is protected by the First 

Amendment. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think that's --

that's true of Buckley II. What was -- what this Court

said could not be done is that the solicitor could not 

be made to wear a badge that says "I am a paid 

solicitor," but that the solicitor's name had to be 

identified for the State. Certainly, the solicitor --

there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with 

whatever was the State agency. 

So what was -- what this Court said could 

not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button 

that says "I am a paid solicitor," but the solicitor's 

name and address certainly had to be disclosed. 

MR. BOPP: That is true. You've correctly 

described Buckley II. But as we can see in the facts of 

this case, the public disclosure of the petition names 

in this case -- there was a planned harassment and 

intimidation of these voters by --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me -- let me ask 

you, could the opponents of a particular ballot measure 

organize a boycott for -- and picket businesses whose 

managers had supported that boycott? 

MR. BOPP: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Had supported that 

initiative? 

MR. BOPP: Yes. Under the --

didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so, 

then it seems to me that the State's -- or 

that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their 

names private is somewhat diminished. 

MR. BOPP: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a First Amendment 

activity. 

MR. BOPP: But what we're -- but what is 

involved here that is not involved there is the 

requirement by the government that you publicly disclose 

your identity and beliefs on a matter that then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- just --

MR. BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me stop you there, 

because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said 

twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's 

belief from the mere signature. You said it could be 

support for -- for the proposition or it could be just 

support for letting the people decide. 

MR. BOPP: That is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or it could even be, you 

say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to 

placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we’ll 

just sign. So you -- you have said that -- that 

the signing itself is ambiguous. You don't know what

the reason is. It doesn't necessarily mean that the 

person is a supporter of the proposition. 

MR. BOPP: But, with all due respect, we 

did not say the third. We did say the first and the 

second. And -- but either of those are political 

statements. The highlighted box at the top, you know, 

states -- states that by signing R-71, we can reverse that 

decision, meaning the passage of a law, and protect 

marriage between a man and a woman. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I call your attention 

to page 20 of your reply brief? Because I don't think 

that your response was correct. You say: Do petition 

signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would 

like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid 

any further discussion with the petition circulator? 

MR. BOPP: I acknowledge that we said that, 

Justice Ginsburg. And, of course, the second statement 

is -- and which I think is the dominant statement and 

certainly sufficient -- and that is that we want a measure 

to be placed on the ballot in order for the people to 

vote. That is one of the central --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter --

if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is 

satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that 

person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum

to see whether the statute should be blocked? 

MR. BOPP: I think it's very unlikely. But 

it -- we acknowledge it's possible, but we think it's 

very unlikely. 

JUSTICE ALITO: It's possible --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- but if you were in the 

real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a 

referendum petition with respect to a statute that was 

passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you 

think would be opposed to that legislation? 

MR. BOPP: Very few. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so Justice Alito's 

question points out that this would be a very slim basis 

upon which to rest a holding in your favor. 

And just to go back to the line of questions 

of the first, the State of California has very 

complicated referendum and initiative matters. Don't 

you think it's relevant for the public to know that, 

say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put 

those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of 

Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had 

paid solicitors to put this on the ballot? 

Isn't that part of assessing the -- the 

reasons why this initiative was proposed? And isn't

that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an 

informed decision? 

MR. BOPP: Well, actually, after your 

Buckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the 

requirement of disclosing the paid circulators. And, of 

course, in California, petitions are not public. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They did that. It wasn't 

due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged, 

under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed. 

MR. BOPP: Well, the Ninth Circuit thought 

it was Buckley. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me, but the point is, 

isn't -- isn’t there an interest in knowing this 

information? Not -- not that it's paid. 

MR. BOPP: There is no evidence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We'll leave that out. 

But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that 

supported the amendment. 

MR. BOPP: There’s no evidence in the 

record that that is pertinent information, and, at most, 

we think it is marginal information. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we create 

this right of -- this constitutional right of 

association in the manner that you are describing it, 

why is it limited to the voting area?

Would we be inviting review if a group of 

citizens get together and send a letter to an agency 

that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y 

regulation? Would the agency be prohibited from making 

that letter public? 

MR. BOPP: Well, potentially. And -- and 

this Court -- I -- because it would be required to be 

subject to a First Amendment analysis. It's this Court 

that created, in the NAACP case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're -- you're 

suggesting --

MR. BOPP: -- the right of private 

association. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that when a 

petitioner or a person engages in political discourse 

with the government, that they -- when they choose to do 

it, because the government is not compelling them to 

write to it; it’s not compelling them to sign the 

referendum. It's just --

MR. BOPP: And they’re not compelling 

Ms. McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either. But 

this Court held that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's -- but 

Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its 

process in her favor. She was asking for political

has a lot of options. For instance, they don't have to 

conduct elections for the election of judge. But if 

they opt to do that and provide that procedure, well, 

then, the First Amendment applies to the political 

speech. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to follow up on 

Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency 

could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a 

proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and 

your address and your telephone number and your 

political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital 

status and your income level and all sorts of other 

demographic information? 

MR. BOPP: And your employer, as in this 

case here. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could they do that? 

MR. BOPP: No -- no, because there is no 

sufficient governmental interest that would justify it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not even just your name, so 

they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all 

the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person? 

MR. BOPP: They, of course, can -- can check

MR. BOPP: Yes, they can get your name --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. BOPP: -- and we’re not objecting to 

filing of a petition. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you’re objecting to 

the public being able to check whether the agency is 

indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or 

not, correct? 

MR. BOPP: No. No, I'm not objecting to 

that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Really? 

MR. BOPP: They have procedures to check and 

verify these signatures that do not involve public 

disclosure. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't you have some 

options, too? Have you started a referendum to repeal 

the -- the California law that requires disclosure? 

MR. BOPP: California law does not require 

disclosure of the petitions, and that has been upheld by 

the courts of California. And you can verify these 

signatures.

MR. BOPP: They did not publicly disclose 

the petitions for a century. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been a good 

idea. 

MR. BOPP: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the -- a 

majority of the voters in Washington decided that, and 

one of the purposes of the First Amendment is to protect 

minorities. 

MR. BOPP: Well, only in the most general 

sense. They adopted a Public Records Act. They didn't 

adopt a law that specifically required the disclosure of 

these petitions. But in a general sense, they did. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, this is not a 

peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's 

correct, isn't it? Aren't there about 20-odd States 

that require disclosure of the names of signers to 

initiatives, referenda? 

MR. BOPP: That is true. Some -- some in 

their initiative and referendum statute, because they 

actually provide some public input on verification where 

Washington does not; others under their Public Records 

Act. Some do not, such as California. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- but what you’re

those other States that have -- that have public 

disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions. 

MR. BOPP: Well, one -- one thing we say is 

different between Washington and these other States is 

that Washington provides no way for the public, even if 

they get access to the petitions, to participate in the 

verification process. 

The only thing the public can do is have --

observe -- a limited number of observers. These 

observers are prohibited from --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there were 

instances where the State official missed something and 

a member of the public who had access to the list of 

signers said: Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my 

neighbor who died 5 years ago. 

MR. BOPP: That's not allowed in the State 

of Washington. The instructions from the Secretary of 

State is while you can have observers to observe the 

process, the people --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you mean if -- that was 

over. It passed the screen of the Secretary of State. 

It's disclosed to the public. If someone then said 

you've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State 

would do nothing about it?

Petitioners here -- weren't two of the Petitioners here 

seeking the list so that they could go over the 

certification process the State had done to ensure that 

they had certified all the right people, et cetera? 

MR. BOPP: Well, one of -- one of the 

intervenors sought an exception from the -- from the 

injunction, which we did not object to, that -- that 

they would have access to the list. But under 

confidentiality and protective order --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to the 

privacy questions. You responded to Justice Ginsburg by 

saying that there was no way to challenge the State's 

process of validation, and that -- I don't think that's 

correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh. 

MR. BOPP: What I -- what I said is there’s 

no role for the public in verifying signatures. You can 

ask for judicial review --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's assuming the 

answer, meaning if they don't have the right to access, 

they can't. But, legally, they can challenge it if they 

find on the petitions that things were erroneously 

counted by the State. They can go into court and prove 

that. 

MR. BOPP: The only thing that they could do 

is request that the court does its own count. In other 

words, there's judicial review available. But the 

public has no role in the verification, but they can 

trigger judicial review. And then the court conducts 

its own count. 

In other words, this is not an adversary 

process in which people come in and present evidence 

of -- of people's -- of invalid signatures. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you involve the 

court? If the State's -- the executive representative 

of the State says: Oh, we missed that. Now we're going 

to have to deal with it. We don't need any court to 

order us to do it.

the public noticing that there are people on the list

MR. BOPP: Well, the -- the observer --

under the Washington procedure, observers can observe 

the process, and if they feel, or if anyone feels, 

that there has been an inadequate job in -- in 

verification, then they can ask for judicial review. 

And then the court conducts the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would they ask for 

judicial review instead of going first to the State's 

Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people 

missed it?

that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why involve the court? 

MR. BOPP: That's not -- there’s no 

procedure for that. You know, if they wanted to involve

this procedure and other procedures. They’re claiming

involved in verification. Well, there’s no

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another --

MR. BOPP: -- to be involved in verification. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there another 

possible public interest? Would it be a legitimate public 

interest to say I’d like to know who signed the 

petition because I would like to try to persuade them 

that their views should be modified? 

Is there a public interest in encouraging 

debate on the underlying issue? 

MR. BOPP: Well, it's possible, but we think 

this information is marginal. In other words, the --

it's much more important --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does identify 

people who have a -- a particular point of view on a 

public issue. And if you had the other point of view, 

don't you have an interest in finding out who you’d 

like to convince to change their minds? 

MR. BOPP: Well, we -- we think it's a -- a 

very marginal interest. The Ninth Circuit recently 

ruled that if you give a small contribution to an 

initiative, there's not -- I mean, nobody cares. So why 

should it be publicly disclosed when it's so marginal?

criticism; it's the public -- it's the government 

requiring you to disclose your identity and beliefs. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But part of the reason is 

so you can be out there and be responsible for the 

positions you’ve taken. 

MR. BOPP: Well, then why don't they require 

both sides? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that people -- people 

can criticize you for the position you have taken. 

MR. BOPP: Then why don't they require both 

sides if that was the purpose?

sides"? The other side hasn't signed anything. When they

the identity of these people and whether or not these 

interests are sufficient. 

Could I reserve the balance of my time?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. McKENNA 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

I’d like to begin with the question of 

how the public can bring to the attention of the 

government that errors and fraud have been discovered. 

First of all, it's important to understand 

that the petitions do not become public records after 

the verification process but, in fact, are made available 

as public records before the verification process even 

begins. 

This is because the Secretary of State's 

first step after receiving submitted petitions is to 

take them to his archiving section and to have them 

digitized. As soon as they’re digitized, they’re 

available on disks for anyone who requests them. Then 

the verification process begins. 

During the verification process, it is 

possible --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How much time are we 

talking about in those processes? 

MR. McKENNA: The verification process, 

Justice Sotomayor?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

MR. McKENNA: The verification process 

will depend on how many signatures have been 

submitted --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. I'm trying 

to get the relationship between the disks being made 

available and the verification process. 

So is there a time for the public to look 

through the disks before the people who are sent into 

the room are sent into the room? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you’ve just 

said --

MR. McKENNA: Yes, they’re --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they're --

that they are immediately available on the disk, and 

so while the checking is going on by the Secretary, 

the public has the list. Is that what you’ve just said? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, that's correct. For 

example, in the case of Referendum 71, the proponents of 

the referendum submitted the petition sheets on 

Saturday, July 25, 2009, and on Tuesday, July 28, a 

records request was already submitted. And so they 

can obtain records --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would these 

records --

MR. McKENNA: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or was that part of the 

initiative and referendum structure before the Public 

Records Act was passed? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, this is 

part of the Public Records Act. This is as a result of 

the Public Records Act that these petition sheets are 

made available. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- all right. So 

this -- the public record -- pardon me. The -- in 

California, we call it an initiative and referendum 

process -- existed and was in place before the Public 

Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there was a judgment at 

one time by the State of Washington that it didn't --

that it didn't need the public records disclosure? 

MR. McKENNA: Well, when the initiative 

and referendum processes were created by public vote on 

a constitutional amendment of 1912, there was no 

Public Records Act at all. And the Public Records Act, 

an Act of general applicability, was adopted by the

voters in 1973 as part of an initiative which also 

enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if the 

State had a law that you could disclose voters and for 

whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment 

interests? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we 

would -- we do believe that First Amendment interests 

would be implicated by revealing how people voted, and 

we don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how 

people voted, only in who voted. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the country was acting 

unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted 

the Australian secret ballot? Do you really think that? 

MR. McKENNA: No. No, Justice Scalia. I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That it was 

unconstitutional --

MR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a whole century 

not to have a secret ballot? 

MR. McKENNA: No, Justice Scalia, I 

didn't say that I thought that the secret ballot was 

constitutionally required. I was asked by the Chief 

Justice whether some First Amendment interests would be 

implicated. They probably would be.

implicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know 

your vote is going to be revealed. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think having 

your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have 

a chilling effect on whether you sign it? 

MR. McKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, some 

chill may result, just as some chill may result from 

having your campaign contributions disclosed or the 

fact that you have registered to vote and provided your 

name, address, your voting history is being disclosed. 

So some chill might be -- might result, but we do not 

think that it is significant enough. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think 

revealing that you’re a voter has the same chilling 

effect as revealing how you voted, do you? 

MR. McKENNA: No, I do not. I think how 

you voted would have a much greater chilling effect than 

the fact that you are registered to vote.

voting in New England unconstitutional? Is the caucus 

system in Iowa for presidential candidates 

unconstitutional? The Court in this case does not

told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated 

with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't 

require people to reveal how they voted. 

MR. McKENNA: We don't -- we don't know 

if this Court would rule that the vote could never be 

revealed. We know that in some places, votes are done 

in public. We know that before the late 1800s, there 

was no secret ballot. We just -- we don't know what the 

constitutional ruling would be. But we -- we do know 

that in this case, it's not necessary for the Court to 

reach that -- that determination, because in this 

case --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I’d like to know 

how far you -- you are -- you want to go. You say in

signature petitions allows Washington voters to engage

acts secured the election and suspension of State law. 

So would -- would it be consistent with the 

First Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition 

to put down not just the person's name and address, but 

also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in 

a conversation about what they had done? 

MR. McKENNA: It -- it would depend on 

the strength of the State interest in having the 

telephone number. The State does not have an interest 

in the telephone number on the petition form, because 

the State has -- only needs to know from the petition 

form the name and the address in order to verify --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that you were 

saying that one of the interests that's served by this 

is to allow people who -- to allow Washington citizens 

to discuss this matter with those who signed the 

petition. So putting down the telephone number would 

assist them in doing that. 

MR. McKENNA: It -- yes, it probably 

would make it easier for people to contact. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So you would --

Would it be consistent with the First 

Amendment to require anybody who signs a petition to 

list the person's religion? 

MR. McKENNA: No, I do not believe it 

would, Justice Alito. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that in 1957 in 

Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted 

to put on the ballot a petition to require the school 

board to reopen Central High School, which had been 

closed because there was a sentiment in the community 

that they didn't want integration. And it was pointed 

out that if they signed this petition, there was a very 

good chance that their businesses would be bombed, that 

they would certainly be boycotted, that their children

might be harassed. 

Now, is there no First Amendment right in 

protecting those people? And if there is, how does it 

differ from your case? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Breyer, that is 

count 2. That is count 2 of the Petitioners' 

complaint. This Court ruled as recently as Citizens 

United that such situations should be evaluated on a 

case-by-case basis to evaluate the reasonable 

probability of threats, harassments, and reprisals. But 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- you would have no 

objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the 

names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is 

demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are 

violent and will do violence to the people who signed 

the petition? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Scalia. That 

would be the Socialist Workers Party case. This -- this 

Court has ruled that, on a case-by-case basis, it is 

possible that some information otherwise disclosed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business 

boycott? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is just a general 

challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition

signers? 

MR. McKENNA: Of any type of petition 

including nominating petitions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. McKENNA: -- initiative petitions, 

and the rest. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about a business 

boycott? Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of 

disclosing the name? 

MR. McKENNA: Well, of course, boycotts 

have been upheld under the First Amendment in Claiborne 

Hardware, and so if someone wanted to boycott a business 

because it turned out that the manager of the business 

had been a supporter of a particular ballot measure, 

that would be allowable, of course, to that person 

choosing to boycott. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your answer 

to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied 

challenge. Now, that as-applied challenge would be 

small comfort unless the names were protected pending 

the resolution of that challenge, correct? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a stay 

should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners 

to pursue an as-applied challenge.

MR. McKENNA: Yes, of course -- yes, 

they could apply for another preliminary injunction if 

this Court upholds the court of appeals. They were able 

to obtain that preliminary injunction in this case, 

which is why these petition forms have not been released 

to date, except under a protective order by the court to 

the opponents. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that 

the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of 

their as-applied challenge, would subject them to 

incidents of violence and intimidation? 

MR. McKENNA: We -- there is no evidence 

of that in the record. There's no evidence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There’s no 

evidence -- there’s no evidence of episodes of violence 

or intimidation? 

MR. McKENNA: Involving the 

Referendum 71 signers? No. The evidence in the record 

is about people who were out circulating petitions, 

people who were out, you know, campaigning for the 

petitions, the campaign manager for the measure. But 

none of the evidence in the record speaks to petition 

signers, and none of the evidence in the record speaks

to petition signers for other, similar measures which 

were cited by the Petitioners. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that because nobody 

got to count 2? And the district court -- this whole 

case in the lower courts was on count 1 alone; wasn't 

that so? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, that is -- yes, that 

is correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And count 2 is the one 

that deals with the harassment. 

MR. McKENNA: That is true, 

Justice Ginsburg. Of course, in several other States, 

Arkansas, Florida, and Massachusetts, which had similar 

measures regarding gay civil rights or same-sex marriage 

on the ballot -- in those three States, the petition 

forms were obtained under public records, were put on 

the Internet, and no evidence has been provided that’s 

in the record that anyone who signed any of those 

petitions in those three States was subjected to 

harassment --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say somebody is 

thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive 

subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from 

signing because they fear retaliation. At what point 

could they bring this as-applied challenge?

Do they have to -- could they do it before 

they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that 

if -- if these names -- if people are not assured ahead 

of time that their name and address is not going to be 

revealed to the public on the Internet, they’re not 

going to sign this? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, it would be 

possible procedurally for them to bring the motion for 

an injunction even before collecting the signatures --

JUSTICE ALITO: And how would they --

MR. McKENNA: -- if they had sufficient 

evidence. 

JUSTICE ALITO: How would they prove that 

there’s -- that there’s a -- a threat, a sufficient 

threat of harassment in that particular case, before the 

petition is even signed? 

MR. McKENNA: I believe that the 

sponsors of the measure would bring to the court 

evidence, if they have any, of -- because of the 

controversial nature of that particular measure, that is 

based on what's happened to some of the people who were 

planning to put the measure on the ballot. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you -- you’ve 

rejected that here. You’ve said there’s no evidence here 

that any of the petition -- petition signers were

subjected to any harassment. 

MR. McKENNA: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course there isn't, 

because the names haven't gotten out yet. How could you 

possibly demonstrate before the names get out that 

petition signers are going to be subjected to 

harassment? 

MR. McKENNA: One could look to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or otherwise, don't insist 

upon evidence that these very petition signers will be 

harassed. 

MR. McKENNA: I imagine, Justice Scalia, 

that the individuals moving for that preliminary 

injunction would do what the Petitioners have done in 

this case. They would cite to an example from another 

State involving a comparable measure. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that would be 

an acceptable type of evidence? 

MR. McKENNA: They could bring it into the 

court. I'm not saying the court would accept it, 

because I don't know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you don't think 

it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you’re not making

say it couldn't be acceptable. I'm saying this is a 

hypothetical, so I don't know what the evidence would 

look like in the hypothetical example. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the -- the 

hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated, 

the supporters came into court, and they said: Look what 

has happened in California with -- with Proposition 8. 

Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public 

disclosure of the names and addresses here. 

Would that be sufficient? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, I think 

that the evidence would have to be very strong. It 

would have to rise above criticism. I think it would 

have to rise to the level of threatened violence. It 

would have to rise to the level of the Socialist Workers 

Party case, for example, or the NAACP case. 

I think the standard would be very high. 

But it would be up to the trial judge to decide whether 

or not the evidence was sufficient to issue the 

preliminary injunction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- the State has 

had this procedure now for some time, and there have 

been controversial ballot initiatives. Is there any 

history in the State of Washington that signers have 

been subject to harassment?

Mr. Chief Justice, we have had measures on assisted

petitions.

in favor or opposed to assisted suicide? 

MR. McKENNA: It was -- well, the 

referendum challenges the assisted suicide law. So if 

you vote for the referendum, you vote to uphold the 

legislature's adoption of that law, which -- which 

allowed assisted suicide. 

So there have been controversial measures. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This case will likely be 

controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because 

that's the most fully developed. 

Did you look at the Petition Clause at all? 

In the early days of the republic, the petitions were 

the way in which you communicated with your legislator. 

MR. McKENNA: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I tried to look it up. 

I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those 

petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional 

Record. But did you look at the history of the Petition 

Clause? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Kennedy, we have 

considered the history of the Petition Clause, and we 

see a basic difference between the kinds of petitions 

under the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue 

here because, essentially, petitioning the government 

under the Petition Clause is asking the government to do

something. You’re petitioning them: Please do 

something. 

The petitions for a referendum or an 

initiative are telling the government to do something. 

The petition form says that I, the signer, am directing 

the Secretary of State to conduct an election. And by 

submitting these petitions in a referendum, I am 

suspending the law which the legislature has already 

approved until the election has taken place. 

Tell versus ask. I think that's a pretty 

big -- a significant difference. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, of course, that can 

cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a 

vote. And there -- there is strong interest in keeping 

the -- the vote private. 

MR. McKENNA: And, Justice Kennedy, I’d 

like to speak to that question, because several 

Justices asked: Well, what can we tell from what, you 

know, someone who signed? Do we know how they’re going 

to vote. 

I -- I agree that many people signing a 

petition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of 

an initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would 

put on the ballot. But also we know from the social 

science research, which is cited, for example, in the

Direct Democracy Scholars green brief, that many people 

sign simply because they believe it's important for 

the -- for the public to have an opportunity to vote. 

And, of course, as the Petitioners have acknowledged and 

we also point out, some people vote just to get around the 

circulator and get into the store. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What percentage --

what percentage of the people who signed this petition 

to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it 

because they think these sort of things should be 

generally put to a public vote as opposed to because 

they opposed the law? 

MR. McKENNA: The percentage of people 

who believe simply that there should be a vote held has 

not been quantified by the research, except that several 

scholars indicate that it is significant. So, whether 

it's 20 percent or 40 percent, I -- I really can't say 

within a certain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think as much as 

20 percent of the people who signed this petition are 

actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal? 

MR. McKENNA: It is possible. But it's 

also possible some of those 20 percent don't have an 

opinion on the law, Mr. Chief Justice. They simply 

think that there should be a vote held, and they’ll

make their mind up later on. 

There are plenty of people who aren't aware 

when certain laws are -- are adopted that are subjected 

to a referendum, and they may not have decided at all. 

In fact, one of the reasons they may sign the petition 

is to say: Well, I'm not sure how I'm going to vote, 

but, you know, I think a public vote would be a good 

idea. So, I'm going to let it go forward to be on the 

ballot, and I’ll decide. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question? 

It seems to me your -- the strongest State interest here 

is detecting fraud. And you mentioned that the records 

are digitized. And maybe you can correct my impression 

of this, but it seems to me that if the records are 

digitized, there are very simple ways of detecting fraud 

that would not require the disclosure of the list to the 

public. 

If somebody wants to see whether his or her 

name has been fraudulently put on the list, wouldn't it 

be very simple to set up a Web site where the person 

could put in a little bit of identifying information and 

see whether that person's name is on the list? And if 

the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person 

lives at a particular address, couldn't you just 

cross-reference by means of a computer program the

information on the referendum with the -- with the 

voting lists? 

So if you've got John Jones who lives at 10 

Main Street, you see whether there really is a 

registered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street? 

Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet? 

MR. McKENNA: Justice Alito, the -- just 

to be clear, you are right. They do use computer --

computers because when -- in the verification process, 

the Secretary of State’s staff, with the observers looking 

over their shoulder, will look at the petition and look 

up that voter in an -- in an electronic voter 

registration database. 

This is exactly why the information is so 

useful to the public as well. They have access to 

electronic online voter registration history as well, 

and they can also check. 

In -- in Massachusetts, under their public 

records law in 2006, petition forms obtained by public 

records requests were put online, and over 2,000 people, 

as has been documented in the Lambda amicus brief, 

discovered that they -- their names are on petitions 

that they claimed did not sign, and discovered that they 

had been, in some cases, misled.

my question? Couldn't you -- couldn't this be done very 

simply? If I want to see whether somebody has 

fraudulently signed my name, very quickly go to a 

Web site, wouldn't be expensive to set up, put in your 

voter ID number, and see whether -- and your name, and 

see whether you’re on the -- on the --

MR. McKENNA: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- whether you --

somebody signed your name to the petition? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, Justice Alito, 

that -- that could be done. In our State and the 

other States that's done when somebody requests the public 

records and chooses them to put online. The State 

doesn't -- does not put the petition forms online 

itself, although, you know, other information is put 

online by the State. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do we take this case 

on the assumption -- do you make the contention before 

us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it 

are not capable of determining whether the petition 

signatures are valid? 

MR. McKENNA: No, we are not taking 

that position, Justice Kennedy. Of course --

disclosure?

MR. McKENNA: What we know, 

Justice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around 

the -- around the country, as recently as 2009 in 

Maryland, 2006 in Massachusetts, and so on, it was 

the -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions 

by public records request who found significant fraud 

and error. This isn't just about fraud -- fraud is very 

important -- it's also about finding plain old mistakes 

which the State, Secretary of State, or auditor has 

missed. 

That -- that does happen with regularity in 

this country, and we cite cases in our brief where error 

is not fraud, but errors in Washington State have been 

discovered by people who look at these public records. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes the public may 

not trust the Secretary of State. 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, sir. Justice Scalia, 

we agree. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it may be an issue in 

which his administration has taken a particularly firm 

stand, and the public may not trust the job that the 

Secretary of State does. 

MR. McKENNA: That goes to the heart to 

the Public Records Act, Justice Scalia: Trust but

verify. The people did not leave to the State the idea 

that, well, we’ll let you know what you need to know. 

The people want a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Trust but verify -- I like 

that. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You did say something 

about this category of speech. You said, well, this is 

in the category that -- it's like O'Brien. It has speech 

elements and non-speech elements. And I was trying to 

figure out which -- what is it in the signature that 

speaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't 

speak? 

MR. McKENNA: The speech element could 

be construed in the fact that someone has chosen to sign 

a petition which we know means they want something to be 

put on the ballot. So, they favor having it on the 

ballot. That -- that much we know. 

But we also looked to Burdick, of course, 

because in this -- in -- in the Burdick decision this 

Court held that write-in voting could be prohibited by 

the State of Hawaii. That was upheld by the court of 

appeals and this Court. And this Court found that 

writing in a candidate's name was not even expressive 

conduct.

So we look to the Burdick level of 

intermediate scrutiny, to the O'Brien level of 

intermediate scrutiny for the test. 

Justice Ginsburg, the other point I wanted 

to bring up is something about Buckley II, which --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the -- to finish 

your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, what is the 

non-speech component of signing a petition? 

MR. McKENNA: The non-speech component 

is suspension of law in the case of a referendum or the 

legislative effect. We believe this is a legislative 

act fundamentally. In --

JUSTICE ALITO: And what's the State's interest 

in regulating the non-speech component? When you --

when you talk about the vote cast by an elected 

representative, of course, there's a strong interest in 

knowing how an elected representative voted, because the 

representative is answerable to the voters. But 

somebody who signs a petition isn’t answerable to 

anybody -- any other citizen. So what’s your interest? 

MR. McKENNA: The interest, Justice 

Alito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a 

sufficient number of signatures submitted to qualify the 

measure for the ballot. 

JUSTICE ALITO: It’s the fraud interest?

And, secondly, there is a valid informational 

interest in knowing who is it exactly who’s calling for 

this election and suspending the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, but how far does that 

go? When I asked whether you could -- you want to know 

the religion of the people who signed, no, you can't do 

that. How much more demographic information could be 

-- could be -- does the -- does the State of 

Washington have an interest in making publicly available 

about the people who support this election? 

Let's say it's -- it's a referendum about 

immigration. Does the State of Washington have an 

interest in providing information to somebody who says 

I want to know how many people with Hispanic names 

signed this, or how many people with Asian names signed 

this? Is that -- that what you want to facilitate? 

MR. McKENNA: No, Justice Alito, we 

don't need to know that. We need to know whether there 

were a sufficient number of registered voters who 

signed -- we need to know whether they signed more than 

once. We need to know they are registered in Washington 

State. 

Informational interest I think that you could 

-- the information you could collect to satisfy

informational interest might include other information 

that’s in the voter registration records. You might 

want to know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the 

reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have 

information that would allow them to participate in the 

civic process, and there are people who -- might think 

it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested 

by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group 

or not. So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief 

would say the State has an interest in that type of 

disclosure. 

MR. McKENNA: I don't see what the valid 

State interest would be of knowing the ethnicity of the 

person. I mean, of course, anyone could look at the 

petition ballot forms and, I suppose, divine something about 

the ethnicity based on the last name, but the State's 

interest doesn't go -- go to that. That we -- we 

don't believe we need to know that. We believe we need 

to know what is requested -- required on the -- on the 

petition form. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand what 

information is being -- what information you think you’re 

providing to the public. Outside of the fraud area, 

if I see that John Jones from Seattle signed this

petition, that tells me absolutely nothing. 

MR. McKENNA: Well, Justice Alito, it 

might -- if you know John Jones, that would tell you 

something. Number two, we know from the -- we know from 

the, you know, Direct Democracy Scholars green brief 

that intermediaries and especially the press and 

sometimes social science researchers and others will --

will look at the names, and they’ll be able to tell, 

for example, that a large number of employees at one 

company signed a measure; maybe it's a measure that would cut 

a tax break for a particular industry. Or perhaps members 

of a union, in large numbers, have signed. They have been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they --

MR. McKENNA: -- able to provide 

that information. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can they find that out 

with just the name and address, that a large number of people 

from a company signed it? 

MR. McKENNA: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to 

put on who you work for, do you? 

MR. McKENNA: No, you do not. I'm 

saying intermediaries might discover this, for example, 

by taking a close look at who’s paying for the 

signature gathering. If it's paid signature gathering,

they might be aware of prominent sponsors. In fact, 

the -- the importance of knowing who the sponsors is, is 

demonstrated --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm still 

on the companies. How -- how does knowing who the 

sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular 

company signed the petition? 

MR. McKENNA: Well, a voter who -- who 

works at that same company or does business with that 

same company might know that, gosh, I know these 

employees, and they've -- they have all signed this 

petition. The press might be able to do the research to 

find that out. Intermediaries do play an important role. 

The last point, if I may, I wanted to make 

about -- about Buckley II is that the Petitioners have 

stressed that Buckley II struck down the requirement to wear 

the name badge. But in that same decision this Court 

upheld the requirement by Colorado that affidavits 

signed by the petition circulators, including the 

petition circulator's name and address, can be disclosed 

as public records. 

And the Court ruled that -- found that and 

compared it favorably to the badge requirement because 

the disclosures of public record occurred after the heat 

of the moment, after the moment of interactive discussion.

It happened later on. And we believe, of all the Court's 

rulings, that -- that approval of the disclosure requirement 

of the -- of the affidavit, in contrast to the badges, is the 

most similar to requiring after the fact or allowing 

after the fact for petitions to be disclosed under the 

Public Records Act. 

JUSTICE ALITO: You know, if somebody called 

your office and said I'd like the -- the home 

address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney 

General’s Office because we want to -- we want to go to 

their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with 

them --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- which is what has been 

alleged here, would you release that information? 

MR. McKENNA: We would not, Justice 

Alito. We would not release it because they can come to 

the office and have uncomfortable conversations with 

them --

(Laughter.) 

MR. McKENNA: -- which I can personally 

attest happens with some regularity.

least the names of those people -- isn't it probably

MR. McKENNA: Yes, it is, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can it be obtained under 

the Freedom of Information Act in this case? 

MR. McKENNA: Yes, it can. Their names, 

their office locations, their office phone numbers, 

their office e-mails is all a matter of public record in 

our State. 

Thank you very much.

McKenna. 

Mr. Bopp, you have 2 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. BOPP: Thank you. First a clarification 

of what we sought in the preliminary injunction. We 

were -- we sought to base our preliminary injunction on 

both count 1 and count 2. Of course, the district 

court and the Ninth Circuit did not reach -- in either 

case -- reach count 2. 

Secondly, with respect to whether or not 

there’s any conduct here, I don't think signing a 

written statement is conduct. And, of course, by signing 

the statement, the person is adopting the statement on

the petition, one of which involves their preference on 

the referendum, and the second is the -- the request 

that the matter goes on the ballot. And, of course, it has 

no legal effect unless 122,000 make the same political 

statement. 

Third, evidence of harassment comes in, 

as in Citizens United, because the weight of the 

interest that is required depends upon the burden of the 

First Amendment -- to the First Amendment speech 

involved; and this Court specifically referred in 

Citizens United to the lack of evidence of harassment of 

the donors that might occur if they were disclosed 

through the reports which Citizens United upheld. 

Here we do have evidence of harassment, and 

we believe that that requires a greater burden in the 

First Amendment analysis --

JUSTINE GINSBURG: But that's out of the 

case up till now. That's count 2. You put it in your 

pleading, but it wasn't reached by the court. 

MR. BOPP: Actually not. Many is the case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So everybody agrees 

that that's still in the case. 

MR. BOPP: Yes, but it is relevant to count 

1. Bates, for instance, looked to the evidence of 

harassment in protecting the membership list of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The court did not rule on 

whether there was a risk of harassment here. 

MR. BOPP: Well, that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It dealt only with count 1. 

MR. BOPP: That is -- that is true, Your Honor. 

There are -- there were several First Amendment claims 

made -- made under count 1, and this decision was --

was based on other claims. 

I see my time is up. Thank you.

The case is submitted.
