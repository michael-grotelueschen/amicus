 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear


argument now in Number 04-104, United States


against Freddie J. Booker and 04-105, United


States against Duncan Fanfan.


 Mr. Clement.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief


Justice, and may it please the Court:


 This case, and these cases, concern the


constitutionality of the twelve hundred criminal


sentencings that take place in Federal court each


week. If this Court re-affirms its traditional


understanding of the relationship between the


Guidelines, and the statutory maximum penalties


set forth in the United States Code, an


understanding reflected in a series of this


Court's decisions dealing with the Guidelines,


than the constitutionality of those criminal


sentencings remains secure. 


On the other hand, if this Court takes a


different view, and treats the outer bounds of the


Guideline ranges as if they were statutory

maximums, then the majority of those criminal

sentencings become constitutionally dubious, and


this Court must confront difficult remedial


issues. 


This is, of course, not the first time


that this Court has confronted a challenge to the


constitutionality of the Guidelines or to the


Commission. To be sure, in those previous cases,


this Court has never considered the precise Sixth


Amendment issue before the Court today. But,


nonetheless, those previous cases are instructive,


because all of those cases, Dunnigan, Witte,


Watts, and Edwards, all reflect a particular


understanding of the relationship between the


Guidelines and the statutory maximum sentences for


each specific crime defined in the United States


Code. And all of those decisions suggest that the


statutory maximum in the Code is the relevant


focal point for constitutional analysis.


 So, in the Witte case, for example, the 


finding of relevant conduct in the Witte case increased


his sentence under the Guidelines by two hundred


months. Nonetheless, this Court rejected the

double jeopardy challenge before the Court by

emphasizing that that consideration of relevant

conduct did not increase his penalty beyond the


statutory maximum. 


Likewise in the Edwards case, this Court


considered the propriety of a judicial finding of

crack cocaine that increased the Guideline


sentence, when the jury was instructed in the

alternative, to find cocaine or crack. Now, even


though the judicial finding had the effect of

raising the punishment under the Guidelines, this


Court found no serious Sixth Amendment issue


raised precisely because the effect of the judge's

finding did not take the sentence beyond the


maximum for a cocaine-only conspiracy. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say we found no


serious Sixth Amendment issue raised. Was the


right of jury trial issue argued in that case, and

decided?


 MR. CLEMENT: In the Edwards case, a Sixth


Amendment issue and, I think, fairly including the


jury trial, was raised in that case. Now, I've tried

to go back and look briefs in that case and I have


to admit, they're a little difficult to get


through in terms of the precise issue that was


being raised.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: The right to jury trial

is fairly clear and stark, and I just don't

recall that being argued in any of those cases.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it was argued, I


think, fairly clearly in the Watts case, I mean,


there was a section -- Watts, of course, was a


summary reversal, so you have to go and look at


the brief in opposition in the Watts case. And if


you do, there's a separate paragraph in the


argument section denominated the jury trial

right. 


And I think in some respects, the Watts


case is a particularly clear indicator that this


Court has rejected the view of the Guidelines that

Respondents embrace. Because Justice Stevens was


quite prophetic in his dissent in that case. He


embraced the precise understanding of the


significance of the outer bound of the Guidelines


range in his Watts dissent, and no member of this


Court joined that dissent, and no member found the

disposition with respect to Watts 


JUSTICE STEVENS: That just proves they

don't listen to me as much as they should.


 MR. CLEMENT: It may very well prove that,


Justice Stevens, because you were very clear about


the point, just to remind you, in the Watts case

there were two cases before the Court, there was


the Putra case, and there was the Watts case, they


were consolidated. And with respect to Putra, you


can envision that case, or characterize that case


as being sort of a collateral estoppel, double


jeopardy case, but as you correctly recognized,

very clearly, in your Watts dissent, with respect


to Mr. Watts, the finding, the criminal finding of


acquittal was based on 924(c), which requires use


of a gun. The sentencing enhancement was done


based on an enhancing factor that only requires


possession of a gun. So there wasn't any


collateral estoppel effect in that case. 


But, nonetheless, in your dissent you


pointed out, in footnotes 2 and 4 that it still


had the effect of raising his sentence above the


outer bound of the Guidelines range, and that,


because that was done on the basis of a


preponderance of the evidence, rather than a


beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that that


raised a constitutional problem, and you would


have reversed. The rest of the Court was happy to


summarily reverse in that case.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, here's the


problem I have with the Government's argument

insofar as it does not urge that we reverse


Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as


well. But assuming we adhere to Blakely, it seems


to me you have a cure that doesn't correspond to


the disease. You say that the reason the right to


jury trial does not apply here is because, after

all, these sentences have not been prescribed, or


these maximums have not been prescribed by the


legislature, but rather, have been prescribed by a


quasi-judicial agency. 

But the right of jury trial is meant to


protect against whom? Who are you worried about


when you say, "I want to be tried by a jury." 

You're not worried about the legislature, you're


worried about the judges, precisely. So I don't

care if the upper level of the Guidelines were


actually prescribed by a court, as opposed to the


Commission which is, I don't know what it is, but


it's not a court. 


But even if it were prescribed by a court,


how would that eliminate the jury trial problem? 

The whole reason for jury trial is we don't trust

judges.


 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice


Scalia, I'd like to make two observations. One, I

25

don't think the jury trial right is just a

juxtaposition of the role of the jury versus the

role of the judge, because if that were the only

factor at issue in this Court's Sixth Amendment


jurisprudence, it would be very difficult to

explain why it is that judicial fact-finding can

have the effects that it can under a purely


discretionary system, yet this Court has upheld


that time and time again.


 The second point I'd like to make, is I do


think that this Court's Apprendi to Blakely line


of cases ­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we just go back to

the point you just made, it's a little different

when the judge has discretion and there's no -­

the judge has discretion to take a whole bunch of

things into account, but they're not quantified. 


And I think that was dramatically illustrated, the


difference, by the decision of Judge Lynch when he


said, "Well, I'll go back to the old ways of doing


it, I'll look at the Guidelines for some advice,"


he comes out with twenty-four months instead of


thirty-three months. 


So I think there is a huge difference


between a judge taking account of many, many


10

factors, not giving them a specific quantity as


the Guidelines require.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I


think there -- there certainly is a difference


between sentencing under the Guidelines, versus a


system of discretionary sentencing, or even a


system of discretionary sentencing where the


Guidelines have an advisory character, I'd


certainly concede that. 


My point was, though, in making a


distinction between the role of the jury and the

judge, it's not just as simple as saying that the

jury trial right exists precisely to protect the

jury from the judge, because if that were the

case, the kind of fact-finding that Judge Lynch


engaged in, or the kind of fact finding that was


commonplace under discretionary sentencing also


takes roles away from the jury, and gives them to

the judge.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we're talking


here about one precise role of the judge or of the

jury, and that is, to find a fact that is

necessary to keep you in jail for an additional

number of years. And the difference with


discretionary sentencing is if it's, you know, ten

to twenty years, what you know when you do the


crime is that you've laid yourself open to twenty


years. 


Now, if you get a merciful judge, good for

you, I mean, that's lagniappe as they say in


Louisiana, but if you get a hanging judge, you've

got twenty years, and you know that when you


commit the crime, whereas we have a system now


where you are entitled to no more than so much. And I


find it just incompatible with jury trial right

to say that that fact must be determined, before


you can be kept in jail. And yet we're going let

it be determined by a judge. That bears no

resemblance to the discretionary sentencing


system.


 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice


Scalia, I think you've built in some assumptions


into that question, because under our system,


generally speaking if somebody wants to know what


the maximum exposure for a particular criminal


offense is, they would be well-advised to look at


the U.S. Code provision that specifies what the


maximum sentence is for that offense, because that


is their exposure, that's what they're told about


in their Rule 11 colloquy if they plead to the

crime, and if the judge makes certain findings, to

be sure, upward departure, whatever it takes in a


particular case, that is the maximum exposure that


the individual 


JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the maximum


exposure. If, for example, one of the factors is


whether the crime was committed with a firearm, I


know that if I don't use a firearm, under the


Guidelines, I can only get so many years, so


somebody has to find that I used a firearm, and if


I didn't, my maximum exposure is less.


 MR. CLEMENT: Unless the judge departs for

some other reason, or the like. I mean, but certainly


that's true -


JUSTICE STEVENS: Or he makes a


mistake in finding. 


MR. CLEMENT: I suppose that's true, too.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: He finds a gun when


there really wasn't one. 


MR. CLEMENT: So there are different ways


that you could get that sentence under the


Guidelines system. But if there's no mistake, and


no departure on some other grounds, we both 


understand, I think, how the Guidelines work and


you're describing it correctly. But still, that

is a finding that is only necessary because of the


determination of the Commission and the


Guidelines, and that brings us back to the


question -


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the


determination, as is occasionally true of the


Guidelines, is made not by the Commission, but by


Congress itself? Or made by the Commission at the


direction of Congress? Then the distinction that


you're making between the maximum set by the


legislature and the guidance provided, or the


guidance to discretion under the Guidelines,


really doesn't stand up. So at least to the


extent that Congress directly enacts Guidelines,


would you concede that then, the critical finding


has to be made by the jury?

 MR. CLEMENT: I would not concede that,


Justice Ginsburg, but let me first make clear that


in the case before us today, the Guidelines that


we have are promulgated by the Commission, and


were not the direct or indirect result of a


Congressional act the way that the, say, the


Protect Act added particular amendments to the


Guidelines, so that question is not directly posed


in this case.

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

 The reason I would say that even in that


case there is a difference is because it is still


different when Congress goes in and amends a


particular Guideline in a sense in a sea of


Guidelines provided by the Commission. And I


think that's true, one, because amending a single


Guideline doesn't change the overall character of


the Guidelines. 


But also because, when Congress decides to


take action not as a statute, but as an amendment


to a Guideline, it doesn't change the fundamental


character of the Guideline as a Guideline. And so


after -- the Protect Act for example, specifies a


period in which -- after which the Commission can


then amend that Guideline. Which is obviously not


a case that you can have with a statute consistent


with the Presentment Clause.


 And to just give you another example, the

Sentencing Reform Act that has brought us here


today, one of the things it did was make specific


amendments to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure


32. I think when Congress does that, it doesn't


make Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 a


statute, it continues to be a Federal Rule, the


Federal Rules Advisory Committee could still modify

it after the fact, and so I think even in that


case, there's a difference in effect.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference in


effect? I mean, that's where I'm having trouble,


and I guess others are having trouble. Yes,


there's a difference in process, there may be a


difference, in some sense, in ultimate status, but


there isn't, it seems to me, any difference in


effect. The defendant in the courtroom is going


to suffer the same effect either necessitated or


sufficed by this fact which is just as crucial,

whether it's a rule, whether it's a guideline,


whether it's a statute, why should that make any


difference for the Sixth Amendment?


 MR. CLEMENT: I think it should make -­


well, I guess what I would respond to that,


Justice Souter, is this. I think that one thing


that emerges from this Court's recent Sixth


Amendment jurisprudence, is that the impact on the

defendant himself or herself is not the only test


that this Court looks to. Because from the


perspective of an individual defendant, they don't


care if they've gotten five extra years because a


judge made a finding under a discretionary regime,

or they got five extra years because the judge


16

made a finding that the legislature told the judge

to make, the practical effect is the same.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the practical


effect is the same but in the moment before either


in theory they commit the crime or in the moment


before the trial is over or in the moment before


the sentence comes down, there is one big


difference in the two classes of cases. The


defendant is entitled to claim that he can not be


sentenced to the higher range unless a fact is


found. In a case of discretionary sentencing


range, within that range, he can not make that


claim, he can not make that assumption, and the -­


that, it seems to me, is the point at which the


jury trial right has got to focus.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think again, as


Justice Stevens suggested earlier, I mean, that


may be true if you focus in on that single fact


under the Guideline system, but under the myriad


of various ways that your Guidelines sentence can


go up or down, it may be inappropriate under the


Federal Guideline system to focus in on the point


of analysis on that particular interval, of just

the one -


JUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?

25

 MR. CLEMENT: Because, again, as a


defendant, you may have a case where there are


five or six potential enhancements, and there are


five or six potential departures, and your


sentence is going to be a product of the judicial

fact finding that goes in, in making those various


conclusions -


JUSTICE SCALIA: And each one is


appealable separately, each one is appealable


separately, it's a separate legal finding. And


the judge doesn't, in discretionary sentencing, he

doesn't have to make any factual finding, he can


just look at you and say, "I think you're a bad

actor, you've got forty years." We have a system


here where the judge must make factual findings,

and each one is appealable if he's made them


incorrectly.


 MR. CLEMENT: I don't disagree with that


characterization of the Guidelines, but I still


think that is a difference from a pure


statutory scheme, it's different from a scheme


like this Court had before it in Blakely against


Washington, where the statute focuses you in on


just a couple of factors and you really can re­

conceptualize that regime as providing for a base

offense level and one or two aggravated grades of


the offense. As Judge Lynch observed in language


that we quoted on page four of our reply brief, you


really can't re-conceptualize the Guideline system


that way.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the principal


reason you can't, or I think the principle reason


that you're advancing is, that the Guideline


system is so complicated. There are a myriad of


factors. As Justice Scalia says, why isn't each


one in that myriad subject to the same claim? 

Surely, the argument can't be just because it's

more complicated, that the Sixth Amendment


evaporates.


 MR. CLEMENT: I agree, Justice Souter, and


the point isn't that it's more complicated. If I


just continue with Judge Lynch's observation,

which, as I say, is quoted on page four of our


reply brief, it's not just that it's complicated,

it's that the mission of the Guidelines system is,


once, assuming that somebody's been convicted of


some Federal crime with certain elements defined


by Congress, then, what the Guidelines ask the


judge to do is evaluate the incident of criminal

activity and assess an appropriate punishment

without regard to whether it has met the certain


elements of a particular Federal crime. And so,


the really, the focus is quite different, and in


that sense, I think there is, there is more than a


difference of form between a set of guidelines


produced by a legislature and a set of guidelines


produced by the sentencing commission.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find very little


difference between telling him to evaluate it with


regard to particular elements of a crime and


asking him to evaluate it with regard to


particular sentencing facts. The result is the


same. You're asking him to evaluate it in 


light of certain facts that he has to find. 


Whether you call them the one or the other, he's


doing the same thing. If he finds this fact you


get three more years; if he doesn't find it, you


don't. I mean, you know, as far as the real


outcome is concerned, what difference does it make


whether you call it an "element" or a "required


fact for sentencing"?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there are


differences between the two. I think if you look


at the Washington system that you had before you


in the Blakely case, it was a product of the

legislature, and so, not surprisingly, there was a


focus on the crimes as defined by the legislature,


there was a presumptive range for each crime, and


then there were a handful of things that got you


into - added three years, like a firearm, and


then there was basically the upward departure


authority or the downward departure authority, and


that was it. And that makes sense; a legislature


is going to be predominantly focused on the


statutorily defined crimes.


 In the context of the Guidelines, on the


other hand, it is a much more widely variant


focused, and what it's focusing on is the criminal


activity as a whole. There are many factors that


can increase it, there's many factors that can


decrease it, and 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that complexity, is


the key or, suppose these Guidelines were proposed


by the Commission, just as they are, with all

their complexity, but they were proposed as


legislation, and then Congress enacted these


Guidelines, would you be able to make the argument


that you're making, still? The Federal system,


now legislative guidelines is viable after


Blakely?

 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so. I think


in that, in that context we would be limited to an


argument to asking this Court to overrule Blakely. 


But that is not to say that, that, what I want to


make the point, though, is ultimately if pushed ­


and your hypothetical pushes us - if pushed, the


argument is one of form, that the fact that these


emanate from the sentencing commission makes a


constitutional difference. But I don't want to


lose the fact in making that concession that there


is still a real difference between the way the


Federal Guidelines work and the way the Washington


Guidelines work, and the Federal Guidelines work


exactly as you would expect: sentencing guidelines


promulgated by an entity located in the Article


III branch, and consisting of Article III members;


and the Washington Guidelines system works 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not so clear


anymore, it just happens that there are three

members, but they don't have to be any judicial

members, under the current legislation.


 MR. CLEMENT: That's true, Justice


Ginsburg, but there 


JUSTICE SCALIA:They're still in the


judicial branch, right?

 MR. CLEMENT: Still in the judicial

branch, Justice Scalia, and there are the same


number of judicial members on the Commission now

as there were when this Court considered the


Mistretta decision. And I think Mistretta itself


recognized that you could have bodies located in


the judicial branch that were auxiliary to the

judicial branch, even if they consisted, quote,

"solely of non-judges." 


So I don't think that's what's


dispositive. I think what's dispositive


ultimately is what this Court recognized in the


Mistretta decision. In the Mistretta decision,


this Court made clear that the Commission was


constitutionally located in the Article III branch


precisely because it did not take on the


quintessentially legislative tasks of setting


maximum punishments and defining the elements of


Federal crimes. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mistretta 


might have come out the other way had it not been


for that observation.


 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's exactly


right, Mr. Chief Justice. And I can talk more


about that in terms of the severability issue,

which is question two. But I think especially if


you get to the point where prospectively the


proposal is to treat sentencing enhancement


factors under the Guidelines exactly as if they're


elements of Federal crimes, they would have to be


included in indictments and have to be charged to


the jury on beyond a reasonable doubt.

 Then I don't see how Mistretta survives


anymore or at least how Mistretta allows that


particular judicial remedy to go forward. Because

at that point, you've really had the Commission


become transformed into precisely what this Court


said it wasn't, as a matter of constitutional law,


in the Mistretta case.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The paradigm that the


cases discuss in Blakely and in the cases


leading up to it from Apprendi, are facts such as


the amount of drugs, was there a weapon, was there


violence performed against the victim. And if the


Court finds that these are so much like an element


that they have to be proved, and adheres to its


jurisprudence and invalidates the Guidelines to

that effect, is there any argument that either the


Government makes or that some of the commentators


would make, that there are other kinds of

sentencing considerations that can be called


factual, to be sure, but that should be the


judge: say, lack of remorse as demonstrated after

the verdict; the fact that after the verdict,


investigation shows that of the two defendants,


one was the real ringleader, streetwise, the other


was kind of a naive dupe; or that there was a


failure to cooperate with the person presenting


the -- preparing the sentencing report.


 These are facts in a certain way. Is it


for a penny, in for a pound? Do we have to treat


all of these as factual, or is there any progress


to be made in trying to see if there are some,


some facts that are, are like elements and some


that are not. That would be a -- it would take a


number of cases, I suppose, to elaborate that.


 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, I think


that the thrust of respondents' position -- they


can obviously speak for themselves to this point,


but I think the thrust of their position is in for


a penny, in for a pound, that if you extend


Blakely to the guidelines, then that's it, the


guidelines go out. I think the consequence of


accepting the Government's position here, that the


guidelines are different, would not foreclose the

possibility for a more fine-tuned analysis that


focused on the particular effects of particular


guidelines ranges, or the particularly enhancing


factors and the like.


 And I think one thing that ought to give


the Court caution before it extends Blakely all


the way to the guidelines is, if you look at the


guidelines, there are certainly some enhancing


factors or some factors that increase punishment


under the guidelines, that look nothing like any


traditional element of any crime.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What, what, what tests


would you propose, or the commentators? How do we


distinguish the permitted kind of fact that the


judge can find, and those that must be for the

jury?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, two things,


Justice Kennedy. I don't want to get too far


afield in the sense that we think that for


purposes of this case, the Court could distinguish


the guidelines and could still maintain the very


bright line of Blakely as applies to legislative


enactments. But if this Court were going to


either, with respect to legislative enactments or


in the particular field of the guidelines, try to

develop another test to differentiate elements


from - I'm sorry, elements from sentencing


factors, I think this Court could get guidance in


the same kind of analysis that it's done in the


context of affirmative defenses.


 As Apprendi itself recognized, in the


Patterson case, this Court decided that in that


context, it would not adopt one bright line or


another and just give up the enterprise of drawing

lines in between. And I think a similar


enterprise could be done under the guise of


dealing with the guidelines. But I think the


thrust of the Government's position here today is


that you shouldn't accept the Respondent's


particular challenge to the guidelines because


that does have the effect of "in for a penny, in


for a pound," and wiping the guidelines out.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, following


up on Justice Kennedy's thought, if we adhere to


the strict language in Apprendi itself, as quoted


below, any - solely on the fact reflected in the


jury verdict or the plea of the plea bargain, that's - that

establishes the maximum. What percent of the


total number of sentences that are imposed in the,


by the Federal system today would violate that

rule?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, let


me try to answer it as best as I can. I want to


make the observation, though, that the only


estimate I can give you is based on retrospective


data, obviously, and it could be ­


JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let's look at the


future and assume that in 97 percent of the cases


which are plea bargains, you could agree on what


the relevant facts are. That certainly could be


done. And in the 3 percent that are trialed, it


is my impression that a very small number of those


actually involve violations of the Apprendi rule. 


Is that correct?


 MR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure that's right,


Justice Stevens. Let me answer it this way,


because I can only answer it based on the data I


have. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: See, it's relevant


because underlying all this is a question do the


guidelines fail in toto, or do they only fail with


respect to those relatively small number of cases in


which there's a violation of the Apprendi rule?


 MR. CLEMENT: I understand, and let me


answer it this way, which is looking

retrospectively at the data from 2002. If you


consider all the cases that either went to trial


or pled and that, they're not differentiated, the


two aren't differentiated, then about 65 percent


of the cases raise a potential Blakely or Apprendi


type issue, so that would be the starting point


for the analysis. Now, as you pointed -


JUSTICE STEVENS: In raising the issue, it


depends on what - the issue you describe. A lot


of people describe it as an issue when you just

use the guidelines at all. Do they raise an


issue, involve it in a sentence over and above the


amount that would be authorized by either the jury

verdict or the plea bargain?


 MR. CLEMENT: Yes, that's 65 -


QUESTION: Do you think 65 percent of the


cases do?


 MR. CLEMENT: The numbers that we have is


65 percent. Basically, you have 44 percent of the


cases involve some chapter II or chapter III


enhancement or adjustment to the base level. And

then we've kind of looked, in addition to the 44


percent, we've looked at the drug cases, which by


the nature of the drug sentencing table, virtually


all of the drug cases, if they don't implicate a

mandatory minimum, involve a potential Blakely


upward adjustment. And so what we've done is, in

looking at these numbers, is to basically take all


the drug cases and then subtract that 


JUSTICE STEVENS: They all, of course,


involve a potential upward adjustment. But do

they all involve actual sentences above the amount


that the jury verdict would have authorized?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, Justice


Stevens, I don't know, because that comes to a


second question, which is, if I understand your


question, which is, we know that 65 percent of the


cases raise a potentially, a potential Blakely


issue. Then the question is, well, if 97 percent


of the cases settle, is there a way to sort of


waive Blakely rights and the like, and make this


workable going forward? And it's hard to know


what the, what, what system will emerge. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: The thing that -- I'm


sorry, but I really, it's important to me. 


Raising an issue, the issue is always raised when


there's a possibility of a higher sentence, but I


don't think it's fair to assume that that 65 percent of


the sentences of tried cases actually resulted in


sentences higher than what the jury verdict would

have authorized.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, I can only give


you the numbers -


JUSTICE STEVENS: It's potentially that


every case does. But if in fact, most sentences


come within the maximum anyway, it's of course a


serious problem in those cases, but system-wide,


it's not nearly the problem that the figures


you've mentioned suggest.


 MR. CLEMENT: Again, Justice Stevens, I


want to answer as best I can. The figures I have


suggest that 65 percent of the cases do involve an


upward adjustment of some kind. And so there is a

Blakely problem. So the only real question


is, all right, 65 percent of cases in the


world where nobody thought Blakely was a problem


for the guidelines involve those kind of upward


adjustments. There may be ways through plea

agreements and the like to have people waive their


Blakely rights in certain ways that may make the


system work a little bit better or deal with a


slightly reduced number of cases. But I think any


way you slice this, this is going to have a


tremendous impact on the reality of criminal


sentencing in the Federal system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as to past. I mean,


it may have a significant one-shot impact with


respect to cases that were decided without Blakely


in mind. But for the future, I, I just don't

agree with you that changes could make some


reduction. I think changes could provide for jury

findings whenever, whenever there's a need for a


higher sentence based on facts. I don't know;


what is the problem with that?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I, well let me try to


address the remedial question then going forward. 


If this Court were to find that Blakely is fully


applicable to the guidelines, then that's going to


raise some very serious and complex remedial


questions. One question, though, I think ought to


be clear, is that one option that shouldn't be on


the table is the idea that on a prospective basis,


the guidelines are severable in a way that makes


all enhancements or all upward adjustments

completely unavailable, and all downward


departures fully available. Because that system


is obviously nothing that Congress intended.


 Now Respondents, for their part, don't


propose that rule, although they want to benefit


from effectively that rule for their own cases.

What they suggest is that on a going-forward


basis, you could include the sentencing enhancing


factors as, in the indictment and then send them


to the jury as effectively de facto elements of

the crime to be found by the jury beyond a

reasonable doubt. Now with respect, I think that


so-called Blakely-ization of the guidelines


creates an enormous amount of judicial lawmaking

and raises very serious separation of powers


problems.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is, what is the


lawmaking part? I mean, if I have a choice -- if


I have -- let's put the question this way. 


Congress has authorized the Commission and the


Commission has said, "If fact X is found, then the


range is higher." Is there a lot of lawmaking in


concluding that Congress and the Commission would


have preferred that range to be higher regardless of


whether a jury found the fact or a judge found the

fact? That doesn't seem like much of a stretch to


me. There may be other reasons not to do it. But


in terms of judicial lawmaking, it doesn't seem

like much to me.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice


Souter, I think it is fairly ambitious judicial

lawmaking. You do have to take out a fair amount


of text to get the sentencing judge effectively

out of the business of fact-finding. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: What text do you have to


take out? 


MR. CLEMENT: You have to take out the


reference in 3553(b), that talks about what the


court finds, and then it makes a definite


reference to the court needing to find things in


order to have upward and downward departures.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you


mean by the "court," doesn't it?


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just consider the word


court to mean jury. Jury or a judge.

 MR. CLEMENT: And I think then ­


JUSTICE SCALIA: Which - which is sometimes


done, there are statutes that refer to the court,


that -


MR. CLEMENT: And as we point out in our


brief, there are plenty of statutes that refer to


the court in distinction from the jury. I think

then if you look at 3742(e), which is the appeal


right, if you look at 3742(e), makes it quite


clear that on appeal, courts of appeals are


supposed to defer to the, to the fact, the facts

found by the district court. Now I think in the


context of the overall provision for judicial

review, that is clearly a reference to the


judge, not to the jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me, when


there is an ambiguity that construed one way


creates a constitutional statute and construed


another way creates an unconstitutional one, it's


an easy call.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, I don't


think there's any way to avoid a potentially


unconstitutional system going forward, because if


you treat these guideline factors that were


clearly created by the Commission and in some


cases created by Congress, on the assumption that


they would be used for judge fact-finding, and

then send them to the jury, then what you've done

prospectively -- it's one thing -- let me put it


this way. It's one thing to recognize that the


guideline factors that are enhancements have the


effect of increasing sentences and operate like


elements of crimes for retrospective


constitutional analysis, for finding a Sixth


Amendment problem, but it is quite another thing


to prospectively treat those factors exactly as if

they're elements of crimes, force them to be


included in the indictment, send them to the jury

beyond a reasonable doubt.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: It just means that if a

different procedure is followed, you'll reach


precisely the same sentences the guidelines


reached.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I actually don't think


that follows, Justice Stevens, because I think


taking guidelines that were clearly designed for


judge fact finding and sending them to the jury --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think judges reach


different results on factual issues than juries

do? Is that part of your submission?


 MR. CLEMENT: No. What my submission is,


is that taking guidelines that were designed for


judge fact finding and sending them and using them

for jury fact finding is going to have a very

disproportionate impact on some cases. Let me


give you an example if I could, to make the point. 


If you think of two fraud cases that under the


guidelines 


JUSTICE STEVENS: But keep it simple


because we're assuming that in most cases, there


aren't a host of factors but usually just two or


36

three, such as the drug quantity and did he find a


gun. Now in those where there's a fairly simple


fact to identify, would it make any difference in


the ultimate sentence that's imposed whether the


jury finds it or the judge finds it?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think it would, Justice


Stevens. And if I could -- I'll keep it a very


simple fraud example. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: Keep to that example


I've given you. The gun and the drug quantity. 


Why would it make a difference?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it might not make as much


a difference in the drug case --


JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it make any difference?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, here's how


it could make a difference,


if I could use the fraud example.


 MR. CLEMENT: And then you may be able to


see how it could or could not relate to the


marijuana example or a drug example. In the

context of a fraud case, two fraud cases that are


sentenced the exact same way and treated as


uniform and proportional under the current system


 JUSTICE STEVENS: And there's a difference

in sentence depending on the amount of


money that the fraud involved. 


MR. CLEMENT: In the number of victims. 


And what you'll have is -- if you think of one


fraud that involved one victim and a slightly


higher amount of money, and another fraud that


involved many victims and a slightly lower amount


of money, the current guideline system basically


tries to treat them the same.


 Now with a single fraud victim, the idea


of Blakely-izing the guidelines may be relatively


straightforward. You include the loss amount in


the indictment. You put a special verdict form


with the amount of loss on it. And you call in


that one witness, and you can prove up your case


beyond a reasonable doubt.


 But if you have a case of telemarketing --


JUSTICE STEVENS: In that case -- let's


take them one at a time. In that case, would it


make any difference whether the jury made the

finding or the judge made the finding?


 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think it would,


Justice Stevens.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. Then what

to contrast it is with 


JUSTICE STEVENS: Now can you give me a


case in which it would make a difference?


 MR. CLEMENT: Sure. Imagine that you have


a telemarketing fraud where a thousand peoples -­


a thousand individuals have been milked out of a


couple of dollars each. Now under the current


system, proving up the fraud amount for the judge

is not that difficult because you can get the


probation officer to testify, or some other way to


get the total amount of the fraud in front of the


judge. Under the system that Respondents propose,

you're going to have to call in every one of 2,000


individuals who was defrauded. Otherwise, I think


it's going to be very difficult to prove that


fraud amount in front of the jury beyond a

reasonable doubt. And that just is one example of

the disproportionate and disuniform effects 


JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think a very


large fraud such as you've described could be


proved through two or three witnesses?


 MR. CLEMENT: I think it would be very 


JUSTICE STEVENS: They used the Internet


and they had all said -- I am not persuaded.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it can't be, maybe


the judges shouldn't go, be going around guessing

how many people have been defrauded. Or you know,


saying "more likely than not, on the basis of the


kind of evidence we usually don't accept in


criminal trials." Why is that okay? I don't


understand it.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, I think whatever


else is true, what you would be doing with such a


system is you'd be taking factors that I think


everyone concedes were designed by a Commission


that was upheld as constitutional precisely


because it did not have the effect of creating new


Federal crimes and statutory limits.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't make me feel


any good if I spend another 10 years in jail

because of it. Say, "Oh, well, don't worry about


it, it wasn't an element of the crime, after all."


 [Laughter.]


 MR. CLEMENT: No, I understand that,


Justice Scalia. I'm trying to talk about the


remedial question, though.

experience in that regard. I understand the


Department of Justice has told prosecutors that


now you allege these sentencing enhancers -- like


drug quantity, like amount of property stolen -­


you allege them in the indictment, you prove them


beyond a reasonable doubt. Has that proved


intractably difficult in cases where it has been


attempted?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I


think we don't have enough experience to know. I


think I can tell you one thing: that with a lot


of enhancements, putting something in the


indictment is not necessarily the difficult step. 


There are some things like relevant conduct that


can be very challenging to try to formulate in an


indictment. But for a lot of the factors that


enhance a sentence, it's relatively easy to put it


in the indictment itself.


 I think the trickier difficulties come up


in terms of trying to instruct the jury,

especially in cases where there are multiple


enhancements.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well certainly


in the case of, say, perjury at trial, you

couldn't possibly allege that in the indictment

because you won't know.


 MR. CLEMENT: That's completely right, Mr.


Chief Justice. And those cases are just out.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They're not out. They've got


to be separately prosecuted.


 MR. CLEMENT: And that's never been the


under -- I mean, that's true, there may be some


cases that you could bring a separate perjury

prosecution, but this court


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I don't know of any


case in which you can't.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, there may be


situations where there's an obstruction of justice

that wouldn't necessarily make out all the


elements of a perjury prosecution.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I guess, we ought


to have an obstruction of justice crime with

defined elements that can be prosecuted.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, with


respect, I mean, this Court, both before the


guidelines and after the guidelines, rejected the

argument that the only way to enhance a sentence


for obstruction of justice was to bring a separate

perjury prosecution.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I, I would, I would

take the same position today, unless you were


going to define it, in terms of a condition that


is both necessary and sufficient to expand the


sentencing range of the crime that you are


nominally prosecuting the person for. I mean,


that's the rub. 


MR. CLEMENT: But that's 


JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me go -­


MR. CLEMENT: That's what this Court had


before it in Dunnigan. And this Court said that


that was not problematic. It was obstruction


during the trial. And this Court upheld it on


reliance on Grayson, a pre-guidelines case, and


this Court said that the additional rigor and


predictability instilled by the guidelines did not


make a constitutional difference.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I've listed four


categories of things that you think would be very


difficult to prove to a jury at the trial, but not

to a judge at sentencing. The first is the vast

amount of information now and prior to guidelines


that were contained in the presentence report. 


That information, most of which was used since


history was begun, maybe a hundred years ago, is


simply not available until the trial is over.

 The second happens to be the things that


the Chief brought up, matters committed at trial,


such as perjury.

 The third sort of thing are those things


that just get too complicated when you try to list

15 in indictment, such as victim -- put them all


together -- victim, brandishing the gun, et


cetera. 


And the fourth kind of thing are the


things that are too difficult to explain to a


jury. Try explaining even "brandishing" to a

jury, and if you can do that one, which may be

easy, try the multiple-count rules.


 All right. So I have those four things. 


Now, are there others?


 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's a fair


summary, Justice Breyer. I think on sort of how


complicated it gets to take something that was


designed for a judge and then send it before the

jury in jury instructions, I would ask the Court

to look at the Medas case, which we cite on page


15 of our reply brief.


 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if I


believe that that is just out of the question,

it's so complicated, nobody could do it, it would

be a radical change, Congress could never have


intended that, what about a much simpler approach? 


What you would do is take 3553(b), and you say,


"Read the word 'shall' -- i.e. 'shall apply the


guidelines' -- to 'may,'" so that the guidelines


become advisory, either because the "shall"


becomes a "may" or because you give each judge the

power to give any reasonable reason at all as to


why the Commission's guideline, they didn't


actively consider this factor. In other words,


read 3553(b) as permissive.


 And now, assuming I've expressed myself on


the underlying Apprendi questions, so I, but


suppose Blakely does apply, would you -- is -­


what would be wrong with taking that approach?


 MR. CLEMENT: Assuming I understand the


approach you propose, there would be nothing wrong


with taking that approach.


 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, I have thought


of one thing that might be wrong.


 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: So I'll ask you about it, 

if you want.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could it be that "shall"

does not mean "may"? Right?


 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's not it? 

"Shall" -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, well, I -- you 

see nothing wrong with that. That makes the


guidelines advisory, and there are a number of


objections -- maybe not, maybe big, maybe small. 

One objection I was worried about is -- I'm giving

you my thought process, you know, and I -- because


I'm trying to get a -- your response -- is that if


we did take that approach, you'd leave the


appellate section in place. That means every time


the judge didn't use the guideline, the appeals

courts would have to review for reasonableness. 


Now that would be in place. We would discover


judges all over the country having different views

on that. Courts of appeals would have different


views about was or what was not reasonable. We


would be here to review those differences, and we


would become the sentencing commission. I thought


I had escaped.


 [Laughter.] 


JUSTICE BREYER: Now, how, how serious an


objection is that? Or do you recommend that, if

you lose on this point, we take the approach of,


in that way, making the guidelines advisory?


 MR. CLEMENT: I would -- I would take the


approach that you should make the advisory -- the


advisory guidelines -- the guidelines as advisory.


 Now, with respect to whether or not you've


escaped from the burden of serving on the


sentencing commission, I don't think that the


reading of 3742, the appeal provision, that you've


envisioned is necessarily foreordained. I think ­


-


JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, have you escaped


Apprendi? If discretion is cabined by guidelines


and appellate courts review, for the abuse of


discretion in applying those guidelines, why isn't


that the same kind of entitlement that the


Apprendi/Blakely opinion is predicated on to begin


with?


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely. Vote me for


that. I mean, after all, judges used to define

the elements of crimes, didn't they? And the mere


fact that the elements at common law were defined


by judges rather than by the legislature didn't

mean that you didn't have to have a jury find

them. So if courts are going to establish the

guidelines, so long as they are still binding, it


seems to me you still need a jury finding, or you

haven't escaped Apprendi.


 MR. CLEMENT: A couple of observations,


Justice Scalia. First of all, you're exactly


right, since 1812 we've abandoned a system where


judges can define the elements of crimes. And

that's why, if I leave you with one thought on the


remedy, I would think that it's inappropriate to


allow an entity within the judicial branch to have

that effect on a prospective basis. I think that


would be a very serious separation of powers


problem. I think it would dwarf the separation of


powers problem that at least you found quite


significant in the Mistretta case.


 Now, if I can address Justice Kennedy's


question about the appeals system simply


replicating the Apprendi or the Blakely problem. 


First of all, we would suggest that the appeal


process that you've envisioned would not violate


Apprendi and Blakely. And that's one of the


reasons that we think the Commission wouldn't


violate Blakely. Because what we see is a


distinction in this court's cases. They have said


this Court has said that judicial discretionary

sentencing doesn't implicate the Sixth Amendment. 


This Court has said that legislative-directed


sentencing does implicate the Sixth Amendment. 


What the guidelines present is a situation of


judicial sentencing that's directive. We would

suggest -- we would suggest --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Judicial discretionary


sentencing, as I understood it, never permitted an


appellate court to increase the sentence given by


the district judge. Do you have any cases,

where an appellate court said the district judge

did not give enough years, where there was


discretionary sentencing?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I can


point you to the DiFrancesco case, where this


Court approved an earlier Federal statute that


allowed for appeals in sentencing.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: That may be under


statute, but I do not know, at common law, that


when you talked about the discretion in the


courts, it meant that in a criminal case a court


of appeals could increase the sentence because of


a -- because of an abuse of discretion by the


sentencing judge. I'm unfamiliar with any such

case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there are lots. 


There are lots, actually. If you -- if -- I ask,


"Is it right, that?"


 [Laughter.] 


JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, if you take


common law to mean England, as well as the United


States, there weren't here, because the sentences


weren't appealable, but in England, they were


appealable, and they had a common law work out of


what they called the "tariff," which is what the


range of reasonableness was or wasn't. And the


prosecution, I believe, could appeal it of being


too low; and the defense, being too high. And the


question was, Was the sentence reasonable? The


appellate court could set it.


 Now, if we had a system like that -- and


this is my serious question -- is it


unconstitutional under Apprendi if appeals court


judges reviewing a sentence could say, "This is

the range of reason, this is arbitrary up here, or


this is arbitrary down there"?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think our position


would be that that kind of system would be


constitutional. As I was suggesting to Justice


Kennedy, we think, because that system would be

constitutional, we think the guidelines are also


constitutional. I think Justice Kennedy is right,


though, that somebody that says that that system


is unconstitutional and the guidelines is


unconstitutional is not going to be particularly


impressed by that reading of 3742 that gets you to


that result. 


And that's why I want to leave you with an


important thought, which is, that reading of 3742


is not foreordained. This court could say that


the guidelines should be applied in an advisory


fashion, and that all that would be left of the


Government -­


JUSTICE O'CONNOR: That just seems so contrary

to what Congress intended. There's no evidence


that they intended this scheme to be advisory. 


They told the Commission to set up a scheme that


would be applied, because they wanted to make


sentencing more uniformly applied in the Federal


scheme of things. I think it's a real stretch to


try to argue for the position taken by some


Federal judges in one of the amicus briefs that,

"It's just advisory, don't worry." And I find it

very difficult to understand how appellate review


could be applied to such a scheme.

 MR. CLEMENT: But, Justice O'Connor,


that's why, to be clear, we've only argued in


favor of an advisory view of the guidelines if we


get to the remedial question, because I think


you're absolutely right, if you look at what


Congress actually intended, it's crystal clear


they did not intend the guidelines to be advisory. 


But it's equally crystal clear they didn't intend


the guidelines to be the basis for jury fact-

finding.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what if


this Court said the guidelines are


unconstitutional, period, and then judges simply

looked to the guidelines, figuring, well, this is


as good an idea as anybody else has about


sentencing?


 [Laughter.] 


MR. CLEMENT: I think that actually would


be the proper remedy. That's effectively what we


ask for, Mr. Chief Justice. And -­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if it were done


that way, why would it be that you would try to


change the word "shall" to "may" in (b)? Why not


just have Section 3553(a), which does list the

judges may take into account in sentencing, one of

-- among three or four others? 


MR. CLEMENT: No, I think that's fair,


Justice Ginsburg. I mean, in responding to


Justice Breyer's hypothetical, I didn't mean that


was the only way to get to the result we've


propose. And the particular way, in our briefs,


that we suggest that you would get to an advisory


use of the guidelines on a prospective basis is


precisely as you suggest. You don't read 3553(b)


to change "may" to "shall"; instead, you read it,


unfortunately, I guess, if we've reached the


remedial question, to be unconstitutional. And


then, at that point, you focus in on 3553(a) -­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which has the


guidelines -­


MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. Absolutely.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as one of other


factors.


 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly. And then if I


could just -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that that, as


Justice O'Connor suggests, deprives the statute of


its principal purpose, which was to constrain -­


to constrain judicial discretion. If there's

anything clear about it, that was clear about, it


was that they did not want judges to have as much

discretion as they had. And now you say these


things are just advisory. It seems to me much

easier to -- I wanted to ask you one very precise


question. Assuming I think "court" can mean


"jury" -- it doesn't have to mean "the judge" -­

where in, in the whole guideline system, how many


sections do not permit the use of "court" to mean


"jury"?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think -­


JUSTICE SCALIA: I think there's only one


where, where it may not work.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't see how it


works in 3742(e), because if you read that section


in context it's talking about determinations made


by the court, it's talking about determinations


made by the court after the presentence report


comes in -­


JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that may be the


one.


 MR. CLEMENT: -- and so I think that


3742(e) has to go. I think the fairer -­


JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Anything else


has to go?

reading of 3553(b) is that it has to go, too. I


know that you don't agree with -­


JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know about fairer. 


MR. CLEMENT: I think you disagree with me


on that. I think 994 -- 99 -- 994(a), in Title


28, which talks about the guidelines being for the


use of the sentencing court, I would suggest that


has to go, but I assume you would say sentencing


court can mean sentencing judge. Then at that

point, there's a provision of rule 32 of the


Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that must go,


because it talks about the role of the district


court in a way that I don't think you can, sort


of, find to mean the jury. And then I think,

obviously, the sentencing guidelines provision


that makes clear that it is the judge that's to

make the findings by a preponderance of the


evidence, has to go, as well. So I think that is


-- that is -- that is the sum total of the carnage


of deciding -­


[Laughter.] 


MR. CLEMENT: -- that the guidelines are


fully applicable with Blakely.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you -- if you

interpret "court" to mean "jury," how many of the

sentencing factors which will be submitted to the


jury are -- would be a radical departure from the

tradition, the role of the jury in the criminal

system in the Anglo-American tradition?


 MR. CLEMENT: I think very, very many of


them. I mean, I can't give you a better answer


than that, in terms of the number. But the Medas


case, on page 15 of a reply brief that I suggested


the Court look at, provides one example. There,


you had a case where it had already gone to the,


to the jury on a general verdict, and it had the

typical kind of general verdict form you see. 


It's had a six-count indictment. There were 12 boxes,


guilty/non-guilty for each of the six crimes in


the indictment. Then when there was a concern


that Blakely might require jury findings on all

the various enhancements, the Government tried to


put in a 20-page supplemental special verdict that


tried to walk through the various factors that the


jury would try to find. I think that just, in

miniature, shows you the kind of transformation


you're talking about. You go from a 12-line


general verdict form, which is the classic kind of


verdict form used in the criminal system, to 20

pages of a supplemental special verdict form.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you ought to get


rid of that prosecutor. That didn't seem to me 

very sensible at all.

 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Scalia, I think if you look at that supplemental


verdict form, and you look at the guidelines,


there's no other way to do it. And I think, as


the judge in that case said, one of the things

that comes up in virtually every guidelines case


is the issue of relevant conduct. Now, that is a


very, very difficult thing to try to instruct the


jury on. The application notes that the

Commission itself have come up in span eight and a


half pages of very small, single spaced text. To


try to give that as jury instructions, I think,

would leave the jury completely bewildered. 


Then, you'd also, though, even if you


could get past the instruction problems, the


effect of considering relevant conduct is going to


have a transformative effect on what goes before


the jury, because relevant conduct asks the jury

not to focus on the elements of the specific


crime; the relevant conduct focuses on the other


acts of that individual defendant and, if there's

joint criminal, if there's a joint criminal

undertaking, the reasonably foreseeable events of


acts of others taken in furtherance of the joint

undertaking. Now, the effect of using that


guideline, designed for judges, and sending it to

the jury, is effectively to transform many, many

cases from individual defendant cases to scheme


cases or conspiracy cases.


 So in tallying up the carnage and the


wreckage of applying these guidelines designed


clearly for judge fact-finding and willy - nilly

sending them to the jury, I think you have to

include the confusion and the difficulty of that.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement can I -- you


don't have an awful lot of time left, and I want


to ask you one rather important question, to me. 


There's been a lot of talk about severability of


the statute, and I can understand the concept that


we'll only apply it in certain categories of


cases. But normally when I consider severability,


I'm thinking of the text of a written statute. Is


there a particular provision of the sentencing


guidelines that you think can be severed from the


rest of the statute?


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I

21

22

think with respect to the Sentencing Reform Act


itself, the statute, the provision that we think


needs to be severed is 3553(b). Then, with


respect to the Guidelines, I think our view on the


guidelines -­


JUSTICE STEVENS: Just sticking to the


statute, take out 3553(b) in its entirety, you


just -­

MR. CLEMENT: Well, the specific reference


to "shall" -- this is basically the "shall/may"


issue -- I think that needs to be severed. I'm


not quite sure what of 3553(b) is left after you


do that, but that's -- that's the important thing.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just not sure what's

left of the whole statute if you take that


provision out entirely.


 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, as Justice


Ginsburg suggests, 3553(a) still stands alone as


telling the court that it should consider that. 


And I think, in fact, if you look at the


legislative history, I actually think the language


in 3553(b) was, was a floor amendment that was


added later. So it certainly doesn't pull the


whole statute down to take that one provision out


of the statute.

 Mr. Kelly, we'll hear from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF T. CHRISTOPHER KELLY


ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BOOKER


 MR. KELLY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


and may it please the Court:


 The first 22 years of Freddie Booker's


sentence punished him for crimes that were proved


to a jury. But the judge added another eight

years to his sentence, years that were only


authorized by the judge's finding that Booker

probably committed other crimes. Like thousands


of other Federal defendants, Booker's sentence was


increased based on crimes that were never proved


to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The final

years of a Federal sentence are as worthy of


constitutional protections against undeserved


punishment as are the first years.


 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the judge

had simply sentenced the defendant, let's say, to


ten years, but looked at these other crimes and


said, "In my practice, I go to 15." All right?

That's the basic situation. Is that

 MR. KELLY: Under the guidelines or under

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, there are no


guidelines.


 MR. KELLY: No, that is not


unconstitutional.


 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now suppose


the people who do exactly the same thing is the


Court of Appeals applying the word "reasonable,"


these officials of the judicial branch. See,

they're reviewing the sentence for reasonableness. 


They say, "In our practice when a person commits


bank robbery, if it's just an ordinary case, we think

it's reasonable five years; but if he has a gun,


seven years." So if there's no gun, five years is


the most that isn't arbitrary. But if there's a


gun, you can go to seven years. In other words,


an English-type tariff system. Is that


unconstitutional?


 MR. KELLY: I believe it would be, Justice


Breyer.


 JUSTICE BREYER: You would think it would be.

 MR. KELLY: Right.


 JUSTICE BREYER: -- now suppose the people


who do it are the parole commission -- as happen


to be in the United States, executive branch


officials. For the last hundred years, they get


sentences, for example, that were indeterminate,


or might have been for 30 years. And what they


say, "It is our practice, assuming good behavior,


that if it was just an ordinary bank robbery we'll

keep him in for five years, but if he had a gun,


he's going to stay in for seven." Is that


unconstitutional?


 MR. KELLY: Parole commissions don't


increase sentences. Parole commissions decrease


sentences.


 JUSTICE BREYER: No, what they have is an


indeterminate sentence.


 MR. KELLY: Right.


 JUSTICE BREYER: California.


 MR. KELLY: Yes.


 JUSTICE BREYER: And what they say is, "In


our practice, what we do is, we think it's


reasonable, and we will keep a person in prison


for five years in an ordinary bank robbery, but


for seven years if he has a gun." I'm asking if

that's constitutional. Because that's the


practice that they follow under parole commission


guidelines, and they've done it now for a decade,


I make up. 


MR. KELLY: That is constitutional, Your


Honor. And the reason is -­


JUSTICE BREYER: That's constitutional. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he have an


entitlement to a certain number of years under any


of these questions?


 MR. KELLY: As I -­


JUSTICE SCALIA: When you're sentenced to


an indeterminate sentence, he's not entitled to


parole at any time -­


MR. KELLY: Other than venues --


JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is he?


 MR. KELLY: No, not at all. And as I -­


JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to drive


at -- and I'll be -- is that I can't imagine a


court holding that a parole commission in the


executive branch that has exactly this same system


would be behaving unconstitutionally. It's


difficult for me to imagine -- though you say I'm


wrong on that -- a court holding it's


unconstitutional when a court of appeals does the

same thing reviewing for arbitrariness.


 MR. KELLY: Well, perhaps I misunderstood


your second hypothetical, Your Honor. But my


understanding of the hypothetical was that if the


judge gave five years and the appellate court

said, "No, you should have given seven years


because of the existence of a certain fact" -­


JUSTICE BREYER: You know, I -­


MR. KELLY: "you must -- you must increase


the sentence --"


 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not phrasing the


question well. I'm trying to imagine sentencing


guidelines run by a parole commission, executive


branch officials. I'm trying to imagine


sentencing guidelines run under the word arbitrary


by ordinary courts of appeals panels reviewing the


sentences. And if those are both constitutional,


then, I would ask, why is it unconstitutional to


put the executive branch and judicial branch

officials together in one group called the


sentencing commission?


 MR. KELLY: The relevant constitutional


principle doesn't have to do with whether it's the


executive branch of Government or the judicial

branch of Government; it has to do whether a fact

is necessary in order to increase a sentence.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. And ­


- well, maybe I'm just not going to get my
question across. I am trying to imagine Apprendi. 


Would Apprendi apply to parole commission


guidelines? I should think the answer, unless


we're going to reverse a hundred years of history,


is no. Would Apprendi apply to a court of appeals


panel with the power to review sentences for


arbitrariness?


 MR. KELLY: No.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I would think the answer


is no. And, therefore, I wonder why it applies if


we take judicial officials and executive branch

officials, and they do exactly the same thing


under the heading Sentencing Commission.


 MR. KELLY: In your hypotheticals, Justice


Breyer, as I understand them, each of those


entities is decreasing a sentence. We're talking


about a sentencing commission that authorizes a


court and, in fact -- well, authorizes a court to


increase a sentence after finding a particular


fact, and that is what triggers the Sixth


Amendment protection. It's the fact that a judge

is authorized to give a longer sentence because of


65

25

the existence of a fact than he would otherwise be


authorized to impose. And that is the essential


protection against which the Sixth Amendment jury

trial right protects. That is a fact that has to


be found by a jury, not by a judge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what is your


position if judges simply have complete discretion

to sentence within a maximum range, and Judge A


gives a lot of maximum sentences, and Judge B


doesn't? Is that system constitutional?


 MR. KELLY: There is no Sixth Amendment


problem with that system, Your Honor.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is it in our legal


tradition -- what policies are served by


preferring unexplained, unarticulated,


standardless discretion to a system in which the


judge gives reasons and follows careful standards

and follows -- and follows standards that give


consistency from one sentence to the other? Why


should the former be preferred? What are we doing


here?


 MR. KELLY: I think, Justice Kennedy, that


Blakely answers that question. Blakely


distinguishes between a discretionary system in


which the judge has the authority to consider a

--

number of different factors in order to do what


the judge thinks is fair, but is not required to ­

-


JUSTICE KENNEDY: What policies -­


MR. KELLY: -- give any particular weight


JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- are being furthered


by that, other than wooden adherence to Apprendi


and Blakely? 


MR. KELLY: The policy is that if a


judge's sentencing authority increases by finding

of fact, which is not the case in a discretionary


system. That fact is the kind of finding that we


leave to a jury, because juries -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that, isn't


that ultimately formalistic and contrary to our


whole design of our system, which is to learn over


experience and to codify and to explain what


considerations we take into account in applying


the law?


 MR. KELLY: I don't think it's contrary to


our system, Your Honor, to say that if a more


serious sentence attaches to a more serious crime,


or to a more serious version of a crime, that it's


up to the jury to decide whether the more serious

crime or more serious version was committed. In


fact, that is essential to our system.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So suppose, in Justice


Breyer's hypothetical -- like the California


indeterminate sentencing regime which applied


until about 20 years ago, after an indeterminate


sentence, the parole board interviews two people


convicted for the same crime; one was the


ringleader, street-hardened offender, and the


other was just a novice, a guy that went along,

although he -- they both committed the same crime. 


Under the California system, the former would be


given a projected release date of ten years; and

the other, a projected release date of about two

years. Would that be constitutional?


 MR. KELLY: Yes, it would, because, again,


under a discretionary system, the judge's

sentencing authority is unaffected by the finding


of a fact. If the parole commission determines


that one offender's sentence should be decreased


and the other offender's should not be decreased,


that has no Sixth Amendment application or Sixth


Amendment -­


JUSTICE BREYER: Look, we're trying to go


to the same point, and I think you're actually

given me a pretty good answer. The --


MR. KELLY: Thank you.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm imagining my system


being the system that Apprendi forbids. So I'm


not doing increase/decreases. I'll think of the


very kind of system. And I take it your answer is


this -- and remember, I dissented in Apprendi.


 MR. KELLY: I remember.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't agree with it. 


Right. But there we are. And so I'm trying to


see how far it goes. So I wonder, we take our


Apprendi system and now it's being administered by


a parole commission. We take our Apprendi system,


and now it's being administered by a court of


appeals using the legal standard arbitrariness. 


And I take it your answer is those are just as

unconstitutional.


 MR. KELLY: No, no, again, I'm not -­


JUSTICE BREYER: Now you understand what


I'm doing, because I'm saying you either have to


follow the force of your logic and make those


unconstitutional, too, or you have to say there's


a difference. And, by definition, the only


difference is who promulgated it. And then, of


course, I'm going to ask you, if there's a

difference right there, why doesn't this one,


which is executive plus judicial, fall on my side

of the difference?


 MR. KELLY: Well, maybe I -- maybe I don't


understand your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,


because parole commissions do not increase


sentences; parole commissions decrease sentences.


 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I -- in my imaginary


parole commission --


MR. KELLY: Okay. 


[Laughter.] 


JUSTICE BREYER: -- I will argue a


different point.


 MR. KELLY: Yes.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I will argue it


another time. I've seen a lot of parole


commission guidelines, and I would say they, a lot


of them did fall within the Apprendi boundaries. 


But if we did take it and have the parole


commission do it -- "it," being the Apprendi


forbidden system, in your view, is it


unconstitutional?


 MR. KELLY: It would certainly be


unconstitutional for a parole commission to find a


fact that increased a sentence.

is true of a -- of a court of appeals panel.


 MR. KELLY: If it could find a fact that


increased a sentence, yes, because those facts


must be found by a jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kelly, I would be


interested in hearing you address some of the


severability problems that the Government has been


raising.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could just ask one

more question, because this is important to me.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the previous


California system in which it was an indeterminate


sentence and the correctional authority made


findings which set the sentence? They were -­


they were committed to the California -­


MR. KELLY: Sure.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY : -- correctional authority


for the term prescribed by law, and that was set


after the fact, post hoc, by the California Adult


Authority.


 MR. KELLY: If the agency were increasing

it.

 MR. KELLY: -- on the basis of a finding ­

-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an indeterminate


sentence.


 MR. KELLY: Right.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They set the sentence.


 MR. KELLY: After the -- instead of the


judge or after the judge?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. It was just


sentenced, the judge, for the term prescribed by

law. And an agency, after interviewing the


defendant, after looking at the probation report,


set the sentence. The term prescribed by law


could be for life.


 MR. KELLY: If there were facts which were


necessary to authorize -­


JUSTICE STEVENS: He sets the sentence


within the range authorized by the jury's verdict. 

That's the question.


 MR. KELLY: Right, that's fine. If it's


within the range authorized by the jury's verdict,

it's fine.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well. 


What if, what if the statute says "every felony in


this state shall be punished by a term of not less


than one year, or, on the other side, life," and


you're committed to the parole authority, and the


parole authority will decide between those


boundaries?


 MR. KELLY: Assuming that authority is


given to the parole commission to select a


sentence, and no further findings need to be made


beyond those made by the jury, there's no Sixth

Amendment problem with that.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: There might be a due


process problem.


 MR. KELLY: In fact, there might be a lot


of other constitutional problems, but not a Sixth


Amendment problem.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I hope you will go over


to the -- to the severability problem, because, as


I understood it, you and the Government were very


much at odds about what should be severed and what


shouldn't, and we didn't get to ask Mr. Clement


about his severance, which was going to be that to


the extent no plus factors are involved, no


sentence-enhancing factors are involved, the

guidelines remain binding. He didn't get a chance


to say that in his argument, and I hope he'll


address it.


 And you say, "Whatever you do, don't make


it half binding and half advisory."


 MR. KELLY: Yes.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why would it be so


terrible to say, "Well, to the extent that there


are no sentencing enhancing factors, let's


preserve what Congress did, let's make them


binding when the jury doesn't have to find

anything"?


 MR. KELLY: For a couple of reasons,


Justice Ginsburg. The first is that Congress


certainly didn't intend to have dual systems. 


That destroys the congressional purpose of


uniformity because you would have sentences, I


suppose, being uniform under systems -- the system


where guidelines applied, but certainly not under


the system where the guidelines don't apply,


because there are guideline facts that need to be


found. So that congressional purpose is not


advanced.


 The second problem is that it's such an


easily manipulable system, particularly by the


74

25

Government. If the Government wants to be in the


guidelines, it doesn't allege a sentence-enhancing


fact, or a guideline fact. If the Government


doesn't want to be bound by the guidelines, it


alleges a guideline fact, and that takes


sentencing out of the guidelines. And that cannot


be what Congress intended.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it any less uniform,


any more manipulable, than on your proposal?


 MR. KELLY: Our -­


JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, uniformity is


gone. A certain manipulability has got to be


faced as a fact, and I'm not sure that you're


proposing a better solution, I gather.


 MR. KELLY: Well, I think our proposal


doesn't really allow for any manipulation at all,


Justice Souter. We're simply saying that the fact


finder must be a jury instead of a judge.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except that the


manipulation, at that point, is the manipulation,


in a way, in the present system, and that is it's


the manipulability of charge bargaining.


 MR. KELLY: Well, that's certainly true,


and that exists under the guidelines. It exists


without the guidelines. It exists in

discretionary systems. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It does exist under the 

guidelines? How does it?

 MR. KELLY: I think it does, because -­


JUSTICE BREYER: How?


 MR. KELLY: Well, certainly, to the extent


that prosecutors make decisions about what charges


they're going to bring -­


JUSTICE BREYER: No, only, only, only if


you have statutes that have mandatory minimums or


that have lesser sentences. That's true.


 MR. KELLY: Right.


 JUSTICE BREYER: But compared to the


status quo, if you have the guidelines alone, one


of their basic objectives was to prevent that kind

of manipulation. And, by and large, I thought


they had succeeded on that point.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, hasn't charge


bargaining simply been replaced with fact


bargaining?


 MR. KELLY: It has, to a large extent.


 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that lawful under the


guideline? Is the judge required to accept the

facts as the -- as the prosecution and defense

agree to present them?


 MR. KELLY: The judge is not required to ­

-


JUSTICE BREYER: No.


 MR. KELLY: -- accept the facts. The


judge typically does.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure that I


understand why you wouldn't have the same


alternatives under your view. Because is it not


correct that if the, if the sentence -- the change


under consideration is a decrease, those findings


could be made by a judge. Whereas, if it's an

increase, you'd say they have to be found by a


jury. So why don't you have the same possibility

of a two-track system under your view?


 MR. KELLY: I guess -- I wouldn't view


that as a two-track system, because the guidelines


would continue to apply in either case. It would


not be a situation in which the guidelines apply


to some criminal sentencings, but don't apply to


other criminal sentencings. The guidelines will


apply in every criminal sentencing. Whether a


fact finder needs to be a judge or a jury depends

upon whether the fact to be found increases the


judge's sentencing authority.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would say -- you


would say your proposal is closer to what Congress


really wanted, because it would leave in place all


of the sentences that would be commanded by the


guidelines, but just require a different fact

finder in some of the cases.


 MR. KELLY: That's exactly right, Justice


Stevens. You -­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then what about all


the factors -- Justice Breyer outlined four


categories of, of guideline factors that are not


easily, if at all, presented to the jury. The

Chief Justice mentioned the one of perjury at the

trial itself. Could never give that to a jury

because it hasn't happened until the trial. And


some of the others that become very complicated,


like he mentioned, other -- other relevant


conduct, relevant conduct, yeah. 


MR. KELLY: I agree that perjury is not

something that could be submitted to a jury -­

perjury during trial is not something that could

be submitted to a jury. That's -­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would just be

out.


 MR. KELLY: That would be out. That's one

of the very few.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would have to be


prosecuted as a separate -­


MR. KELLY: It would have to be prosecuted


as a separate crime.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well couldn't he have a


sentencing phase afterwards? I don't know.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I interrupt for


that?


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: There's one thing that's


running through my mind. What if the defendant


gets on the stand and testifies to a version of


the events that the jury must have disbelieved in

order to convict? Could not the judge -- in

effect, he would be making the finding -- he would


say, "The jury has really found this fact, and,

therefore, I can rely on it."


 MR. KELLY: I don't think so, Justice


Stevens, because the judge is still making the

finding that the witness deliberately lied, as


opposed to being mistaken in his testimony. And


that is a finding of fact that increases


sentencing authority. So I don't think that a


jury returning a guilty verdict in every case

25

means that the jury disbelieved, or thought at

least, that the defendant was lying.


 JUSTICE BREYER: What is your answer to


Justice Ginsburg's question? And I'd appreciate


your focusing on what I thought were the two most


important ones, which is, first, the -- I thought


that sentencing for a hundred years had gone on


primarily on the basis of the presentence report. 


And the idea was, the person is convicted and now


we're going to decide what to do with this


individual who's convicted, and we're going to


read what the probation officer writes about it,


and he'll go interview people after, as he does. 


And many, many, many, if not most, of the facts in


that presentence report were not available at the


time of trial. They're about the history of the


individual, and they're more about the manner in


which the crime was carried out.


 And the other main thing is the -- is the


vast number of really complex operations,


multiple-count rules, relevant conduct, all kinds


of things that -- try even "brandishing." I mean,


that's the second thing, the complexity.


 So the presentence report -­


MR. KELLY: Sure.

21

22

23

24

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and the complexity.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the


tradition was that we asked the jury to determine

what crime was committed, and the sentencing judge

to determine the context in which it was


committed.


 MR. KELLY: And that still happens, even


under our proposal, to a large extent, Your Honor,


because the presentence report has historically


guided a judge in exercising his discretion at

sentencing. To the extent that the judge

exercises discretion in selecting a sentence


within a guideline range, the judge will still

rely upon the presentence report. And, frankly,


most of what's in a presentence report doesn't


have to do with finding extra facts; it has to do


with guiding discretion in selecting a sentence. 


So I don't think that that really changes under


our system.


 With regard to the complexity, it's been


my experience in defending Federal criminal cases


that although the guidelines are lengthy, there


are only two or three that are likely to apply in


any particular case, and it's not particularly


complex to figure out what those are, and it

regard to how to determine facts that are required


by the guidelines. We give juries jury

instructions that are complicated all the time. 


We do it in RICO -­


JUSTICE BREYER: Congress's basic --


that's a good answer. Congress's basic objective

here is -- was uniformity. I think it was a noble


objective, whether or not it's been achieved or,

but are you saying to Congress, Sorry, the


Constitution prohibits you, in Congress, from


trying to create uniformity, or greater


uniformity, of sentencing among district judges? 

There's just no way you can do it, because if you

throw everything to a jury, you know, you throw it

right into the hands of the prosecutor to


determine what to charge, what not to charge, what


facts to agree upon, et cetera, no way to do it? 


We're back to our two cellmates -- one day served,


50 years served -- though the real conduct was the


same.


 MR. KELLY: The real conduct can still be


proved to a jury, as long as it's charged and

proved to a jury.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: How about the

form of verdict under your system? Is there one


line for the basic offense, and then other lines


for each additional factor that's alleged in the


indictment?


 MR. KELLY: There may be, depending on


the case. There may be cases in which a general


verdict is adequate because there are no guideline


facts to find that would increase sentencing -­


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you're


suggesting, then, a special -- a special verdict


in every case where there are guideline facts to


be found.


 MR. KELLY: Just as special verdicts have


been used since Apprendi to find drug quantities


and other facts that increase maximum sentences.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But a special verdict


wouldn't do from the point of view of the


defendant, I think would resist it very heavily,


if what the findings have to be are, say, a much


larger drug quantity, the relevant conduct. These


are things that could be damning for a defendant. 


So a defendant surely would not want that, all of


this to be tried to the jury that's going to try

the basic case. The defendant would much prefer


to have the jury not know about that it wasn't

five ounces, that it was 500 grams, or that, at


the same time, the defendant did a lot of other


bad things.


 MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I think we can


trust district judges to fashion procedural

protections that assure that trials are fair. 


That might, in some cases, mean bifurcating the


underlying elements of the offense and the


determination of those elements from the finding


of guideline facts -­


JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you would have to


have, then, essentially two trials.


 MR. KELLY: In some cases, yes.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't it -- isn't


it -- isn't that going to be so in every relevant


conduct case in which the Government thinks the


relevant conduct is a serious factor? There's


either going to have to be a separate jury verdict

on sentencing, or the district judge is going to

be limited simply to whatever range the jury fact

finding provides as the maximum range. There are


no other possibilities, are there?


 MR. KELLY: Well, in some of those cases,


Your Honor, the additional facts would come in on


the main trial anyway, as 404(b) kind of evidence


84

that is relevant to proving the underlying


charges. And if it's going to come in anyway,


then there probably wouldn't be a second part of


the trial. So I think -­


JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the defendant


in that case going to say look, I, I'm claiming a


serious problem, if you're asking the jury to make

a specific finding that I committed relevant facts


A, B, C, D, and E, even though I don't happen to


have been subjected to a criminal guilty verdict

with respect to each one. By, by requiring those


findings, you're going to skew the jury's mind to

the point where I'm not going to get a fair shake


on the guilty/not guilty finding or special fact


finding most immediately relevant to this case. 


Every defendant is going to demand a separate jury

proceeding for that, isn't he?


 MR. KELLY: It's certainly possible that


they'll demand separate, or bifurcation -­


JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you wouldn't sit


back and allow that focus, if you're the defense


lawyer you're not going to allow that focus to be


made at the time of the basic guilty/non guilty


finding, are you?


 MR. KELLY: Well, I've had experience with


85

21

25

that. And my experience has been, as I've said


before, I might ask for a bifurcated trial, but if


the judge thinks that that evidence is going to

come in against my client anyway, the judge is

going to deny bifurcation. If the judge says

you're right, this would be prejudicial to

introduce this evidence in the main case, then


we'll bifurcate the trial, and we'll let the jury

find guilty not guilty and then find


sentencing facts if a guilty verdict is


returned. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know what the


Kansas system is? I mean, right after Apprendi,


they transformed their guideline system into one


where the jury makes the findings, but are all of

their trials bifurcated?


 MR. KELLY: I don't know if they bifurcate


all their trials. My understanding is that it


works in a way that's similar to what I'm


suggesting could happen in Federal court. 


JUSTICE BREYER: As long as you're on the


subject, I'm quite --- you're going to --- what is

your reaction to what I've written, which you've,


you're just going to say wrong, wrong, wrong, but I want to

know why. And what I know why in particular is I

speculated somewhat, that the reason that this


might work, your side of it, if it works despite


the, the complication, the bifurcated trials,


etc., is that 97 percent of the cases are handled


through plea bargaining, and this will give you a


little bit of a leg up, which I speculated the


defense bar likes. I'm not surprised. But then,


I thought with in the long run, you just can't

have a system of justice that depends for its

workable nature upon plea bargaining, which in


fact depends on the weapons you give to


prosecutors. And so I ended


up thinking, I just can't

underwrite such a thing. And I'd like to get


your, your, your reaction to that.


 MR. KELLY: Your Honor, here's how plea


bargaining works now. The prosecutor charges the


easiest crime to prove that he can prove. There


is no effective plea bargaining in most of those


cases because the prosecutor knows he's going to


win that trial. So the defendant pleads guilty


because he doesn't want to lose his, his reduction


for acceptance of responsibility. I think what


changes is probably if our proposal is accepted,


that there is more meaningful negotiation and that

prosecutors and defense attorney's will come to an


understanding in most cases of what sentencing facts


are provable, and what are not, and cases will


continue to plead out much the same as they do


right now, except more effectively because we


eliminate the problem of the prosecutor being able


to prove the easiest charge and save the heart of


the case for sentencing.


 I think with that, Your Honor, I will,


unless there are other questions, defer to my


colleague.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.


Kelly. Ms. Scapicchio.


 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROSEMARY SCAPICCHIO


 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FANFAN


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: As to question one,


there's no meaningful difference between the


Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington


State Guidelines. The Government conceded as much


in their brief to this Court in Blakely. When


they filed an amicus brief in Blakely they told


this Court, or they urged this Court not to


invalidate the Washington State Guidelines


because, they told this Court, if you do, they are


so similar to the Federal Guidelines that the

25

Federal Guidelines will fall as well. And here


they are, less than five months later, standing


before the same Court, saying something completely


different. Now, it's not that they're so similar


to the Washington State Guidelines, but that


they're completely different, and that they don't


operate in the same manner at all. 


And what it comes down to is that for


Sixth Amendment purposes, the source of the law


doesn't matter. The Government got it right when


they filed their amicus brief in Blakely. It


doesn't matter to a defendant whether or not the


source of the law is legislative, or the source of


the law is by commission or regulatory body. If


the sentence is going to increase, based on a fact


that, that the law makes essential to punishment,


that fact must be pled and proved to a jury beyond a

reasonable doubt. 


JUSTICE BREYER: So can I ask you the same


question? Imagine that the statute says bank


robbery is zero to twenty years. Case one, a


separate statute says a guideline commission will


make distinctions, and the guideline commission


says, "five years in the ordinary case, seven


years with a gun." Case two, the same thing but a

parole commission does it. Case three, the same


thing, but a court of appeals panel does it, under


the guise of what's arbitrary, what isn't. 


They're all, in your opinion, to be treated alike.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: If there's a fact


necessary to increase the sentence --


JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is just what 
I said, just what I said.

 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Then yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: With respect to Mr.


Fanfan in this case, Mr. Fanfan's sentence was


promulgated based on the jury verdict alone. Mr.

Fanfan, the Government chose to indict Mr. Fanfan


on a single count of conspiracy. He went to trial


on a single count of conspiracy. 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Conspiracy to


what?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Conspiracy to distribute


500 grams of cocaine. The Government knew at the


time of trial that Mr. Fanfan was arrested with


281 grams of crack cocaine at the time of his


arrest. The Government chose not to indict him


for that 281 grams of crack cocaine, and instead,


they chose to prove the easiest possible

indictment before the jury. Once the jury was

dismissed in this case, the Government then sought


to increase Mr. Fanfan's sentence by 157 months,


based on the possession of the crack cocaine that


they knew about at the very beginning, and we're


suggesting that Judge Hornby did the right thing


in limiting Mr. Fanfan's sentence to that which


was supported by the jury verdict alone and

nothing else. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Hornby had some


distress in doing that, didn't he, because the


difference was quite large? Based on what the


judge found, it would have been fifteen or sixteen

years as opposed to five or six years?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: What Judge Hornby did for


Mr. Fanfan was, he conducted what he called a


presentence, a pre-Blakely hearing, and at the


pre-Blakely hearing he allowed the prosecutor to


present evidence relative to relevant conduct


involved in the offense. And the prosecutor


presented evidence that the relevant conduct


included this possession of 281 grams of crack


cocaine, as well as a case agent who claimed that


Mr. Fanfan was the leader of this entire


conspiracy. And then Judge Hornby went on to say,

based on everything that he heard in the pre-


Blakely hearing, if given the opportunity, he


would sentence my client to between 188 to 235


months. 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't say it, that


that was his discretionary choice. He said that -­


-


MS. SCAPICCHIO: He was required.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He made, he made those


findings of fact, that -- leadership role and the


quantity of drugs.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: He did.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And on the basis of


those two he said the guidelines would require me


to come up with this higher sentence, not that


using the guidelines as advisory he would have


gotten -­


MS. SCAPICCHIO: Absolutely. It was the


guidelines required him to impose sentence between


188 to 235 months.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the other,


that's the high range, and the low range is, I'll


just stick with the crime that he was indicted

for, and that's five or six years.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: He, what Judge Hornby did

is, is he sentenced Mr. Fanfan based solely on the


jury's verdict. The jury only heard evidence of

the conspiracy to distribute 500 grams of crack


cocaine. Because the jury only heard evidence,

and thus returned a verdict based solely on the


500 grams of crack cocaine, then Mr. Fanfan's


sentence, according to Judge Hornby after this


Court decided Blakely, was limited to the jury

verdict alone.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's quite a windfall


for Mr. Fanfan, isn't it? 


MS. SCAPICCHIO: Well, in this particular


case I would say no, because the Government 


knew when this Court decided Apprendi,


and certainly knew by the time this


Court decided Ring, that if they wanted


to increase a defendant's sentence beyond the


statutory max, that they should plead it and prove


it in the indictment. And in this case, they


chose not to. And so, whether or not Mr. Fanfan


may -- get some benefit because of this


Court's decision in Blakely, certainly he does. 


I'm not denying that he doesn't. But only because


the Government didn't do what this Court told them


they should do in both Apprendi and Ring.

 CHIEF JUSTICE STEVENS: Did the trial


judge give any indication of what sentence he

would have imposed if he were not constrained by


the guidelines?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: He did not. He indicated


that, if the guidelines applied, that he believed


Mr. Fanfan fell between 188 and 235 months. There


was no discussion at all as to whether or not he


had discretion to sentence anywhere outside the


guidelines during this proceeding.


 And, with respect to question two in this


case, whether or not the guidelines are severable,


which of course is the more difficult question


before the Court, our proposal to sever out those


portions of the guidelines that require judicial

fact finding by a preponderance of the evidence


will accomplish the sentencing reform goals. The


goals of the sentencing reform were uniformity,


proportionality, and certainty.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You wouldn't


sever out the ones that would permit a downward


departure, would you?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Would we sever the


portions of the statute that require --­


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You would leave

in place the provisions for downward departures?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: We would leave in place


the majority of the sentencing guidelines.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, and -- but


could you answer my question?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Mr. Chief Justice, would


I sever out -- 


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Would you leave


in place the provisions for downward departure?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Yes.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: How can you do that? 


The statute that makes the guidelines mandatory


applies to both upwards and downwards departures,


so I have always had trouble knowing what


provision of the statute anybody severs. I can


understand your saying that there's a bunch of


unconstitutional applications of the statute, and


you have to set aside the sentences in those


particular cases, but I simply don't understand


severing a single provision that covers both


upward and downward departures. How do you sever


it?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Well, I think you sever it


by severing out the unconstitutional portions of


it. And you sever it by getting rid of anything

--

that indicates that it's a judicial fact

finding by a preponderance of the evidence.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the same,


that's the same provision that allows departures


for the same -- by the same procedure.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Well, the departures in ­


JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you're not


severing a piece of a statute, you're just

severing a bunch of applications of the statute


you think are invalid.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: The applications of the


statute that are invalid in this case are the ones


that require judicial fact finding by a

preponderance of the evidence.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. I understand. 


MS. SCAPICCHIO: Those under Blakely need


to be severed. What we're left with now is a


statute that needs to, that needs to function in


terms of saving the guidelines.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But would it -­


would it really save the guidelines in the way


that Congress intended them, to strike basically


the provision for enhancements, and leaving in


place the provisions for downward departures?

 MS. SCAPICCHIO: It's not going to operate


exactly the way Congress intended. Because


Congress never intended to pass a statute that was


unconstitutional. And so it has to undergo some


change. And in this particular case, what we're


saying is, minimize the amount of changes that the


statute has to undergo in order to preserve it.


 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, maybe we should


just leave it to Congress to decide, because it

doesn't sound like the scheme Congress intended.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Well, Congress intended a


mandatory system. It's clear that Congress


intended a mandatory system. The Government -­


JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And it intended fact


finding by a preponderance for both upward


adjustments and downward.

 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Not necessarily fact


finding by the judiciary. It's not one of the

listed goals of the sentencing reform act. Those


listed goals are uniformity, proportionality and


certainty, and those goals can still be met under


the proposal that we're suggesting the Court


adopt. There will still be uniformity in


sentencing, there will still be proportionality


and there will still be certainty of sentence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but will


there be proportionality if the sentences,


sentences can be downward, the jury verdict could

be adjusted downward, but not upward?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: If it turns out, Mr.


Chief Justice, that there is some, some difference


in the severity of a sentence that a defendant


receives, certainly Congress could, could come in


and make the appropriate changes if that's the


result of the proposal that we're suggesting, but


the proportionality wouldn't change. You know,


the degree of crimes is still going to line up in


the exact same manner.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But you can say


the same thing if we simply said that the whole


guidelines fall, and they're simply there for


judges to apply if they wish. You can say, "Well,

if Congress doesn't like that they can come in and


put a new system." That's true any time Congress


acts. 


MS. SCAPICCHIO: But -- absolutely, Mr.


Chief Justice, it is true any time Congress acts,


but in this particular case, the Government has


the burden of proving the inseverability of the


statute. We're attempting to show that the

statute is severable to save the guidelines in


this case, and we're attempting to show that by


suggesting to the Court that you don't have to


throw out twenty years of sentencing reform. That


the guidelines should still be mandatory; we're


suggesting that the mandatory portions of the


guidelines remain, the bulk of the guidelines


remain, and we're changing the fact finder.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you -- why do you


have to call it severability? Suppose we just

said it's clear that whenever these facts have not


been found by a jury, the guidelines cannot be

applied? That the guidelines are


unconstitutional, as applied, when there's been no


jury finding, and leave it. We're not severing

any particular language, we're just saying that

that portion, that proceeding in that fashion


produces an unconstitutional sentence. And then


let the Government work out how it wants to find


its way around that problem.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: That's certainly an


option that the Court could consider.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just not sure, I share

Justice Stevens' perplexity as to whether that's


really properly described as severing part of the

statute.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: And may I add this


thought, that it seems to me, I don't know whether


this is true; Mr. Clement and I had a dialogue


that was inconclusive; I had been under the


impression, perhaps erroneous, that in fact the


number of unconstitutional departures if one


follows Apprendi as being the constitutional rule,


is actually a small percentage of the total, and


if it should follow that only three, four, five,


six percent of the sentences that have heretofore


been imposed or will be imposed in the future


would be unconstitutional, that's a pretty weak


reason for saying the whole statute is


unconstitutional on its face, or even in one


provision of the statute. It seems to me you just

say, "Oh, okay, you can't impose those sentences


in those three percent of the cases." I don't


know why that's a departure from our prior


practice.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: I, Well, I think because


what's left is, is that the system will then be


open to some manipulation, under that scenario. 


If the Government can control who it is that will


be sentenced under the guidelines and who will not

be sentenced under the guidelines, then the system


is, is ripe for manipulation.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, my suggestion is


everybody is going to be sentenced under the Guidelines;


the only difference is that in three or four


percent of the cases you may have to bring a jury

in to get an enhanced sentence.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: In, under that scenario,


if any fact that needed to increase a defendant's


sentence was pled and proved to a jury, that would

suffice.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't care whether


you call this severing, severability or not, would


you?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Absolutely not.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think you would.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: It produces the same


results, whether it's, you call it severance or


the way that the statute works.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I assume, don't you,


that any solution we come up to is likely to be an


interim solution anyway?

an interim solution and the legislature will tell us


what they really want us to do and we'll all make

the appropriate adjustments.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the idea is that this


works because most cases are plea bargained.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Most cases are plea


bargained.


 JUSTICE BREYER: So what you'll do if


you're right, is all you would say is any time


that the prosecutor wants to say that you


committed the bank robbery or you committed the


drug offense with more than a minimal amount of


money or more than a minimal amount of drug, or


there were guns, they get into a bargain, and they


end up with a sentence once they bargain -- if


that's the sentence, because they're not even


going to contest it before the judge, both sides

will come in and agree. But in those few cases


where they do contest it, you would have to have


the jury find the facts.

 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Yes.


 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the only reason that


I find it disturbing is to think that Congress


could have wanted such a system is given other


developments in Congress, mandatory minimums and


all kinds of things, that seems to me to be a


system that would really, might make non­

uniformity in reality, worse than it was before


1986. See, I mean, my goodness, every


prosecutor's going to be doing something


different, every defense attorney; everything will


depend upon the bargains. The judges when they

come in will think different things. I mean -­


MS. SCAPICCHIO: The -­


JUSTICE BREYER: Should we uphold


something like that in the face of a Congress that


wanted uniformity?


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Yes, and I'll tell you


why. Because that's exactly the way that the


guidelines operate now. The only thing that's


changing is the identity of the fact finder. That


the Government can come in now and charge whatever


it wants, because it's free to charge whatever it


wants, and that, the Government in this case, or


in any case, could then bargain with defense


counsel and the defendant as to which facts they


may want to plead to, as to which portions of the


indictment they may want to plead to, happens


every day. And, and, and so, if that's the case,


changing the identity of the fact finder isn't


going to change that process at all.

in your research on this where anybody in the -­


this discussion on the guidelines began, I think,


in the early 70's, it's been around for 30 years. 


The guidelines have been law for 17 years, and


until recently with Apprendi, is there a history


of anything being written on the guidelines


being unconstitutional for the Sixth Amendment


reason? Did any group of judges, or defense

attorneys, or academics or anybody write anything


that we could look at until quite recently in


which they thought this was a possibility?

this Court's decision in Apprendi?

Apprendi? .

 JUSTICE BREYER: Nothing.

Thomas's opinion in Apprendi? He's got a lot of


prior law that's in there that maybe would be of


interest to you.

jury's verdict by affirming the district court's

imposition of a 78-month sentence based solely on


the facts found by the jury beyond a reasonable

doubt.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one, one

last question? Do you agree that within the


guidelines ranges, which sometimes are fairly


large, the judge does have the discretion to

impose any sentences he wants to based on the


conduct of the defendant, whether or not it's


proved by the jury?

 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Within the guideline


range? Yes.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: You get to the range by


the jury finding, the judge still retains

substantial discretion within the, within the


range.


 MS. SCAPICCHIO: Substantial discretion


within the range, yes. If there are no further


questions.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Ms.


Scapicchio. Mr. Clement, you have four minutes


remaining.

 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief


Justice. 


This Court in Mistretta expressed its


understanding that the commission was


constitutional because it would pursue traditional


judicial tasks related to sentencing, and it would

not get involved in quintessentially legislative


acts of setting maximum penalties, or defining the


elements of the crime. Now, we of course, think


that's quite relevant for the Sixth Amendment


issue that's raised in question one; but even if


you disagree with us on that, even if you think


the non-legislative origins of the guidelines


don't matter for purposes of question one, surely


they do matter for purposes of the severability


analysis under question two. Because if one takes


those elements, those enhancement factors in the


guidelines, and treats them like true elements of


crimes that must go to the jury, then you are

giving this non-legislative body's work product


the effect of Federal criminal statutes, and


that's something that not only Mistretta suggests


is problematic, but United States v. Hudson in


1812 suggests is problematic. And the effect is


really breathtaking; it is an understatement to

say that the effect of that judicial remedial

decision would be to create thousands of new


Federal crimes.


 Now, let me talk just for a second about

the language of severability. There's been some


questions about whether what we're really talking


about is severability. First of all you're going


to have some cases where there's going to be no


enhancing factor at all. And in those cases you


don't need to talk about severability. If there's


no Sixth Amendment issue raised in a case, there's


no reason to strike anything down and that would


be a simple matter of traditional principles of


third party standing and facial challenges. The


fact that you might have a constitutional problem


in this case, doesn't mean that you invalidate the


guidelines in those other cases, where they apply


without problem. 


The real question becomes, what do you do


in a case where there is a Sixth Amendment


problem, assuming Blakely applies to the


guidelines? At that point, I think severability


is the right way to talk about it. One way of


dealing with the case at the point you recognize


there's a Sixth Amendment problem in this case is


107

to say, "Well, there's nothing we can do about it,


we can't sentence this individual to any more than


the upper bound of the sentencing range." The


second thing you can do is you can say, "Well,


okay, there's a constitutional problem, but the


result is that we sever 3553(b), we don't make the


guidelines mandatory, and we allow the judge to

impose a discretionary sentence within the range


of the statute." That is what we think is the


appropriate solution. 


As a couple of you have mentioned, what we


may be talking about here is an interim solution


Anyway. Congress may well get involved. That's


why in considering what regime of remediability or


severability best serves the interests of Congress


in uniformity and proportionality, it pays to pay


particular attention to the cases that are in the


pipeline now. And on those cases, there's no


question which proposal better serves the interest


of uniformity and proportionality. Respondents


have to admit that they are seeking a huge


sentencing windfall here. 


One other point that bears mention is this


idea of, the suggestion that because the


guidelines will not be binding in every case, the

Government somehow controls the decision as to


whether or not it's a guidelines case or not. 


That is not the case. That decision under the


system will rest with the judge. If there is an

enhancement sought, but it's not found in the


basis of the judge, then there's no Sixth

Amendment problem in that case, and the case can


go forward. 


The irony, of course, is that the


consequence of applying Blakely to the guidelines


is to create more power with the prosecutor,


because as Justice Breyer pointed out, under the


current system of the guidelines, the prosecutor


cannot control through the indictment exactly what


sentencing factors the judge will consider. The

Burns case, for example, that this Court had


involved a situation where the judge sua sponte took

notice of sentencing factors that neither the


prosecutor nor the defendant very much wanted in


front of the court. That will no longer be


possible under a system where everything has to be


in the indictment, so the result is to strengthen


the hand of the Government.


 The last thing is this idea of bifurcation


is not a panacea. I know Justice Scalia, you've

thrown that out in a number of instances, but the


traditional rule in cases with real elements of


real Federal crimes is that you don't get to


bifurcate out one element that the defendant


doesn't want to put before the jury. That's the,

that's the binding law in cases like Collamore out


of the First Circuit and Barker out of the Ninth


Circuit. So, I think it's wrong to simply suggest that,


that bifurcation is going to solve all these


problems. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.


Clement, the case is submitted.


 (Whereupon at 2:46 p.m., the case in the


above-entitled matter was submitted.)
