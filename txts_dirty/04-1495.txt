(11:18 a.m.) 

JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in 

04-1495, Hartman against Moore. 

Mr. Kneedler, whenever you're ready, you may 

proceed. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KNEEDLER: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court: 

Respondent alleges in this Bivens action that 

petitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to 

be prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by 

the First Amendment. In order to make out such a 

claim, however, respondent must establish that there 

was no probable cause for the prosecution. That is so 

for three mutually reinforcing reasons. 

First, that requirement accords with the 

deference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong 

and other cases must be given to the prosecutorial 

function because that function is core to the executive 

branch's operations and because prosecutorial decision-

making is ill-suited to judicial second guessing. 

Second, that rule accords a -- an important 

objective screen and check against claims of

retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the 

chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise 

from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those 

involved in the prosecutorial decisionmaking process. 

And third, that rule is deeply rooted in 

history. A claim of First Amendment retaliatory 

prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious 

prosecution, and it has long been required that an 

essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution 

is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause 

for the prosecution. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not sure why --

why we should make the classification that you did, 

that -- that retaliatory is simply a species of -- of 

malicious. I mean, I -- I can see the similarities, 

but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment 

value here which just is not part of the -- the 

analytical mix when you're talking about malicious 

prosecution. So I'm not sure why we should -- we -- we 

should classify it as you argue. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- for several 

reasons. First of all, the -- the First Amendment --

the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the 

malice, a form of the malice that would arise in --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- it's a peculiar,

if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of 

constitutional values, and I don't know of anything 

comparable in -- in malicious prosecution generically. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, to be sure, what renders 

it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but --

but the derivation of -- of the reason for why it's 

wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential 

relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution. 

And if -- if I may add to that, the -- the 

reason why the -- the tort of malicious prosecution is 

highly relevant here is not simply because on the 

malice side of it, but also because it has long been 

recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First 

Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that 

there are critical interests on the other side, not 

simply the defendant's interest in avoiding badly 

motivated prosecutions, but the important 

countervailing public interest of ensuring that 

wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who 

have information about it will come forward. 

And -- and that was recognized by Blackstone 

early on and has been recognized consistent --

consistently by this Court in -- in many, many 

decisions, including recent cases of this Court 

involving immunity issues, which is what we have here,

specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious 

prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules 

should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action 

is brought in the specific context of prosecution. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose there is probable 

cause for a prosecution, but the prosecutors are 

extremely busy and they -- they have to select their 

cases and they select one in which they bring the 

prosecution against the defendant on account of his 

speech. Is that a violation of the prosecutorial duty? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in terms -- in 

terms of the responsibilities of the prosecutor, there 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MR. KNEEDLER: -- that -- that should not --

that should not be a -- a selection criterion in 

itself, but it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking is it a 

violation of the prosecutor's professional obligations 

and his professional duties? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I would think 

ordinarily yes, but with this caveat. Unlike race 

which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision-

making process, there can often be a prosecution -- and

this case is one of them -- in which you might have 

claims of public corruption. And -- and in fact, there 

was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the 

Postal Service board of directors for receiving 

payments to -- for his activity on behalf of 

respondent's corporation and others. This -- this --

involving contracts for $250 million. This was a very, 

very important procurement by the Post Office 

Department and it is understandable that in connection 

with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal 

Service investigators would look into issues of 

respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the 

Government. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just going back to the 

hypothetical, if -- if you acknowledge -- and I think 

you must -- that there's a violation of the 

prosecutorial duty in -- in the instance I suppose, 

then why shouldn't the law recognize it and -- and give 

force to that sanction and give force to that rule? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, there -- there are 

certain restrictions -- certainly restrictions on what 

the prosecutor may do, but several points about that. 

First of all, this is not a Bivens action 

against the prosecutor. The prosecutor is absolutely 

immune from suit. The prosecutor's decision-making

process is -- is, in fact, as is the grand jury's, a --

a critical protection against malicious prosecution --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then 

we'll just change the hypothetical to make it the 

investigators. The investigators select their case 

based on this speech that they consider unwelcome. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the question is 

whether in that circumstance the -- the Bivens 

plaintiff, the criminal defendant, has a First 

Amendment right to be excused from prosecution or, 

after the prosecution is unsuccessful, to bring a civil 

action, whether he has a right not to have been 

prosecuted in those circumstances notwithstanding the 

existence of probable cause and the independent 

judgment by the prosecutor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does he have a right 

not to be singled out because of his speech? 

MR. KNEEDLER: He does -- he does not have a 

-- he does not have a First Amendment claim in those 

circumstances where there is probable cause for the 

violation. The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I asked does he have a 

right not to be singled out because of his speech. 

MR. KNEEDLER: He does not have a First 

Amendment right not to be singled out in those

circumstances. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you -- you 

would advise law enforcement officials that they can 

single out persons for prosecution based on distasteful 

speech. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I would not. I -- I'm not --

I'm not endorsing the motivation. What I'm -- what I'm 

saying is what is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I want you to do is to 

agree. I -- I think you have to concede there is this 

principle in the law, and I think your answer has to be 

even though there's that principle, there's a lot of 

problems with enforcing it because there are going to 

be too many suits, it's hard to -- it's difficult for 

the Government to defend, and -- and so forth and so 

on. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I'm not disputing 

that it -- that -- that a -- a prosecution should not 

be brought or should not be heard --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're not disputing 

either, as I understand it. As the case comes to us, 

we assume the prosecution would not have been brought 

but for the retaliatory motive. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I -- it is -- we certainly 

disagree with that with our proposition.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you assume that 

for the purposes of your argument? 

MR. KNEEDLER: For -- for purposes of our 

probable -- probable cause claim, yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's the only 

argument. 

MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that is true, but 

that, of course, was also true at common law for -- for 

malicious prosecution. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the -- one of the 

differences -- am I not correct, that at common law the 

prosecutor did not have absolute immunity? 

MR. KNEEDLER: At common law -- at common 

law, yes. As this Court has recognized in 

reformulating the common law principles of -- of 

immunity, the -- the public prosecutor now has absolute 

immunity under -- under these --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Now does, but not at common 

law. 

MR. KNEEDLER: -- under these Court's --

under this Court's decisions. 

But at common law, the prosecutor did have 

the protection of malicious prosecution, and as 

Justice Scalia observed in his concurring opinion in 

the Kalina decision, the elements of the tort of

prosecution essentially had a built-in qualified 

immunity, and the probable cause requirement was 

essentially that. It afforded protection for the 

prosecutor. The -- the private citizen who -- who --

the complaining witness -- he could not be the subject 

of a suit for damages if -- if the charges were 

dismissed, not simply upon a showing -- it required 

more than simply a showing of malice. It required a 

showing of an absence of probable cause for reasons 

that are essentially identical to the qualified 

immunity and absolute immunity -- the -- the reasons 

for qualified and absolute immunity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're not totally 

identical because you didn't have the First Amendment 

interest involved in those cases, whereas you do have a 

First Amendment interest at stake here. 

MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but on -- on the -- on 

the governmental interest side of the balance, the 

interests are exactly the same in both -- in both 

circumstances. And that is not to chill -- not -- not 

to create circumstances where people would hold back 

from coming forward with information of violations of 

the law because of fear that they would be sued and 

retaliated against afterward. And that hasn't changed

now that we have public prosecutors. It's still 

critical. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, may -- would 

you clarify just one point about this probable cause? 

There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then 

there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out 

at the close of the Government's case. There is not 

enough evidence here to convict this man. 

Are you saying that as long as the grand jury 

indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order 

to indict, the grand jury would have had to find 

probable cause? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, at -- at common law 

on the tort of malicious prosecution, the indictment 

created a presumption because an indictment does have 

to depend upon probable cause, and under the -- under 

this Court's decision in Gerstein v. Pugh and other 

decisions, that can't be reexamined by the court in the 

prosecution. 

But at common law, the -- the indictment 

created a presumption that was subject to rebuttal by 

the -- by the civil plaintiff. There was some 

disagreement about what would be necessary, whether you 

would have to show fraud on the grand jury or whether 

you could just retry --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, tell me about now, 

not at the common law. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We do not -- we do not 

think that the existence of the grand -- it has not 

been our position that the existence of the indictment 

is dispositive and cannot be challenged, but we do 

think it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the grand jury did 

find probable cause. So what would the plaintiff have 

to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of 

probable cause? 

MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think in a -- in a --

it would have to show by at least a preponderance of 

the evidence, maybe a clear showing, that there was not 

probable cause. And I think that also ties in to the 

-- to the standard for qualified immunity, which is 

could a reasonable person in those circumstances have 

believed that there was probable cause. I think, if 

the grand jury returns an indictment, that that should 

be pretty persuasive evidence but not compelling 

evidence -- I mean, not dispositive evidence that there 

was probable cause. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The case that comes 

closest, as far as I can see, is probably United States 

v. Armstrong, and in that case, this Court said in the

ordinary case, so long as the prosecutor has probable 

cause to believe the offense was committed, the 

decision to prosecute or go before a grand jury rests 

entirely in his discretion. But, of course, the 

discretion is subject to constitutional constraints, 

the equal protection component of the Due Process 

Clause. The decision whether to prosecute may not be 

based on an unjustifiable standard such as race, 

religion, or other arbitrary classification. And the 

standard the Court articulated there was the defendant 

must present clear evidence --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, clear evidence, and the 

Court stressed that it was a --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- to the contrary. Now, 

that's different from your proposition of probable 

cause. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think several 

things may explain that. 

In Armstrong, that was a claim of selective 

prosecution that was brought --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Based on race. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Based on race. That was one 

of the distinctions I was going to point to. And 

secondly --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why should that be

different than the First Amendment violation? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, as -- as this Court's 

decision in -- in Johnson, for example, shows, there --

distinctions based on race are subject to strict 

scrutiny no matter what the context, in that case even 

in the prison context, whereas First Amendment claims 

often take account of the context in which they are 

raised. For example, this Court in the American-Arab 

Anti-Discrimination case held that there would -- could 

be no claim at all of selective prosecution in the 

immigration context because of the important 

countervailing interest in enforcing the law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're willing to 

acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that 

you can have a different standard when the -- the basis 

for the selective prosecution happens to violate the 

Constitution from the standard you apply where the 

basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the 

Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he 

was mean to my brother-in-law. Okay? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to apply a 

different standard there than you would apply where --

where the reason is some First Amendment reason? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, no. The -- the other

distinction -- and -- and I'm not sure if this goes to 

your point or not. The other distinction is that in 

Armstrong the claim was made in the criminal 

prosecution itself. Here, the claim is the civil 

action after the criminal prosecution is over with, and 

it's in that -- in that context especially that the 

analogy to malicious prosecution is very strong and why 

the element of -- that the person has to -- that the --

there has to have been a favorable termination for the 

-- for the plaintiff and there has to be a probable cause. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But would you answer my 

question? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I --

maybe -- I guess I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's going be a different 

criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different 

for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal 

Protection Clause, at least where race is involved. 

What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but 

I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't 

like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of 

mine? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't -- I don't --

common law --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, and would you apply 

a different standard because there isn't a 

constitutional claim? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. There wouldn't be any 

claim at all. I mean, there wouldn't be any basis for 

a claim. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- a malicious prosecution 

claim. You'd have a malicious prosecution claim. 

MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there -- and in the 

-- in the Federal sphere, if there was a malicious -- a 

common law malicious prosecution claim, that would have 

to be brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act against 

the United States. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Kneedler, I 

understand your argument to be they should be treated 

just like a malicious prosecution claim, which is no 

distinction between a constitutional basis and a common 

-- and just that he hated his brother-in-law. I think 

you're saying they're the same. That's what I 

understand Justice Scalia to be asking you.

First Amendment claim is what gives you the Bivens 

cause of action in the first place. So otherwise, 

there wouldn't be any Federal cause of action at all 

without -- without the First Amendment claim. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's how you'd get at 

least as much protection as if it was an ordinary 

malicious prosecution claim, but you don't get any more 

under your view. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, because -- and -- and 

again, this -- this is -- this is because of the -- of 

the background of the common law tort of malicious 

prosecution, which strikes exactly the balance that I 

-- that I'm talking about. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But you really want three 

things. You say we want the protection, number one, of 

there -- if you're -- if there's probable cause, that's 

the end of it. Number two, if you're trying to show 

there wasn't probable cause, you have to bear clear and

convincing evidence, and number three, we also have 

qualified immunity. And I guess, number four, you have 

to prove the whole thing by clear and convincing 

evidence. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: It sounds a little bit like 

the person who has the overcoat, turns up the heat, you 

know, five or -- what about one? 

MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about this one? And I 

want to know -- you simply say you need clear and 

convincing evidence that that was the motive and it 

wouldn't have been brought otherwise. And the 

existence of probable cause is a strong factor, maybe 

even a presumption, that suggests to the contrary. 

Now, have States and other places tried 

things like that without the world collapsing? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. My understanding from --

from reading the treatises on -- on malicious 

prosecution, for example, that there has been no 

watering down of the probable cause requirement because 

it is understood to be a critical check against --

JUSTICE BREYER: So as far as you know, every 

State and every jurisdiction where -- and investigators 

if they don't have absolutely immunity, whatever -- in

all those jurisdictions, nobody has ever said that even 

a constitutional violation, if there's probable cause, 

that's the end of it. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I'm -- I'm focusing on 

the tort of malicious prosecution which is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'm not focusing. 

MR. KNEEDLER: -- which --

JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if --

MR. KNEEDLER: I'm not -- I'm not aware --

I'm not aware that any jurisdiction has done that. 

But in response to your proposal, the -- the 

-- what -- what's wrong with that is that it would 

allow extensive inquiry, discovery, other inquiry into 

the subjective motivations of persons involved in the 

decision-making process with no mechanism analogous to 

immunity or the -- or the probable cause criterion to 

weed out --

JUSTICE BREYER: We have no experience. We 

don't know. Okay. As your -- as far as you can tell. 

The other question I have, which you might 

want to be brief about, is in looking through this 

record, as far as I could see from the briefs, they 

went ahead and prosecuted this man with only two pieces

of evidence. The first evidence was that he tore some 

pages out of his notebook. But he introduced lots of 

notebooks to show he always tore pages out when he gave 

them to his secretary. And the second was that he told 

some witnesses be very careful and answer the question. 

Now, you know, he said a few other things, but they 

all seemed like the kind of things that people would 

always say to witnesses. 

Now, if that's the only evidence, except for 

the fact he owns the company, how is there probable 

cause here? 

MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there was much, much 

more evidence. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't see any in 

the brief. 

MR. KNEEDLER: There --

JUSTICE BREYER: I saw a lot about other 

people in the brief, but not about him. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, for one thing, it's 

absolutely conceded that there was a conspiracy. Three 

people pleaded guilty, including --

JUSTICE BREYER: There are all kinds of 

things about other people. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but --

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- the -- it isn't all about 

other people. The -- the -- that crime included -- and 

it's accepted in this case that the Postal Service 

board of -- board member accepted 30 percent of the 

fees paid by respondent's company to the consulting 

firm. Respondent's company. He was the chief 

executive officer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I would like you to limit 

yourself to what I didn't concede. I concede it's his 

company. I concede that he tore some pages out of his 

notebook, and I concede that he told -- which he did a 

lot of times. And I concede that he told witnesses 

answer the question, et cetera. Now, is there anything 

else connecting him, not his company? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In -- in the summer of 

1984, before there was even a consulting agreement, 

there was a series of conversations between Voss, the 

postal board -- board member, and respondent, including 

one for which there are notes in which Voss said I am 

working for you. 

There -- there was an -- there is an 

abundance of evidence involving Reedy who is -- no. I 

-- I know, but just in -- just in terms of -- just in 

terms of the sequence. 

There is evidence that Voss and Moore were

good friends. Voss said that he had a close 

relationship with respondent, and when the contract was 

first being negotiated, Reedy acknowledged that Voss 

and Moore were good friends. They had a close 

relationship. They were not distant. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, I know you're 

responding to Justice Breyer's question, but I think 

for purposes of our decision, we're not supposed to 

decide whether there was probable cause or not, but 

we're to give you the opportunity to prove there was if 

-- if you win on your --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, although I -- I certainly 

do not want to leave the misimpression that -- and 

there is -- there is much more. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a disputed 

issue, and we don't have to decide the probable cause 

issue. Is that not correct? 

MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that -- you do not 

have -- you do not have to decide it, but I would 

certainly urge the Court not to proceed on the 

assumption or make any comments that there is because 

there were -- there were --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But because the other side 

is arguing that even if there is probable cause, the 

burden shifts when they prove the retaliatory motive,

and you have to prove that you would never -- you made

had been no retaliatory motive. That's what we're 

arguing --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and that is their 

position. And that position accords -- yes, that is 

their position. And that accords no particular --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question I would 

ask is why should this be different from a wrongful 

discharge case in which there's ample cause to 

discharge and the issue boils down to whether or not he 

would have been discharged anyway. Why isn't it the 

same -- same situation? 

MR. KNEEDLER: What is very different is that 

this is the prosecutorial function. As this Court 

recognized in Armstrong, that is a core executive 

branch function and it is one that the courts are ill-

suited to second-guess because a whole variety of 

determinations can enter into whether to prosecute 

somebody, whether they -- whether the particular 

conduct -- how culpable the person is, whether the 

conduct fits into the overall prosecutorial priorities, 

whether there will be cooperating witnesses, what --

what the office's resources are. There are a whole 

bunch of -- of judgments that courts are ill-suited to

second-guess, and it would be very chilling if the 

prosecutor had to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't all 

those considerations justify a rule that makes the 

burden of proving the retaliatory motive very high, 

say, maybe it has to be by clear and convincing 

evidence or something like that? But once you have it 

acknowledged -- I don't know if they're really 

acknowledged here, but there's strong evidence of 

retaliatory motive -- why shouldn't the burden shift 

just on that, on the basis of that proof? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- oh, not -- we do not 

think there is strong evidence of retaliatory motive. 

And I -- I can -- can address that, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if you had a --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- if you had a heavy 

burden of proof at that stage of the proceeding, 

wouldn't that protect the interests that mainly concern 

you? 

MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think the more direct 

-- I don't think so for -- partly for the reason that I 

-- that I gave to Justice Breyer is that -- that that 

would not protect against discovery and -- and the sort 

of chilling inquiry that this Court has recognized in

its immunity cases, and especially in the prosecutorial 

function where the prosecutor would be required to 

disclose. Even though the prosecutor is absolutely 

immune, the prosecutor's decision-making process and 

his communication with law enforcement agents would --

would be exposed for judicial scrutiny, public scrutiny 

in a way that could chill the prosecutorial function. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, the defendant 

here is not the prosecutor. Right? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just someone who provided 

information to the prosecutor that -- that was 

erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think erroneous. It 

was allegedly maliciously motivated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Allegedly maliciously 

motivated, at least. 

I don't understand how you would apply the 

test, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted 

anyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive, 

when the person you're -- you're suing is not the 

prosecutor. It wasn't up to this person whether there 

would be a prosecution. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a -- I think 

that's a very important point, and before a -- a court

enters into that, in the end, unknowable question, 

maybe a court can -- can, in the end, determine 

probabilities, but before a court undertakes that, 

which requires looking not simply at the motivation of 

the -- of the law enforcement officers, but the 

prosecutor and -- and who knows whether the grand jury 

would have returned an indictment, and yet a court 

certainly couldn't be expected to inquire into that. 

Now, so we -- we think that that's another reason why 

the probable cause requirement is a critical gateway 

before a court is -- is going to enter into that 

determination. 

And all -- and it's important to remember 

it's not just proving the question of causation, but 

these are people who are several steps removed from the 

-- from the prosecutorial decision. And the -- and the 

personal liability would be visited on the law 

enforcement agents who were doing their job and 

cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office. 

This case was -- this case got attention at 

the highest levels of the U.S. Attorney's Office. The 

U.S. Attorney personally met with the -- the respondent 

-- lawyers for respondent.

closely, typed it one in which the evidence of 

retaliation was strong and probable cause weak. This 

is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert. 

That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel. And 

I think you've been arguing that that is not the case, 

but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we 

-- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here, 

weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of 

retaliation? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I don't -- I don't think 

there's any reason to accept that because there's no 

factual determinations to that effect. 

There -- there are really just two snippets 

of evidence that are primarily relied upon by the court 

of appeals for the view that there was a retaliatory 

motive here. And they were -- they were really 

observations that the -- that the inspectors made to --

to show -- the first one was why the corporation should 

be indicted, not just -- not just Moore, but why the 

corporation should be indicted. And it was just an 

observation that the corporation, through its agents, 

was involved in a lot of activities and should be held 

accountable. It was not -- it was not evidence of a --

of a retaliatory motive, and there were subpoenas for 

-- for documents about political contributions. But

let's remember that this was a case involving bribery

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK F. McCARTAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. McCARTAN: Justice Stevens, if it please 

the Court: 

If I may, Your Honors, I would like to start 

with the very pointed inquiry that Justice Kennedy made 

at the opening of the argument here. 

The petitioners here do not challenge, 

because they cannot challenge, as was evident from the 

concession made here this morning, that a criminal 

prosecution cannot be based upon the exercise of a 

constitutional right. What they want is an exception 

to that rule, an exception that would mean, despite the 

overwhelming evidence of retaliation of record in this 

case, there would be no violation of the First 

Amendment here and that would treat any prosecution 

based solely upon race, religion, or protected speech

the same as a tort for malicious prosecution. And to 

accomplish this end, what they are trying to do is to 

force probable cause as a standard into a framework 

where it doesn't belong, where it won't work, and 

which, if done here, is going to be contrary to several 

existing decisions of this Court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, how does --

how does your standard work? The same question I asked 

Mr. Kneedler. The -- the test you would propose is 

whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution 

would have been brought anyway? 

MR. McCARTAN: That would be the test, Your 

Honor, for recovery when the matter goes to trial. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. McCARTAN: The test that I would propose 

is the very test that this Court set forth in Harlow 

against Fitzgerald because we're here really on a very 

limited issue of qualified immunity. We have to 

determine whether the defense of qualified immunity is 

available to the petitioners here. The standard, the 

proper standard for making that determination was set 

forth by this Court in Harlow and it's whether the 

conduct alleged --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. McCartan, I don't 

mean to interrupt you, but I thought the primary issue

was not the qualified immunity issue, but whether we

MR. McCARTAN: Well, Your Honor, whether --

no, I think that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And on that, they say you 

don't have a cause of action unless you're able to 

prove an absence of probable cause. 

MR. McCARTAN: I think what they are saying 

is the defense of qualified immunity should be 

available if there should be probable cause for the 

action that was taken here. I think the case before 

the Court is on the very limited issue of whether the 

defense of qualified immunity is available to the 

petitioners. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I think they would say 

absolute immunity, not qualified. I -- I think they're 

saying if there's probable cause, the game is over. No 

-- no qualified --

MR. McCARTAN: That's exactly what they're 

saying, and what I'm saying is that is the wrong 

standard to be applying. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but there are two 

questions in the cert petition and it's the second one 

that's the qualified immunity issue, and the first one 

is whether there's a cause of action.

 MR. McCARTAN: All right. Well, Your Honor, 

let -- let me -- let me back up for just a moment then 

with respect to that. 

Let me say that probable cause is not the 

proper standard which should be applied here. The 

proper standard is the standard that is set forth by 

this Court in Harlow and as refined later in Anderson 

against Creighton and a number of other decisions. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the difficulty I think 

we're all having with it is that the qualified immunity 

issue and the standard to which you are -- are 

adverting responds to a question that doesn't arise 

unless we first assume that there is -- that there is a 

constitutional violation. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And our questions are, what 

is the standard for determining the constitutional 

violation? Once we get that squared away, then we'll 

get to Harlow. 

MR. McCARTAN: The standard that is to be set 

forth to determine whether there is a constitutional 

violation is that that this Court applied in Mt. 

Healthy City School District against Doyle and in 

Crawford-El against Britton, and that is if there is 

illegally or unconstitutionally motivated conduct, it

will not be excused simply because there may be some 

objectively valid basis for taking such action. That 

is the conceptual framework that was established in 

those cases and which should be applied by way of 

analysis. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If it is applied here, I --

I thought we just granted question one. There were two 

in the cert petition. I -- my notes say we just 

granted question one. And that means what they have is 

the screen. We're going to screen out absolutely any 

such claim as yours if there is probable cause. 

Now, the reason they advance for doing that 

is that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a 

screen like that, here's what's going to happen. Every 

single case -- not every one, but millions of cases or 

thousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well, 

companies are going to Congress all the time. They 

have ads all the time. They run into agency hostility 

all the time. The Hell's Angels? That's a pretty 

unpopular defendant. They say things all the time that 

investigators disagree with. And what will happen is 

in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to 

bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and 

then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every 

statement that the -- the investigator made to the

prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare 

of tort cases. And they say that's unfortunate to cut 

off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors 

totally cut them off because they have absolute 

immunity. 

Now, we're saying at least let's restrict 

them, where investigators are involved, to cases where 

it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise 

the criminal process itself will be seriously injured. 

Now, I take it that's the argument. I'd like 

to hear your reply. 

MR. McCARTAN: That is exactly the argument, 

Your Honor, and what it comes down to is whether the 

burdens of litigation in a situation of this kind will 

justify judicial alteration of the protection of the 

First Amendment. And I think that's been very clear 

from the outset in the first question Justice Kennedy 

asked. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but are you going to --

I mean, is there any light you could shed? And that's 

why I asked in my question initially. I thought maybe 

there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that 

survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm 

wrong. And -- and how do I judge this? I would be

cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and 

they don't involve the criminal process. And when we 

get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on 

selective prosecution that are designed to screen out 

all but the very worst. 

MR. McCARTAN: But see --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what he's arguing 

for here. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's what he's arguing, and 

those are not screening mechanisms, Your Honor. 

Probable cause was evident and was present in United 

States against Armstrong and Wayte against the United 

States. It was not deemed by this Court to be a bar to 

the selective prosecution claims that were advanced in 

that -- in those cases. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Leaving -- is there anything 

you can say before I give up on this? And maybe the 

answer is no. Is there anything you can say that would 

relieve my concern, which is completely practical at 

the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there 

suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal 

cases where defendants will say the reason I was 

prosecuted was because of something I said? I was 

advocating motorcycles. I was advocating beating 

people up. I was advocating a congressional change of

something. Many, many such cases. They'll all get at 

least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become 

open to the world. Now, that's what's concerning. Can 

you say anything to relieve that concern? 

MR. McCARTAN: Yes. I think, first of all, 

empirically, Your Honor, there's no evidence to the 

effect that Bivens has had that result after 35 years 

in full force and effect. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if this Court opens 

that door, don't you think we might see a different 

problem? 

MR. McCARTAN: I don't think so, Justice 

O'Connor. I think if you examine part IV of the 

Court's opinion in Crawford-El, there is a very careful 

pattern that is set forth as to how cases of this kind 

should proceed and what protections are available to 

protect Government officials against overly burdensome 

litigation. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion was that? I 

missed that. 

MR. McCARTAN: Pardon, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which opinion are you 

talking about? I missed it -- missed it. 

MR. McCARTAN: The opinion in Crawford-El 

against Britton.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. 

MR. McCARTAN: There, the Court held that if 

there are factually specific allegations that would 

indicate a violation of the Constitution, that at that 

point the court may consider whether some additional 

discovery should be permitted even if there should be 

an independently valid basis. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This wasn't addressing --

this wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though. It 

didn't involve unlawful prosecution. 

MR. McCARTAN: It did not, Your Honor, but it 

provides the same --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it was a suit against 

a prison. 

MR. McCARTAN: It provides the same framework 

for the proper analysis of a claim of this kind. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but we treat 

prosecutions quite differently. We do not give, for 

example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as 

we give absolute immunity to prosecutors. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a specially 

dangerous area in which to allow litigation. 

MR. McCARTAN: It is far less dangerous, Your 

Honor, than when this is asserted by way of defense in

the middle of an ongoing criminal prosecution. It can 

be far more disruptive to allege a violation of 

constitutional rights as a defense to a criminal 

prosecution, while that prosecution is in progress, and 

an effort is made to examine prosecutorial decision-

making than in an after-the-fact, after-acquittal civil 

action for damages, such as we have here. You have 

already permitted that kind of examination in criminal 

cases where probable cause is present. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCartan, I -- I still 

don't entirely understand what you would want the 

Government to prove under your system in order to -- in 

order to -- to win this case. They would have to prove 

what? That -- that --

MR. McCARTAN: They would have to prove that 

something other than hostility to protected speech was 

the reason for the prosecution being advanced. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it would not be enough 

to show that the prosecution would have gone forward 

anyway. 

MR. McCARTAN: No. That's -- that's what I 

mean. Absent -- if there is an objectively valid basis 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

is an objectively valid basis for the action they 

action they would take. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. McCARTAN: Then if the plaintiff has made 

a showing that there was an improper motivation, the 

burden shifts to the Government to show that the 

prosecution would have proceeded absent the illicit 

intent. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You see now in -- in the 

employment cases where -- where somebody is dismissed 

for a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- and 

you have to prove that the same action would have been 

taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with 

the discriminatory motive whether that person would 

have taken that action anyway. Whereas here, the 

person who brought the prosecution is not in this case. 

It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor. 

I don't know how that person could -- could possibly 

establish that the prosecution would have been brought 

anyway. It wasn't up to him. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It had nothing to do with --

MR. McCARTAN: -- as -- as you pointed out 

earlier, probable cause is not the standard that 

governs the investigator's conduct. These

investigators procured a prosecution based upon a 

violation of the petitioner's -- or excuse me -- the 

respondent's constitutional rights. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they did, but wouldn't 

you have to prove under your standard not that they 

would have procured or tried to procure it anyway, but 

that in fact the prosecutor would have prosecuted 

anyway? In other words, that's the distinction between 

the -- the normal case and -- and the case that we're 

dealing with here --

MR. McCARTAN: No, I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- with a prosecutor who has 

absolute immunity. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, the prosecutor has 

absolute immunity. There's a qualified immunity here 

with respect to the investigators, and that means that 

the facts and circumstances of the case are going to 

have to determine whether there's liability. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. All right --

MR. McCARTAN: The burden would shift once 

the illegal motivation is shown. It would shift to the 

Government to establish that the prosecution would have 

proceeded absent the illicit event. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But would it -- would it 

have been a complete defense? Suppose the prosecutor,

who is immune, gets on the witness stand and says, 

well, I know all about this -- the First Amendment 

stuff, but I was going to bring this prosecution anyway 

because it seemed to me there was a serious crime here. 

That's all he says. Wouldn't that be the end of the 

case? 

MR. McCARTAN: It shouldn't be the end of the 

case. It would be an issue of causation at that 

point, Your Honor, if there were evidence. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but the question is 

the motivation for his decision to bring the case. 

MR. McCARTAN: The motivation for his 

decision --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And he says I -- I would 

have brought it anyway. 

MR. McCARTAN: But in this case, the 

prosecutor's decision to bring these charges to the 

grand jury I don't think has any probative force 

whatsoever. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the defendant 

can subpoena the prosecutor? 

MR. McCARTAN: Of course. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I thought the 

prosecutor had absolute immunity.

 MR. McCARTAN: The prosecutor is not a

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say he -- he can't be 

brought into court to defend his own -- his own 

judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when 

an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his 

testimony as to what would have happened? 

MR. McCARTAN: His testimony was taken in 

this case and can be taken in this case because at that 

point in these proceedings -- and you have to look at 

the evidence of record to this point in this proceeding 

-- there is very clear evidence of retaliation as a 

motive for this prosecution. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he may have done it 

voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he 

could be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute 

immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a 

suit against somebody else. It seems to me a very 

strange kind of a --

MR. McCARTAN: Your Honor, the fact that he 

has absolute immunity does not immunize him from giving 

testimony in the case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So he's a witness. Suppose 

his testimony --

MR. McCARTAN: He's a -- he's a witness.

think would stand in the way of that, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Really? So that's a -- but 

it's not a civil case. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, it's not a simple case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So you say that if he's 

convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it 

may be because of the retaliatory motive. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, if he is convicted and a 

civil action for damages is then brought --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. McCARTAN: -- then I think you are in the 

framework of Heck against Humphrey --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you -- so you

MR. McCARTAN: -- where the court --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if he's convicted, that's

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- whether there was a

MR. McCARTAN: No. I think it's very 

difficult in that case. 

In Heck against Humphrey, which this Court 

viewed as a collateral attack on an outstanding 

conviction, the Court held that there had to be a 

favorable termination of the criminal proceeding in 

order to maintain the civil action for damages under 

section 1983. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's 1983. 

MR. McCARTAN: The Court went on to say, 

however, that if the civil damage action would not 

necessarily impugn the conviction, that the case could 

proceed even though there had not been a favorable 

termination, reversal, or expungement --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what he does 

is he --

MR. McCARTAN: -- of the conviction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- he brings his action and 

he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm 

guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without 

the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in 

fact, criticize everything that we say. 

MR. McCARTAN: I don't think that action

MR. McCARTAN: It would be viewed as a 

collateral attack on an outstanding conviction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's saying I was 

-- I was guilty, but the -- all right. Anyway --

MR. McCARTAN: I -- I don't think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I won't force you into that. 

MR. McCARTAN: -- with all due respect, Your 

Honor, that's a real-world example. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'll take basically 

virtually never if he's convicted. They concede that 

you could bring this kind of action if there's no 

probable cause. So we're talking about that range 

where there was probable cause but acquittal. That's 

what we're talking about here. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's right. And why 

probable cause is not the appropriate standard is 

because it does not distinguish between what might be 

an unconstitutional prosecution -- that is, one based 

solely upon race, religion, or protected speech -- and 

one that is not. When you look to these earlier cases, 

Your Honor, I agree they arose in employment contexts. 

They arose in the context of a prison.

train of thought here, but look. 

I'm looking for other screens. Is there --

is there -- the particular point that they're worried 

about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory 

motive. That's what's worrying them because they see, 

in that establishment of the retaliatory motive, 

discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the 

investigators, but you're also talking to, as a 

witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to 

whom in order to see if you could establish that they 

didn't like the speech of the defendant. Now, can you 

give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a 

screen that will help --

MR. McCARTAN: Yes.

set forth by this Court in Harlow, which is an 

objective standard and which is whether the conduct 

involved violated a clearly established statutory or 

constitutional right of which a reasonably prudent law 

enforcement officer or Government official should be 

aware. 

That's why I tried to say earlier this 

standard that should govern this case is not probable 

cause, but the standard set forth by this Court in 

Harlow --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- the screen, in 

effect, is --

MR. McCARTAN: And is a screening. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the qualified immunity 

screen. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's right. 

And there was no screening mechanism in 

United States against Armstrong. The Court made it 

very clear that what you were applying there were 

ordinary equal protection standards. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Have there been cases where 

in the context of the prosecution, there's been a

level --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it did in the 

Armstrong --

MR. McCARTAN: -- where the conviction has 

been invalidated for that reason. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in the race context, it 

is a dismissal of the prosecution itself. Isn't it? 

MR. McCARTAN: Yes, Your Honor. It might be 

the same here.

prosecution --

appeals, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely the prosecution would 

go ahead if there were probable cause. No? No? I 

mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean to say if there was 

-- if there was perfect probable cause for the 

prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its 

tracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendment 

violation? 

MR. McCARTAN: You can move for dismissal of 

the charges. 

But look, as far back as 1886, this Court --

this Court found a violation of the Equal Protection 

Clause in a racially motivated prosecution in a 

situation where there was clearly probable cause and, 

indeed, overwhelming evidence of guilt for violation of 

a facially neutral statute. In United States against 

Armstrong, the existence of probable cause did not 

stand as a bar to the selective prosecution claims. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But that -- that's true. I 

now think we're making some progress. I don't think it 

is quite a qualified immunity. I think it's possible

and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny 

them if I am. One, he's convicted, no case. Two, no 

probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case. 

Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted. 

Okay? 

MR. McCARTAN: That's this case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In that circumstance, 

suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery. You 

don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive 

unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you 

show likely, question mark, that the investigator not 

only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions 

where any reasonable person would have known that what 

he was doing was contrary to the Constitution. 

MR. McCARTAN: Exactly, Your Honor. That --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't show that 

as a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery. 

MR. McCARTAN: We don't -- that is exactly 

the Harlow standard. That is exactly the standard that 

was applied in Crawford-El against Britton as the first 

step in the stage of developments in that case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you turn the Harlow 

standard around -- I mean, you're -- you're making the 

-- the negation of the Harlow standard the screening 

device --

cause here and this is a bad actor. What results? 

MR. McCARTAN: The result is that's a 

question of causation, Your Honor, if there is 

evidence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why --

MR. McCARTAN: Yes. If there is evidence 

here with respect to retaliation, then the question of 

whether the independent act of the prosecutor somehow 

immunizes that conduct is a question of fact for the 

trier of fact in the case. If the action --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the prosecutor 

said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you 

-- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment. 

But now that it's here, I have my own independent 

interest in going ahead. 

MR. McCARTAN: That's the evidence the 

Government can bring forward when the burden of proof 

shifts upon a showing of an illegal or unconstitutional 

motive for bringing the prosecution to begin with. 

That's the kind of evidence the Government would 

present to show that the prosecution would have taken 

effect in any --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the burden does shift 

that way --

MR. McCARTAN: Exactly.

wouldn't the -- the -- when the burden shifts, wouldn't 

the obligation be on -- on the point of substance, as 

opposed to the point of -- of screening, not to show 

that the -- that the prosecutor would have brought the 

prosecution anyway, but to show that the investigator 

would have acted to procure that prosecution anyway? 

So you would have parallel standards. 

MR. McCARTAN: Exactly. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. McCARTAN: Because the prosecutor has 

immunity, cannot be a defendant in the case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But just -- I 

just want to nail this --

MR. McCARTAN: No, absolutely. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- to make sure I understand 

it. So you're -- you're modifying your position of a 

minute ago in which you said the standard would be 

would the prosecution have been brought anyway, and 

you're now saying, which I think would be consistent 

with your answer to Justice Breyer, the -- the question 

is would the investigators have tried to procure the 

prosecution anyway. And do I understand you correctly,

and -- and have you changed your position? 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, I think that is a 

significant distinction, Your Honor, but I think we 

have to establish that they procured the prosecution 

and that it did proceed by reasons of the illegal 

motivation and not for some independently objective 

standard. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, because the 

prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information 

from other people. 

MR. McCARTAN: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're not going to 

throw out the prosecution just because this one piece 

of information was bad. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a dual --

MR. McCARTAN: Consider too what the facts of 

record are here. This prosecutor was a complicit 

conduit in this action. He admitted in the presence of 

a grand jury witness that he couldn't care less about 

the guilt or innocence of these people. He just wanted 

a conviction so he could obtain a lucrative position in 

private practice. I understand he is still a 

prosecutor at this time. But that decision of the 

prosecutor, based upon facts of that kind, has no 

probative value whatsoever in terms of the independent

action that might have broken the chain of causation in 

a case of this kind. 

Nor does the indictment of the grand jury 

have any probative value because exculpatory evidence 

was withheld from the grand jury. And I think in 

determining the value of the grand jury's action, you 

have to really determine not only what was presented to 

the grand jury, but also what was withheld from 

examination. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I go back to one 

question Justice O'Connor asked you earlier? To what 

extent are there -- is there precedent out there in 

other courts that have decided this very issue? Are 

there -- is there precedent for what you're asking us 

to do? 

MR. McCARTAN: There -- there is precedent in 

the courts of appeals, Your Honor. The cases, I think, 

are cited in our brief where prosecutions have been 

invalidated based upon violations of constitutional 

rights. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But a violation of First 

Amendment rights or --

MR. McCARTAN: First Amendment rights. I 

think that is the case. Not cited in our brief. But 

there are cases to that effect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and were those cases 

in which the prosecution itself was brought to a halt, 

or were they post-prosecution damage actions? 

MR. McCARTAN: Post-prosecution. Not post-

prosecution damage actions but appeals, direct appeals, 

to invalidate the conviction --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The conviction. 

MR. McCARTAN: -- based upon the violation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any precedent 

for a damage action of this kind? 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, Bivens is. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but not quite. 

Bivens isn't exactly like that. This is Fourth 

Amendment. 

So is there -- is there precedent for a 

damage action brought on the theory that the 

prosecution was brought for -- to retaliate for First 

Amendment speech? 

MR. McCARTAN: I'm not aware, Your Honor, of 

any precedents --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not either. 

MR. McCARTAN: -- in the three circuits where 

probable cause is not a bar to an action of that kind. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, that -- that means one 

of two things: either what you're arguing for is not

going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has 

assumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, I think it would be the 

former rather than the latter, Your Honor, since 

probable cause does not distinguish between what may be 

an unconstitutional act on the part of the Government 

and one that might be motivated by a legitimate 

grievance. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but I'm not 

sure that that proposition has been established in the 

cases. 

MR. McCARTAN: No, Your Honor, and that's why 

I think this case is before this Court at this time. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Neither -- neither does 

absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish 

between whether the prosecutor was acting just 

illegally or just acting unconstitutionally. I mean, 

yes. 

MR. McCARTAN: If I may --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You apply the same rule 

there.

that -- was that an observation or a question?

difference between whether there's a constitutional 

violation or not in this context seems to me not well 

taken because we don't make that distinction in the 

context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor. 

We don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when --

when he's been guilty of a constitutional violation. 

MR. McCARTAN: But as Justice Souter brought 

-- questioned whether the prosecution was procured for 

unconstitutional reasons, the immunity of the 

prosecutor has nothing to do with the reasons for which 

the prosecution is brought. It only protects him from 

civil damage liability. The investigators themselves 

have no such immunity. It is qualified. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But the point 

remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the 

immunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional 

violation, then that teaches us that the same rule 

should apply to this case. That was Justice Scalia's 

MR. McCARTAN: No. I think that is the 

difference, Your Honor, between absolute and qualified 

immunity. The Court has given absolute immunity only 

to those functions that are so intimately associated 

with the judicial process, that they have to give 

immunity to those people, otherwise there would be an

unjust interference with --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Maybe I should ask Mr. Kneedler. But am I correct in 

assuming that even if you should lose on the issue that 

we're faced with today, the case would, nevertheless, 

go forward because you would still seek to prove an 

absence of probable cause? 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, certainly that would be 

a question for the jury, Your Honor, absence of 

probable cause. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the case wouldn't 

be over if you lose here. 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, it depends on what 

ground we would lose here. If the Court went on to 

decide the sufficiency of the allegations in a Bivens-

type case, which I don't think it should and which the 

Court declined the invitation to do so in Harlow, then 

we would not lose. If you did --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't worry a lot about 

that, Mr. --

MR. McCARTAN: All right. 

May I say one word about the tort of 

malicious prosecution, which I say is not a proper 

analog for the analysis of cases of this kind?

Amendment are far different from those that are 

remedied by the tort of malicious prosecution, and the 

injury to which is of far greater magnitude than what 

the common law sought to address by the tort of 

malicious prosecution. The tort of a malicious 

prosecution tells us nothing about the interests 

protected by the First Amendment. It remedies 

different interests. It is not a proper analog and, 

therefore, shouldn't be involved in definition of what 

the First Amendment rights may be. 

If you look at those cases where the Court 

has referenced the common law in determining how 

constitutional rights should be remedied, they have 

been situations where the interests protected at common 

law are identical to those that are protected by the 

particular constitutional provision that is involved. 

A good example is Wilson against Arkansas, Fourth 

Amendment situation, the question of whether the knock-

and-announce principle of common law should be 

incorporated into the reasonableness determination of 

the Fourth Amendment. The interest protected by the 

common law in that situation against unreasonable 

searches and seizures was identical to the interest 

protected by the Fourth Amendment. For that reason, 

the Court said that should be taken into consideration

JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to ask you one 

other question. Suppose you win on this on the grounds 

we've been discussing. What happens in the middle of 

the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? 

Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing? 

MR. McCARTAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What happens when the same 

claim is made in the middle of a trial that I --

whether I'm guilty or innocent? I haven't been 

convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution 

wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the 

retaliatory motive. Can he make that claim in the 

middle of trial or not? 

MR. McCARTAN: Well, if he were foolish 

enough to make such a claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, he believes it. 

MR. McCARTAN: I can't believe that a 

defendant in a criminal prosecution who is acquitted in 

a subsequent civil suit --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He's not acquitted. 

MR. McCARTAN: Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

You say he's not acquitted.

JUSTICE BREYER: He's in a criminal trial,

MR. McCARTAN: This is not a civil action for 

damages. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. 

MR. McCARTAN: This is a criminal case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: They read our opinion which 

holds in your favor. Then the next thing is in -- in 

the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I 

think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that 

the FBI had a retaliatory motive.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens. 

I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's 

suggestion that this could all be solved by an 

application of the Harlow qualified immunity standard. 

With all respect, I don't think that that would really 

work at all because if -- if the point is that it would 

be unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because 

of protected First Amendment activity, that could be 

taken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into 

what actually happened between the investigator and the 

prosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the 

prosecution's policies were. That is the concern we 

have for the post hoc inquiry into the process. 

And not only that, it isn't just the 

discovery. It's what -- what consequences this will

have on law enforcement generally if police officers 

operate under the assumption that if the prosecution 

fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which 

is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted 

in Dinsman v. Wilkes. 

The reason for the rule is that it would be a 

very great discouragement to public justice if 

prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion, 

were liable to be sued at law whenever their 

indictments miscarried. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not talking 

about prosecutors there --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, but -- but that included 

complaining witnesses. That -- that was what 

prosecutor meant at common -- at common law. And 

there's no reason to grope for some sort of screen 

because the common law furnishes it. The tort of 

malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in 

Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule, 

that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the 

conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was 

terminated in favor of the plaintiff. 

That same tort, that tort of malicious 

prosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to 

guard against an objective screen, to guard against the

very thing that Blackstone was worried about and that 

this Court noticed in -- in the Dinsman case. And that 

is, that it is important not to have law enforcement 

officers be chilled from the important function of 

furnishing information to prosecutors. 

And this Court's decision in Armstrong 

imposed an important objective test that you have to 

show that there's somebody similarly situated before 

you even inquire into prosecutorial motives. You have 

to show an objective factor that someone else was 

similarly situated. Respondent's position would offer 

no such -- no such protection. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the judge 

granting a motion to quit at the close of the 

Government's evidence? Why isn't that objective? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Because at -- at common law --

and I think this was an important insight. At common 

law, it was not even evidence of the absence of 

probable cause because a judgment of acquittal turns on 

the determination that a factfinder -- a reasonable 

fact finder could not find beyond a reasonable doubt 

that the defendant had actually committed the crime. 

Probable cause is a very different standard, which is 

whether it would lead a reasonable, cautious, prudent 

person to believe that a crime had been committed.

suggest that there could be an objective test. This is 

not going to the probable cause question. Objective 

test? Was this case thrown out at the close of the 

Government's evidence? 

MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but my -- my point was 

at common law, that the wisdom of the courts was that 

-- that that wasn't even evidence of a -- that should

because it was a sufficient guard -- protection for the 

prosecutors.
