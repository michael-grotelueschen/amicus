 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T. MAZIARZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MAZIARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 More than 27 years ago in Belton this Court 

applied its prior decisions in Chimel and Robinson to 

the arrest of a recent occupant of an automobile. The 

Court sought to forge a workable straightforward rule 

that could be easily applied and predictably enforced by 

law enforcement officers in the field in this dangerous 

and dynamic situation.

After careful consideration, this Court held 

that the passenger compartment of the vehicle was deemed 

to be under the immediate control of the arrestee. The 

Court also made clear that the search need only be a 

contemporaneous incident of the arrest.

 There are three reasons, all 

well-established by this Court's case law, why officers, 

law enforcement officers, need not demonstrate a threat 

to their safety or need to preserve evidence prior to 

searching an automobile incident to arrest, even if all 

of the recent occupants of the vehicle have been 

arrested and secured.

 First, neither justification need exist in a 

particular case. This Court has made clear in Robinson 

that a search incident to arrest requires no additional 

justification. It's the fact of arrest that justifies 

the search.

 Second, the search need only be a 

contemporaneous incident of the arrest or substantially 

contemporaneous with the arrest. Obviously a search can 

be contemporaneous even if the arrestee has been 

secured.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if it occurred in 

the station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had 

been taken into the station house?

MR. MAZIARZ: Correct. That would be remote 

in time and location, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or location.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Time and location, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why isn't this 

situation more like the station house than it is like --

the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a 

driver. They are concerned about weapons, about being 

assaulted. But here we have someone who is locked up 

inside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere. 

That sounds to me more like the station house than it 

does the urgent situation where the police have a 

legitimate concern for their own safety.

 MR. MAZIARZ: The arrestee is still at the 

same location at the scene of the arrest. It's not 

remote in place or time because it -- it -- the arrest 

and the search occur in a short period of time at the 

scene of the -- of the arrest. And while he -- the 

arrestee is secured to one degree or another, in Belton 

this Court wanted a workable, straightforward rule that 

officers could apply across the board and not have to 

look at particular facts and circumstances. So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this is important, but 

you had three -- three points. One was the fact of the 

arrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous. And the

third?

 MR. MAZIARZ: The third is requiring a 

justification is anathema to a bright-line rule. And 

that is precisely what this Court wanted in Belton, was 

a rule that law-enforcement officers would know how to 

apply from one case to another, that wouldn't vary based 

upon the particular facts of the arrest.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we do have a -- we do 

obviously require a justification for the bright-line 

rule itself. And -- and the problem that this case 

raises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of 

the others that we've had recently, is that it seems if 

-- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to 

divorce the search totally from the justification for 

the Chimel rule.

 And -- and at some point we've either got to 

say, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's 

some other justification for the bright-line rule; or 

we've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in 

a case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police 

car and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense.

 And -- and I -- I think we've got that 

choice in front of us. Do we have a new and different 

rule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go 

this far. This is like the station house.

MR. MAZIARZ: I think in Belton this Court 

did apply Chimel and simply said, in this recurring 

situation we need a bright-line rule that can be easily 

determined and enforced by officers --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the bright line 

swallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where 

already he's handcuffed; he is in the car. Is there a 

justification apart from Chimel for our keeping this 

bright-line rule?

 MR. MAZIARZ: The fact that officers have 

for 27 years applied it; it's a workable rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a long time. 

What -- what was the situation when the Fourth Amendment 

was adopted? Do you know? If you stopped Thomas 

Jefferson's carriage to arrest Thomas Jefferson and you 

pulled him off to the side of the road, could you --

could you then go and search his carriage?

 I'm struck by the fact that there is no 

effort in your brief whatever to take this thing back 

any more than 27 years. Now, you know, it could -- it 

could well be that it has always been considered 

reasonable to search the person and to search the 

conveyance from which the person has been taken.

 If that's the case, I could say, gee, it's 

always been considered reasonable, end of case. But --

but you -- you give me nothing to hang my hat on.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Your Honor, there is not much 

on searches incident prior to 1914, the Weeks case. 

There really is not any --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Something was happening 

back there. The automobile exception is much older than 

that.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Excuse me, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The automobile exception 

is much older than that.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Right, but the -- the search 

incident language and application --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, you know, the 

automobile exception could provide a rationale that 

would cover all of these cases. Do you remember my 

opinion in Belton?

 MR. MAZIARZ: Yes, I do, very well, Your 

Honor. But here we -- we have no probable cause. So it 

would not affect the situation here. This is purely a 

-- a Belton search for officer safety and preservation 

of evidence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's for officer safety 

when the defendant is no longer in the car and is under 

-- under the control of the officer?

 MR. MAZIARZ: There is still a risk.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which are not the facts of 

Belton.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Belton, no. The arrestees 

were not physically restrained in a vehicle.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are asking for the 

expanded Belton rule, not the rule of Belton itself.

 MR. MAZIARZ: No, Your Honor. We're asking 

that Belton be applied as it has been applied by 

virtually every court in the country and -- and, in 

fact, in this Court in Thornton. That as -- as long as 

the arrestee remains at the scene and the search is 

contemporaneous with the arrest, the officer is entitled 

to -- to conduct a search of the vehicle.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a reasonable rule. 

What isn't a reasonable rule is to say at the same 

premises as long as the officer is there and the officer 

is at risk. I mean that is just -- it's just silly. 

It's -- it's simply not the case. And -- and if you 

bring that forward as the justification for this rule, 

I'm going to say, you know, get rid of it.

 MR. MAZIARZ: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Realistically, he is not at 

risk. The guy is handcuffed in the police cruiser, and 

so I want to go and search his car. What -- what risk 

to the officer is being avoided?

MR. MAZIARZ: In -- in our reply brief we 

pointed out in 2007 there were 93 reported cases where 

arrestees cuffed in the back of a patrol car escaped. 

So it -- it's very possible this could happen. Now, you 

have to know --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any one of 

those cases in which the officer got hurt? Do you know 

of any one of those cases in which the person who got 

out of the police cruiser made a beeline for -- for his 

own car?

 In fact, so far as I know, we are -- we are 

not even sure that those people came out of automobiles 

before they were put in a police cruiser. But do you 

know of any case in which they went to their own car and 

tried to get a gun to hurt the cop?

 MR. MAZIARZ: In one of the cases the 

arrestee went to his vehicle but simply took off and led 

the police on a high-speed chase, but none in -- where 

they went to the vehicle and grabbed a weapon.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did he -- did he have --

have his hands handcuffed behind his back?

 MR. MAZIARZ: Yes. Yes, he had --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And he was able to drive 

the car?

my understanding from reading some of these cases --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'd really like to meet 

him.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't. I'll bet you 

that in most of those cases the -- the felon got out the 

other -- other door of the car while the policeman was 

searching the vehicle.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MAZIARZ: And, Your Honor, in -- in ten 

of those cases the officers were searching the vehicle 

when they escaped.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you 

don't have -- I thought the whole point of a bright-line 

rule is that you don't have to justify in every 

particular case applying the -- the rule. So you are 

certainly going to -- if you -- the point is if you have 

a fact case-by-case inquiry, you're giving up the 

bright-line rule.

 MR. MAZIARZ: And that was the point I was 

trying to make is -- is there is going to be -- security 

is a matter of degree. Is the arrestee sufficiently 

secured if he is arrested and standing next to the 

vehicle? Is he sufficiently secured if he is cuffed and

-- and removed 10 feet away? Is he sufficiently secured 

if he is in the patrol car?

 We -- in Belton this Court wanted to do away 

with those nuances and have just a straightforward --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other -- are 

there other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or 

at least risky to leave an unattended car where other 

people can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband 

if the police aren't guarding it? I mean, are there 

other reasons other than Chimel for this bright-line 

rule?

 MR. MAZIARZ: Certainly, in -- in the case 

of an automobile, which is different from the Chimel 

home situation, if a vehicle is being left there. In 

this case the gun was on the front passenger seat of the 

vehicle. Someone could readily access it. That's 

always true with an automobile.

 Officers obviously could take some steps to 

try and secure the vehicle, lock it up or what-not. But 

that's not going to guarantee the fact that -- that the 

weapon or destructible evidence won't be tampered with 

by either other co-occupants who the officers have no 

justification to arrest and secure or other people in 

the area. So --

Now, we had no passengers, just the driver. He is put 

away in this squad car, so he is not going to drive that 

car home. What happens to the car? Let's say there was 

no search. The car is there. It has no driver. What 

do the police do with it?

 MR. MAZIARZ: In this case the police 

impounded the car, but that was only because after they 

did the Belton search, they found drugs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose they didn't? 

Suppose they said, well, he is secure; he is no danger 

to us, so we are not going to search the car without a 

warrant. What -- what happens to the car? It just 

doesn't stay there stranded on the road, does it?

 MR. MAZIARZ: It depends on the department. 

Some departments would simply lock it up and leave it 

there. Other departments would impound it and do an 

inventory search of the contents which obviously they 

would find anything that happened to be in there during 

the course of the inventory search. Now, in this 

particular case it was unusual because the vehicle was 

actually pulled in the driveway of a house, so the 

officers at the evidentiary hearing testified that had 

they not found the drugs in the vehicle they would not 

have impounded it, because again it was on private 

property and they would have had no real reason to do

it.

 Quite simply there is no special 

justification for this Court to overrule Belton. 

Nothing has changed in the past 27 years to call Belton 

into question. The same complaints we hear voiced by 

defendants, legal commentators and some judges are the 

same complaints voiced by Justice Brennan in his dissent 

in Belton as well as by the New York Court of Appeals in 

its decision in People v Belton. The Court considered 

everything, made a policy decision based on 

reasonableness that -- that -- that officer safety --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it isn't true that we 

didn't have the recent occupant problem at the time of 

Belton?

 MR. MAZIARZ: Right. That -- that came into 

fruition in -- in Thornton and -- and of course in this 

case Gant is a -- as recent as a recent occupant can be. 

He literally was stepping out of the car when the 

officer summoned him and he knew the officers were there 

because they flashed a flashlight in his face as he 

drove by three -- three feet from them.

 Police officers have been trained under 

Belton for the past 27 years. They have applied it in 

the field. It would ban an undue burden to have to 

retrain those officers and -- and for them to determine

under totality of the circumstances analysis when they 

can and when they can't conduct searches of automobiles 

incident to arrest. They wouldn't know their authority; 

citizens wouldn't know the scope of their Fourth 

Amendment protection. Additionally as we pointed out, 

an overwhelming majority of states, 41, have followed 

Belton and a few of those have even done so under their 

own State constitutional search and seizure provisions 

and of course they all had the opportunity to opt out 

but they obviously believed Belton is a workable rule 

that promotes officer safety and only has a minimal 

impact on the privacy interests of the recent occupant 

of an automobile.

 Unless the Court has any further questions 

I'll retain whatever I have for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG,

 FOR THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the commonly recurring incident of vehicle arrest and 

the search incident to that arrest. Justice Stewart who 

authored both Chimel and Belton recognized that over a 

decade of experience of Chimel had shown that the courts 

were in disarray, that courts had confronted similar 

fact circumstances and come to differing results, that 

officers in the field, confronted with the highly 

volatile and dangerous events surrounding a custodial 

arrest needed clear guidance to be able to govern their 

actions in these instances.

 That makes total sense. Unlike Chimel which 

occurred in a home and arises in a situation where the 

privacy interests are at their apex, in the Belton 

context, the search is of the passenger compartment of a 

vehicle, and this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that 

with respect to automobiles there is a considerably 

diminished or greatly are reduced expectation of 

privacy. Given the very real threats that officers face 

in discharging their duties on a day-to-day basis in 

this commonly recurring scene -- circumstances, Belton 

established a bright-line rule to be able to govern 

their conduct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you -- once you 

eliminate the -- the need to show that the officer's 

safety was threatened why -- why would you limit the

search just to the passenger compartment of the vehicle? 

Why don't you let him search the trunk, too?

 MR. YANG: Well, I think Belton -- when 

Belton was decided there was some question in terms of 

the trunk in terms of this Court's decision in Sanders. 

Sanders is mentioned in Belton. There hadn't been a 

problem with a bright-line rule with respect to trunks 

and the Court simply didn't -- didn't address it. And 

we're not in this case seeking an expansion of Belton, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know -- I know you're not 

but it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon 

the requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be 

threatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search 

the -- the passenger compartment. If indeed there is 

reduced expectation of privacy for the automobile, you 

arrest somebody you can search the automobile; what's 

wrong with that?

 MR. YANG: Certainly in another case, you 

know, the Court can revisit the scope of Belton but I 

think Belton as established certainly makes sense with 

respect to the ambit of the passenger compartment. Even 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Belton, wasn't the 

notion what was within grabbing distance? And the trunk

wasn't within grabbing distance. That was -- and here 

nothing is within grabbing distance.

 MR. YANG: Well, I'm not sure that that's --

that's correct, Justice Ginsburg. In Belton the New 

York Court of Appeals in a portion quoted the Court by 

Belton had determined that there was no longer any 

danger that the arrestees could get to the vehicle, and 

in fact Justice Brennan emphasized in dissent there was 

no possibility that they could reach passenger 

compartment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is the basis for your 

wanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line 

rule for automobile exception? What are the reasons 

other than officer safety which we think may not be a 

very persuasive reason.

 MR. YANG: Well, the -- related to officer 

safety is the question of the administrability of the 

rule in these highly fluid contexts. The officers must 

make rapid judgments about what is and what is not 

permissible and in Belton the Court recognized that a 

rule -- that rules based on the totality of the 

circumstances, which require all kinds of ifs ands or 

buts, simply are not workable; and that had been borne 

out with 10 years of experience with Chimel being 

applied in the vehicle context and Belton.

JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you agree it's 

perfectly workable to say that if the defendant has been 

taken to the police station, they can't then search the 

car --

MR. YANG: Yes. We believe the 

bright-line --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it equally 

workable to say when the defendant is handcuffed and put 

in the back of a cruiser, they can't do it?

 MR. YANG: Well, Justice Souter we think 

that -- in some ways that does have the benefit of a 

bright-line rule, but we don't believe that the --

that's a question of where you're going to draw that 

line.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And -- and we are 

talking now about administeribility. The police station 

rule is administrable; it makes for a good bright-line 

rule; why doesn't handcuffs in the back of the cruiser 

make for an equally bright line?

 MR. YANG: We actually would draw the line a 

little closer than the police station. It would be when 

the -- the search has begun after the suspect has been 

removed from the scene. But in terms of 

administrability I guess that would provide for a 

sufficiently bright-line rule but the problem is drawing

the line at that point.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't the rule of 

requiring just the automobile exception, where you would 

require probable cause to search a vehicle, why wouldn't 

that be a bright line rule that would fit into 

everything else.

 MR. YANG: It is, but the difference between 

the probable cause exception and a search incident to 

arrest is a search incident to arrest doctrine --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you more concerned 

about the ability to search the vehicle or the 

protection of the officer?

 MR. YANG: Well, certainly the protection of 

the officer is what motivates the doctrine.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't -- don't these 

rules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there 

really is very little risk to the officer?

 MR. YANG: Actually, Your Honor, very 

common-day traffic arrests have high risk to the officer 

due to the unknowns. The Court recognized that in 

Robinson, Robinson which established the bright-line 

rule for search of the person was in fact an arrest 

based on failure -- driving on a suspended license. The 

Court has in Chadwick emphasized that all custodial 

arrests --

 MR. YANG: Primarily, but also the interest 

in preserving evidence. When a suspect is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the interest in 

preserving evidence really should only be present when 

there is probable cause to believe there is some 

evidence.

under custodial arrest, the -- there is increased 

incentive both to escape, to get weapons, and also to 

destroy any incriminating evidence that might be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You've arrested this guy 

for -- for reckless driving. He was going 25 miles over 

the speed limit, okay? And you're going to search his 

car for evidence? Of what?

 MR. YANG: To preserve --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're going to allow the 

search nonetheless. Let's assume he is handcuffed in 

the back, so officer safety is not at issue; but you say 

we want to be able to search a car for evidence. 

Evidence of what?

 MR. YANG: Well, we would take issue with 

respect to the officer safety.

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to link -- if 

you're going to use that rationale you have to link the 

reason for the arrest with the likelihood that there 

would be any evidence found in the car that would 

support the arrest.

 MR. YANG: The Court recognized in Maryland 

v Wilson that when you pull someone over for a traffic 

stop, there is a risk of escalation of the encounter 

because evidence of a more serious crime might be 

revealed in that stop.

rummage around for evidence of a different crime, right?

situation, Your Honor.

to danger. And let's -- let's assume that some of us

of a car and he is about ready to leave the scene, there 

is no more danger. I want to know if there are any

searching the car.

 It seems to me there are good reasons for 

searching that car. It's -- it's movable. That's the 

old vehicle exception. It can have contraband in it. 

It can be stolen. It can be taken for joy rides. But 

you don't seem to make any of those arguments. You just 

want to keep coming back to officer safety and on that 

point I think your case is very weak.

 MR. YANG: Well, on the point of officer 

safety, Your Honor, I can understand the Court's 

reluctance to think that a person handcuffed in a car is 

likely to escape. And we admit that the occurrence is 

relatively small. It's clear that a person handcuffed 

in the back of a patrol care escapes the car dozens of 

times a year. We just did a simple search on the 

Internet --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Fine, if you want to go 

back to that, fine. I have problems with the argument 

but if that's your argument I'll take it from there.

 MR. YANG: But the point is, on a continuum, 

Belton provides an administrable rule where officers in 

the field can guide their conduct. There's going to be 

instances in which the risk is going to be higher, and 

there's going to be instances where the risk is lower. 

And, admittedly, we are on the end of the continuum, but

it -- Belton wanted to provide a rule whereby you 

wouldn't have to guess in these circumstances.

 Certainly, with respect to the privacy 

interest in vehicles as well, Justice Kennedy, the 

privacy interest in the vehicle, particularly when 

you've been arrested and could be -- for a traffic 

violation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Normally, to overcome the 

privacy interest, you need probable cause. And you did 

need probable cause for the automobile exception too.

 MR. YANG: In terms of the balancing that's 

conducted, it can be a risk to officer safety, the need 

for administrable rule balanced against the privacy 

interest. Here the privacy interest has been quite 

diminished. Once you've been arrested on the street, 

the police often have -- certainly have a constitutional 

ability to impound the car and conduct an inventory 

search.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they have impounded 

this car? I thought they didn't have grounds to impound 

it because it was -- we were just told it was parked in 

an alley of a private house.

 MR. YANG: It was in a private house owned 

by someone else. The officers testified that they 

normally would not tow it at that point, but certainly

they would have had the constitutional authority. It 

would have been reasonable for officers to impound the 

car that was not at the residence of the arrestee.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they could have 

impounded, and then could they have done an inventory 

search?

 MR. YANG: Correct, which underscores the 

diminished privacy interest that an arrestee would have 

in the contents of a vehicle. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why can they impound 

it? Suppose they stop and he pulls over to the side of 

the street where there is parking, all-night parking. 

What authority would they have to drag that car away?

 MR. YANG: Well, once someone has been 

arrested and if it's all-night parking, if the person is 

going into a custodial arrest, going to jail for 

purposes of protecting --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He says, "Let me lock my 

car." You know, "I park it on the street all the time. 

It's a lousy car any way. Nobody wants to steal it."

 (Laughter.)

 MR. YANG: Well, for purposes of the impound 

and inventory search, so long as there's a reasonable 

basis, and the reasonable basis would be to secure the 

vehicle to get it off the street when the occupant has

been arrested and wouldn't be able to retrieve it, I 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I can see some situations 

where -- where, for public safety or other reasons, you 

have to remove the car from where it is, and I guess the 

best thing to do is to drag it off to the police 

impoundment yard. But in other situations, I -- you 

speak so blithely of impoundment as though -- as though 

that's an automatic remedy. I just don't know that it 

is.

 MR. YANG: It's not automatic, but it does 

go against the expectation of privacy that one has in 

the personal effects in the vehicle, and is greatly 

diminished because, you know, the State -- I believe it 

was your decision in Wyoming versus Houghton -- the 

State regulates cars on a daily basis. They inspect, 

examine the vehicle. So when we are talking about the 

constitutional balance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Diminished expectations of 

privacy are not a reason to search.

 MR. YANG: Correct, but what it's balanced 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The only reason to search 

that I can find from you so far is officer safety.

an administrable rule, which is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where -- where is it? I 

mean, if you want to -- if you want to search, you can 

impound the car. If you want to search, you can ask for 

consent, which you probably won't get. If you want to 

search, you can look in the window. There's no problem 

there. It's just under the seat and in the glove 

compartment we're talking about. If you have probable 

cause to think that there's evidence of a crime even in 

the glove compartment or underneath the seat, you can 

look at it without a warrant. Why do you need this as 

well?

 You say we need this as well because the guy 

who's locked up in back of the squad car might take off 

the handcuffs, open the door, run out, and grab a gun 

from under the glove compartment. That's a little thin. 

And then you say, well, the rule is it needs to be 

administrable. And then I say, okay, the rule is 

administrable if you've got him locked up in the squad 

car and all you want to do is have a good snoop around, 

take it in and impound it. That's administrable.

 MR. YANG: The likelihood of that event 

occurring is relatively small. The potential risks to 

officers are great. Given that this does occur, that 

individuals do escape from vehicles, and -- here the

vehicle, the police vehicle, was parked immediately 

behind the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I got that point. Are 

there many people, by the way, they arrest but they 

leave them standing outside the squad car?

 MR. YANG: It will depend on the 

circumstances, Your Honor. Sometimes --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean are we going to have 

one of these spectrum things?

 MR. YANG: Well, that's exactly the point. 

In items of the administrable rule, there's all kinds of 

stages in an arrest, which, we'd have to stop and say, 

you know, is it going to be -- is he arrested -- is 

there one officer, or are the three suspects -- are they 

handcuffed in front or are they handcuffed in back? Is 

it a metal handcuff? Is it a plastic handcuff? Is it 

night? What's the surrounding circumstances in terms of 

the traffic that might be distracting to the officer? 

Is it a neighborhood which is a high-crime neighborhood? 

There's all kinds of things that, in the "totality of 

circumstances" approach the Arizona Supreme Court 

adopted, would be inadministrable in the field. And the 

Court recognized that in Belton, and in fact reaffirmed 

that in Thornton. Just recently the Court explained 

that experiences show the need for a bright-line rule in

this context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- a fine-line rule. I 

mean -- and you can instruct all the police officers in 

your department, when you arrest somebody, have them 

stand right near the car while you search it. Okay? 

Make sure that he's near enough that, you know, he's a 

threat to your safety.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. YANG: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's certainly a 

bright-line rule.

 MR. YANG: I doubt that -- the hypothetical 

that someone --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's actually a 

serious point, maybe in your favor because it -- what 

was worrying me about this is, if you lose the case, 

there would be policemen who would then let dangerous 

people stay in the car so they could search it. But you 

haven't made that argument, and, you know, that would be 

the --

MR. YANG: We think that that would be the 

exception. It's possible. We don't think that would 

happen on a routine basis, and certainly police 

departments and the Federal Government would not 

encourage our officers to take that risk.

 MR. YANG: Custodial arrests are dangerous 

in themselves, and this is one step, a reasonable step, 

that officers can take to secure their safety, among 

others, in the instance of a custodial arrest on the 

street.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But really what's at stake 

here is the right to search the vehicle for things that 

are not right out in front at the time he does the 

custodial arrest.

 MR. YANG: For instance, like a gun right 

underneath the seat, which would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If it was right there, 

obviously he had a right to search the whole vehicle 

under the automobile exception, but in the normal case, 

I don't see why officer safety is an adequate 

justification for going beyond the authority that it 

would have under the automobile exception. That's the 

problem I have, because you do have broad authority if 

you have probable cause.

 MR. YANG: May I?

doesn't that different doctrine apply the bright-line 

rule, simply administered, that you need?

 MR. YANG: When we're talking about 

custodial arrest, there are unknown risks. If there are 

unknown risks, officers obviously can't have probable 

cause to believe there would be a weapon in the car. 

And that's what the "search incident to arrest" doctrine 

seeks to address.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS F. JACOBS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the LaFave treatise is cited. That treatise addressed, 

primarily in the context of automobile searches, a 

history of the -- the nature of Fourth Amendment 

restrictions on that type of search.

 We also draw from Chimel itself, which 

contained an evaluation of the history of Fourth 

Amendment searches in general in order to come to the 

conclusion that the Fourth Amendment requires that 

searches which are exceptions to the warrant requirement 

must be tied to the twin exigencies on which they are 

based.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that so for 

searches of the vehicle? When it isn't -- it isn't so 

for search of the person? I mean, if the police arrest 

Mother Teresa, they are still entitled to frisk her, 

right, even though there's little likelihood that she 

has a Gatt?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- if -- if we don't 

apply the officer safety rationale to searches of the 

person, no matter how elderly, how eminent, how virtuous 

the person is, you can frisk. We're obviously not 

applying the officer safety rule across the board. 

We're adopting a bright-line rule that obviously applies 

to many situations in which the officer is not at risk.

Why can't you do the same for automobiles?

 MR. JACOBS: If the Court, Mr. Justice 

Scalia, if you're suggesting that a bright-line rule 

might be adopted that is essentially exactly like the 

search of person incident to arrest, the problem is that 

in an arrest situation the police have exclusive 

dominion and control over the person. They have that 

person in their custody, that person realistically, at 

the point when they have taken that person into their 

custody, historically had been recognized as a subject 

of search, and that has been consistent throughout our 

jurisprudence in the Fourth Amendment. We have always 

recognized that right. The problem is when you take an 

item like a car that is divorced from the person who is 

in the custody of the police and now extend that right 

to search to the individual or to the car, which is not 

necessarily something over which the police have a right 

to dominion and control. They have no problem with the 

car.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the 

history there? Do you know the history there.

 MR. JACOBS: In -- in terms of extension of 

the car rights?

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is not much there.

 MR. JACOBS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is not much there.

 MR. JACOBS: The -- the Court has raised a 

good point, but what we -- what is consistent, whether 

it's cars or not cars, is the requirement that searches 

under the Fourth Amendment be supported by warrants or 

an exception.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the absence of 

dominion or control works the other way. That makes it 

all the more dangerous. That could be -- there could be 

guns that other people could get out, evidence other 

people could get out; and, rather than go through a 

case-by-case analysis of whether this was true in every 

case, we just have a bright-line rule as Justice Scalia 

said at the outset.

 MR. JACOBS: The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that the 

absence of the dominion and control is -- is just a 

conclusory statement to explain what happens in the case 

the person is arrested, but it -- it doesn't seem to me 

to provide a rationale.

MR. JACOBS: Well, Justice Kennedy, it 

explains the difference between a person and something 

that is not the person, something that is divorced 

physically from the person, in the same sense that 

Mr. Chimel's house was separate from his person.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It actually works the 

other way, because it means there is more reason to 

search. It's not in our dominion and control. We are 

leaving it on the street. We want to know what's in 

there.

 MR. JACOBS: Well, keeping in mind the 

police have no right to search the car except under 

delineated exceptions. And what the Government is 

asking here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is what they are 

asking about in this case.

 MR. JACOBS: Well, what the Petitioner is 

asking, Justice Kennedy, is that the Belton rule be 

interpreted so expansively that it's no longer simply a 

bright-line rule of what you can search, but it's 

actually a bright-line rule that removes judicial review 

from when you can conduct that search. And the problem 

with that is --

not have to show that there are any special 

circumstances, and we do not necessarily have to 

overrule Belton here.

of the holding of Belton: When a police officer has 

made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an 

automobile, he may as a contemporaneous incident of that 

arrest search the passenger compartment of that 

automobile?

 MR. JACOBS: That is an accurate statement 

of the holding of Belton, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And if that rule is applied 

in this case, you would lose; would you not?

 MR. JACOBS: Well, we do not lose, Justice 

Alito. The reason is because of the focus that the 

Petitioner places on the aspect of that holding. They 

take it in a vacuum. They don't look at the word 

"contemporaneous" in terms of defining "incident to 

arrest."

 The problem with the search in this case and 

so many others is that the search that is conducted is

after the police have taken custody and secured the 

individual.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I mean I don't know if 

it can go off on that. The -- it seems to me I -- I 

thought when I looked through this, which was quickly, 

it seemed to me everyone was assuming that it's 

contemporaneous. Of course, if it isn't 

contemporaneous, that's a new world, and maybe you would 

win on that. I don't know. But don't we have to for 

present purposes take it as a contemporaneous search, 

which I think is what the lower courts found?

 MR. JACOBS: There are two views of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm sure there are, 

but what is your opinion? I mean, is there some reason 

what I have been doing -- you can tell me -- I am 

finding this case very, very difficult. And I am not at 

all certain in my own mind, and I am being quite frank 

with you. And the reason is that although I don't think 

Belton is very logical, it has been the law for 27 

years; and I take they seriously, as we all do, the 

principle of stare decisus.

 That is why your response to Justice Alito 

really sort of shook me. Because I was thinking, one, I 

have to take this as contemporaneous; and I have to run 

squarely into the problem that for some period of years

Belton has been the law and maybe even before Belton. I 

don't know about Thomas Jefferson's automobile. But, 

nonetheless, no disaster has occurred, and so why would 

we overrule an earlier case?

 Now that's -- that's exactly my problem. 

And so if you were interested in that, you have to give 

me an answer.

 MR. JACOBS: Justice Breyer, we are here to 

focus on exactly the issue of what is contemporaneous 

and I believe that it's important to focus on exactly 

what Belton arose out of. Belton arose out of as this 

court is well aware four individuals who were taken out 

of a car all four placed under arrest one set of 

handcuffs all around the car and arguably all arguably 

had access to or control over the passenger compartment 

of the vehicle. That's one of the requirements of 

Belton's holding is that they have to arguably have 

access to the passenger compartment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What does contemporaneous 

have to do with officer safety? It has to do with 

timing doesn't it?

 MR. JACOBS: Well if we consider Justice 

Alito that officer safety is a function of when you make 

that assessment. Is officer safety most at risk when 

the person is initially seized? Yes. However, once

they are in the back of a police car as Justice Scalia 

pointed out they pose a threat to no up with and the 

record is clear on that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let's say when an arrest is 

made, a team of officers are there. The person arrested 

is a person of slight stature. They immediately descend 

on this person and manacle the person in every possible 

way, but it's all done in 10 seconds. Is that not 

contemporaneous?

 MR. JACOBS: If one were to assume a search 

was conducted at that moment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And immediately they search.

 MR. JACOBS: I'm sorry if they immediately 

search after restraining the person and there is a 

defined between it being a second or minute or 32 

minutes that's not contemporaneous because the reasons 

supported by that search are not supported by the fact 

in the exigency. Belton was a situation where there was 

an immediate and tipping risk to the officer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're looking at 

the specific facts of Belton. Belton adopted a 

bright-line rule. The whole point of a bright-line rule 

is that you don't look at the specific facts and it 

presents a problem here you say the guy is handcuffed 

and in the back of the car? Well what if he is in the

back of the car but not handcuffed? What if there are 

five people around who might break open the police car 

and free him? What if there are three people around? 

You have exactly the same case by case inquiry that 

Belton said we are not going to do.

 MR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice we look at 

Buie, in Mincey the court noted that I search conducted 

immediate risk was that all preBelton.

 MR. JACOBS: Those are not all preBelton 

Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which one is not.

 MR. JACOBS: Mincey was after Belton, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those all 

preThornton.

 MR. JACOBS: Those are all preThornton Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well in Thornton of 

course the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police 

car.

 MR. JACOBS: In Belton Your Honor, the 

Petitioner in this case waived this analysis that we are 

dealing with in this case but it is true that the 

arrestee was secured. The issue was whether he was a 

recent occupant of the vehicle when he was apprehended

and whether we should even consider application of 

Belton.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my question 

is what is left of the Belton bright-line rule when you 

are done.

 MR. JACOBS: Exactly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have to have a to 

determine a threat to officer safety.

 MR. JACOBS: If we assume that that 

assessment is something new, Mr. Chief Justice then we 

are accepting without a basis Petitioner's 

interpretation of Belton's bright-line rule as etch 

tending beyond simply what is the permissible scope of 

the search. Remembering that Belton only applied Chimel 

to the automobile situation Petitioner advocates a much 

much too broad interpretation of this bright line rule 

that arose out of Belton and --

JUSTICE ALITO: The bright-line rule is set 

out in one sentence which is the sentence that I read to 

you but if you just assume for the sake of argument that 

in order to prevail, in order for you to prevail Belton 

has to be overruled. What is your, what's the 

justification for overruling Belton? Is it, has there 

been no reliance on it, is the Belton rule less workable 

than the rule that, the case by case rule that you're

proposing, is it undermined by subsequent developments 

and precedent or does stare decisus simply not count in 

these cases.

 MR. JACOBS: Well Justice Alito stare 

decisus always counts except where you're wrong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Assuming the 

decision is wrong.

 MR. JACOBS: That's right. Stare decisus is 

wrong, but you have to consider my point, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's enough if we think 

Belton was wrong that's enough for overruling it.

 MR. JACOBS: Yes and if the court is 

considering it Mr. Justice Alito if we would like me to 

answer the question assuming we should overrule Belton 

why we should do it the answer is Chimel provides us 

with sufficient tools for officers to protect their 

safety in the field because you will recall there are 

other ex-is hes to automobile searches with I have based 

on actual grounds.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well are you saying do you 

have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I 

think that the stare decisus is really brought into play 

when you think the earlier decision was wrong.

 MR. JACOBS: Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER: And at that point I'd still 

need a reason why you should depart from that earlier 

decision at the moment what the other side says is we 

tell our police a simple thing. We tell them when you 

arrest somebody who is in a car you can search the 

passenger compartment of the car okay. Simple. And 

we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do 

that and they do it. Now, is there some indication that 

that's turned out to be abusive? Is there indication 

that there are other problems with the rule as it turned 

out to be complicated? What kinds of things you could 

say that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind 

of reluctance.

 MR. JACOBS: I understand, Justice Breyer, 

and the answer is that -- two things: One, and first 

and foremost, Belton's general assumption, which is 

essentially required for the application of the 

bright-line rule, is empirically not true. With police 

procedures as we understand them today, routinely 

arrestees are secured, they are handcuffed, they are 

routinely placed in the back of patrol cruisers.

 And even the amici for the Petitioner in 

this case acknowledged that officers are not going to 

deviate from those procedures just to make a search in 

the future if the rule is changed, but primarily that,

that the assumption that underlies Belton is not shown 

to be empirically true. It's empirically false.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just not to get 

back -- Mincey was 1978. Belton was 1981.

 MR. JACOBS: Yeah, I misspoke then. Mincey 

would have been before Belton and would have been a 

basis, Mr. Chief Justice, for the Court to apply --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but I'm trying 

to see -- you cited three cases. And my question was 

whether those survived Belton. Now, were all three of 

those before Belton?

 MR. JACOBS: If Mincey was, then I would 

hazard a guess that the other three were as well, Your 

Honor, except for Buie. And I don't have a cite on that 

as to the year for Buie.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one of the 

really contentious issues at the time Belton decided is 

whether you can search containers in the back in the 

passenger part of the car. And under the automobile 

exception, you could search those containers if you had 

probable cause to believe anything in the car was 

contraband. And that's what Belton really opened the 

door to, was container searches. It was not just 

searches of things in plain view.

suggesting that that's too broad a rule is the very 

strong privacy interest in containers in cars driven by 

ordinary motorists. That's really what's at issue under 

Belton.

 MR. JACOBS: I would agree with that 

statement, Justice Stevens. That's a correct statement.

 And Buie is 1990, Your Honor. My able staff 

has provided the answers.

 But we have to recall, Justices, that we are 

at all times looking to the Fourth Amendment, its twin 

exigencies, and the requirement that this Court has 

consistently held, that in order to avoid a warrant, 

there must be a clearly defined and limited exception to 

the warrant requirement.

 Now, if there are no more questions, I will 

yield the floor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are not asking to 

overrule Belton; you are asking to take it in the 

context in which it was presented, where there was 

genuine concern for officer safety. Is that --

MR. JACOBS: Justice Ginsburg, that is 

exactly correct. In those situations Belton would 

apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to explore 

that, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to

the extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule. What 

you're saying is, well, in these circumstances Belton 

applies, and in these circumstances, it doesn't. But 

you're overruling Belton when you say there's no longer 

a bright-line rule.

 MR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm not 

being articulate enough, I think, because I keep coming 

back to the same thing. The bright-line rule in Belton 

was the extent of the permissible search, not the 

trigger for the permissible search. Although Belton 

indicated that the arrest -- an arrest of a person, if 

he is deemed a recent occupant and if the search is 

conducted contemporaneously with that arrest, allows the 

search. It is the scope of the search that was 

permitted, because we couldn't figure out, as a 

consistent matter, what was reaching distance when we 

dealt with that particular and problematic situation. 

And that's from Belton. And footnote 3 again comes back 

to that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think after 

Belton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look 

and see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case 

basis?

 MR. JACOBS: Belton only requires that if 

the passenger compartment of the vehicle is arguably

within the reach of an arrestee who was a recent 

occupant, that the police may contemporaneously search 

the passenger compartment without regard for how far.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

that part: "Arguably within the reach." I don't 

understand that to be part of Belton. I thought that's 

what Belton did away with, and thought Belton was 

saying, look, we are going to have a bright-line rule, 

because we don't want to say he's five feet away, he is 

not within the reach; two feet away, he is.

 MR. JACOBS: Belton --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think Belton 

kept the requirement that the person be arguably within 

the reach of the compartment?

 MR. JACOBS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Not 

any specific portion of the compartment. That's what 

Belton said. You don't have to prove he could reach the 

jacket in the back seat. You don't have to prove that 

he could reach the briefcase under the passenger seat. 

You just have to prove that he could reach the passenger 

compartment. And we will generalize that if you can 

reach the passenger compartment, you can reach anything 

in it. And that was the generalization.

 And even though we know from police 

procedures that empirically that's not really true, we

know that we can't -- the Petitioner can't cite a single 

instance where somebody has gone back to his car, 

grabbed a weapon, and attacked an officer. It just 

hasn't happened. Empirically it's false. And that, as 

Justice Breyer pointed out perhaps by his question, is 

one of the flaws of Belton that courts may continue to 

struggle with, but the bright-line doesn't change.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the situation 

where there are multiple occupants but there's probable 

cause to arrest only one of the occupants?

 MR. JACOBS: The consistent holdings of this 

Court, in analyzing this type of situation under the 

Fourth Amendment, have held that the arrestee is the 

focus of the inquiry into determining whether there is 

an exempt to the Fourth Amendment requirement. And this 

dovetails, essentially, into the argument we have 

against the Petitioner's thought that third parties 

should be the focus. But they weren't in Chimel, they 

weren't in Mincey, they weren't in Buie.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that going to be --

aren't cases like that going to be difficult calls as to 

whether there's officer safety concerns?

 MR. JACOBS: No. They are not going to be 

difficult calls. The focus being on the arrestee, the 

officer --

JUSTICE ALITO: One person is arrested, 

three people who were occupants are not arrested. They 

are all out by the side of the car. One of them is in 

handcuffs. Three of them are not arrested, not in 

handcuffs. There's no danger of officer safety there --

three people?

 MR. JACOBS: Officers have -- well, first of 

all, again, the focus for the analysis is on the danger 

from the arrestee, and we know that from Buie and the 

many cases that go with it. But, importantly, officers 

have other tools that they can use, other than searching 

somebody's car when they don't have probable cause.

 They can temporarily detain people for 

investigative purposes. They can separate them from the 

area of vehicle and the arrest, and move them away. 

They call for backup typically. In this case, for 

example, they had -- they had four or five officers on 

scene, and the scene, objectively, according to the 

officers, was secure. They said they had control of the 

scene.

 And that's an example of the use of police 

procedures that are available other than searching that 

establish officer safety and serve to protect our 

officers in the field without offending the Fourth 

Amendment.
