3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 11-460, Los Angeles Flood Control District 

v. The Natural Resources Defense Council. 

6  Mr. Coates. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. COATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that a 

12 discharge from a point source under the Clean Water Act 

13 occurred in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, 

14 based upon the fact that water moved from channelized 

portions of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers into 

16 what it termed, quote, "naturally occurring portions of 

17 those rivers." 

18  The court emphasized, in fact, that the 

19 discharge occurred because it moved through the concrete 

portions. And in the words of the court itself, found 

21 at the cert appendix at 44, it was, "again discharged to 

22 the rivers," and the "again" meaning that it was 

23 prior -- at prior time, it was in the rivers. 

24  This is completely contrary to the Court's 

decision in Miccosukee Tribe, where the Court held that

Official 

1 there cannot be a discharge for purposes of the NPDES 

2 permit program and the Clean Water Act, based upon the 

3 mere transfer of water within a single body of water. 

4  All the parties to this case agree that is 

the correct rule. Virtually all the amici agree that is 

6 the correct rule. And it's our view that that is 

7 dispositive of this case. It is the only live issue 

8 before this Court from the Ninth Circuit, and it 

9 dictates --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we just 

11 remand and let it sort it out under the right 

12 understanding of the legal rule? Which is basically 

13 what the government is saying, with an added twist 

14 because it thinks there is another legal question that I 

think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go 

16 back and forth on it. 

17  MR. COATES: Correct. At minimum, a 

18 reversal is -- is warranted, without a doubt, but I 

19 think given the record in this case is abundantly clear 

about what the claims were before the Ninth Circuit and 

21 what's going on with these monitoring stations. 

22  I mean, these monitoring stations are 

23 clearly within the rivers themselves. There is just no 

24 dispute about that. Even the Ninth Circuit's opinion, 

like I said, the language of the opinion 

4

1 suggests that --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Everybody agrees. 

3  MR. COATES: Correct. And the reason why I 

4 don't think there is an open remand is because there is 

nothing further in the record, really, to argue about. 

6  At minimum, of course, we would prefer 

7 reversal, and it would take an open remand. But I 

8 think, given the record in this case, the only live 

9 claim before the Ninth Circuit was this discharge theory 

when they found it in the middle of rivers; and, that 

11 being resolved against the Respondents, there is no 

12 other live issue. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me 

14 that they present a very direct syllogism. You have a 

permit that sets these monitoring stations where they 

16 are. The monitoring stations show exceedances, you have 

17 violated your permit. What -- what's wrong with that? 

18  MR. COATES: Well, because the nature of the 

19 monitoring here -- for example, when you look at the 

permitting question, it doesn't say the monitoring of 

21 any permittee. If you look at the permit where it talks 

22 about the mass emissions monitoring stations, it talks 

23 about measuring discharges and compliance from the MS4, 

24 not any individual permittee's MS4. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But I 

5

5

25

Official 

1 understand the argument to be that that's the problem 

2 that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that 

3 this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be. 

4 What is it monitoring, if not discharges from the MS4, 

for which you're responsible? 

6  The government suggests that there could be 

7 different rules about whether you have to show the 

8 allocation or if that's your responsibility. 

9  MR. COATES: But itâ€™s the -- Well, I think, 

again, the -- the rules say that you look at the permit's 

11 terms to interpret it. 

12  And the Ninth Circuit did look at the 

13 permit's terms. I mean, it -- it dealt with this 

14 argument, and it noted that there are several factors in 

the permit that suggest that it didn't relieve the 

16 Respondents of the obligation of having to show an 

17 actual discharge of water --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't --

19 you don't question that there was an actual discharge. 

The storm sewer system in Los Angeles hasn't been shut 

21 down, right? 

22  MR. COATES: Correct. But, again --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are 

24 discharges, right? 

MR. COATES: But not discharges of 

6

1 pollutants, and that's what's reported. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute 

3 that there was at least some small amount of pollutant, 

4 even below the -- the permit level, from your point 

sources, do you? 

6  MR. COATES: Well, we don't know that. But 

7 the -- but the point I want to make --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm asking you 

9 whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense 

suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on 

11 how much of a --

12  MR. COATES: Sure. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- particular 

14 pollutant you can discharge. 

MR. COATES: But, again --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You wouldn't do 

17 that, unless you expected to discharge some. 

18  MR. COATES: You might -- You might do it 

19 sometimes, you might do it others, you might do it in 

concentrations that would cause or contribute to the 

21 exceedances; but you still have to have a discharge that 

22 causes or contributes to the exceedances. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did you 

24 put the monitoring sources where they are, if that 

wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 the permit? 

2  MR. COATES: Because you're required, in 

3 a -- in a system-wide permit like this, to suggest -- to 

4 propose monitoring which is subject to the approval of 

the regulatory agency. And it's a question of 

6 monitoring of what? Not monitoring of any individual 

7 permittee's discharge. In fact, it's not designed for 

8 that. We even presented evidence in the district court 

9 to that effect. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the government 

11 says that that question -- you're saying, I understand, 

12 there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the 

13 dominant discharger, but I understand there are others, 

14 and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring 

station says. 

16  But the government's position is that, well, 

17 that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation; 

18 and that whatever allocation issues you have may be 

19 between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't 

affect the showing of liability. 

21  MR. COATES: Well, except for the fact that 

22 the permit terms themselves say that each permittee is 

23 only responsible for its own discharge. If you read the 

24 permit in the general fashion that the Respondents wish, 

then -- then you're not responsible only for your own 

8

1 discharge. 

2  It's essentially you're in immediately and 

3 responsible for all of them, until you prove otherwise. 

4 And that's just not how the permit reads. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that? I 

6 know we've got the permit. Where does it read that way? 

7  MR. COATES: Let's see. At the Joint 

8 Appendix, page 93, G, 4. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What page again? 

MR. COATES: Volume I of the Joint Appendix, 

11 page 93, and it's the fourth paragraph. And it's at the 

12 very bottom of the fourth paragraph. "Each permittee is 

13 responsible only for discharge for which it is the 

14 operator." 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the district 

16 has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into 

17 this river, and then you have this high pollution index. 

18 Does that make it an easier case for the challengers? 

19 Or is that just irrelevant? 

MR. COATES: It's just irrelevant, unless 

21 you show that, in that bulk of water, there is a higher 

22 concentration of pollutants. 

23  You could have a major discharger that 

24 undertakes more vigorous pollution controls than other 

smaller discharges. It doesn't necessarily show that

Official 

1 you're adding more pollutants, necessarily, or how those 

2 pollutants contribute to exceedances measured at the 

3 mass emissions monitoring stations. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one different 

question. This is hypothetical. It's not in the case. 

6 It's just for me to understand that. 

7  Suppose you have the river, and part of it 

8 is a concrete bank, and then there's a more natural 

9 bedding and then another concrete bank. 

And when the -- in the dry season, they fix 

11 the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete. And a lot 

12 of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is 

13 in the river. Is that a discharge under this statute? 

14  MR. COATES: I don't believe so. Although, 

I could --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would there be any --

17  MR. COATES: -- imagine circumstances where 

18 you create an outfall unintentionally by -- by 

19 funneling. I mean, I think you're talking about just 

natural erosion of turbidity or whatever into the river. 

21 I don't believe that would necessarily be a point 

22 source. 

23  It might be a non-point source pollution, 

24 but I don't believe that would necessarily be a point 

source if it's just inadvertently -- you know,

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's a 

3 separate provision of the statute, nonpoint source 

4 pollutions. 

MR. COATES: Well, it doesn't sound like --

6 you know, the -- the way it's defined under 1362 is a --

7 you know, like, enclosed conveyance that -- that 

8 discharges --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not in this 

case. 

11  MR. COATES: Yes, that's not in this case. 

12 But I --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was just a background, 

14 background question for you. 

MR. COATES: Yes, but I think that that --

16 that probably wouldn't be a discharge from a point 

17 source. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coates, I am -- I am 

19 still perplexed. 

MR. COATES: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: You say -- and it seems to 

22 be correct, that each -- each alleged polluter is only 

23 responsible for his own pollution. But you also say 

24 that these monitors are so situated that it is 

impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible 

11

1 for the pollution; is that right? 

2  MR. COATES: I think that -- I think that is 

3 right, but you look for the --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So whose fault is that? 

MR. COATES: Well, the reason why -- the 

6 reason why that that's there is to measure, essentially, 

7 the health of these rivers so that you can fine-tune the 

8 MS4 permit -- the systemwide permit, and so that you can 

9 gauge general water quality standards, and if necessary, 

you can fine-tune it to try and measure individual 

11 permittees. 

12  And we note that there is a renewed permit. 

13 It still has the monitoring stations in it, so under the 

14 Ninth Circuit's decision, we would still be discharging 

at those monitoring stations. But it does provide for 

16 outfall monitoring at representative outfalls for 

17 individual permittees to do precisely that kind of 

18 correlation that we are talking about. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what it is -- what 

is it that provides for that? 

21  MR. COATES: There is a renewed permit. The 

22 permits are renewed every 5 years. This is -- we are on 

23 the third permit now; this is the fourth; it's gone 10 

24 years. The renewed permit continues the mass emission 

station. So, as I mentioned, we are still discharging 

12

1 in middle of the river, as far as the Ninth Circuit is 

2 concerned. 

3  But it does have provisions for additional 

4 monitoring near outfalls, along the banks of the rivers, 

for various permittees, so that, in the future, you 

6 could look at that testing and go, boy, your outfall is 

7 producing X, Y, and Z. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this was a regulatory 

9 void? 

MR. COATES: This was a --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A regulatory void that 

12 these -- that there was no requirement previously that 

13 you monitor the outfalls? 

14  MR. COATES: Monitoring, correct, that there 

be specific outfall monitoring. It's a regulatory --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you -- how do 

17 you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one 

18 side question and then on to this one. 

19  I thought the Ninth Circuit basically 

endorsed your view that, under the permit, you're not --

21 you're only responsible for your own pollution. 

22  MR. COATES: That is correct. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it has resolved this 

24 issue?

2 why I ask why remand and why you're saying why remand. 

3  MR. COATES: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But putting that aside, 

how do you think the system was supposed to work before? 

6  MR. COATES: Well --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you have any 

8 obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start 

9 the reiteration process, to try to figure out who was 

the cause of this? 

11  MR. COATES: Well, if they attribute a -- a 

12 violation to a particular permittee -- for example, the 

13 district court noted and the Ninth Circuit re-emphasized 

14 it that you could at least, if you wanted to try and hook 

it to a single permittee, you could at least try and 

16 sample at an outfall for that permittee and then provide 

17 evidence that that contributed to exceedances. 

18  They didn't do that here, in the lower 

19 court. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You mean the Respondents 

21 could have done that here? 

22  MR. COATES: The Respondents could have done 

23 that here. They did not argue that they did that in the 

24 Ninth Circuit. They abandoned that -- that contention. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what -- what 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 percentage of discharges come from you, as opposed to 

2 the other members of the MS4 --

3  MR. COATES: We have -- we have the most 

4 infrastructure. I don't know the specific percentage, 

but bear in mind that there are 1,400 other entities 

6 upstairs --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Give me an estimate. 

8  MR. COATES: You know, I can't in terms of 

9 total water volume. But we are -- we are the largest 

player in that portion of the system. I'm not going to 

11 downplay that. 

12  What I'm saying is that there is no 

13 necessary correlation between that and, ipso facto, 

14 you're the one causing the exceedances at the monitoring 

stations; that, again, there has to be something 

16 traceable to our discharge that contributes to those 

17 exceedances. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what goes 

19 into these discharges, besides the rainwater runoff? 

MR. COATES: Here, it's just stormwater. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

22  MR. COATES: I mean, a municipal separate 

23 storm sewer system --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your -- your 

hypothesis is, in some of these minority dischargers, 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

    

20

25

Official 

1 that, for some reason, their rainwater would have a 

2 different amount of pollutants than your rainwater? 

3  MR. COATES: Well, they could -- they could 

4 very well have storm discharge different -- Yes, there 

are other discharges upstream from -- there are 

6 industrial sites that discharge water into the L.A. 

7 River, so -- no, absolutely. Absolutely. And again --

8 you know, a large jurisdiction, we may be more proactive 

9 in terms of doing pollution control as well. 

There is just no automatic correlation to 

11 that. And I think, as the district court said -- you 

12 know, it's not so much to ask to at least sample at one 

13 outfall to try and show that kind of correlation, so you 

14 can show exceedances at the margin. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, you mean --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy. 

17
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Circuit's error -- was the 

18 Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was 

19 based on the location of the stations? Or was it a legal 

one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case? 

21  MR. COATES: It -- it's a legal one. I 

22 don't believe it's a factual mistake, for a couple of 

23 reasons. One, the language that -- that I cited, that's 

24 in the cert appendix at 44, where it talks about the 

water, again, discharged to the river, suggests that 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 that water was in the river, and now, it's moving 

2 through our concrete channels and it's, again, 

3 discharged into the river. Its distinction that it 

4 draws is that there is something different because the 

MS4 is an intrastate manmade construction, as opposed to 

6 a naturally occurring river, which talks about the 

7 distinction being made in that regard. 

8  And finally, the record is just abundantly 

9 clear on where these monitoring stations are. The 

opinion itself at cert appendix, page 18, footnote 4, 

11 cites our website as the location of the monitoring --

12 for the location of the monitoring stations. And that 

13 website clearly says they are within the Los Angeles and 

14 San Gabriel Rivers. And, in fact, appellant's brief --

the Respondents' brief in the lower court, specifically 

16 said the same thing. 

17  And the --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just said there were 

19 polluters upstream. Are those industrial polluters 

upstream --

21  MR. COATES: There are -- there are --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- or industrial 

23 facilities, are they within your MS4? 

24  MR. COATES: They are not. They have 

separate NPDES permits.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're saying 

2 is that there are outfalls from different people into 

3 the same river. 

4  MR. COATES: Correct. Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So we don't 

6 know whether the outfall is from your MS4 or from some 

7 other source? 

8  MR. COATES: Correct, because they are all 

9 upstream of -- of the monitoring station. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you say they have 

11 two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are 

12 polluting, could have done -- could do two things. One, 

13 they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample 

14 or to make an estimate, based on what he knows about the 

industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains 

16 that are polluting. That's one thing they could do; you 

17 say they didn't do it. 

18  Okay. The second thing they could do is 

19 they go to the permitting authority, and they could say, 

will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the 

21 actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof. 

22 And you're saying they could have done that, but they 

23 don't have to now because, now, that is a requirement. 

24 And we are doing it. 

MR. COATES: That's correct.

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where is 

that requirement? 

6  MR. COATES: Excuse me? 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that 

8  requirement that you're now doing? 

9  MR. COATES: We -- in our reply brief, we 

cite the fact that a -- a -- the permit has just been 

11  renewed. We are waiting for the final version to go 

12  online and to see it. I think what we cite to the Court 

13  is the last one that was before the regional board. It 

14  lines -- it lines out. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are not doing 

16  it now? 

17  MR. COATES: We are not doing it now. I 

18  mean, there's -- the new permit is technically 

19  effective. It could be stayed if someone challenges it. 

I think it's open until it's challenged until December 

21  11th. But under the renewed permit, there is outfall 

22  monitoring -- specific outfall monitoring. Now, the 

23  mass emission station is still there, and under the 

24  Ninth Circuit's opinion, we are still discharging there 

and responsible for the exceedances.

1  So -- but that's the type of monitoring that 

2  plaintiffs want, and that's in the new permit. If they 

3  want it in the last permit, they could have disputed it; 

4  they could have contested the last permit. But they 

didn't do so. This is a fine-tuning program. I mean, 

6  municipal stormwater is a complex issue. Congress 

7  didn't treat it the same way it did industrial 

8  stormwater. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your position that 

the rivers -- the two rivers in question are outside the 

11  MS4? I thought there was a suggestion in the 

12  government's brief that you could have both the river 

13  and the MS4 that could cover the same area. 

14  MR. COATES: We have -- in the lower courts, 

the district personnel refer to the channelized portion 

16  as part of our MS4 because it's all flood control to us. 

17  However, we have never said it's all the same for 

18  purposes of a discharge. We've been very careful about 

19  that, that, for a discharge from a point source, an 

outfall, not the monitoring stations -- in fact, in the 

21  district court, plaintiff somewhat argued that theory, 

22  the monitoring stations, when you're MS4, they're 

23  exceedances; ergo, exceedances in your MS4. 

24  And we pointed out, under Miccosukee, there 

is no discharge of water. There's no discharge because

1  it's merely transferring water as water moves past the 

2  monitoring stations. And then --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the purpose of 

4  having the monitoring station if nothing can be done? 

And are -- the monitoring shows, yes, there is a lot of 

6  pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of 

7  them have to be ascribed to the district. But you say, 

8  unless you -- you show the outflow, that it comes from 

9  there, no liability. 

Why shouldn't it be that, given there is 

11  going to be a contribution that the district is making, 

12  that the district should have the burden of showing, no, 

13  there are all these other ones out there, so our 

14  percentage is X, not the whole thing? 

MR. COATES: Well, again, the -- the Water 

16  Act makes you responsible for a discharge in violation 

17  of permit terms, so you have to have a discharge by the 

18  permittee. 

19  The permit terms itself are not written in 

that fashion. Again, it says we are only responsible 

21  for our own discharge. Could you write a permit that 

22  way? Perhaps. But this permit was not written that 

23  way. 

24  And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit agreed with 

us on that. The permit language is not tricky on that.

1  You could have permittee monitoring. You could. And 

2  that's what the renewed permit does. But that is not 

3  this permit. 

4  The regional board -- as I said, it's part 

of a process. There have been three permits over the 

6  last -- since 1990. And we have a fourth permit, and it 

7  has some new provisions to fine tune it for precisely 

8  this reason. 

9  I note that -- the biggest dispute we seem 

to have on this monitoring issue -- and -- and it's one 

11  that I think the discussion we are having bears out, is 

12  that it is not a straightforward issue; that when you 

13  look at the statute itself, the Statute 1342(p)(3) 

14  distinguishes between industrial stormwater dischargers 

and municipal stormwater discharges. 

16  Now, I think it is worth looking at that 

17  provision because, if you look at (a), and that talks 

18  about industrial dischargers, it says they have to meet 

19  every requirement of this provision. And if you go to 

1342(a), it includes everything, including the 

21  monitoring requirements of 33 U.S.C. 1318. 

22  But if you look at 1342(p)(3), subdivision 

23  (B), which talks about municipal stormwater, you do not 

24  see that language. You do not see that "must comply" 

with every other provision of this section. It doesn't

1  say that. 

2  It only has, essentially, three 

3  requirements, which is these permits can be granted on a 

4  system-wide or jurisdiction-wide basis, you have to only 

allow stormwater, and that the -- must provide to try 

6  and manage pollutants to the maximum extent practicable. 

7  And that's the sum total of it. 

8  So I don't think you can assume that these 

9  are identical monitoring requirements. It's, at the 

very least, a complex question. I think it's one that 

11  would have behooved the Court to be able to obtain more 

12  amicus assistance on. And part of it is the way that 

13  this was raised to this Court, that this was a proper 

14  issue for a cross-petition. 

And the only justification I've seen for 

16  this is I saw a letter come to the Court advising it of 

17  two cases, I think, LeTulle v. Scofield -- I don't know 

18  if it's LeTulle or LeTulle -- and Ryerson v. United 

19  States. And neither of one of those suggest that this 

is an appropriate issue for the Court. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is your description 

22  of the statute meant to conclude, or does it -- does it 

23  conclude, that these outsource monitoring stations which 

24  exist under the new permit are not really required?

17  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH, 

18  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

19  MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

21  The answer to the question presented in this 

22  case is both straightforward and undisputed. Under this 

23  Court's decision in Miccosukee, no addition, and thus, 

24  no discharge of pollutant occurs, when water flows from 

a channelized portion of a river to a downstream portion 

24

Official 

1  of that same river. 

2  Because the monitoring stations at issue are 

3  actually located within the rivers themselves, the court 

4  of appeals erred in concluding that a discharge of 

pollutants occurred when, quote, "the still-polluted 

6  stormwater flowed out of the concrete channels where the 

7  monitoring stations are located, through an outfall and 

8  into the navigable waterways." 

9  And because the court of appeals rested its 

liability determination on that erroneous premise, the 

11  judgment should be vacated and the case remanded to the 

12  court of appeals. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, what about the 

14  problem that one of the amici brought up concerning 

dredged material? Said that if we just say Miccosukee 

16  applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the 

17  material is redeposited back into the same water, then 

18  that would also -- there would be no responsibility 

19  based on that. 

MR. SHAH: Right. Your Honor, I think -- I 

21  think the one amicus that does raise that issue raises 

22  it limited to -- the biggest counterexample they raise 

23  is the one that you raise about Section 404 permits for 

24  dredged and fill material. Those permits are just very 

different in kind.

1  Section 404 applies to dredged and fill 

2  material, which almost, by definition, is going to be 

3  coming from the source itself. And so we think that the 

4  Miccosukee line of decision just doesn't apply to that 

permitting regime, which -- which is a very different 

6  sort of permitting regime than we have at issue here. 

7  And in any event, I think it's far beyond 

8  the question presented in this case, the Miccosukee 

9  rule. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, tell me why 

11  remand? I thought -- and correct me at whatever step 

12  I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected 

13  Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses 

14  created liability. What it said is you have to follow 

the terms of the permit and make the permittee 

16  responsible only for their excess discharges, and you 

17  haven't shown us any evidence that does that. 

18  The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee 

19  is only liable for its own discharges. It held the 

permittee liable because it believed that the discharges 

21  were within their source -- within their outflow. So 

22  what are we remanding for? The legal question of 

23  whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations 

24  automatically create liability has been answered in the 

negative by both courts.

Official 

1  MR. SHAH: Justice Sotomayor, I agree with 

2  your reading of -- of both opinions below. 

3  I think what we're asking for is the Court 

4  to do what it normally does when it vacates an erroneous 

part of a judgment and sends it back, that is, leave it 

6  open to the court of appeals, to address any issues 

7  consistent with this Court's opinion. 

8  We think it's conceivable that the Ninth 

9  Circuit might approach the permit construction issue 

differently, once it's corrected of the 

11  misimpressions --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would it --

13  MR. SHAH: -- that it had before it. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what could it do 

differently? 

16  MR. SHAH: I think, in particular, the Ninth 

17  Circuit construed this permit on the understanding that 

18  there was a discharge of polluted water after it flowed 

19  past the monitoring station and said that the district 

could be liable, based simply on the exceedance measured 

21  by the mass emission station alone. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does that change the 

23  answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both 

24  courts have said the permittee is only liable for their 

own discharges. And unless this proves that they 

27

1  discharged -- they, themselves, discharged, which it 

2  can't because it's in the river and not within the 

3  source --

4  MR. SHAH: Well, it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how can that, alone, 

6  establish liability? 

7  MR. SHAH: Well, again, I think the Ninth 

8  Circuit predicated its permit interpretation on the 

9  understanding that there would be at least some way to 

hold a permittee -- in this case, the district -- liable 

11  based on the mass emission exceedance alone, and that's 

12  because it misapprehended that there would be a 

13  discharge of flow of the polluted water. 

14  It could be, and it may not be. We don't 

know until it gets back to the Ninth Circuit. It may be 

16  that the Ninth Circuit would reject the view that you 

17  could have a permit that sets up a permitting regime 

18  that does not allow a plaintiff to sue any particular 

19  permittee, unless it has evidence beyond that provided 

by the monitoring regime. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so -- so what follows 

22  from that; that the district is liable because it's a 

23  lousy permit? 

24  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, if --

2  be able to do anything different, other than say there's 

3  no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another 

4  fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is 

something I worry about. 

6  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we think that 

7  this permit -- again, the terms of this permit are both 

8  complex and ambiguous. We do not think that permits 

9  should be written this way. We think permits that 

provide for water quality -- for MS4s to adhere to water 

11  quality standards based on ambient monitoring should be 

12  coupled with either individual --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I agree with that, but 

14  how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a 

way as to hold a district liable? 

16  MR. SHAH: Well, I think the most 

17  persuasive -- and, again, we don't take a firm position 

18  on this, but I think the most persuasive argument on the 

19  other side would be that, when permit writers issue a 

permit, they -- they assume that the permitting regime 

21  provided in the permit would provide a basis to seek 

22  enforcement of that permit. If that were true --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: They would assume that; 

24  but, if it doesn't, it doesn't. 

MR. SHAH: Well --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: So what do you do if it 

2  doesn't? 

3  MR. SHAH: Well, one could imagine a regime 

4  where the permittees, that is, the municipalities who 

apply for a joint permit, would agree to a shared 

6  presumption of liability. For example, there are --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: They have -- they have not 

8  agreed. 

9  MR. SHAH: Well, again, we don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're going to impose a 

11  shared thing? I see no way for the court of appeals to 

12  do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case 

13  right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back 

14  to the same panel. 

MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

16  it's a cert-worthy issue, how to interpret the terms of 

17  this specific -- this is a fairly --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But, anyway, you say that 

19  the court held the same thing in two other cases 

involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal 

21  from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of 

22  us. 

23  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --

you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two

2  MR. SHAH: Right. You Honor, I think in 

3  terms of the cross-petition issue, that is a closed 

4  question. I don't think the Court needs to get near it 

because I think there are several other good reasons why 

6  this Court should not decide the permit construction 

7  issue itself. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But if we decide 

9  that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't, 

then what's the basis for our remanding, rather than 

11  reversing? 

12  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: It's that issue that what 

14  we have to decide. 

MR. SHAH: Your Honor, it's established that 

16  this Court -- even if a cross-petition were required, 

17  it's established that this Court has the authority to 

18  remand for disposition of any further issues once a case 

19  comes before this Court. So the cross-petition --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should we, in light 

21  of the clarity of the permit? That's the question 

22  Justice Scalia is asking. 

23  MR. SHAH: Sure. I think the Court should 

24  just follow its ordinary practice. We're not asking for 

anything different than its ordinary practice of

6  ordinary practice, when -- when nothing can happen on 

7  remand, except -- except to give judgment for the 

8  Petitioners here. 

9  MR. SHAH: Well, I think it would be unusual 

for the Court to reverse and then instruct that judgment 

11  be entered in favor of Petitioner. Of course, the Court 

12  is free to do that, and it may decide to do that. We 

13  just think that there is a possibility that the Ninth 

14  Circuit would -- would take a different approach. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Sometimes, the Court says 

16  the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've 

17  never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but 

18  it just says, "Reversed." 

19  MR. SHAH: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And then, sometimes, it 

21  says, "It is so ordered." And exactly when you write 

22  the word "Reversed" -- but I usually just ask the Clerk, 

23  all right.

3  "Reversed," we'll deal with the rest of it. All right. 

4  So that's --

MR. SHAH: Right. And, again, the Court is 

6  well within its -- its discretion to do that. We 

7  think --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that always 

9  say that in the judgment of the Court? 

MR. SHAH: Doesn't it always say what, Your

13  so ordered," in the judgment that we release? 

14  MR. SHAH: Yes, yes. And I think the 

typical -- I think the typical phrasing would be vacate 

16  and -- and remand for further proceedings. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, am I right 

18  about that this other theory, if it were open to the 

19  Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers 

that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the 

21  case because, when it got to the Ninth Circuit, we were 

22  talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel?

still has the case on remand, if it were to revisit its 

6  permit construction.

8  not look at Malibu and -- what's the other one that 

9  we're already --

MR. SHAH: The other watershed.

18  rivers, it would be in tension with it, and if they 

19  agree that the rationale which led them to deny -- to 

deny liability on those two rivers, that may lead them 

21  to adhere to its current permit interpretation.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON COLANGELO 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. COLANGELO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

6  it please the Court: 

7  We do not defend the judgment on the Ninth 

8  Circuit's stated rationale, but on alternative grounds 

9  that are properly before this Court. The compliance 

monitoring included in the permit determines 

11  Petitioner's liability for permit violations as a matter 

12  of law, as the Clean Water Act, EPA regulations, and the 

13  permit's own terms all require. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, where is the 

permit's own terms? Your friend cited JA 93, which says 

16  each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for 

17  which it is the operator. So where does the permit 

18  clearly show the opposite? 

19  MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, let me point you 

to three provisions in the permit that, taken together, 

21  compel this result. The first is page 195 of the Joint 

22  Appendix, the paragraph numbered D(1). And this refers 

23  to the individual permittees, and it says, "Each 

24  permittee must comply with all of the terms, 

requirements, and conditions of this order. Any 

35
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  violation of this order constitutes a violation of the 

2  Clean Water Act, its regulations, and the California 

3  Water Code, and is grounds for enforcement action." 

4  And that's the first of the three 

provisions, and it is undisputed here that there are 

6  permit violations. The monitoring included in the 

7  permit that Petitioner and its co-permittees chose has 

8  demonstrated, since 2003, undisputed permit violations. 

9  The second provision is page 98 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. But -- but before 

11  you go further, it says each permittee must comply. It 

12  doesn't say that each permittee shall be responsible or 

13  shall be liable. And it's the other provision that says 

14  that each permittee is responsible only for a discharge 

for which it is the operator. 

16  MR. COLANGELO: 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18  MR. COLANGELO: 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

MR. COLANGELO: 

Correct. 

So you got more --

Yes, You Honor. 

-- more besides 195. 

Well, and what 195 adds is 

21  it says any violation is grounds for enforcement action. 

22  Now, JA 98 talks about exactly this 

23  circumstance, when violations are detected at the 

24  monitoring stations. And about halfway down JA 98, it 

says, if exceedances of water quality objectives or 

36

Official 

1  water quality standards persist -- and that's only 

2  measured in one place; that's at the compliance 

3  monitoring in the rivers -- notwithstanding 

4  implementation of control measures and other 

requirements of this permit, quote, "the permittee," 

6  individually, "the permittee shall assure compliance 

7  with discharge prohibitions and receiving water 

8  limitations by complying with the following procedure." 

9  It then sets out four steps that each 

permittee must comply with to bring the MS4 within the 

11  permit limits. Now, that is --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the very first 

13  step is A, "Upon a determination by either the permittee 

14  or the regional board that discharges are causing or 

contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water 

16  quality standard, the permittee shall promptly notify," 

17  et cetera. They cannot make such a determination 

18  because of the nature of the monitoring -- monitoring 

19  here. 

MR. COLANGELO: That's -- that's incorrect, 

21  Your Honor. The permit compels this result because 

22  there is only one place in the permit that that 

23  monitoring is required, and that is the in-stream mass 

24  emission stations that the permittees chose. And the 

permit says, explicitly, the monitoring results at those

Official 

1  locations are used to assess compliance and determine 

2  whether the MS4 is contributing to violations. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: But as I read it, and he 

4  explained it, I thought that, look, what they're 

thinking is this: Stormwater is really a big problem, 

6  and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we 

7  want the agencies to work it out. So the purpose of 

8  this monitoring thing is we first determine that there 

9  is an exceedance. 

Now, once we determine that there is an 

11  exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent 

12  particular requirement, then we're going to go on to 

13  decide who. And what we're going to do is leave you 

14  with two possible choices. One is you can try to figure 

out who, which means you've got to get an expert and 

16  monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which 

17  will -- will -- you know, which will -- which will put 

18  some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll 

19  monitor higher up the river. 

Now, that's a rational way for an agency to 

21  proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies. 

22  And so why -- why are we running all around, trying to 

23  work this thing out? Why don't you just sort of try to 

24  deal with it as they described it and say, okay, we're 

going to either prove you did it before or at least we

1  can prove it now? 

2  MR. COLANGELO: There are two answers to 

3  that, Your Honor. The first is this is all sorted out 

4  during the permitting process. This permit was adopted 

by the State agency and upheld by State courts upon the 

6  Petitioner's challenge after 5 years of litigation. The 

7  permit was based on an 80,000 page administrative record 

8  and the testimony of 29 witnesses. And the point of 

9  this process is that permit terms are fixed once the 

permit is finalized and approved by the courts. 

11  Now, the reason we didn't challenge the 

12  permit at the time is that we were defending the permit 

13  alongside the State agency as an intervenor against 

14  Petitioner's challenge. Petitioner in State court for 

years made exactly the opposite argument that it makes 

16  here. It said that it was entitled to a safe harbor 

17  provision in the permit, to excuse it from liability, 

18  because it would be held responsible based on this 

19  in-stream monitoring. 

Now, there may be, as a -- as a technical or 

21  scientific matter, better monitoring programs, to 

22  determine who's putting in what and where exactly it is 

23  coming from, but that cannot be reopened upon an 

24  enforcement proceeding. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do -- the

1  district is a big contributor, but there are other 

2  contributors. So, on your theory, how do we determine 

3  what is the share that the district would be liable for? 

4  MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, the permit 

includes a blueprint that sorts that out, and it 

6  parallels the traditional notion of several liability. 

7  Where there are multiple contributors to a single harm, 

8  each is responsible for its share --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you still have to show 

that there is a contributor. And I've been through 

11  these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable 

12  interpretation of this section is that there is a 

13  violation if a particular permittee violates. 

14  And what I'm taking away from your argument 

is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees 

16  are liable, and that just can't be. 

17  MR. COLANGELO: It can be, Your Honor, and 

18  that's the -- that's the solution that the permit works 

19  out and that the permittees negotiated for in advance. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the third section, 

21  Mr. Colangelo? I'm waiting breathlessly for your third 

22  section. You said there were three. 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  MR. COLANGELO: The third, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I've got 195. I've got 98.

1  Where is the third one? 

2  MR. COLANGELO: The third, Your Honor, is JA 

3  109. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: 109. 

MR. COLANGELO: And this parallels a 

6  provision in EPA's regulations. 

7  At the very bottom of JA 109, subsection D, 

8  it says, "The permittee shall carry out all inspection, 

9  surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to 

determine compliance and noncompliance with permit 

11  conditions." 

12  So the problem with Petitioner's theory is 

13  that they are violating this provision of the permit, 

14  which is taken virtually verbatim from EPA regulations, 

which says that the discharger has the responsibility to 

16  measure and report its own violations. 

17  And stepping back to talk about the Clean 

18  Water Act program, generally, and the discharge permit 

19  program, generally, no one is entitled to discharge 

without a permit; a permit fixes terms that must be 

21  complied with; and at the heart of the permitting 

22  program is self-monitoring and self-reporting of 

23  violations. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- Looking at 

109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say â€“ to

1  say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection 

2  and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with 

3  the permit, and their point is, well, we're not -- we're 

4  not not in compliance with the permit because you 

haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the 

6  discharges to them. 

7  MR. COLANGELO: Well -- and the problem with 

8  that, Your Honor, is that it leads to no liability ever 

9  for the discharger, even though it concedes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that 

11  might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets 

12  back to the question of whether the permit is -- is 

13  poorly drafted. 

14  MR. COLANGELO: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I guess 

16  the idea is they're changing the permit so to -- to cure 

17  that problem. 

18  MR. COLANGELO: The permit has changed. It 

19  is not yet effective, Your Honor, but there is a new 

permit that will be in effect shortly. But on the 

21  question of whether --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why do you 

23  need that if -- if the present permit covers it as 

24  clearly as you say? I mean self -- self-monitoring. 

MR. COLANGELO: That is absolutely --

3  take you to challenge this and blah, blah, blah, blah? 

4  Why go through all that if, indeed, the present permit, 

as you say, is perfectly adequate? 

6  MR. COLANGELO: The present permit is 

7  adequate. The State agency renewed the permit. That's 

8  a matter of course. It changed the monitoring program. 

9  The point is that whatever monitoring the State agency 

sets and that the State courts uphold is the monitoring 

11  that determines compliance. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you still 

13  I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the 

14  district share would be determined. It is not the 

only polluter. Are you saying each permittee is 

16  responsible for the whole? 

17  MR. COLANGELO: No, Your Honor. That's 

18  joint and several liability. And here, JA 93, which 

19  Petitioner cites, says that each permittee is 

responsible only for its discharges. That's just --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So how do we find out 

22  what is its part -- what is its share? 

23  MR. COLANGELO: The permit sets that out. 

24  The permit says, once a violation is detected, each 

permittee has to go back upstream, conduct enhanced

1  monitoring to identify the particular sources of 

2  pollution within its jurisdiction, control those 

3  sources, but only those within its jurisdiction, and 

4  continue that process until the problem is resolved. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the 109 language 

6  you cite? 

7  MR. COLANGELO: No, Your Honor. That's at 

8  both 98, which I cited second, and page 213. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the upshot would 

be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm 

11  wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under 

12  the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical 

13  assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the 

14  new permit, then the only result of your winning this 

would be to transfer the running of the district from 

16  the agency to the court. And I suspect the Ninth 

17  Circuit knows less about it than you participating in 

18  a -- some kind of negotiation with the agency. 

19  MR. COLANGELO: No, not at all, Your Honor. 

The -- the Petitioner retains the authority and, indeed, 

21  the responsibility to identify the particular sources 

22  within its jurisdiction that are causing the problem and 

23  abating only those. So it is limited, in response to 

24  Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, only to its own 

share.

1  There is no question that there are other 

2  contributors, but the permit doesn't impose a violation 

3  only upon the entity who is the sole cause. There 

4  are -- there are many polluters that discharge into 

these rivers. The permit specifically says it is 

6  unlawful to cause or contribute to a violation of water 

7  quality standards. So prohibiting a contribution 

8  assumes that there will be other contributors and that 

9  the Petitioner will not be the sole cause. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is all 

11  fine and good. Your -- your friend, though, says you 

12  should have cross-petitioned because the relief you seek 

13  expands the judgment below, and there are all these 

14  cases saying you can't do that. 

MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, the relief we 

16  seek would not expand the judgment below because the two 

17  rivers on which we lost are out of the case. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand 

19  that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot 

of cases that say you can't do that. You can't just 

21  sort of say, oh, I give up on the others because the 

22  judgment, I guess, is one whole, and you would be 

23  changing the judgment.

would necessarily have changed the judgment. 

6  Here, accepting this argument would not 

7  change the judgment. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why wouldnâ€™t it 

9  necessarily --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thatâ€™s because youâ€™re giving 

11  up -- you're giving up on the two rivers, even though your 

12  theory would work the same way with respect to them? 

13  MR. COLANGELO: That's correct, Your Honor. 

14  And that's consistent with the cross-petition rule. A 

respondent who is satisfied with the result below and 

16  does not seek to change the judgment does not need to 

17  cross-petition. A cross-petition is only necessary --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you think that the

the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you 

21  didn't prove -- there was no -- there was no proof that 

22  the district was responsible for a given part. So, on

1  Honor, yes. But this Court can affirm on any basis 

2  preserved below, and this was also preserved in our 

3  brief in opposition at the jurisdictional stage, as long 

4  as it would not change the judgment. 

And here's why it would not. Let me 

6  distinguish the Northwest Airlines v. County of Kent 

7  case, which Petitioner cites. That case presents, in 

8  fact, the opposite situation of what we have here. In 

9  that case, Respondent's argument, had it been accepted, 

would have required the district court to grant further 

11  relief in continuing proceedings on a claim that no 

12  longer existed because the Respondent's argument was 

13  that there was no private right of action at all. 

14  Our case is the opposite because, if the 

Court accepts our position, we simply don't get any 

16  further relief with respect to claims that are waived to 

17  which we would have been entitled. And the two cases 

18  that we've cited by letter last week both represent 

19  exactly that situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Colangelo, did you

is at the very bottom of page 4 in our supplemental

3  Final -- now, most of our supplemental brief 

4  and our brief in opposition were addressing why we did 

not think Petitioner's question merited this Court's 

6  review. This is the argument that we made in defense of 

7  the judgment below, "The Court of Appeals ruling was 

8  both correct and equitable. Every permit must include 

9  sufficient monitoring to determine compliance." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- but -- but that --

11  that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant 

12  monitors. 

13  MR. COLANGELO: Absolutely, Your Honor. And 

14  Petitioner's saying we're not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say -- you know, 

16  they were correct. You have to find some basis for 

17  liability, and they use the monitors, and that's it. It 

18  didn't -- it didn't say, in detail, that these people 

19  had to go and -- and set up their own monitoring 

under -- under the permit. 

21  MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, that was the --

22  that was our argument in the Ninth Circuit and at the 

23  cert stage, and that -- we do lay out exactly how the 

24  permit works. The point is that the permit imposes 

liability on the multiple dischargers --

4  That's correct. But we can -- we can defend the 

judgment on a basis, even one that the Ninth Circuit 

6  rejected. 

7  To go back --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Colangelo, suppose we did 

9  what the Solicitor General says to do and vacated 

this. Can you think of any reason why the Ninth Circuit 

11  would change its mind? I mean, is there any connection 

12  between these two issues that you can point to, such 

13  that our making clear to the Ninth Circuit that they 

14  made a mistake on one actually would affect their 

analysis on the other? 

16  MR. COLANGELO: There is one reason, Your 

17  Honor, and that is that a permit is interpreted like a 

18  contract, and it is a cardinal rule of contract 

19  interpretation that a contract should be read where --

where possible to be both lawful and enforceable. 

21  So the Ninth Circuit may go back down and 

22  say, okay, with this corrected understanding of the 

23  universe of law and facts that apply, we see that 

24  Petitioner's reading of the permit would render it 

unenforceable because none of the permittees can be held 

50

1  liable and, therefore, unlawful because the Clean Water 

2  Act requires all permits to include within it 

3  self-monitoring and self-reporting to demonstrate a 

4  violation. 

So the Ninth Circuit -- now, it may just --

6  it may just say, we say what we said before. But it 

7  could reconsider on that basis, and that would be a 

8  legitimate basis for it to do so. 

9  To go back to the earlier question about 

where there is a discharge, there is no question that 

11  Petitioner discharges these pollutants to these rivers, 

12  so the only question for this enforcement proceeding is 

13  where to measure Petitioner's discharges for purposes of 

14  liability. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is there no -- where 

16  do I look to find out that the district is making a 

17  discharge of polluted water, other than under the Ninth 

18  Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself? 

19  MR. COLANGELO: Two places, Your Honor. 

First is that it's a premise for the permit itself. So 

21  if you look at page JA 55, it says the Petitioner 

22  discharges stormwater into these rivers. And then the 

23  very next paragraph shows that the Petitioner has done 

24  an assessment of the pollutants that are typically in 

its discharges, and it lists the ones that are now in 

51

1  violation here. 

2  So the permit, it didn't -- it came out of 

3  this administrative process, and one of the elements --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So is your theory that, if 

the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10, 

6  to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station 

7  in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable 

8  for the increase, even though other dischargees might 

9  have made this? 

MR. COLANGELO: Yes, yes, because --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't get that from what 

12  you have read. I've looked at --

13  MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, because --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the text you've read and 

it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee. 

16  MR. COLANGELO: It says that the MS4 is in 

17  violation, that's correct. But then it says each 

18  permittee must, when an exceedance is detected, take 

19  these steps. So here, what they have failed to do is 

take the necessary steps to apportion responsibility 

21  among the multiple contributors. The second place, just 

22  to finish on the -- on the proof that they discharge --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Finish that. So what's the 

24  consequence of that? 

MR. COLANGELO: I'm sorry?

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Therefore, each one of them 

2  is liable for all of it? 

3  MR. COLANGELO: No, no, Your Honor. No. 

4  Each one is liable for what they put in and bears the 

burden to demonstrate and limit what it puts in. That's 

6  explicit in the permit. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: But they haven't done so. 

8  So what? 

9  MR. COLANGELO: So that's a permit 

violation, and result is that this pollution continues 

11  year after year after year, when the point of the permit 

12  and the point of the Clean Water Act was to eliminate 

13  what everybody agrees is the biggest source of water 

14  pollution in Southern California. And this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if each permittee is 

16  allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; 

17  then both permittees are liable? 

18  MR. COLANGELO: Correct, Your Honor, 

19  unless -- because those facts are not known at the time 

the violation is detected. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, we now know the 

22  facts because it's the hypothetical. 

23  MR. COLANGELO: Okay. So if the permittee 

24  has done its own monitoring, in addition to what the 

permit requires, and can demonstrate that it did not put

1  anything in, then it is not liable. If not, then yes. 

2  Two dischargers into the same river who agree in advance 

3  to be measured by a single monitoring station in the 

4  river are liable for what's measured there, and then 

they sort it out. 

6  And what -- Congress set up a regime that 

7  would allow for system-wide and jurisdiction-wide 

8  permits precisely because this problem was so 

9  complicated. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are the 

11  provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been 

12  talking about, the three that you cited and the one that 

13  youâ€™re -- are they boilerplate? Do they show up in every 

14  typical stormwater permit? 

MR. COLANGELO: Well, 109 -- the fact that 

16  the permittees must conduct all monitoring to 

17  demonstrate compliance, if "boilerplate" means that they 

18  are in all permits, then, yes, because that's a 

19  requirement of EPA regulations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. What about the 

21  one that says each permittee is responsible only for a 

22  discharge for which it is the operator? 

23  MR. COLANGELO: That's from a EPA 

24  regulation, too, yes. That's in the definition of 

"co-permittee" at 122.2; so, yes, that's also standard

1  in system-wide permits. 

2  To go back to the earlier question about 

3  where there is a discharge, the district court found, 

4  and this is undisputed, at Petition Appendix 117, the 

permit admits -- the permittee, Petitioner, admits that 

6  it is discharging these pollutants, the ones measured in 

7  violation, to these rivers. So what we have is no 

8  question, no dispute that they discharged these 

9  pollutants, a monitoring system included in the permit 

that the State court upheld against Petitioner's 

11  challenge, showing that those limits have been exceeded. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Your basic argument is 

13  this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring, 

14  to decide if you're violating it. You chose this 

system, then common sense suggests you're doing it. You 

16  struck out twice with that argument --

17  MR. COLANGELO: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: -- in the other two rivers, 

19  and now, you're going to go back if we permit it, and 

we want to make the argument and tell the Ninth 

21  Circuit, three times and you're out; in this case, hold 

22  the opposite.

3  MR. COLANGELO: But correct, the lower court 

4  did not -- neither lower court accepted this argument 

fully. The Ninth Circuit did agree that all permits 

6  must include compliance monitoring, but it said you need 

7  a little more here. And we think that was improper 

8  because you can't add terms to the permit once it's been 

9  settled. 

And there was an earlier question, Justice 

11  Breyer, about could we sample from an individual 

12  outfall, could we show more? The problem with that is 

13  that it would prove nothing. The Petitioner has said, 

14  just sample from one outfall, one of our outfalls. We 

alleged 140 violations for a dozen different pollutants 

16  over a 5-year period. So sampling from a single outfall 

17  as an evidentiary matter would be utterly meaningless. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Couldn't you get some 

19  expert who understands --

MR. COLANGELO: Well, we did, Your Honor, in

3  MR. COLANGELO: Because, Your Honor, we were 

4  satisfied with the judgment; and that's the rule. A 

respondent who is satisfied does not need to 

6  cross-appeal, unless it is --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't say you need to. 

8  I didn't say you needed to. But I -- I would normally 

9  have done it, just to be sure I had that arrow in my 

quiver and that it would not be argued, as it will be 

11  here, that this would be expanding the judgment below. 

12  MR. COLANGELO: And the reason it would not 

13  be expanding the judgment below is that we are on the 

14  opposite side of what happened in Kent. To rule in our 

favor on this argument would just leave untouched two 

16  claims on which we didn't prevail. 

17  We'd get no further relief on those. It's 

18  like two co-plaintiffs in district court who both lose 

19  identical claims. One appeals, and the other doesn't. 

The one who appeals wins a reversal. That creates an 

21  inconsistency, two similarly situated plaintiffs, one 

22  has a valid claim, one no longer does. But that's the 

23  consequence of our failing to cross-petition. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do we have -- I just 

don't remember now. Do we have a circuit split on thi

1  issue of whether a permit in a situation like this would 

2  impose liability on all permittees? 

3  MR. COLANGELO: No. No. There is no â€“ I 

4  don't know of any other circuit court who has 

addressed -- that has addressed this question. 

6  And let me speak to -- to the issue of 

7  additional monitoring, putting the burden on plaintiffs 

8  to conduct additional monitoring. The problem is it 

9  creates a complicated factual dispute for district 

courts resolve -- to resolve, when that was exactly what 

11  Congress wanted to eliminate. 

12  When Congress adopted this permit program in 

13  the Clean Water Act and then amended it to bring 

14  municipal stormwater discharges under the program, 

Congress said, we do not want district courts to be the 

16  forum for sorting out all of these complicated factual 

17  issues. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. What do you think 

19  of the government's point? They are telling us, just 

write what you usually write, and then you can go make 

21  all your arguments, see what they do. Does that satisfy 

22  you? 

23  MR. COLANGELO: Your Honor, we would be most 

24  satisfied with an affirmance on the grounds we have 

presented. If the Court vacates, we would be satisfied

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if this panel found â€“

surely find for you on this other ground, which --

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MR. COLANGELO: Yes. We expect they would. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which has at least an 

9  inkling of plausibility.

14  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

16  MR. COATES: Thank you, Your Honor. 

17  To the cross-appeal issue, the cases that we 

18  cite talk about the Court's prudential limitation on 

19  deciding questions that are not preserved by 

cross-petition. And I depart from my learned opponent, 

21  Mr. Colangelo, on that point as to what the Court's 

22  cases say. We cite the Northwest Airlines v. County of 

23  Kent case, and that is a case where, in fact, the 

24  respondent was not seeking to change the judgment below. 

They did not cross-petition. They were just trying to

1  keep what they had. 

2  And the Court said we are not going to reach 

3  that issue because, if we buy the fact that there is in 

4  fact no private right of action, the effect of that is 

to essentially change the underlying judgment --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask a quick 

7  question. 

8  MR. COATES: Sure. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Does it satisfy you if we 

just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write, 

11  and then you all can argue what it means below? What 

12  about that? Does that satisfy? Or do you want us to 

13  write something special? 

14  (Laughter.) 

MR. COATES: It -- it's -- it's acceptable 

16  because a reversal is always better than an affirmance. 

17  But talking about what the Court decides and what's left 

18  in the case, I think it is a case where the Court 

19  reviews what the Ninth Circuit actually decided, what is 

actually before it, and what is properly remaining in 

21  the case because we don't believe the cross-appeal issue 

22  is here. 

23  And that leads, I think, to reversing the 

24  Ninth Circuit because the district is entitled to 

summary judgment on these two river claims. And I think

1  that is all that's left in the case. 

2  And I call the Court's attention to another 

3  case we cited on the cross-appeal issue. It's one of 

4  the NLRB cases, the -- the Express Publication case. 

And it makes it very clear there, that the respondent 

6  was just trying to hang on so much of what was good 

7  about the order as he could keep and was not seeking to 

8  change anything. And, again, the Court said no. 

9  It basically undermines the entire basis for 

the --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Did we use our usual 

12  language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court 

13  of appeals considered --

14  MR. COATES: I think, in one of the cases, 

the Court --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- considered the issue we 

17  had refused to consider? 

18  MR. COATES: In one of the cases, the Court 

19  simply affirmed, and so it didn't go anywhere. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

21  MR. COATES: But --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we have two -- I 

23  don't know that we do this all the time. When we expect 

24  them to keep the case and do something different, don't 

we usually vacate and remand, rather than reverse?

1  MR. COATES: Well, I do know that, in the 

2  context of a lot of the Court's opinions, the Court will 

3  specify that judgment be granted in terms of a party. 

4  I know the qualified immunity cases, you 

find someone's entitled to qualified immunity, and it 

6  comes up on a summary judgment, the reversal is -- to 

7  the Ninth Circuit. And I've seen both languages used, 

8  but it's plain, from the text of the opinion, the 

9  judgment is to be entered in favor of that party. 

And, again, I think that's appropriate here. 

11  My opponent suggests and the government suggests, again, 

12  that, let's go back to the Ninth Circuit and let them 

13  consider this monitoring argument. They considered it. 

14  In fact, they even considered the use of contract terms 

that -- that they urged them to consider again. 

16  It's already rejected that claim with 

17  respect to these two rivers that are in front of the 

18  Court. It's rejected it with respect to Malibu Creek 

19  and Santa Clara River, which is not in front of the 

Court. They even accepted it with respect to an entire 

21  different party with County of Los Angeles --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: But they might change their 

23  mind now. They might change their mind. 

24  MR. COATES: It would be a very odd judgment 

because you'd have two claims that are -- continue to be

1  dismissed that are not properly before any court. Those 

2  close -- those are closed. And you have another party 

3  out of the case on the very ground that the Ninth 

4  Circuit rejected in the initial opinion. 

A sort of remand for some consideration of 

6  an issue that's already spoken on just doesn't seem to 

7  make sense and invites the very sort of kind of 

8  jurisdictional confusion that, I think, leads the Court, 

9  for prudential reasons, not to consider these things 

unless there's a cross-petition. 

11  I think that's why this is kind of a great 

12  example of why prudential reasons say you should not 

13  consider it. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand, 

and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't 

16  figure out what sense it makes. I mean, if you're 

17  willing to give up Santa Clara and Malibu, you're --

18  you're safe there, and that's the only thing you've won. 

19  Why does it -- how does that make sense? 

MR. COATES: Well, the Court does it for two 

21  reasons. It does it as a prudential matter because it 

22  does look odd to affirm on -- to make a decision in this 

23  Court on a ground that essentially repudiates the lower 

24  court decision. It does it for prudential reasons. 

And, in fact, the case they cite, LeTulle,

1  which basically says the Court has the jurisdiction to 

2  do that -- when someone abandons the piecemeal claim --

3  is cited only once in this context after that, and 

4  that's in the United States v. ITT Continental Baking 

case, 420 U.S. 223, footnote 2. 

6  And the court gives it a "but-see" for the 

7  proposition that you have the jurisdiction to do it. 

8  But then describes this exact situation and says, for 

9  prudential reasons, we don't do it because it undermines 

our cert jurisdiction, particularly if resolution of 

11  that issue is highly fact-specific -- the one they are 

12  trying to bring up -- and it would really foreclose 

13  having to even decide this cert issue because you 

14  wouldn't get to it.
