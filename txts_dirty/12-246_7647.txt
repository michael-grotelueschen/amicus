3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 12-246, Salinas v. Texas. 

Mr. Fisher. 


6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 


7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


8  MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 


9 and may it please the Court: 


The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a 

11 person's silence during a noncustodial police interview 

12 against him at trial, and nothing about the specific 

13 facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from 

14 applying that rule here. 

To the contrary, the State's closing 

16 argument in this case urging the jury to find 

17 Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, "an innocent person 

18 would have denied law enforcement's accusations," 

19 strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule and, 

indeed, the Fifth Amendment is designed to prohibit. 

21  It evokes an inquisitorial system of 

22 justice. It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto 

23 the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by 

24 conscripting the defendant as a product of his own 

demise.

1  Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 

2 resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't 

3 apply because there was supposedly no compulsion in this 

4 case in the sense that there was no physical or 

psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in 


6 custody. 


7  But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 


8 simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and 


9 the nature of the compulsion. The compulsion that 


Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the 

11 question about ballistics evidence, there was nothing he 

12 could do to avoid supplying the State with incriminating 

13 evidence that it could use against him. 

14  If he answered the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it -- why isn't 

16 it like the -- is it Berghuis case? There was a case of 

17 someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so, 

18 the Court said he was silent. He didn't invoke the 

19 Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented 

on. 

21  MR. FISHER: No, that's not the holding of 

22 the Berghuis case, with all due respect. The Berghuis 

23 case was about whether his subsequent statements could 

24 be used against him. This Court didn't hold that his 

silence that preceded those statements could be used

1 against him, and, indeed, that would be contrary to 

2 Miranda itself in footnote 37, where the Court said, if 

3 somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face 

4 of law enforcement accusations, they may not be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then what's the law? What 

6 is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of 

7 his tax return. The IRS gets it. Later, it turns out 

8 to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he 

9 left this blank. Okay? 

Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right. 

11  MR. FISHER: If the --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, isn't it -- you're 

13 not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell 

14 the government anything and, later on, it turns out to 

be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken 

16 as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment. I mean, do you 

17 want to go that far? 

18  MR. FISHER: No, I don't need to. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you need a 

line. 

21  MR. FISHER: This case is --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Then what is -- then you 

23 need a line. So where is -- there's the tax case; then 

24 we have a case they're selling tickets to the 

policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and 

5

1 the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around 


2 before, and he doesn't answer. Okay? Now, that's 


3 probably not an invocation. 


4  And then we have the clear line, which, in 


custody, and, now, you want to extend that line. And so 

6 what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend 

7 it, what line do I draw? 

8  MR. FISHER: Well, it's sufficient to decide 

9 this case to say that a noncustodial police interview 

during the investigation of a crime, where they're 

11 interviewing somebody about --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: So then --

13  MR. FISHER: -- who is -- who is, as the 

14 State concedes, a suspect in a crime. Now, it may well 

be that Griffin extends a little bit further, and, 

16 remember, the Solicitor General at least agrees that 

17 Griffin applies in a noncustodial setting. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's -- it's 

19 well settled that, when you're -- wherein you're 

examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly 

21 says, I don't want any more questions, that 

22 that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're 

23 examining a witness on the stand. 

24  So, against that background, suppose, in 

this case, the facts were just about the same, and he 

6

Official 

1 said what -- the police said, what would you do if we 

2 matched the shotgun shells? And he said -- he said, 

3 "Well" -- and then he starts to cry. He said one word, 

4 "Well," and he started to cry. Admissible? 

MR. FISHER: I think that would be 


6 admissible, but it would be forbidden for the --


7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because he said, "Well"? 


8  MR. FISHER: Yes. That word would be 


9 admissible if the State had -- had any


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but could the 

11 police officer also testify that and then he started to 

12 cry? 

13  MR. FISHER: Perhaps. But the State -- what 

14 the State would not be able to do would be to argue that 

his silence and refusal to answer the question 

16 demonstrated his guilt. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or the prosecution could 

18 say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he 

19 never told us anything else. That -- that final 

sentence that I used is impermissible? 

21  MR. FISHER: I think that may well cross the 

22 line. You have the exact issue that arises already in 

23 custodial settings, where, under Doyle and footnote 37 

24 of Miranda, you've held that silence can't be used 

against a criminal defendant.

1  So, Justice Kennedy, you're right, that 

2 questions will arise in two ways: One is whether words 

3 that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to 

4 answer the question, and then there is a second question 

about physical demeanor evidence. 

6  The law is already sorted out on this in the 

7 lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test. 

8 The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the 

9 reason why this Court hasn't seen a case or -- itself, 

seen a case like that is because, once the rule is 

11 established that the prosecution can't use silence 

12 against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try 

13 to introduce that evidence for some, supposedly, 

14 different purpose. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, but then --

16 do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying 

17 demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible 

18 to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked 

19 down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he 

was shuffling his feet. 

21  MR. FISHER: Insofar as demeanor evidence 

22 that the State offers has communicative value and the 

23 State argues that it has communicative value, 

24 independent of, simply, what the defendant looked like 

when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be 

8

1 able to introduce that evidence. 


2  Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up 


3 telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard 


4 cases in this respect because, once the temptation --


once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the 

6 prosecution, I think, has little motivation to try to 

7 walk that line. 

8  And, indeed, I think it would be appropriate 

9 in a case, if the prosecution said, look, the fact that 

the defendant started crying, we think, is relevant for 

11 some reason independent of what he -- of failing to 

12 answer the question. The jury could be instructed, as 

13 they are in Griffin -- Griffin settings already, that 

14 you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer 

the question against him, but --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, may -- I have 

17 a number of problems. The first is your rule would be 

18 seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights 

19 than those defendants in custody because you're arguing 

that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression, 

21 other than silence, would be needed to show the 

22 invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. 

23  MR. FISHER: No. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or are you trying to 

equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 noncustodial, with respect to invocation? 

2  MR. FISHER: No. And I -- and this is where 

3 Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's 

4 very important for me to be clear on this. 

A person in a noncustodial setting still has 

6 fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting. What 

7 the Court held in Berghuis is that, if the defendant 

8 wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda 

9 to cut off police questioning -- those are the words 

this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in 

11 some manner during the interrogation. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem -- I have an 

13 easier problem understanding this argument with 

14 respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with 

respect to the situation in which someone is approached 

16 by the police and said, come in and talk to us. I have 

17 a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk 

18 to them could be held against them. There, I understand 

19 it. 

But, here, your defendant went in and 

21 talked. So, once he chose to do that, why does he get 

22 more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 

23 2-and-a-half hours? The Court wasn't willing to find 

24 that that was an invocation of the privilege against 

self-incrimination. Why would it find the refusal to 

10

20

25

Official 

1 ask one -- answer one question indicative of the 


2 privilege against silence -- or the privilege for 


3 silence? 


4  MR. FISHER: Let me -- if I may, let me 


focus on the Berghuis question. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know --

7  MR. FISHER: And then turn to the selective 

8 silence point. The reason why he doesn't have --

9 Mr. Salinas doesn't have the right that Mr. Berghuis had 

to cut off questioning. That's the right that has to be 

11 expressly invoked, and it, indeed, can only be 

12 effectuated in this setting. 

13  There was no issue in Berghuis, I don't 

14 think, that his silence could be used against him. The 

State never argued in the Berghuis case that, because he 

16 failed to answer for 2 hours, that shows he's guilty. 

17 What the State argued in Berghuis was the fact that he 

18 later confessed is what shows that he is guilty. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- I don't want -- are 

you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required, 

21 you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment? 

22  MR. FISHER: No. You can. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean -- that's --

24 that's how I understood that. 

MR. FISHER: You can. There's two 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 different rights --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know you're not arguing 

3 that, but that's why I'm --

4  MR. FISHER: Let me separate two rights. 

One is the prophylactic right under Miranda to have 

6 police cease asking you questions. That's one right, 

7 and that right has to be expressly invoked in some 

8 manner during the interrogation, after you've been 

9 warned, in order to effectuate it. 

There is a separate right, which is the 

11 genuine Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. And 

12 this Court said, in Miranda itself and it's never 

13 questioned since, that that right doesn't have to be 

14 expressly invoked. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it can be 

16 invoked, and that might make a big difference. In 

17 your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most 

18 citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right. 

19  MR. FISHER: Right. So, I think, Justice 

Kennedy --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so if there's -- if 

22 questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking 

23 my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in 

24 custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply. 

MR. FISHER: Right. 

12

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your client didn't do 

2 that here. 

3  MR. FISHER: He didn't. And so the 

4 question -- I think, unless the Court's prepared to hold 

that even an expressed invocation could be used against 

6 him, then it reduces to the question you framed, Justice 

7 Kennedy. And so ask yourself whether there's any good 

8 reason to require an express invocation in that setting. 

9  Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke 

his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, 

11 at trial, in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to 

12 be excluded. So the question is whether there's a 

13 reason to ask him to do it sooner. And our argument is 

14 it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be 

unadministrable. So let me walk through those, if I 

16 can. 

17  It's unnecessary because all the cases the 

18 Solicitor General cites for an express invocation 

19 principle involve a scenario where the government has no 

good reason to know that it's seeking incriminatory 

21 information. 

22  And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting 

23 principle that you were searching for in the tax cases 

24 and the like. If the government doesn't know or have 

good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 likely to be exercising his right, then the government 

2 needs to be put on notice because the government may --

3 may well challenge that, may well go seek a court order. 

4 It may well decide to grant immunity. It may do a number 

of things. 

6  But, here, the government would do 

7 absolutely nothing different. Police would have done 

8 absolutely nothing different. Indeed, look at the 

9 record in this case. What the Solicitor General says is 

that Mr. Salinas should have said, "I refuse to answer 

11 that question," and, if he had said that, everything 

12 would be different. 

13  But look at what the State argued at trial 

14 and what the officer testified. The officer testified, 

when we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer. 

16 The prosecution argued to the jury, he refused to answer 

17 that question. So there is no ambiguity in the setting, 

18 whether he was remaining silent. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, yes, there's no doubt 

he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was 

21 trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right. 

22  Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the 

23 situation, where either the individual expressly raises 

24 his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from 

the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right, 

14

1 would that be a sensible rule? 

2  And, if so, how would your case stack up? 

3  MR. FISHER: Yeah. I think, as long as the 

4 latter part of that test, Justice Breyer -- can be 

satisfied by exercising the right, that is remaining 

6 silent --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: It depends on the 

8 circumstance. 

9  MR. FISHER: -- in a setting in which -- in 

a setting in which the government has every good reason 

11 to know that the person is most likely to be relying on 

12 the Fifth Amendment. And, here, where they are 

13 investigating a murder and bringing in somebody as a 

14 suspect and asking him, basically, did you commit the 

crime, I think it's a fair assumption -- at least absent 

16 any clarification by the police -- remember, when he was 

17 silent, the police would have had every right to say, 

18 Mr. Salinas, why aren't you answering the question? 

19  And so the police could clarify. But, 

absent any clarification from either the police or the 

21 suspect, the more likely than not scenario -- and that's 

22 the test the Solicitor General agrees should be used --

23 the more likely than not conclusion there is that he is 

24 exercising the right. Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would you deal with 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1 another common situation where a defendant meets up with 

2 the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the 

3 story. And the question is asked at trial, you never 

4 volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they 

questioned you. 

6  Would that be silence, to you? Would that 

7 be an invocation of his right not to incriminate 

8 himself? Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred 

9 from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to 

say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story. 

11  MR. FISHER: No, Justice Sotomayor, for two 

12 reasons: One is, if I understood your hypothetical, it 

13 sounded like the defendant may have been on the stand, 

14 and that would be an impeachment scenario that's 

entirely different. But even --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, sometimes, they 

17 come back and later do a different confession. 

18  MR. FISHER: Right. So but -- but even if 

19 that were the case, then that would be basically using 

his statement against him. And so a material omission 

21 from a statement is not the same as silence. Here, 

22 Mr. Salinas was silent. 

23  Now, it's also not just that there's no good 

24 reason to require some sort of magic words to be spoken 

by the suspect, but it's unfair. Remember, the States 

16

Official 

1 tell you, in their amicus brief, that, if you affirm in 

2 this case and adopt the rule they're asking you for, 

3 police officers are going to tell people in its custody, 

4 which would be nothing more than an accurate statement 

of the law, sir, if you are silent in response to any of 

6 our questions, the prosecution is going to argue that 

7 that -- that shows that you're guilty. 

8  They're also going to have every good reason 

9 to bring people in. I think this goes a little bit to 

Justice Kennedy's question and -- and perhaps just yours 

11 as well, the fact that Mr. Salinas did agree to commence 

12 this interview. Remember, he agreed --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he's not in 

14 custody. So let's say he's answering the questions. 

All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he 

16 says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and 

17 going to go home. Is that an invocation of the Fifth 

18 Amendment right? 

19  MR. FISHER: I think you'd have to ask that 

to the Solicitor General. I don't -- I'm not the one 

21 requiring an invocation. And that is part of the 

22 administrability problem that the rule raises. I have 

23 no idea of all the permutations, one of which you've 

24 raised --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that

1 something --


2  MR. FISHER: -- but you can imagine many 


3 more. 


4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that something 


that could be used against him at trial? 

6  MR. FISHER: It can be introduced. It's 

7 hard to understand how that is probative, the fact that 

8 he said, I have to leave now, it's time to go. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's probative 

if that he says that -- he's answering all the 

11 questions, they're fine. All of a sudden, they say, 

12 well, is your shotgun going to match the shell? 

13  MR. FISHER: Yeah. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then he goes, gosh, 

it's late, I'm going to go home. That seems as --

16  (Laughter.) 

17  MR. FISHER: Well --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems as 

19 probative as the silence. 

MR. FISHER: Well -- and so -- what the 

21 State cannot do is what it did in this case and sort of 

22 transform that into he refused to answer, and, 

23 therefore, it shows he's guilty. 

24  And, if I could go back to the part of the 

unfairness and the difficulty here, it's not -- it's

1 just that -- yes, Mr. Salinas did come to the police 

2 station, but remember why he came to the police station, 

3 because they said, we want to bring you in to clear you 

4 as a suspect, to get elimination prints. 

So he was effectively told to come in, so 


6 that we can clear you as a suspect, asked perfectly 


7 innocuous questions at the beginning of the interview, 


8 and then everything shifted on a dime to this one 


9 "gotcha" question. 


And I think it's perfectly reasonable and 

11 customary in out-of-court settings, where the defendant 

12 isn't on the stand and so telling some story, now, 

13 trying to backtrack it, but out of court, to be able to 

14 selectively exercise your right to silence, when you 

feel, now, law enforcement is turning against me. 

16  And, remember -- this is the other part 

17 about, Justice Kennedy, your question. Of course, 

18 people know they have a right to remain silent, so why 

19 not -- why not ask them to invoke it? 

Remember, people in this setting generally 

21 don't have lawyers. They don't have a right to lawyers. 

22 What does the layperson know? The layperson knows, I 

23 have a right to remain silent. That's what the 

24 layperson knows. The layperson doesn't know I have to 

say some sort of magic words.

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Would you draw a distinction 

4 between Mr. Salinas's situation and someone who's 

questioned in the home -- in the person's home or on the 

6 street? 

7  MR. FISHER: No, I don't think there is a 

8 relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an 

9 investigatory interview -- and this Court has said, time 

and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or 

11 plenty or Royer, that the police can try to initiate 

12 consensual encounters. And the Court has said, time and 

13 again, that people don't have to participate in them, and 

14 they can cut them off at any time. 

And it would be odd --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: And what if -- what if the 

17 person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the 

18 police, but called up the police and said they want --

19 wants to talk to them for some purpose. You 

wouldn't draw a distinction between that situation?

2  JUSTICE ALITO: He wants to talk to them, 

3 and then, in the course of this conversation, the same 

4 thing happens that happened here. 

MR. FISHER: I think that might, depending 

6 on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of 

7 a difficult -- different case. But, if the person said, 

8 I want to talk to you about criminal activity, started 

9 giving statements about a -- about a past crime, so it 

was an investigatory interview, I think it may well 

11 apply. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're -- you're giving us 

13 Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area. 

14 That -- that's what you're arguing. You want a gray 

area opinion to be written? 

16  MR. FISHER: No, I don't want a gray area 

17 opinion. Remember, Justice Kennedy, at least the 

18 Solicitor General -- and I'll let the State speak for 

19 itself -- but the Solicitor General agrees that Griffin 

rule applies in a noncustodial setting. 

21  I -- I totally understand there's a bright 

22 line between custody and noncustody, and so a custodial 

23 suspect is in a different situation than a noncustodial 

24 suspect. 

But all I'm saying is, again, in agreement

1 with the Solicitor General, whereas all we disagree on 

2 is whether the magic words need to be spoken, that a 

3 person who is at least in a police investigatory 

4 setting, and so the police would reasonably expect that 

a failure to seek or answer your question was relying 

6 on a Fifth Amendment --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm assuming, now 

8 that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue 

9 that, even in a custodial setting, a prosecutor couldn't 

say, I asked him, did he shoot his wife, and the 

11 prosecutor can't argue that, because he refused to 

12 answer, that makes him guilty. 

13  MR. FISHER: That's precisely what the Court 

14 said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower 

courts have depended on for a generation now, and I 

16 don't think my opponents are even arguing to the 

17 contrary. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, in fact, at most 

19 trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence 

is not the unanswered question. It's the question plus 

21 the answer. 

22  MR. FISHER: Right. Right. Fair enough. I 

23 think that's perfectly well-established law. And so the

2 Berghuis raises, but, for purposes of the Griffin rule, 

3 is there any reason to distinguish between a custodial 

4 and a noncustodial setting? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. The answer 

6 is going to be yes because we're going to hear it in 

7 one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori 

8 for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have 

9 to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth 

Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently 

11 coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the 

12 argument. 

13  MR. FISHER: No, but -- but --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: You're not in an inherently 

coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation, 

16 you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations, 

17 you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth 

18 Amendment --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. 

3  MR. FISHER: If Mr. Salinas had been in a --

4 if everything about the case was identical, but he'd 

been in custody, there would be no argument that his 


6 silence could be used against him. 


7  JUSTICE BREYER: Right. And that's saying 


8 because, there, we have a line. It's called the 


9 in-custody line. Once you get outside of custody --


MR. FISHER: But it's not because of the 

11 physical or inherent pressures of custody because what 

12 the Court has said, time and again, is that, after 

13 somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a 

14 free and deliberate choice whether to talk. And so --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't want to make 

16 the government's argument for them. They'll make it 

17 very well. 

18  MR. FISHER: Well, no, but I do want -- I do 

19 want to make sure that the Court understands the 

critical difference between the express invocation 

21 requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and 

22 what I'm asking for today. 

23  And the express invocation requirement in 

24 Berghuis is the -- is -- is to administer the Miranda 

prophylactic rule, that the police have to stop asking

1 somebody questions when they invoke their rights, the 


2 rights they've just been advised of, remember. 


3  It didn't hold in Berghuis and it -- and 


4 it's never held that, if somebody is Mirandized -- and 


let's say Mr. Berghuis was Mirandized and just remained 

6 silent for two hours, and then the police said to 

7 themselves, oh, this guy is never going to talk, we end 

8 the interview, there would have been no argument the 

9 State could have made in that case, that his silence 

could be used against him. 

11  And so I understand that -- that -- you 

12 know, I'm -- that custody is different, but, in terms of 

13 the express invocation requirement, there's no express 

14 invocation requirement in custody, and there's no reason 

for it here. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: So I think the argument 

17 will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if, 

18 after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an 

19 hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm --

I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when 

21 he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of 

22 time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that 

23 long period of behavior is insufficient without the 

24 express statement to show that he wanted to remain 

silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be

2 see, it's argument by analogy, I think --

3  MR. FISHER: I understand, but his silence 

4 wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his 

state -- his later statements were. And so, yes, you 


6 could have a scenario --


7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't the -- isn't the 


8 point, Mr. Fisher --


9  MR. FISHER: Pardon? 


JUSTICE KAGAN: The question is: What is it 

11 insufficient for? In Berghuis, it was insufficient for 

12 the purpose of cutting off police questions. 

13  MR. FISHER: Exactly. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: That's not the case here. 

The question here is whether it's sufficient or 

16 insufficient for the purpose of allowing his -- his 

17 silence to be used against him at trial. 

18  MR. FISHER: Precisely. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: That's an entirely different 

question, isn't it? 

21  MR. FISHER: That's exactly my point. And 

22 remember, again, the layperson in this setting who 

23 knows -- if there's one thing the layperson knows and 

24 most every American knows, is that they have a right to 

remain silent. So somebody nervous in this setting,

1 without a lawyer, the one sanctuary they have is simply 

2 not to talk. 

3  If you issue an opinion that says, as the 

4 Solicitor General would like, you have to pronounce some 

sort of magic words, it's terribly unfair and terribly 


6 misleading and, again, for no good reason. And it 


7 raises all kinds of administrability problems. The 


8 Court is going to have an absolute, I think, flood of 


9 cases of all the permutations of somebody under 


different kind of police warnings or the other that may 

11 be given ahead of time and different kind of verbal 

12 formulations. 

13  Maybe he says, I'd like to talk about 

14 something else. Maybe he says, as the Chief Justice 

explained, I'm going to leave now. Maybe he actually 

16 just doesn't show up for the interview. There is 

17 innumerable permutations. The easy rule --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Unless you're going to argue 

19 that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented 

on in any noncustodial situation -- and I didn't think 

21 you were willing to go that far when I was questioning 

22 you previously -- you're going to have the same kind of 

23 line-drawing questions, aren't you?

2 under suspicion? What was the purpose of the -- of the 

3 questioning? 

4  MR. FISHER: So as to where -- as to where 

you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to 

6 where an express invocation before trial would be 

7 required, you are going to have to draw a line. I think 

8 it's very easy to draw the line and just say a police 

9 investigatory interview because that's the setting where 

the police have every reason to believe that silence is 

11 an exercise of the right. 

12  All the other settings, whether they be tax 

13 settings, whether they be immigration cases, all the 

14 totally disparate settings the Solicitor General cites 

cases involving, it's perfectly reasonable to require an 

16 advance invocation there. 

17  But, remember, the Court said in Chavez that 

18 the Fifth Amendment is a trial right, and so invoking it 

19 at trial is perfectly timely in the ordinary setting. 

The only question is whether you should have some sort 

21 of special requirement for special reason. We think 

22 there is no good reason, and it would be very unfair. 

23  I'd like to --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess, as I understand

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN K. CURRY 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. CURRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  Absent an invocation, a defendant's failure 

8 to answer a question during a noncustodial, voluntary 

9 interview should not be protected by the Fifth 

Amendment. It should be --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why, counsel? I 

12 mean, really, what you're saying is, merely because I 

13 asked you the question and you choose not to answer, it 

14 makes you guilty. 

MR. CURRY: Well --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It -- no problem. Here, 

17 you're asking about the crime of investigation. But you 

18 could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another 

19 street, and, if he had remained silent, you would be 

arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that 

21 at trial. 

22  And you would be arguing it would be 

23 sufficient to convict him, that you merely asked the 

24 question and he remained silent about it shows his 

guilt.

1  MR. CURRY: Yeah, I don't know that that 

2 would be sufficient to convict him. And that -- that 

3 hypothetical might suggest that the probative value of 

4 that particular failure to answer a question was less --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a little scary to 


6 me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt. 


7  MR. CURRY: Well --


8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is not arguing that 


9 the physical response is not admissible. He is just 


arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure 

11 to answer it, you can't argue, as a prosecutor, that 

12 that shows someone is guilty. 

13  MR. CURRY: I think one of the things we are 

14 asking the Court to do, Justice Sotomayor, is to 

recognize that silence, certainly, as occurred in this 

16 case, doesn't always occur in a vacuum. And the 

17 defendant's failure to answer this question, accompanied 

18 by things that he did, along with or contemporaneously 

19 with -- you know, the shuffling of the feet, the biting 

of the bottom lip -- revealed a guilty conscience on his 

21 part. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would be up to the 

23 jury, wouldn't it? The jury might well agree with 

24 Justice Sotomayor, that it doesn't prove anything that 

he answered a question, right?

3 can ask the jury to consider that. 

4  MR. CURRY: Correct. And I think that's --

I think that's the import of our argument. And we've 

6 referenced this Court's language in Baxter, to that 

7 extent, that a jury can give what weight they wish to 

8 give it, but the --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your -- my hypothetical 

that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say, 

11 come in for questioning, and you ignore them, is that an 

12 invocation of the right to silence or not? 

13  MR. CURRY: I don't know that that's an 

14 invocation, Your Honor, but I don't know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why -- why could you 

16 argue that that's --

17  MR. CURRY: Number one, I don't think a 

18 prosecutor ever would argue that because that's 

19 ambiguous and not probative, and I think -- not 

probative for someone just to not come in when police 

21 offer them a chance to come in. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They -- then they're 

23 arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that 

24 situation. 

MR. CURRY: Right. The legal theory of 

31

1 guilt in that situation would be lessened than it is in 

2 this case because there is no -- there is nothing to 

3 suggest that that defendant was guilty, necessarily, 

4 because he decided not to show up to the police. 

But, here, in this situation, the 

6 defendant's failure to answer the question, accompanied 

7 by the other things that he did, did reveal a guilty 

8 conscience on his part. And it was nothing to reflect 

9 that he was trying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So why is 

11 it -- would it be admissible that someone decides --

12 someone comes in, and they say -- police say to him or 

13 her, we are investigating this crime, help us. They 

14 start asking questions, and it's clear from the first 

question -- there is a waiver of Miranda, and, from the 

16 first question, the first question is, did you kill this 

17 person? 

18  The guy remains silent. They ask a whole 

19 bunch of other questions, and he remains silent. Had --

has he invoked his right? 

21  MR. CURRY: I don't believe he has, Your 

22 Honor. I mean, if he -- you said he was provided 

23 Miranda rights, so maybe they feel he is in custody or 

24 not, but --

1 into the jury and say, he waived his Miranda rights, and 


2 he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions? 


3  MR. CURRY: He is guilty if he revealed a 


4 guilty conscience, Your Honor. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: He wouldn't say that. He 


6 would say one of the indications of his guilt is that he 


7 refused to answer the question. No prosecutor would 


8 argue that, that alone, would support a conviction, 


9 right? 


MR. CURRY: Correct, Your Honor. And that's 

11 not what we're -- that's not what we are asking the 

12 Court to do here. We're not asking the Court to say 

13 that, every time silence occurs, that's necessarily 

14 going to be probative, and every time silence occurs, 

that's necessarily going to be something that we 

16 utilize. 

17  We're merely saying that, in this particular 

18 situation, the defendant needs to tell something to the 

19 police in order to reveal that he is relying on a 

constitutional right and not merely having --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Curry -- I'm sorry.

23 "absent an invocation."

2 brief goes further. So are you, now, saying that the

4  MR. CURRY: I believe that has been our 

position, Your Honor. I believe -- we do have some 


6 alternative argues, as well, based upon this Court's 


7 jurisprudence. But I think the government and we both 


8 agree that the defendant in this particular situation 


9 would need to invoke. 


And that is the basis upon which we proceed. 

11 And we are not proceeding just upon Berghuis v. 

12 Thompkins. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: And so you would agree with 

14 the government that, if he had invoked, that the Fifth 

Amendment right would come into play? 

16  MR. CURRY: We would not attempt to -- we 

17 would not attempt to introduce anything, for example "I 

18 plead the Fifth," "I don't want to talk any more," 

19 something like that, No, we would not be introducing 

that. I do believe that would be a -- you know, a rule--

21 violation of the rule --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you -- why would 

6 you draw that -- that line? 

7  MR. CURRY: I think, Your Honor, I would not 

8 want to -- I would not want to introduce a statement 

9 that a defendant was relying on a constitutional right 

by saying, "I don't want to talk any more," as opposed 

11 to the mere silence, which might be probative, in 

12 conjunction with other evidence. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the mere silence 

14 suggest, "I don't want to talk anymore"? 

MR. CURRY: It might, but it also might 

16 suggest that he's having difficulty coming up with an 

17 exculpatory response. It might suggest that he can't 

18 think of a good answer. It might suggest that he is 

19 worried about the question and he is thinking more about 

how worried he is about the question than how he wants 

21 to respond to it. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Particularly since 

23 he did want to talk some more, right?

1 continuing to provide exculpatory responses. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't the most 

3 logical inference from the silence not that he isn't 

4 quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but 

that it would incriminate him if he answered? 

6  MR. CURRY: Yes, Your Honor. That may be --

7 that may be a permissible inference, but I do not 

8 believe that that necessarily means that he was invoking 

9 his -- his Fifth Amendment right because he did continue 

to talk. He already knew what the police were 

11 investigating. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could -- he could 

13 invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of 

14 questions and not another, and what's disturbing me 

about your position, if it's -- if you have -- someone 

16 being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, "I plead the 

17 Fifth." And somebody who is not that smart is just 

18 silent. To make a difference between those two people 

19 on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond 

is troublesome. 

21  MR. CURRY: Your Honor, I think that would 

22 be consistent with this Court's jurisprudence to -- to 

23 allow the use of evidence, if there was no invocation 

24 involved. In Jenkins v. Anderson, Justice Stevens 

recognized the importance of an invocation, even in --

1 even in that type of situation. 


2  This Court -- it's not just Berghuis v. 


3 Thompkins that we're relying upon, where the Court has 


4 recognized the necessity of an invocation. Garner v. 


United States says the same thing, that -- that an 

6 invocation is necessary for Fifth Amendment rights. 

7  And I know that we don't have a case that is 

8 squarely on -- on four with this one. But all the 

9 defendant would have to say is, I don't want to talk 

anymore, or I don't want to answer that question, and 

11 then we would be in a completely different posture at 

12 this point. 

13  But, here, the -- the defendant failed to 

14 answer a question and did other things that revealed a 

guilty conscience on his part. And that is precisely 

16 the type of evidence that we believe that we can 

17 introduce. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Curry, in a case 

19 like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the 

defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone 

21 through the entire interview and, really, never said a 

22 word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but 

23 he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not 

24 go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him 

questions, and he didn't talk.

2 is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off 

3 limits as well? If there's no invocation necessary 

4 there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was 

saying, why should there be an invocation requirement 


6 here? 


7  MR. CURRY: Well, number one, because the 


8 hypotheticals are different. In -- in our particular 


9 situation, the defendant did answer questions and only 


did -- you know, fail to answer one particular question. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. I -- I understand 

12 that, in your case, there happens to be a kind of 

13 selective answering sort of question, but let's say --

14 let's take that out of the picture, all right? And just 

say -- you know, he just didn't want to answer 

16 questions, all right? So then the question is, why 

17 would that case be any different from the case that I 

18 posited? 

19  MR. CURRY: Okay. In -- in Berghuis v. 

Thompkins, this Court looked at the ambiguous nature of 

21 whether or not the invocation had occurred. If, in your 

22 hypothetical, the defendant failed to answer any 

23 questions whatsoever --

4 situation, the defendant can't be said to have been 


doing that. He can't be said to have been exercising 


6 the right because he failed to answer a question, but 


7 answered several other questions. 


8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So you're pinning 


9 your argument really, on the fact that he did a lot of 


answering. 

11  MR. CURRY: That's one of the reasons, Your 

12 Honor. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: On this -- on this, you 

14 know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument. 

MR. CURRY: Well, we're saying that you 

16 cannot infer an assertion of a Fifth Amendment right 

17 based upon this. We cannot infer that he was 

18 necessarily asserting his Fifth Amendment right, whether 

19 to cut off questioning or stop talking altogether, 

or -- you know --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: So would it be fair to say 

22 that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep 

23 talking and talking and talking and -- and, at that 

24 point, you have to invoke? If -- if you've been doing a 

lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent,

1 at that point, you have to invoke. But that's not to 

2 say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial 

3 encounter. Is that your argument? 

4  MR. CURRY: No. I think you need to invoke 

in every -- every noncustodial encounter if -- if you do 

6 not want the things that you say to be utilized against 

7 you. If you -- if you want to -- you know, if you want 

8 to be prevented from that evidence being utilized, you 

9 have to say, I don't want to talk anymore, or I plead 

the Fifth, or whatever the words --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: But I thought you said he 

12 didn't have to do that, if he didn't answer any 

13 questions, didn't you? Isn't that what you said? 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: You took the words out of my 

mouth. 

16  MR. CURRY: No, no. If he didn't answer any 

17 questions, then -- then it would be drawn closer 

18 to -- to Berghuis v. Thompkins, in which this --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but, in Berghuis, we 

found no implication. 

21  MR. CURRY: Correct. Correct. But if --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a few, as I recall. 

4  MR. CURRY: Correct. He --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Curry, Berghuis is 

6 different for a different reason. Berghuis is different 

7 because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to 

8 do to make the police go away. Here, the police were 

9 not going away. There was no -- there's no question of 

that. The -- the question is what do you have to do in 

11 order to bar the prosecutor from introducing your 

12 silence at trial. 

13  So that's a really different question, isn't 

14 it? 

MR. CURRY: Well, it is a different 

16 question, but, here, I think the police were, 

17 quote-unquote, "going away." I mean, they -- they 

18 finished their questioning at some point. And --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Exactly. That's why 

Berghuis is irrelevant here because Berghuis said at a 

21 certain point -- you know, you need to invoke in order 

22 to stop questioning. But -- but that's not what's at 

23 issue here. 

24  MR. CURRY: But this Court's case law still 

requires an invocation. And the rule we're asking this

3  JUSTICE BREYER: What is that? That is what 

4 I'm -- I'm uncertain about this. And they cite page 

468, note 37, of Miranda. 

6  All right. What is the law, in your opinion 

7 now, in respect to -- and what case would support this? 

8 A defendant comes in, he is warned and given his Miranda 

9 rights. He says, fine, and then he proceeds to answer a 

whole bunch of questions. 

11  Then they ask question number 432. He says 

12 nothing. You then go on to 433, 434, et cetera, and he 

13 answers them all. Okay? At the trial, the lawyer --

14 the prosecutor wants to comment on the fact that, in the 

face of that single question -- though answering many, 

16 many more -- he remained silent. 

17  Does Griffin say he can -- the prosecutor 

18 can make that comment, yes or no? And I'd appreciate 

19 the government answering this question, too, because 

they're -- if they -- are they speaking here? Or are 

21 you doing the whole argument? 

22  MR. CURRY: No, the government is also

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Because I -- well, now,

4 the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note 

37 of Miranda. Okay. I just read it. 

6  MR. CURRY: Correct. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: And I -- may be ambiguous 

8 on the point. It says you have the right to maintain 

9 immunity in the face of an accusation. 

MR. CURRY: Right. I think the reliance of 

11 on the footnote is -- is --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: No, fine. But what's your 

13 opinion? I mean, what is the law in respect to that 

14 single point? And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to 

know your opinion on that. 

16  MR. CURRY: Your Honor, I do not believe 

17 that this Court has extended Griffin to this particular 

18 type of fact situation, and Griffin wouldn't apply to 

19 that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority, or 

21 is it just your opinion that we have to go on? 

22  MR. CURRY: Well, I believe this Court would 

23 have had the opportunity to extend Griffin, for example, 

24 Doyle v. Ohio. The Court did not do that. This Court had 

the -- the opportunity to extend Griffin in Fletcher v.

1 Weir and did not do that. 

2  So I do not believe this Court has 

3 necessarily -- you know, sought to always attempt to 

4 extend Griffin in that situation. Now, we -- I see some 

ambiguity in the standing mute phrase from footnote 37. 

6 Does that mean not talking at all? Does that mean not 

7 answering one particular question? 

8  In your hypothetical, if it was as probative 

9 as it was in our case -- you know, that might be 

something the prosecution would want to use without 

11 violating the Fifth Amendment right because there's no 

12 clear indication that the defendant did, in fact, rely 

13 upon his Fifth Amendment right. 

14  Now, I don't want to -- you know, misread 

footnote 37, but that's how we read footnote 37 because 

16 in the absence of -- there's many, many cases cited 

17 there, and it's not clear that it's attempted to apply 

18 an -- an extension of Griffin in that situation. 

19  The rule we're -- we're offering here would 

not -- would not change the law with regard to how it 

21 exists in much of the Federal Circuits. In much of the 

22 Federal Circuits, these defendants where -- where the 

23 courts have held that we cannot utilize this evidence, 

24 those defendants have, in fact, done something to 

invoke. 

44

Official 

1  So I think the -- the rule that we're asking 

2 the Court to adopt would allow for these -- that case 

3 law to stand; i.e., if a defendant says, I don't want to 

4 talk anymore, I plead the Fifth -- you know, we're not 

asking this Court to issue a rule that says that we can 

6 introduce that. 

7  All we're asking this Court to -- to 

8 introduce is consistent with this Court's case law that 

9 would require an invocation -- or some invocation that 

the Fifth Amendment right was being relied upon and not 

11 just a difficulty with the question or I can't think up 

12 an exculpatory answer for that particular question, so I 

13 don't know what to say. 

14  I mean, there, the defendant is not relying 

upon a constitutional right. And I think we're asking 

16 this Court to -- to look at whether an inference has to 

17 be made that the Fifth Amendment right is being done, or 

18 perhaps another inference can be -- can be provided. 

19 And Baxter v. Palmigiano allows for acquiescence -- you 

know, to -- to be something that we can utilize against 

21 a defendant. 

22  Here, the jury --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does the 

24 compulsion line come in? Your adversary points out 

that, under this scenario, the police can ask you

3 trial, that police will actually to that, that they'll 

4 actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the 

story -- you know, either answer or it'll be used 


6 against you. 


7  MR. CURRY: I could perceive then, Your 


8 Honor, the -- the trial court upholding a claim by the 


9 defendant that he was coerced at that point, that, at 


that point, the officer --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't you say 

12 that a call from a police officer to someone who says, 

13 come in and talk, that that can't be used against them 

14 at trial as -- you gave me a different answer. You said 

it wasn't probative, but you didn't say Griffin would 

16 protect that. 

17  MR. CURRY: No, if -- no, if -- I don't know 

18 that I would say Griffin is protecting it, but what I 

19 would say is this Court's penalty jurisprudence would 

say that, when a penalty flows directly from something 

21 the defendant is -- you know, either saying or not 

22 saying -- you know, that could be a problem. 

23  So when an officer says -- you know, I'm 

24 going to hold -- hold against you your failure to answer 

a question -- you know, that can be something where the

Official 

1 court might utilize as -- as -- for some sort of 

2 penalties flown. 

3  Justice -- Justice Stevens said, in his 

4 dissenting opinion, in McKune v. Lile, that there is an 

appreciable difference between some sort of sanction --

6 official sanction being placed upon a -- you know, of 

7 essentially disobeying of an order, as opposed to a 

8 voluntary choice arising from -- from just a possible 

9 adverse consequence. 

And, here, I think, the fact situation that 

11 confronts this Court in this case is just the risk of an 

12 adverse consequence and not something that necessarily 

13 is going to occur. 

14  However, if an officer says, I'm necessarily 

going to use this against you, the adverse consequence 

16 may become more -- more tangible at that point. That 

17 isn't the facts of this particular case. 

18  I also want to disagree with Mr. Fisher with 

19 regard to his suggestion that the police essentially 

manipulated this. If you look on the Joint Appendix, 

21 page 14, lines 9 and 10, the officer clearly says that 

22 he wants Mr. Salinas to come down to the police station 

23 and talk, as well as do elimination fingerprints. 

24  The officer had already been questioned. 

These people knew we were investigating a double murder.

were -- you know, looking for him as a possible suspect 

6 at that point when they asked a ballistics question.

9  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

11  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

12  MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

13 please the Court: 

14  In Minnesota v. Murphy, this Court applied 

the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is 

16 not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in 

17 order to claim its protection to a noncustodial 

18 interview in which the -- the probation officer doing 

19 the questioning was aware that the questions that she 

asked could be incriminating. 

21  The Court there held that because the 

22 suspect had not invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his 

23 statements could be used against him as evidence at 

24 trial. A suspect's silence should similarly be 

admissible against him when he fails to expressly invoke 

48
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 the privilege. Requiring invocation --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is such a radical 

3 position, that silence is an admission of guilt. That's 

4 really what the argument is. I certainly understand 

that speaking can implicate you, and, if you choose to 

6 speak, clearly, whatever you say can be used against 

7 you, unless you're in custody and unless you've invoked 

8 the right before. 

9  But this is radically different. We are --

we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and 

11 omission are the same, but statements are different than 

12 silence because, then, you're making the person who is 

13 asking this question your -- your admission. You are 

14 saying you're adopting their statement as true. 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I think the Court has 

16 repeatedly recognized that, when a citizen is 

17 voluntarily interacting with the police and there --

18 there is no coercion because it's not a custodial 

19 situation, we expect that person to be treated as fully 

capable of deciding whether or not to assert his rights. 

21  This is what the Court said in United States 

22 v. Drayton in an analogous context, which is whether 

23 someone has voluntarily consented to a search. The 

24 person, even if he is not told that -- that he can 

refuse to -- to consent, we still assume that he knew 

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that he could refuse to consent, and, therefore, it was 

2 a voluntary choice. 

3  And I think you can draw the same inference 

4 here, that, when someone -- we -- I think we all agree 

that most people know -- people know what their Fifth 

6 Amendment rights are, and, therefore, they can assert 

7 them when they don't face any coercive pressure. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Anders --

9  MS. ANDERS: And so when the person does not 

do that --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry. We don't require 

12 invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in 

13 a custodial setting. And you might think, well, 

14 custodial, that's very different because, after all, 

custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole 

16 point of Miranda warnings, is that, once we give Miranda 

17 warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial 

18 setting, essentially, becomes like a noncustodial 

19 setting. 

So, if we don't require invocation, even 

21 after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting, 

22 why should we require invocation here? 

23  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think the reason that 

24 we don't require invocation in the Miranda setting, I 

think, highlights the fundamental difference between 

50
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 custodial interrogation and noncustodial interrogation. 

2 So, in the custodial setting, the Court has said 

3 that -- that the suspect faces inherent coercive 

4 pressures to confess --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but then --


6  MS. ANDERS: -- and, therefore --


7  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- you're given the 


8 warnings, and then that's gone. 


9  MS. ANDERS: Exactly. That's why we give 


the warnings. And, in the warnings, we promise the 

11 suspect that his silence will not be used against him. 

12 And so this is what the Court said in Doyle v. Ohio, 

13 that, because of that promise, the suspect does not have 

14 to expressly invoked, and his silence can't be used 

against him. 

16  But, in the voluntary situation, we presume 

17 that the suspect knows his rights, and, because he is 

18 not facing any pressure, he can simply say, I don't want 

19 to answer that question. And so when he doesn't say 

that --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've -- you've said in 

22 your brief that there might be a whole other -- many 

23 other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested 

24 that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most 

likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 fears incrimination. 

2  But what -- what obvious other reasons 

3 unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might 

4 remain silent? I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't 

have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that, 

6 when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because 

7 he doesn't want to incriminate himself. 

8  MS. ANDERS: That's right. The -- the 

9 Griffin rule says -- or it's premised on the idea that, 

when you fail to testify at trial, you're inherently 

11 exercising your Fifth Amendment right. 

12  But I think, when you're looking at a -- a 

13 noncustodial interrogation, the question whether the 

14 person is trying to exercise his Fifth Amendment right, 

I think the operative question is not whether he wants 

16 to avoid inculpating himself, it's whether he wants to 

17 refuse to answer as a matter of right. 

18  And I think we know that because, if you 

19 look at the interview as a whole, presumably, his 

overarching motivation is not to inculpate himself. 

21 That's why his statement -- his statements can be used 

22 against him at trial because those statements we --

23 we've -- the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, those 

24 statements are inconsistent with a desire to refuse to 

answer as a matter of right.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Are you -- are you 

2 conceding the -- the point that they make? I -- that --

3 that even if in the custodial setting he waives his 

4 Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't 

answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot 


6 comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one? 


7  MS. ANDERS: I think that raises a 


8 different --


9  JUSTICE BREYER: Does it? What do you 


think? He says, no, you can't, and he quotes Miranda. 

11 Okay? So what do you think? 

12  MS. ANDERS: Well, there is -- there is a 

13 circuit split on that, and -- and I think the circuit 

14 split shows that it raises a different analytical 

question that the Court doesn't have to get into here. 

16 The circuit split is that some courts say, as I 

17 understand it, that, even after the person waives his 

18 Miranda rights, Doyle still applies, and so you can't 

19 use his silence against him. 

And some of those other courts say, no, once 

21 he has waived his Miranda rights, he is essentially in 

22 the same situation as he would be, if he weren't in 

23 custody --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: And do you have a view 

on it?

3 think there is a serious question there. And I think 

4 the Court doesn't have to resolve it here because, 

again, that highlights a distinction between custodial 

6 and noncustodial interrogation, that, once the suspect 

7 has been promised, that --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is your answer 

9 to Justice Kagan's earlier question to -- of the 

hypothetical of the defendant that says nothing for 20 

11 questions? 

12  MS. ANDERS: Well, I -- I think the 

13 standard --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then there's no -- and 

there's no Miranda warning and no custody. 

16  MS. ANDERS: Right. So like this case, 

17 except 20 questions. 

18  Well, I think the standard is whether the --

19 the suspect has done something that reasonably can be 

construed as invocation. This is the standard that the 

21 Court announced in United States v. Quinn a long time 

22 ago, but it's also the same formulation that the Court 

23 used in Davis and Berghuis. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: What -- what does that mean? 

Does he just -- how about if he just says, you know, I

Official 

1 don't really want to answer that question? 

2  MS. ANDERS: I think, if he expresses the 

3 desire not to answer the question, that is sufficient 

4 because he is saying, I'm not going to answer that, and, 

implicitly, he has a right not to do that. I think the 

6 20 questions hypothetical that Justice Kennedy proposed, 

7 probably that would not be sufficient by -- by analogy 

8 to Thompkins, where the suspect sat silent for two 

9 hours. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. But -- but I don't 

11 think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal 

12 of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear 

13 incrimination. What else is --

14  MS. ANDERS: Absolutely. I think -- I think 

there are several types -- there are several mental 

16 states that silence can reflect that are both probative 

17 of guilt and not consistent with the desire to refuse to 

18 answer the question as a matter of right. So, for 

19 instance, the suspect could want to answer the question, 

but have trouble coming up with an exculpatory answer. 

21  He could strategically decide that he is 

22 just going to sit silent for a bit, to see what else the 

23 prosecution -- or, I'm sorry -- the police say, in order 

24 to spin it out, see what they know. He could be 

dismayed or shocked, momentarily, because the question 

55
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 reveals that the police have more evidence than he 

2 thought they did. 

3  So I think, in all of those situations, 

4 those -- those mental states are not consistent with the 

desire to invoke the privilege, and that's why 


6 Petitioner's rule is, essentially, a prophylactic rule 


7 that would protect a great deal of conduct that has 


8 nothing to do with the desire to exercise the Fifth 


9 Amendment right. 


I think -- you know, this case is a good 

11 example of that, where you have a -- a suspect who 

12 speaks for -- you know, several minutes -- you know, 

13 half an hour, whatever, and he's answering questions in 

14 an exculpatory manner. He's suddenly silent in response 

to one question, and so I think the inference that could 

16 be drawn there is that he was surprised by the question 

17 and didn't know how to answer it in the most exculpatory 

18 manner. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Anders, suppose --

you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be 

21 one thing, and then it turns out that the interview was 

22 something else. He realizes, it dawns on him, that the 

23 police really do see him as a suspect. And he says to 

24 himself, I better stop answering, right? 

So he says, okay -- he's answered a bunch of

1 questions already, but -- but, now, he's -- you know, I 

2 don't want to answer any more questions. Is that an 

3 invocation? 

4  MS. ANDERS: I think that would be 

sufficient, yes, to say, I don't want to answer any more 

6 questions. And I think --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Or, if he says, I don't want 

8 to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an 

9 invocation? 

MS. ANDERS: I think that would be 

11 sufficient to invoke with respect to questions on that 

12 topic. And I think, as -- as in Thompkins, I think it's 

13 important to have a clear rule here because invocation 

14 does affect --

JUSTICE KAGAN: That doesn't sound like a 

16 clear rule. I mean -- you know, as -- as between -- you 

17 know, I don't want to answer those questions on a 

18 particular topic, I don't want to answer that question, 

19 or just like could we go on to a different question 

or -- or I don't know. Why is that different? 

21  MS. ANDERS: Well, I think it's -- it's an 

22 objective standard, and it's the same formulation that 

23 the Court has already adopted in Berghuis and in 

24 Thompkins and in Davis. So, in the Miranda context, the 

Court has already faced this problem, how do we know

1 when the defendant has invoked his rights and what 

2 should the standard be? 

3  And it has said that it is an objective 

4 standard, it's what's reasonably perceived as an 

invocation, and so -- you know, the lower courts are 

6 very used to applying that. I think it's very 

7 administrable because --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's not administrable 

9 about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury 

that merely not asking a question is guilt? What --

11 what lacks administrable? 

12  MS. ANDERS: Well, I -- I think there are a 

13 variety of circumstances in which, as I said before, 

14 silence is probative of guilt. And so the question is 

whether you want a broad, prophylactic rule that will 

16 protect a great deal of conduct that -- that has nothing 

17 to do with the exercise of the right.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

21  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

22  MR. FISHER: Thank you. I'd like to make 

23 three points. 

24  First, Justice Breyer, your question about 

the state of the law, with respect to question number 

58

1 432, In our reply brief, at page 4, we cite cases that 


2 are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury, also, 


3 which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our 


4 brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment 


applies. 

6  The Solicitor General, when they speak about 

7 a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking 

8 about impeachment cases. Remember, Doyle and Jenkins, 

9 which are the cases the State cited to you in response 

to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely 

11 different. 

12  Second, if I -- we can look at the 

13 transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State 

14 and the Solicitor General said to you, today, if 

Mr. Salinas would have said, I don't want to answer that 

16 question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply. 

17 But, because it was somehow ambiguous, that it 

18 shouldn't, that is ridiculous. If you look at the 

19 transcript in this case, what did the officer testify 

when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he 

21 did not answer. 

22  What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in 

23 closing? Verbatim of what the State is telling you 

24 today is all Mr. Salinas had to say. At closing, the 

State said, the police officer testified that he

1 wouldn't answer that question. He didn't want to answer 

2 that. 

3  So the whole principle behind express 

4 invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the 

police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the 

6 right to remain silent. There was zero ambiguity in 

7 this case that was going on. 

8  So it explains why the rule that the State 

9 and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court 

today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the 

11 only thing that this formal requirement of saying some 

12 sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I 

13 don't know what they are -- but whatever they are, 

14 what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury 

apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more 

16 than a trap for the unwary, who is told, through culture 

17 and learning, that he has a right to remain silent. 

18  And he does the one thing that is consistent 

19 with his right, which is exercising it, and, somehow, 

the State is telling you that it can walk into court and 

21 say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime; 

22 jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime. 

23  And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the 

24 State, well, what about an officer that tells the 

defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in 

60

1 South Carolina v. Neville, in a roughly comparable 

2 situation, that law enforcement actually admitted they 

3 were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll 

4 do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer, 

we're going to use that against you, the State said that 

6 would be coercion. But the officer would be doing 

7 nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking 

8 you to announce today. 

9  So wouldn't the defendant know the law? 

Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law? And the 

11 State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the 

12 person what the law is, it's coercion. 

13  So, really, what we're asking today is 

14 nothing radical. It's nothing of a departure of our 

deepest traditions, which require the government to 

16 shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and 

17 not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own 

18 demise. 

19  People's silence -- it is the time-honored 

concept of the Fifth Amendment, which, remember, was 

21 created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement 

22 authorities, that people who remain silent could not 

23 have that used against them at trial. 

24  And, finally, I hope the -- the confusion 

with respect to the Berghuis, as related to this case,

1 has been dispelled. I think Justice Kagan got it 


2 exactly right. But, remember, another way to make it 


3 clear is that, if Mr. Salinas had said, in response to 


4 the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me 


questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that. 

6  Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right 

7 to have questioning cut off, so the police could have 

8 kept asking him questions. That's the only right that a 

9 custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke. 

The right to remain silent is not something that's ever 

11 had to be expressly invoked by somebody in custody or 

12 not in custody, and there's no good reason to require it 

13 to be invoked here. 

14  If the Court has any further questions, I'd 

be happy to entertain them. Otherwise, I'll submit the 

16 case. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'd like to go back to 

18 what Justice Ginsburg argued because there is an 

19 argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the 

right, that, by physical conduct, there was a statement. 

21 Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had 

22 argued at trial -- you know, when he was asked about 

23 this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous? 

24  MR. FISHER: No, that would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that shows his

2  MR. FISHER: That would be an entirely 

3 different case. And we wouldn't have a problem with the 

4 State making legitimate arguments based on demeanor 

evidence that is, itself, communicative, as opposed to 

6 what it did in this case, which is argue that his 

7 silence demonstrated his guilt.
