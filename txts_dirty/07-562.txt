 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this term in Altria Group v. Stephanie Good.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondents' state law claims track nearly 

verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption 

provision. For example, the complaint challenges 

promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer 

to smokers than regular cigarettes. But the statute, 

Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement 

respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon 

smoking and health. In short, the Respondents are 

seeking in state court precisely what Congress 

pre-empted. There is no space --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what if 

the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the 

relationship between smoking and health? Something 

along the lines of saying our studies show that light 

cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their 

studies show the opposite. So all you, all the

plaintiff would have to show is that there was a 

deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad. 

It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were 

healthier or not healthier. Is that the type of action 

that could be brought?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think the facts could 

differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice. But the 

inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is 

there a requirement? Is it based upon smoking and 

health, and does it appear in an advertising or 

promotion of a cigarette. Now, I suppose there might be 

conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell 

that the requirement is not connected in some way with 

smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here.

 The complaint specifically talks in terms of 

promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or 

safer, despite serious health problems associated with 

smoking. These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2 

of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning 

Joint Appendix pages 26 through 28. I invite the 

Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended 

complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended 

complaint. In fact, the words "promotion," 

"cigarettes," "smoking," "safety," and "health," the 

very words that appear in the Labeling Act statute,

appear, I counted at least 12 times in the amended 

complaint.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a question of just 

how you phrase it, Mr. Olson? Is there any scope --

does your argument leave any scope for attorney general, 

state attorney general imposition of state law remedies 

against a deceptive practice involving advertising 

cigarettes. To give you concrete examples, suppose a 

state attorney general said in every - suppose the 

practice were in every carton of cigarettes the 

cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If 

you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if 

you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes. 

And the state attorney general goes after that statement 

in the carton as false and deceptive advertising. Would 

there be any scope for that?

 MR. OLSON: I think that there is. In 

answer to the general question that you ask, Justice 

Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney 

general to pursue deceptive advertising. Another 

example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is 

that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes 

in a package or other things having to do with 

cigarettes. That would not necessarily be related to 

smoking and health. So there is not a pre-emption if

there is not a relationship between the prohibition and 

smoking and health. The example you gave might require 

some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the 

attorney general. The motivation is what you referred 

to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I 

would say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, doesn't your 

answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the 

possibility of inserts like that? I mean, what else 

would they be addressing except smoking and health? 

That's the only subject on the table.

 MR. OLSON: I think that's probably true in 

most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there 

might be regulations at the State level having to do 

with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to 

have to do with smoking and health. The Court went 

through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had 

to do with billboards and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer then to my 

specific example would be the attorney general could not 

go after such a statement, "If you want to ingest less 

nicotine, buy our cigarettes"?

 MR. OLSON: If -- if the courts were to 

conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and 

health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there

might be some case in which someone said, well, the 

issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being 

regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with 

smoking and health, but in the environment in which this 

-- this statute was passed and this litigation was 

pursued, there certainly isn't any question here. Now, 

I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion 

in the Reilly case, focused on the content. He said and 

the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as 

opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing 

on the content of advertising.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose that a new 

drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma 

-- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear 

that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic 

reaction. Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty 

to disclose this on the label or in promotions?

 MR. OLSON: No, Justice Kennedy, to the --

the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full 

authority to regulate deceptive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I -- they've just 

found this out last week. Do they have any -- there can 

be no -- I take it under your position there can be no 

suit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling, 

and there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe

item?

 MR. OLSON: Well, there could be -- the 

States may regulate the sale of items. The Labeling Act 

provision only relates to promotion, marketing, 

advertising, and that sort of thing. The State can 

prohibit the sale of cigarettes. States and 

municipalities have done that sort of thing. This 

statute has three provisions in it: Is what the State 

is attempting to do a requirement or prohibition. 

There's no question that that's involved here. Does it 

have to do with the advertising or promotion of 

cigarettes? There's no question that this complaint is 

aimed at the advertising and promotion of cigarettes. 

And does the advertising or promotion have to do with 

smoking and health?

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in your view, it says 

in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in 

Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law 

where it's based on a prohibition of making a false 

statement of material fact. For example, to make a 

funny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42 

cigarettes a day will grow back your hair.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's totally false, and 

in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress

attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot 

make a completely false statement of material fact --

MR. OLSON: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if it's based on -- has 

something to do with smoking and health.

 MR. OLSON: I don't mean to be whimsical, 

but I think that, to the extent there's a representation 

with respect to growing hair or something like that, 

that may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with 

smoking and health.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I was trying to 

produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight 

ways.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. OLSON: Yes. And let me say with 

respect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was 

found to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating, 

easily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and 

superseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this 

Court, it should be set aside and restated. However, 

the very case that the Cipollone decision in the 

plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that 

plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the 

opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize, 

minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning

label on the packages. This complaint is precisely that 

claim. You could probably not have written a claim more 

squarely --

JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. The reason I 

think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that 

when you read through this statute it seems as if what 

Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting 

aside State law, which is tradition, about not making 

false statements, false and deceptive advertising law. 

It was concerned with a different thing. They said, to 

the cigarette companies: You have to put on the label 

"Smoking is dangerous to your health." We don't want 

States telling you to put other things like that on the 

label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a 

picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her 

cigarette. We don't want States to tell you that you 

can't do that. That would be focused on the object of 

the statute, which no one said had as its objective 

setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive 

advertising law. I think that's the argument.

 MR. OLSON: That is the argument, and the 

Respondents are making that argument. I submit that 

that argument is squarely answered by the text of the 

statute, which this Court has said again and again you 

have to turn to. The text of the statute says no

requirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no 

requirement or prohibition except one which is expressly 

misleading. And the reason you mentioned, Justice 

Breyer, what was the background for the statute or what 

was Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on 

section 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the 

blue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose 

squarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in 

Reilly was sweeping language: Any relationship between 

smoking and health. And then Congress went on to point 

out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for 

consumers to receive certain information about the 

smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then 

went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the 

national economy to be protected from confusing 

cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that 

might be "non-uniform, confusing, or diverse."

 Now, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly 

opinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring 

opinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or 

dissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different 

requirements by different States might cause those very 

diverse, confusing advertising. If one State says, 

you've got to put something else in there about this; 

one State says that so-called descriptors are

misleading, as was the case under this case, and another 

State says, like Illinois said in another case, that 

they are not misleading; that national advertising 

becomes impossible. That's inconsistent and Congress 

expressed what its policy was.

 And, Justice Breyer, the Court went through 

the same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case 

in connection with airline and deregulation and whether 

or not misleading advertising might be expressly 

pre-empted. The Court went through the same sort of 

process in the Riegel case with respect to medical 

devices. The Court went through the same process in the 

Rowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in 

connection with another context. And again, with 

respect to the Reilly case, the Court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, you're relying 

on 1334(b), I take it, specifically.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens. Not just 

1334(b) but 1331, which it helps explain.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the prohibition you're 

talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption 

argument -- 1334(b). And I was just going to ask you, 

is a State requirement prohibiting false statements 

about smoking and health a requirement based on smoking 

and health?

MR. OLSON: I think it is, unless I 

misunderstood your question. If a State decides what 

may be in the advertising or promotion --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The predicate for "based 

on smoking" is the word "requirement." And a 

requirement that you may not make any false statements, 

would that be a requirement based on smoking and health?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the statute contains the 

words both "requirement" and "prohibition." And in your 

plurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same 

page I mentioned before, you made the point that a 

prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement. 

And either a prohibition or a requirement with respect 

to advertising if it relates to smoking and health is 

pre-empted.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The question I'm asking, 

though, is a requirement that you make no false 

statements a requirement based on smoking and health?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. And to the extent -- no, 

we are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair-

practices statute is preempted in all respects. It's 

only when the statute, like a common law tort provision 

which the Court considered in Riegel, has application to 

the context of smoking and health.

 If the Court starts with the Morales case

through the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through 

the Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the 

application of the statute in the Reilly case. It was a 

-- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much 

identical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute 

here. And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney 

general was attempting to apply the generalized, 

unfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking 

and cigarettes near schools.

 This is a similar statute, which is 

attempted to be applied in the context of these labels 

and the advertising of cigarettes. It's the application 

of a generalized statute. This Court repeatedly said, 

and specifically said in the Riegel case, there is 

hardly any common law requirements which are 

requirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the 

Respondents don't dispute that; they specifically 

acknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general 

standard to the circumstances of the case. That's where 

the pre-emption occurs.

 Congress didn't want to pre-empt general 

common law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or 

anything like that except in the context of the 

marketing --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would

Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side 

raises here is just what Cipollone said. I can 

understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States 

telling cigarette companies what to say about health and 

smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad. I 

can understand that.

 What I can't understand is why Congress 

would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional 

rule that advertising has to tell the truth.

 Now, what you said was you could end up with 

different applications of that in different States. Of 

course, every national advertiser faces that situation 

at the moment. Everyone who advertises across the 

nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws 

differently administered in different States. Yet, 

they'd survive. There is no evidence even that there is 

a problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of 

that particular statute?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the Court -- and this 

Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that 

pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that 

the plaintiff puts in the complaint.

 Now, as I think every member of this Court 

would know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a 

claim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation,

concealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth. 

It's just a matter of how they change the label on the 

complaint.

 Now, what Congress didn't want -- and I just 

gave an example of a situation where Illinois decided 

that the descriptors, which are an issue in this case 

were not misleading; and it was not -- and they could 

continue to be used.

 What happened in this case in applying the 

Maine statute is a court decided that they were 

misleading and -- and couldn't be used.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But did the Illinois --

Illinois court reach the question whether the claim was 

pre -- pre-empted? I think it firmly decided on the 

merits there was no fraud, if I understand what you 

said.

 MR. OLSON: That's correct, and I'm not 

saying --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So we must assume there 

was no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the 

merits otherwise.

 MR. OLSON: I -- I haven't got all of the 

specifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply 

meant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in 

your concurring opinion in Reilly: That if you're going

to conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be 

governed by what a jury might decide in Des Moines 

versus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama. 

And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: When it's not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it the jury fracture? 

You said the attorney general could not stop, my 

example, "If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our 

lights." The attorney general could not proscribe that. 

So nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury 

rather than the attorney general, does it?

 MR. OLSON: Well, no, that's absolutely --

absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the 

panoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't 

matter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute 

that's being applied or a common law standard that's 

being applied, and it does not matter whether it's an 

attorney general interpreting and enforcing general 

provisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens 

situation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort 

action being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to 

a jury a la Riegel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is 

essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the 

advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one

decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't 

act then the cigarette companies can say anything they 

want about low tar and low nicotine?

 MR. OLSON: Well, there is also -- I -- I 

think it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the 

pre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement 

agreement that the tobacco companies entered into with 

the States, which gives the States a lot of power to 

enforce various different things.

 But I think that the point here is that, 

yes, Congress decided that it wanted one uniform source 

of regulation of advertising of cigarettes with respect 

to smoking and health. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the 

consent decree say anything about advertising low, 

light, those specifics?

 MR. OLSON: The master settlement agreement?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. OLSON: I -- I don't -- I can't answer 

that question. I don't know the answer to that 

question, but what I -- I believe that it would allow 

broad powers by the attorney generals. But I have --

hasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some 

parties entered into that master settlement agreement I 

don't think changes the Federal -- the congressional

intent is very clear. It wanted the -- the statement --

Congress wanted the statements, certain statements, on 

cigarette packages. It didn't want any confusion about 

what the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be.

 I can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer 

statement. It says no requirement or prohibition in 

section 1334(b). And in 1331 it says "comprehensive 

Federal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and 

advertising with respect to any relationship between 

smoking and health."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Olson, isn't the 

problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least 

been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of 

reasoning that holds against you? And that line of 

reasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees --

that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate 

advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters 

that do affect -- relate to smoking and health.

 It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage 

of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of 

deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation 

of deceptive advertising as a general proposition. In 

fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State 

regimes. That state of the law is just as clear. It is 

at least as clear as you say the language is here.

Now, given the fact that the FTC can 

regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in 

the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give 

some recognition to this complementary regime of State 

regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives 

it?

 MR. OLSON: Well, the point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And all I'm saying is what 

we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision. 

But we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at 

odds with that preemption provision, and presumably 

we've got to give some effect to that, too.

 MR. OLSON: Well, the -- the statute deals 

with this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain 

responsibilities. But I think the more powerful answer 

is that the background principle, the Federal Trade 

Commission Act and Federal and State Trade -- Fair 

Practices Act, are a part of a national scheme just 

exactly as you said. It's a background --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's part of a 

national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that 

on any subject matter that the FTC regulates. And, 

nonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of 

regulating deception survive.

 So that the argument you are making here is

an argument that can be made, I suppose, on every 

subject that the FTC touches.

 MR. OLSON: Well, no. As a matter of fact, 

I could not disagree more, Justice Souter.  That's the 

general background scheme. Then Congress specifically 

addresses smoking and health in the advertising of 

cigarettes. The same --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your implied -- your 

implied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to 

that -- to that point.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it -- we have -- I'd like 

to spend no time on the implied preemption argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Good idea.

 MR. OLSON: -- because I think -- I think 

this is the -- the -- that Congress could not have been 

more clear. And another answer to your question, 

Justice Souter, is the Airline Deregulation Act.

 You dealt -- you Court dealt with this in 

the Morales case and the Wolens case. The -- you could 

have said the same thing there: That there is a 

background principle against unfair --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Perhaps we did not think of 

it.

 MR. OLSON: I don't -- I think that it's

clear that, looking at the briefs in that case, that 

those very same arguments were made. The same argument 

could have been made in the Riegel case with respect to 

devices. The general principle that I'm making that I 

think Congress understands, and this Court has clearly 

understood, is that there is a background principle that 

the Federal Government is not pre-empting deceptive 

practice regulations except when Congress specifically 

says so.

 Now, one more point because I think the 

white light will come on: the United States Government 

did not address in this case the express pre-emption 

argument. But a few years ago, in the Reilly case, 

having to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette 

Labeling Act, the United States Government said that the 

labeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the 

content of cigarette advertising, the content of 

cigarette advertising. That's what the government said 

then and the Acting Solicitor General during the 

argument in that case, in response to a question by one 

of your members of this Court, specifically said the --

the statute would pre-empt State laws about filters or 

the safety of a particular cigarette. That was the 

position of the United States Government a couple of 

years ago and they have not changed.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court:

 When Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the 

1969 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to 

immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that 

they made in violation of anti-deception in the 

marketplace rules. They didn't empower the FTC with any 

special rulemaking authority that applied industrywide, 

and in fact the FTC's enforcement authority with respect 

to individual companies was quite limited. The argument 

that Philip --

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Frederick, suppose that 

the FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970 

and required that the tar and nicotine figures that were 

produced by the particular testing method that is at 

issue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and 

promotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a 

regulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the

State of Maine state that the Federal figures are 

misleading and should be disregarded. Would that 

regulation be pre-empted?

 MR. FREDERICK: That would be implied 

conflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that 

would be pre-empted. The difference here --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between that situation and this situation?

 MR. FREDERICK: The difference here is that 

between a generally applicable rule that is specially 

targeted at the cigarette industry and a generally 

applicable rule against deception, upon which a fact 

finder would not need to make any special inquiry about 

smoking and health.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case 

where they said, and I'll quote: "We have held that a 

provision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted 

common law duties"? That's no suggestion that this is a 

distinction between a focused common law duty, which 

would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I have three 

responses, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that the 

text in Riegel was different; the purposes behind what 

Congress enacted in the medical device amendments were

different; and third, this Court twice, in both Reilly 

and in Cipollone, has looked at this exact statute and 

come to the opposite conclusion.

 First with respect to the text of the 

medical device amendments, there are several provisions 

of that act that are quite a bit broader than what the 

1969 Labeling Act --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say Riegel 

wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue. 

It was making a general point. The Court said: We have 

held that a provision pre-empting State requirements, 

which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common 

law duties.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the result, Mr. Chief 

Justice, of virtually every one of this Court's 

pre-emption cases has been to look at the particular 

words of the statute to determine the scope of the 

pre-emption. The Court did that in Bates. It did that 

in Morales. It did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So as a general 

proposition -- I understand your position to be that 

this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law 

duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in 

response to Justice Alito's question was that general 

common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored

ones are.

 MR. FREDERICK: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that a 

general common law duty can be pre-empted by a 

particular statute?

 MR. FREDERICK: I do acknowledge that, 

Mr. Chief Justice. But my point is that in the medical 

device amendments what Congress was getting at were 

things that were quite a bit broader and it had sweeping 

language. It said not only to establish but also to 

continue in effect, with respect to a device, which 

relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device, or 

"to any other matter included in a requirement 

applicable to the device."

 By contrast --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're -- so 

you're saying that we should -- the difference in your 

case is that the language here is narrower. It says "no 

statement relating to smoking or health." I don't see 

how that language is narrower.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, I think you're quoting 

1334(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr. 

Chief Justice, is 1334(b) which says --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So 1334(b) 

says "no requirement or prohibition with respect to."

Isn't that just as broad?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, no, it isn't, because 

the modifying term that's at issue in this case comes 

between the two points that you quoted, and that's the 

phrase "based on smoking and health." Our contention 

here is that a generalized duty not to deceive is not a 

requirement based on smoking and health. It's based on 

a duty not to deceive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you tell --

how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you 

don't look at what the relationship is between smoking 

and health? They have an advertisement that says light 

cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes. 

You have to know what the relationship is between 

smoking and health to determine whether that's 

deceptive.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, you don't. You have to 

look at two products and determine whether or not they 

are achieving the same yield of tar and nicotine that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the 

relationship between smoking and health.

 MR. FREDERICK: And the word "relate" does 

not appear in 1334(b), and that is crucial because this 

Court in Safeco v. Burr defined the phrase "based upon" 

to mean but-for causation: But for smoking and health,

is there a requirement? The words "related to" have 

been defined by this Court in numerous pre-emption 

cases, including Morales, Wolens, ERISA cases, to be 

among the most sweeping language that Congress can use 

to denote a connection.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have -- would 

have you been satisfied if your complaint said this 

complaint does not seek any damages based on the link 

between smoking and health?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the damages here, Mr. 

Justice Kennedy, are -- concern getting two products 

that are not different. It's just like going to a car 

dealer and saying, I want a Ford and they --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you accept that 

amendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not 

seek any damages based on some link between smoking and 

health?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think we would accept 

that, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How can you accept that and 

then expect to prove damages in the case? You can 

accept it to this extent, it seems to me. You can 

accept it in saying that what we are going to prove at 

step number one is that it is false to indicate that 

smoking light cigarettes will result in the ingestion of

less tar and nicotine; and we know why you're saying 

that. But in order to prove damages in your case, you 

would have to say: People get hurt because there is a 

relationship between the ingestion of tar and nicotine 

and their health; and the same cause -- the same causal 

connection is therefore appropriate for -- for -- is 

therefore necessary in order to prove that people were 

hurt.

 MR. FREDERICK: In fact in our case we are 

not proving health-related damages.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're asking for 

injunctive relief, I guess.

 MR. FREDERICK: No, we are not asking for 

injunctive relief. We are asking damages for the 

difference in value between a product we thought we were 

buying and a product we actually bought.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the reason -- and the 

reason the product is of different value is that in fact 

it is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more 

dangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to 

less dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage 

you've still got to prove the link between causation and 

health.

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think so, Justice 

Souter. I think all we have to prove is that the

products were different and that we relied materially on 

a misrepresentation about what product to use.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think you could 

recover if the evidence showed simply that all your 

clients had the health of Olympic athletes?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You do?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, I do, because our 

damages here, Justice Souter --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What would the harm be, 

sort of aesthetic?

 MR. FREDERICK: If we bought a product 

thinking that it would be a safer product and it was 

not, and we would have quit smoking.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If they are healthy as 

horses, you have no proof that it is not.

 MR. FREDERICK: We're -- yes, we do, because 

the product is different. If you buy a car thinking 

it's a Ford and it's a Yugo but it still drives, you 

still have a claim under the lemon laws for deceptive 

advertising.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what if Yugos and Fords 

are worth the same amount of money?

Unless you show that for some -- for some reason -- were 

light cigarettes sold as a premium? Did they charge 

more for light cigarettes?

 MR. FREDERICK: There is economic evidence, 

Justice Scalia, of a difference in value, and of course 

the pre-emption -- the issue here is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Answer my question. Did 

they charge more for light cigarettes?

 MR. FREDERICK: They did not charge more for 

light cigarettes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So what are your damages?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, what's the difference 

in value?

 MR. FREDERICK: Economists have projected 

that if a person would have quit smoking and, therefore, 

not purchased light cigarettes or would have paid a 

different amount of money thinking it was getting a 

safer cigarette, there is an economic value --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the person have 

decided to quit or not to quit? The person would have 

made that decision based upon the health consequences.

 MR. FREDERICK: Certainly. And the point 

here about the advertising --

smoking and health.

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Souter, I don't 

think that the liability requirement here, the rule of 

law that is being imposed under Bates -- what Bates said 

was that you look at the elements of the claim to 

determine whether or not the requirements are imposed by 

State law. The requirement that we seek to impose here 

is the duty not to deceive --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why couldn't you say 

exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to 

protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule, 

and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you 

have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you 

have to put skull and crossbones? That's the state law.

 And you say why? They say because we are 

trying to protect consumers. And then you would be up 

here saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is 

not the duty to put the skull and crossbones. It's the 

duty to protect consumers.

 Now, that argument would get nowhere, as you 

understand. And they are saying you're making just that 

kind of argument here, except substitute the word 

"deception".

 MR. FREDERICK: We are not making the same 

argument here for two reasons: One is that the main

statute is not specially targeted at cigarette smoking. 

It's specially targeted at deception in the marketplace. 

Under your hypothetical it would be specially targeted 

at cigarette companies. Under Reilly that would be 

preempted.

 Secondly, skull and crossbones I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me before you go. I 

don't understand that. It is not specially targeted at 

cigarettes and at the harmful health effects of 

cigarettes?

 MR. FREDERICK: The statute we seek to 

invoke is a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a general statute but 

in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at 

what its specific application in the case was.

 MR. FREDERICK: Because the statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't get away with 

just coming in and saying the general statute is an 

anti-deception statute. Didn't we look at what the 

application of it was in the case?

 MR. FREDERICK: You looked at it because the 

statute required you to look at it as applicable, and 

the purposes behind that Act were to give the FDA 

authority at the premarketing -- and purposes behind the 

medical device amendment were completely different. The

FTC does not look at these marketing materials before 

the cigarette companies do that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I want you to 

get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds. I 

can't deal with this conceptual thing. It was hard for 

me to see it conceptually. I can't understand -- and 

that may be enough to any other person here, but I can't 

understand somebody saying yes, this language is very 

absolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it 

literally applies to. For example, it probably doesn't 

cover a requirement about workers smoking who put up 

billboards. And another thing you say it doesn't cover 

is traditional anti-deception law. That would have to 

do with the purpose of the statute not the text.

 I'm not making your argument for you. I'm 

giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30 

seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there 

is something to that line or there isn't.

 MR. FREDERICK: Prior to the enactment of 

the 1969 Labeling Act, Congress confronted the spectra 

of states imposing warning requirements. And the 

tobacco companies went to Congress and said, we do not 

want special burdens imposed on us. We don't want 

special advantages, but please don't impose special 

burdens on the cigarette industry.

And Congress said, we will wipe away the 

prospect of state imposing warnings by having a 

congressionally mandated warning on the cigarette packs 

and in cigarette advertising. The Congress said nothing 

about having anti-deception laws be displaced by States.

 So that in, in the hair hypo that you gave, 

I think Mr. Olson would have to acknowledge that the 

cigarette companies were not asking at the time of the 

'69 Labeling Act to be free of anti-deception laws. 

They had been out for decades saying cigarette smoking 

cures the common cold, it makes the throat feel better, 

all sorts of health-related claims that were deceptive. 

And Congress was not trying to wipe that away.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick, did I 

understand you earlier to say that your complaint did 

not seek injunctive relief?

 MR. FREDERICK: We are not here seeking 

injunctive relief for this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 42A of your 

amended complaint says you ask the Court to grant such 

injunctive relief as may be appropriate.

Justice, with apologies to the Court. Our claim here, 

though, principally is for damages. And I would also

ordered here would be superseded by the United States 

RICO case, where the District Court of the District of 

Columbia has already issued an injunction for the use of 

light cigarettes because Judge Kessler found in more 

than 4,000 findings of fact that Philip Morris had 

engaged in deception in the marketplace and findings of 

fact, beginning 2023 and following --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, are you 

saying that the consent decree -- because we have 

overtaken Judge Kessler's decision by consent decree, 

right and it has terms? Does a -- does a consent decree 

terms allow state attorney generals to say don't 

advertise low?

 MR. FREDERICK: The consent decree in the 

master settlement agreement does not address itself to 

specific issues with regard to light and low tar, to my 

knowledge. The Kessler order does address the deception 

by lights and low tar, and the reason is temporal.

 When the master settlement agreement was 

entered into in the late '90s, the tobacco companies had 

not yet acknowledged publicly that they had been engaged 

in deception with respect to studies regarding low tar 

and light cigarette. That came to light in 2002, and as 

a result of the discovery that occurred in the 

government's case and in State cases, the studies that

the cigarette companies knew for decades that there was 

no difference in the yield for low tar and light 

cigarettes came to light.

 And so, the master settlement agreement was 

not -- it had certain provisions about the way 

cigarettes could be marketed but -- but the Judge 

Kessler opinion, in the government's RICO case, actually 

makes findings of fact on this score. And the complaint 

here essentially tracks the allegations in the 

government's. All we seek to do is to provide a remedy 

to consumers that have been defrauded by Philip Morris 

over these many decades.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a state attorney 

general say under my authority to check against false 

and deceptive advertising, no cigarette company can 

advertise in this State low or light?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think that would fall into 

the Reilly line of being preempted, because it would be 

specially targeted and there would be no room for a 

cigarette maker to say truthfully our product actually 

does yield lower and light. So, it could not be a 

requirement based on deception. It would have to be a 

requirement based on smoking and health under your 

hypothetical.

held to be preempted in Cipollone based on general 

common law duties?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, they were. Those --

the fraudulent neutralization of warning claim and the 

failure to warn claim were common law claims, Justice 

Alito, but the difference here is that in Cipollone the 

plurality plus the three Justices who joined Justice 

Blackmun's opinion and would have found no common law 

claims preempted. Seven Justices found fraud claims 

that are virtually identical to ours not to be preempted 

because Congress lacked any intent to displace State 

laws concerning deception.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Frederick, if I take 

away from your oral argument that it is your position 

that this suit is not based on a link between smoking 

and health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting 

your position in this entire case. Do you have a 

secondary position that it is based on a link between 

smoking and health but it is subject to a general duty, 

that is, that supersedes or is quite in addition to 

labeling?

 MR. FREDERICK: The requirement is what I 

would urge you to focus on, Justice Kennedy. And the 

requirement that is being imposed here is not a 

requirement that has to do specifically with smoking and

health.

 There is a second argument, which is that 

even under the application of that generalized duty, the 

jury here or the trial court would not be asked to look 

at the linkage between smoking and health. It could 

simply say, have a scientist up there who says the yield 

of a light cigarette is no different than the yield of a 

regular cigarette.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand your basic 

argument to be that this statute is a prohibition 

against State warnings in either promotion or 

advertising different from the Federal one?

 MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That was 

the general purpose of the statute. There is language, 

of course, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: This specific quotation 

deals only with the contents of the advertising that 

might be described as warnings different from those in 

the Federal scheme.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct, 

Justice Stevens. And here what we are talking about 

with these light descriptors are comparisons between two 

products that, in fact, are not different.

Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general

could not impose a regulation that said you must say 

that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular 

cigarettes. If the attorney general couldn't do that, 

why could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, the attorney general 

could bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice 

Kennedy. The difference is between a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The hypothetical was 

the attorney general requires this as a regulation under 

his authority.

 MR. FREDERICK: And let me answer the 

hypothetical this way: The attorney general can bring 

the lawsuit under the State deceptive practices act but 

cannot issue a generalized regulation targeted at the 

cigarette industry that takes truth completely out of 

the equation, because if another cigarette company comes 

up and says, "We actually have a light cigarette that is 

lower in tar," and we can prove it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he wins the 

lawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and 

deceptive to say "low." Could he then have a regulation 

that says cigarette companies don't advertise "low" or 

"light"?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think that's a much more 

difficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and

that would be no, because a regulation would be -- would 

be specifically targeted at the industry and it would be 

based on smoking and health, not deception.

 In an injunctive situation, adjudicatory 

facts can evolve. A company can come forward and say 

the facts have changed, circumstances have changed, 

please modify the injunction. That can't happen when a 

generalized regulation is imposed that is specifically 

targeted at facts regardless of their truth or veracity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you make that 

concrete? What would change about the label "low" or 

"light"?

 MR. FREDERICK: If the -- if the company 

came forward and said, "we redesigned our cigarette," 

and it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a 

scientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that 

would run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run 

afoul of the general duty not to deceive.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It will not surprise 

you that my first question is, why did the United States 

not address the express pre-emption argument and, 

second, what is the position of the United States on the 

express pre-emption argument?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the 

United States did not participate on the question of the 

scope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone, 

and to a large extent the express pre-emption question 

in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in 

Cipollone. And so that is of less interest to the 

United States than certainly the second question 

presented, which has to do with the FTC's own authority 

and its exercise of that authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well, 

that's why you didn't address it. Now, what is the 

position of the United States? It's a statute that is 

directed to an area in which the Federal Government has 

an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have 

thought there'd be a position on that. It is logically 

antecedent to the implied pre-emption. You would 

consider whether there is express pre-emption before 

implied pre-emption.

an earlier case.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't believe 

that the position that the United States stated in 

Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in 

this case. But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief 

that the United States has filed with respect to implied 

pre-emption is not relevant.

anymore. I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give 

up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.

to express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice 

Ginsburg --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does the FTC at this point 

in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and 

nicotine figures that are produced by this testing 

method are meaningful or misleading?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as Your Honor 

is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority 

letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a 

request for comment on a proposal to rescind its 

guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test 

results, precisely because of concern that they are 

misleading due to the evidence that has developed about 

the incidence of compensation. That was not believed at 

the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in 

1966 and '67 to present a significant problem. But it 

is evident now. The scientific community indicates and 

certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that 

the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967 

that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for 

that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the 

Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to 

a true human smoker. And for that reason, it proposed

to withdraw.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be -- would it be 

unfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40 

years, the FTC has passively approved the placement of 

these tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: With respect to the 

-- I want first to take issue with the question of 

"approved," because I think that it -- it draws an 

analogy to the FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and 

that is not the nature of what the Federal Trade 

Commission does. It doesn't stand --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you passed a rule to 

require it, did you not?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We proposed a rule 

to require the disclosure of tar and nicotine --

JUSTICE ALITO: And you withdrew that after 

the companies voluntarily agreed to place the 

information on the ads --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and entered into consent 

decrees with other companies requiring them to put 

information in their ads.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The consent

their ads. It said that it would be deceptive to make

claims about the tar and nicotine content of the 

cigarettes without expressing, in milligrams, what the 

yield was per the Cambridge test method. But that's a 

very different thing. It's a prohibition. They were 

ordered to cease and desist making claims about tar and 

nicotine content without giving the consumer the benefit 

of the yield figures. But the Commission has never --

specifically at issue in this case are the descriptors 

"light" or "lower in tar." In 1987, the Commission 

issued a notice in which it said these terms are are not 

defined by Federal law. They asked whether there should 

be --

JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a different 

between saying "light" and saying "lower in tar" in 

accordance with the Cambridge testing method?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor, 

because the -- the "light," on its own, much more 

conveys the impression to the consumer that this is the 

yield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker, 

and in fact that was why the --

JUSTICE ALITO: The FTC's position seems to 

me incomprehensible. If these figures are meaningless, 

then you should have prohibited them -- are misleading, 

you should have prohibited them a long time ago. And

approving the placement of these figures on the -- on --

in the advertisements. And if they are misleading, then 

you have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette 

for a long time.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They -- whether 

they are or are not misleading depends upon the 

incidence of compensation. At the time the Commission 

issued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was 

that compensation was not expected to be a problem. It 

was not believed to be a problem. Beginning in 1983, 

when in light of the Barclay's case in which it was 

determined that a particular cigarette, the yield 

according to the test method had nothing to do with 

yield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire 

about this.

 But the Petitioners, although they have 

known since 1967 about the incidence of compensation, 

failed to disclose that information to the Commission. 

They have failed to -- they have refused to give them 

the benefit of their insights, their own studies. The 

Commission has asked --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Commission -- when did 

the Commission know of this stuff? I had a case when I 

was on the Court of Appeals, so it had to be before 1984 

involving so-called lip drape --

covers up the little holes that bring in some fresh air.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In 1978 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's been general knowledge 

for a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There has been a 

question. In 1978, the Commission issued a notice 

requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact 

occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the 

air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that, 

even though they had their own studies showing that it 

was a problem. So it is -- it is true that the 

Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to 

withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners 

themselves should not be able to benefit from their own 

misleading of the Commission.

 But again, I think it's more fundamental 

than that, is that their arguments rely upon a 

misconception of what the Commission does. As Justice 

Souter noted, it is Supreme Court law the Commission 

does not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with 

State law. The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper 

like FDA in approving things. It acts as a law 

enforcement agency. It goes after fraud when it is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

We haven't given up the implied pre-emption argument, 

but I --

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just didn't want 

to argue it.

 MR. OLSON: I -- we feel that we explained 

it very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing 

that the time was limited I thought we should focus on 

the strongest argument I think by any stretch of the 

imagination, when Congress has spoken directly.

 Now, first of all, with respect to what the 

Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says, 

and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia 

was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the 

Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the 

Labeling Act. So it is the government's responsibility, 

according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act.

 Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief, 

distinguishing between the location of the billboards in 

that case and other things that would be pre-empted, 

pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act 

preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette

advertising with respect to smoking and health. And the 

Acting Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of 

the argument that day in this case was asked that 

question, what is pre-empted? And she said it pre-empts 

State law claims about filters or the safety of a 

particular cigarette. That is this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't the point, it doesn't 

pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about 

content?

 MR. OLSON: That was the government's point.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the government's 

position. Now, if that's their position, isn't it just 

one additional step to say depending on what the history 

of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about 

content that don't have to do with lying about the 

content?

 MR. OLSON: It has to do according to what 

Congress said about the content of the advertising and 

the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is 

about when it has to do with smoking and health.

 Now, my opponent seems to run away, in 

answer to your question, about what if we take out 

smoking and health from their complaint? Well, they 

can't take out smoking. That is everywhere in the 

complaint. I asked the Court to sit down and compare

the labeling statute with the complaint. And the words 

are indistinguishable, and they say over and over again 

and on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well, 

all they want is economic damages. They are really 

not -- they are just concerned about they got one 

cigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette. 

Page 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood 

it. This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the 

plaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these 

substances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on 

which cigarette to purchase, because consumers 

understand that reducing the quantities of tar and 

nicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health 

effects. That is what this case is all about.

 Now, I will just conclude in this way. The 

statute in the language of this Court in the Reilly 

case, uses "sweeping language." The language is every 

bit as sweeping as the language in the airline 

deregulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I 

submit.

 So there is three requirements. Either --

the statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase "any," 

you can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the 

word "no" requirements or prohibition. The Court has 

dealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly,

Cipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel. The statute that we 

are talking about here in this case is the same statute 

essentially that it was dealing with in Reilly. It's 

the State Unfair Practices Act. It was 

Massachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by 

side. They essentially the same.

 Is the requirement based upon smoking and 

health? Well, the complaint specifically says so. The 

relief is based upon the relationship between smoking 

and health and is it in promotion or advertising of 

tobacco? Again, they've said that over and over again. 

I submit that the statute could not be more clear. This 

particular complaint seeks to impose a regulation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it correct that your 

argument requires us to reject the fraud analysis in 

Cipollone?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. I believe it does. 

However, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked 

about in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about 

minimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning 

labels. That's also this complaint. This as a 

complaint is identical so what you were referring to on 

page 527 of Cipollone.
