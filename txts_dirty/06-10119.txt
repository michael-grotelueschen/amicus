 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-10119, Synder v. Louisiana.

 Mr. Bright.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The decision here of the majority of the 

Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an 

extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court 

taught in its Miller-El decisions. And I point out sort 

of three overarching errors in that regard.

 First, the majority looked at each of the 

Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely 

discounted them. That there were five African-Americans 

struck, they whittled that down to two. That there was 

disparate questioning, they identified that of the white 

jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted 

for the State. And Miller-El clearly teaches that it 

didn't.

 They found there was no racial implication 

in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of 

the case all the way through, because neither O.J.

Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned.

 Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors 

that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged. 

For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure 

to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott. 

There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking 

them. They asked no questions. In this case, you could 

ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer.

 And then thirdly, when they got to the point 

of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled 

them down to where there was very little to consider.

 And our position is that what Justice 

Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who 

wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents 

here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to 

do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El, 

because when you consider all those factors together, 

nothing answers the question of or explains them as well 

as race.

 You can pick each piece out, each leaf out 

and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it. 

But when you stand back and look at it all together --

and that's why the court missed the fact that the back 

strike was racially motivated in this case.

 It just simply didn't look at these things

in the context --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you about one of 

the factors?

 MR. BRIGHT: Sure.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It's hard to discuss them 

all at the same time. What is the relevance of strikes 

of black lawyers that you don't argue were based on 

race? It's hard for me to understand why that's 

relevant in this calculation.

 Suppose there's a case where it's perfectly 

clear that certain strikes were not racially motivated. 

Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking 

every lawyer who's on the panel. It strikes every white 

lawyer and it strikes every black lawyer. Then what is 

the relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were 

peremptorily challenged?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I see. You mean the 

jurors happen to be lawyers and they are struck?

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's right.

 MR. BRIGHT: There's a common reason. Well, 

if that's the case and you have considered that in 

Miller-El, that's a factor for race neutrality. The 

difference here is the reason given for striking Brooks, 

for example, is he might have a reason to go home --

JUSTICE ALITO: You are making the argument

there were five African-American jurors who were the 

subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.

 MR. BRIGHT: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And -- but you don't claim 

that three of those strikes were based on race? Do you?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, no different than 

Miller-El. The Court in Miller-El says you look at the 

prima facie case because it is unlikely to happen by 

chance.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There were a large number of 

strikes in Miller-El. This is a much smaller number. 

Could you just explain, if you can, what is the 

relevance of strikes that you do not even claim were 

racially motivated?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, the difference is that as 

in Miller-El it is unlikely to happen by happenstance. 

They struck all the blacks they could in this case. 

There were only five. They struck every one of them. 

And the way they went about striking them -- and the 

context of all this -- it doesn't say that all five of 

those, that's -- Justice Alito, but that's the classic 

Batson case where the prima facie case is strong, given 

the number of people struck, but you zero in on the 

particular jurors where doing the side by side 

comparison, the failure to ask any questions, the other

factors that were identified --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's right 

that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected. 

But you also want to rely on the fact that these other 

jurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their 

exclusion. If an objection had been made, the State, of 

course, would have -- could have explained if they had a 

reason, a non-racial one, why they were struck. But you 

didn't object.

 And yet you want them to be considered as 

convincing racial bias.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, part of the reason they 

weren't struck, Mr. Chief Justice, was one of the 

elements of race here. The prosecution accepted the 

first black juror. So when the second one, Gregory 

Scott is struck, there's only one out of two. There's 

no the pattern. Then Mr. Hawkins is struck. Now it's 

two out of three. It is when Miss Elaine Scott was 

struck. And now it's three out of four. There's still 

one African-American.

 At that point defense counsel said there's a 

pattern, and I strike based on the pattern of striking 

African-Americans.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Couldn't counsel at that 

point have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's

going on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to 

interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second 

and third African-American?

 MR. BRIGHT: Or actually the first and 

second. You're right. The second and third. There was 

-- that certainly could have been done. I think 

basically the defense was snookered here.

 But also, there was nothing to prevent the 

prosecution from giving reasons. In fact, Mr. Oland, 

the junior prosecutor here, he starts to say, I struck 

Mr. Hawkins, and at that point Williams, the senior 

prosecutor, said, don't say anything. Stop --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably because 

no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins. I mean, it 

is -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors 

are being excluded on a racial basis.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, but the only thing we're 

putting the pattern forward for is step three of Batson, 

where both Miller-El decisions make it quite clear that 

if the numbers are such that it is unlikely to happen by 

happenstance, that's one element. It is not that all 

five necessarily were struck on the basis of race. But 

it is the fact that that unlikely event, that five out 

of five were struck, informs that decision in Batson 

saying looking at all relevant facts, it doesn't

exclude -- I've seen Batson challenges where a lawyer 

will say, well, with regards to five and six, then we 

think those are particularly strong, not with regards to 

others -- Miller-El did that.

 They only challenged seven on direct appeal, 

only challenged six on the habeas corpus case that 

ultimately made its way to this Court, and this Court 

only found with regard to two.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Out of -- out of how 

many who were struck.

 MR. BRIGHT: Ten. So they only challenged 

seven of those on -- on direct appeal, six on habeas 

corpus, and this Court only found Jurors Fields and 

Juror Ward. That's basically -- we're here saying, you 

struck five out of five, all that he possibly could 

have, and Juror Brooks -- if you look at all the 

Miller-El factors with regard to Jeffrey Brooks, just 

two general reasons that probably applied to everybody 

there. He was nervous; I expect every citizen called 

out of their home or out of their work --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The district judge is in a 

much better position to decide those matters, such as 

you know, he -- his -- his response was -- was slow on 

-- one the question of, you know, whether he could 

consider the death penalty. I can't tell that from a

cold record, and that's why we -- rely upon the trial 

judge.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, that was with regard to 

Ms. Scott.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. BRIGHT: Justice Scalia, there -- only 

one juror here was ambivalent about the death penalty, 

said she wasn't sure. She's cross-examined for four or 

five pages of transcript. 23 -- 21, I'm sorry -- jurors 

are asked if they are opposed to the death penalty and 

answer the question yes. 21. Every single one is asked 

at least two and some were asked more questions. The 

only person not asked any questions was Elaine Scott. 

She first says, could you impose the death penalty? "I 

think I could." Then she says later, "I could." If you 

look at the three jurors right before her, Mr. Boyd, "I 

could consider it," Ms. Sara Coney, "I could consider 

it," Mr. Salita, "I could consider it," Miss Scott, "I 

could."

 They all give the same answer. Two of those 

people, Justice Scalia, end up on the jury in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm looking at 

-- at the joint appendix on page 360. As I read it, 

Miss Scott gives an answer that can't be heard, right?

 MR. BRIGHT: Right. The first time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Dupont says, 

"I'm sorry, I can't hear you." I mean, we don't know; 

since we weren't there if it was kind of, you know, "I 

think I could" and then "I think" -- I mean, you know, 

it's an atmospheric determination by the -- the district 

court judge; and as -- as has been pointed out here, all 

we have is the cold transcript.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, then, just a couple of 

pages later, Mr. Chief Justice, she says I could. She 

gives the same answer that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's on joint 

appendix 401?

 MR. BRIGHT: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and the 

problem with that, of course, is it's --

MR. BRIGHT: I'm sorry. 367.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 367.

 MR. BRIGHT: She says "I think I could" at 

361. And then just a few pages later they go each 

juror, and she says "I could."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- the 

question is not could you consider the death penalty. 

It says could you consider both, when they're going 

through several of the juries. Jurors.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I thought that 

was -- the point was made by your friend on the other 

side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she 

was saying she could consider.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I'd invite the Court to 

look at that. Because what that starts out with is a 

question about life. Could you consider life 

imprisonment. And then when Ms. Goff is answered, she 

says the death penalty, could I consider it? Yes, I 

could consider it. And then everybody says they could 

consider it.

 Now, the Louisiana Supreme Court treated 

this as her saying I could consider the death penalty. 

That's what they said. But here's the other point with 

Miss Scott. It only took one question: Ms. Scott, what 

did you mean when you said I think you could?

 I mean that was in Miller-El -- in the 

opinion in Miller-El II, the fact that Fields wasn't 

asked any questions about the position on the death 

penalty. He had expressed some; but if the 

prosecutor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, these are peremptory 

challenges. It seems to me if you have one -- one juror 

who says I think I could and another one who said I 

could, I'm going to strike the one who said I think I

could.

 MR. BRIGHT: But Justice Scalia, there's no 

reason you wouldn't ask them what they meant. And 

that's what the prosecutors did with all the white 

jurors here -- every single one. It's only Ms. Scott, 

Elaine Scott that there's no questions asked about the 

reasons they gave for striking her. So they had the 

opportunity to ask her what she meant and they asked all 

21 of the white jurors. They asked the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did all 21 say I think I 

could?

 MR. BRIGHT: No. All 21 said no. And then 

the prosecution asked them follow-up questions about 

what their beliefs were. So in those situations, the 

prosecutor is asking questions to be sure to clarify 

their position on the death penalty. Miss Calligan is 

the only one who says well, I'm not sure. So they asked 

Ms. Calligan a number of questions. How long have you 

thought about it? What do you think? All those sorts 

of things. Ultimately it is pretty clear Ms. Calligan 

is opposed to the death penalty.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Bright, you make good 

arguments about comparisons between white jurors and 

black jurors.

 MR. BRIGHT: Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO: What do we do with the 

comparisons that you are making now to white jurors who 

were never brought to the attention of the Louisiana 

Supreme Court?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I think Miller-El, again, 

answers that, because the entire voir dire was before 

the Louisiana Supreme Court. On remand from this Court 

arguments were made about the -- the disparate 

questioning of jurors; and also with Jeffrey Brooks, 

where that's also very clear because the reason given 

for striking Jeffrey Brooks is that he would have a 

reason to want to go home early.

 My experience is most jurors taken out of 

their homes and out of their work, would like to finish 

their job and go home early.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I think you have a good 

argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors, 

in particular Mr. Laws.

 MR. BRIGHT: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But my understanding is you 

never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme 

Court. Is that correct?

 MR. BRIGHT: Not Mr. Laws specifically, but 

you can look at the other people that are mentioned in 

Justice Kimball's dissent. Mr. Yeager had something

coming out on Sunday; he wanted to get home for that. 

Brandon Burns --

JUSTICE ALITO: But the arguments as to each 

of them are different. The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I 

think is much weaker. He had one event on a Sunday and 

he was told you don't have to worry about that, this 

case is going to be over by Sunday.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: So that's quite different 

from somebody -- it could be quite different from 

someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws. Isn't that?

 MR. BRIGHT: Actually the reason they say 

they're concerned about Mr. Brooks is because he was 

told, your dean says it won't be a problem. And he says 

okay. No further expression of worry by him.

 There is, by the other jurors, that were 

accepted -- they all say on the record I need to get 

back to my job, to my family. Mr. Burns -- a single 

parent, teenagers, 89-year-old grandparents that he 

wants to get back to. All of those people accepted by 

the State. And Justice Kimball deals with some of those 

in her dissenting opinions, and they're briefed up to 

the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this case.

 But I believe Miller-El III -- or II --

dean could resolve his problem.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, he's the dean.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The man's problem, what 

he's worried about is that he has to put in a certain 

number of hours of teaching. And what was it? A couple 

of months before the end of the term? It was going to 

be very --

MR. BRIGHT: No, this was in August. This 

was right before the Labor Day weekend in August. The 

term went all the way to December, Justice Scalia. And 

he, at this point -- Brooks -- was just observing 

someone else teach. I mean, he wasn't teaching himself.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever. He had to be 

there to observe. He had to put in a certain number of 

hours. How could the dean say oh, don't worry, it's no 

problem?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The hours requirement is a 

requirement for the degree. I don't think deans have 

the ability to -- to waive degree requirements.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, with all due respect, 

Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the dean was just 

saying oh, he'll be able to do it, and --

MR. BRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that wouldn't inspire a 

great deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, again, it would have only 

taken one question. One question -- Mr. Books, now that 

you've heard that your dean said it won't be a problem, 

do you have further concerns about wanting to get home 

quickly? Mr. Brooks --

JUSTICE SCALIA: My reaction would be --

would depend on how he said okay. And if I were sitting 

there as the trial judge, I -- I could discern whether 

okay meant well, you know, that's what he says but I'm 

still going to have a hard time digging out those hours 

for the remaining time that I have in the term. I don't 

know how he said okay.

 MR. BRIGHT: If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If --

MR. BRIGHT: If I could answer that 

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

 If you're the lawyer standing there beside 

him and he says what you just said, then you ask him one 

question. But there's a professor, Sanders; he's not 

watching class; he's teaching class at the start of a 

semester at the University of New Orleans; and he 

doesn't -- it is no speculation. With Brooks it's all

speculation. With Sanders --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With Brooks, what he 

said when he said I'm missing right now something that 

will better me towards my teaching career, and they 

say -- and the judge says, is there anybody who could 

speak to it? And he says, I've already talked to the 

dean. And so based on the initial conversation with the 

dean he was still worried.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then the judge calls 

the dean, and of course the dean's going to --

MR. BRIGHT: No problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what 

he's going to say to the judge. When Brooks talked to 

him, apparently there was a problem because his concern 

remained after having talked to the dean.

 MR. BRIGHT: Brooks doesn't say there's a 

problem. He gives the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He says I'm missing 

right now --

MR. BRIGHT: Something that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Something that could

the jury, you're not going to be allowed to communicate 

with anybody. You're going to have to stay out at the 

Travelodge while this case is going on. Of course, he 

doesn't say at that point how long it's going to be. 

And 44 people come forward. But all -- with most of 

those people, like with Brandon Burns, who has got to 

get back to his landscaping business, Mr. Laws who's has 

to get back two homes he's building; his wife is 

recovering from surgery and taking his children to 

school every day -- all those people are assured this 

case is going to be over by Saturday; it's not going to 

go very long. This argument that they were worried that 

the jury might be out for a long time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

your answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a 

problem. He says, I've already missed half a day. 

There's something I'm missing right now that will better 

me towards my teaching career. He says I've already 

talked to the dean.

 How can you say he isn't identifying a 

problem?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, he -- he's saying, again, 

not knowing how long this is going to last, or what's 

going to be expected of him -- right now I'm missing 

something to help my education. Everybody is missing

something that's going to help them in their job, with 

their families, or whatever.

 But once the judge calls him back up to the 

bench and says, we've talked to the dean. He said it is 

not going to be a problem for you to be here, most 

students I know -- and I know a lot of you have had 

experience with students -- once they're assured by the 

dean that it's not going to be a problem, it's not going 

to be a problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the assurance is 

only secondhand, right?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I think when the judge --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When the dean says it's 

okay, that's all right.

 MR. BRIGHT: The judge of the court, the 

presiding judicial officer there, says we've talked to 

your dean, and it's not going to be a problem for you to 

be here this week. And everybody is told this week 

we're going to try this case. This is a Labor Day 

weekend coming up. We know you will send the jury out 

on Friday afternoon. You're not going to wait too long 

for that verdict probably. And everybody is told --

you're going to be out of here by Saturday. Mr. Yeager, 

you're going to be out of here by Sunday.

 So we're talking really about Mr. Brooks

missing three more days. This is on Tuesday. This case 

is over on Friday.

 And everybody knew it was going to be over 

on Friday, because they told jurors over and over and 

over again that it was going to be over by Friday, so --

or Saturday at the latest.

 So I -- I would say, again, no questions 

asked. The lawyers had an opportunity right there when 

they told him the dean says it's not a problem. Then 

later he's called in panel 1. You can ask -- you see 

this voir dire. It is very interesting. It is very 

short, but the lawyers could ask individual questions to 

any juror out there on the panel. Mr. Brooks, 

do you have any concern that you won't be able to 

concentrate because you need to get back to school?

 They asked that question over and over, as 

we pointed out in our brief, of white jurors. In fact, 

the Louisiana Supreme Court, in what I think is one of 

its great legal errors --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose you are trying 

this case. You are a defense attorney, and you ask a 

juror, a potential juror: Would you hold it against a 

defendant who doesn't take the stand? And the initial 

answer is: I have to think about that. I'm not quite 

sure.

Now -- and then you go on, and you ask a lot 

of questions, and the juror comes around to saying: I 

understand that's a person's constitutional right. They 

get the -- advice from a lawyer. It doesn't necessarily 

mean the person has something to hide, et cetera, et 

cetera.

 Does that additional questioning allay the 

concern that you would have had at the beginning about 

the fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I think you have to look 

not only at those answers but -- but what the court in 

Miller-El II said were the side-by-side comparisons.

 If you're asking the white jurors follow-up 

questions to determine that, then that, I think, cuts 

very much against the prosecution and supports an 

inference of racial discrimination.

 If you basically asked everybody about the 

same thing, you can't draw that inference.

 But the Louisiana Supreme Court said here 

there was consistent questioning of the jurors about 

whether whatever their other obligations were, it would 

interfere with their ability to sit as jurors. There is 

consistent questioning of everybody except Jeffrey 

Brooks. And that's the one African-American who the 

court -- who the prosecutors then say they're striking

for that reason.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bright, the Judge was 

quite passive, and was -- was the judge, in fact, 

present throughout the entire voir dire?

 MR. BRIGHT: I -- I think the judge was 

present, but he was quite passive. One of the more 

remarkable aspects of this jury selection is when he 

grants a defense strike for cause, the prosecutor, 

Mr. Williams, says -- are you crazy?

 And the judge says: No. And they go right 

on to the next fact.

 You know, I -- I practiced law for 30 years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like the right 

answer to me.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BRIGHT: It wasn't the right question. 

I've often wondered about that, but I've never 

articulated it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BRIGHT: And I think most lawyers 

wouldn't.

 There's another point where Williams tells 

the judge: Swear all these people to say they've got a 

valid reason for leaving, and send them all out of here 

-- swearing people to say something that may be true or

may not be true.

 And the judge says: Well, do I do it 

individually, or do I do it in a group?

 He says: Do it in a group. Just have them 

all swear that they've got a legal reason, a hardship 

reason, to be excused.

 And the judge goes right along with it.

 I think what we see with the judge in every 

ruling here is four or five words: I'm going to allow 

it. I'm going to allow it.

 The judge is not engaged in questioning. 

Unlike Uttecht v. Brown that Justice Kennedy wrote about 

last term where you have a judge involved and hearing 

the lawyers and whatever, that's not present here.

 So I think that when you look at that 

factor, you don't have assurance that this judge was 

involved in a way to make sure that the credibility 

determinations which were being made -- and the other 

point I would make is here he's ruling on the Batson 

strikes as the jury is being selected. So he doesn't 

have all of the information.

 Now, he does rule again on the motion for a 

new trial. That's the only time that all of the 

information, all of the relevant information, is before 

the judge. But, there again, all he says is I think the

prosecutor's reasons were race-neutral.

 There is no indication that he went beyond 

that to consider what Batson said and what Miller-El 

says we have to consider, which is all the relevant 

factors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Bright, may I ask, in 

your judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson 

relevant at all to what is before us?

 MR. BRIGHT: I think it is, Justice Stevens, 

and I think, even if you don't look at the closing 

argument, which tells you two important things -- first 

of all, the prosecutor broke his promise to the judge 

that he wouldn't mention it. He said as an officer of 

the court, I will not mention it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do 

with anything?

 MR. BRIGHT: It has to do with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So he broke his promise. I 

mean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has 

anything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was --

MR. BRIGHT: It has to do with his 

credibility, which is very much what Batson is about. 

But -- but to the O. J. Simpson case, I think the 

prosecutor's obsession with O. J. Simpson -- a month 

before he mentions it in a pretrial hearing.

The defense moves to ask to quit referring 

to the O. J. Simpson case in the media; and, for 

goodness sakes, Judge, don't let him refer to it before 

the jury.

 And the -- the defense makes quite clear: 

The polls show that the society is divided. This was 

ten months ago that Simpson came down. It is a very 

polarizing case. The fact that he is mentioning it is 

going to inject racial prejudice into this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

explanation that was given that this was referring to 

the defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than 

anything to do with race?

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, I think, Chief Justice 

Roberts, it doesn't have anything to do with that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What doesn't have 

anything to do with it?

 MR. BRIGHT: The fact of whether or not 

Mr. Snyder was, in fact, suicidal is not rebutted in any 

way by bringing in the most racially polarizing case in 

the country and saying that Simpson was trying to get 

away with it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not just 

racially polarizing. I mean maybe it is that, but it is 

also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.

MR. BRIGHT: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same as here.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well, there are a lot of 

similarities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And then feigned a mental 

illness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is 

-- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to 

bring before the jury.

 MR. BRIGHT: Well -- and he said Simpson got 

away with it. Snyder couldn't have possibly known that, 

because the verdict in Simpson didn't come down until 

after Snyder's crime had been committed.

 So he couldn't have been imitating, if that 

is what he was arguing -- he couldn't have been 

imitating O. J. Simpson. I -- I think what this 

prosecutor learned from O.J. Simpson, Justice Stevens, 

is that you don't let blacks on the jury.

 I mean I think he saw that this racially 

mixed jury in Los Angeles let him -- quote -- "get away 

with it," and we're going to have an all-white jury here 

in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. And unlike what 

happened out there, we're not going to let -- of course, 

this was at the penalty phase. He could only get life 

without parole or the death penalty. He wasn't going to 

get away with anything. But that was the way it was

pictured to the jury: That if they didn't give him the 

death penalty, he would get away with it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the relief you 

are requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the 

conviction?

 MR. BRIGHT: No, Chief Justice Roberts. 

This was in striking the jury, and there's no prejudice 

requirement with race. Allen Snyder is entitled to a 

new trial with a fair jury that represents the 

community. So I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- even 

though your theory is that it was only with respect to 

the penalty that the bias -- you have no allegation --

MR. BRIGHT: Oh, no.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that this jury 

did not return a valid conviction. I thought your 

objection was with respect to the death penalty.

 MR. BRIGHT: No. Let me -- let me make this 

quite clear. Our objection is that when the jury was 

selected, in terms of the disparate questioning, 

disparate acceptance, failure to ask any questions, 

racial prejudice infected the selection of the jury. 

All the O. J. Simpson case does is put a little icing on 

the cake. But if you look at the Miller-El factors and 

you consider them cumulatively, like Justice Kimball did

in her dissent, you come away once again with what the 

Court said in Miller-El. The evidence is too powerful. 

It all points in one direction, and that's intentional 

race discrimination. And that was in the jury. And if 

that happened, Allen Snyder is entitled to a new trial.

 If I could, I'd reserve the rest of my time. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Bright.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY M. BOUDREAUX

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 I had some prepared remarks to begin with, 

but I think I'd like to go straight into responding to 

some of the concerns that have just been raised.

 First of all, concerning Elaine Scott, the 

lady who said "I think I could." I think the record is 

quite clear that she was being asked about considering 

life imprisonment. Beginning at 364 of the joint 

appendix, the question is asked by the prosecutor four 

times: "Could you consider a sentence of life 

imprisonment?" "Could you consider the possibility of 

life imprisonment?" "Could you consider life

imprisonment?" "It is whether you could consider life 

imprisonment." You get to Ms. Scott, the answer is "I 

could." She's the lady who said originally, "I think I 

could." So the prosecutor's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As to life imprisonment or 

as to the death penalty?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: As to life imprisonment, 

Your Honor. As to death, she said "I think I could." 

When it got to life imprisonment, the full question 

asked four times, among various -- going down the list 

-- is when she said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this? I -- 364? 

Show me --

MR. BOUDREAUX: Beginning at 364 of the 

joint appendix, Your Honor. I just wanted to point out 

the question posed is regarding life imprisonment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: She was originally asked the 

question about the death penalty, and her response was 

the "I think I could."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bright contrasts 

that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white 

jurors who said "I think I could," and here there was no 

follow-up.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: That's true, Your Honor. In

-- in reviewing this record, there are instances where 

-- where there were not a lot of follow-up questions. 

We see the situation with Mr. Brooks. This jury, unlike 

the jury in Miller-El, which took five weeks, this jury 

took less than a day and a half to pick. So there were 

not a lot of probing questions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The explanation for 

Mr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face. This 

is -- was an incredibly short trial, was it not? 

Mr. Brooks is voir dired on Tuesday. And there's a 

death verdict on Friday.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the concern -- the major 

concern about him is that he's going to worry about 

missing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir. But you see --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you compare him to some 

of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws. 

Mr. Laws seemed to have a more compelling reason to be 

worried about not being -- about being in court. He was 

a contractor. He had houses he had to finish. His wife 

had recently had surgery. He was taking kids back and 

forth to the school.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir. Mr. Laws, like 

Mr. Brooks, I think it's good to point out, approached

the bench of his own volition. Other -- other 

individuals waited until they -- if they were called and 

were questioned. The way the proceedings began, when 

the venire were summoned into the courtroom, the judge 

introduced the staff, read the statutory requirements 

for jury service, and then they started lining up. And 

one of the people lining up to express his concern, not 

just about meeting the requirements to be a juror, was 

"I've got class, I've got" -- and I think it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laws was an 

identical -- he came up too. He said --

MR. BOUDREAUX: He did come up, and I think 

the distinction there, Your Honor, is that like several 

of others, unlike Mr. Brooks, in the end he said "I can 

make arrangements. I can deal with it."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I go back to Ms. Scott?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could I go back to Ms. 

Scott?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Ms. Scott?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. If you look at the 

top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I 

think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general 

question. And then he poses his question -- or she --

and goes around and gets an answer. Here is Mr. Lindey.

So they start out with the death penalty. They have 

some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366. Then the 

prosecutor says, "Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said 

you could not impose the death penalty." "Mrs. Goff --

Ms. Goff: I could consider the death penalty." "Ms. 

DuPont: I couldn't hear." Prosecutor: You could 

consider both?" "Yes, I would consider it." "Ms. 

DuBois: I could consider it. Yes." "Ms. Archonie: I 

could consider it." "Mrs. Alvino: I could consider 

it." "Ms. Scott: I could. I could."

 Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me 

-- to me. It seems that what they're talking about, 

each of them, is the death penalty because that's what, 

by the time they got to the top of 367, they were 

talking about. Maybe there's ambiguity there.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I haven't noticed in 

anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you 

just made.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I would submit that -- that 

would indicate ambiguity, Your Honor, that the 

prosecutor starts off with the life imprisonment 

question, and then it sort of morphed into a death 

penalty. But, by the time you get back to Ms. Scott --

JUSTICE BREYER: No -- well, there's -- I

just read you what it was, so I guess people make up 

their own mind about that. But by -- what I don't think 

you can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this 

prosecutor met with an answer that he considered not --

call it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs. 

Calligan, she said, "I'm not sure." That's more 

ambiguous than Mrs. Scott. And then he goes on, for 

three pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages 

later, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse 

her until she volunteers, "I could give a verdict -- I 

don't think I could give a verdict to take someone's 

life."

 And it's at that point that the prosecutor 

excuses her.

 Now, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started 

out saying "I think I could" and then, as I read it, 

said "I could." Now, that's the kind of comparison 

here. No follow-up. At the worst, minor ambiguity.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. What --

JUSTICE BREYER: And a slight hesitation. 

Now, what do you say to that?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: One of the weaknesses in 

some these jurors is a lack of follow-up questions. But 

I think we go back to her original comment, which was so 

softly spoken that the defense attorney said "I can't

hear you." There's nothing --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that, of course, is a 

problem I have generally in this area. We can always 

imagine that things that are not in the transcript, 

perhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is 

"I hate the death penalty. I'll never -- I'll never 

apply it under any circumstances." And I grant you, if 

that's the law, we are never going to find that there's 

any prejudice. But I just don't see how that could be 

the law.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: In the totality of her 

responses, the ones that were heard which are on the 

record and the ones which were not heard which are not 

on the record, the prosecutor felt that she was weak on 

the death penalty. And that on its face is a 

race-neutral reason.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course -- sorry.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Well, I would just say that 

the -- we're talking here with the prosecutor's 

perception of the juror based on her answers and the the 

trial court's perception in evaluating the prosecutor's 

proper race-neutral reasons.

 Could someone look at this and say it's to 

the contrary? Yes. But in the -- in the totality of 

the circumstances and the reviewing for clear error with

the benefit, of course, that the trial court has in 

being present, hearing or not hearing what was said, the 

tone of voice, the demeanor, the mannerisms, the 

deference's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There -- there isn't much 

reason, is there, to think that the trial court was 

being very critical of the prosecutor's answers? My 

recollection is that, after the O. J. Simpson remark had 

been made in final argument, that the ultimate 

resolution of that involved the trial judge saying that 

one reason that was not a racially significant remark 

was that the prosecutor had neither -- had mentioned 

neither the race of the defendant nor the race of O. J. 

Simpson.

 Now that is not a critical mind at work, is 

it?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I would -- I would suppose 

not, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And because --

MR. BOUDREAUX: The objection was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And because you suppose not 

and I certainly suppose not, the -- the fact is that we 

have to -- we have to consider the O. J. Simpson remark

in trying to evaluate what went on, in trying to 

evaluate, for example, the lack of critical follow-up in 

-- in a disparate way by the prosecutor. And that, in 

fact, is a fair and potent argument that the other side 

has, isn't it?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. I would 

like to respond to that by pointing out, though, that 

the reference to the O. J. Simpson case was based on the 

factual similarities involving the O. J. Simpson case 

and this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you believe that, if 

there had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson 

case would have been mentioned?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor, and I 

believe if the O.J. Simpson case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: See, I'd be candid -- I 

will be candid to say to you, under the -- under the 

circumstances of the record in front of us, I find that 

highly unlikely. And because I find that highly 

unlikely, I put significance in the O. J. Simpson remark 

which even you concede is significant.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. But I 

think the -- the reason it doesn't fatally infect the 

proceedings with racism is -- I think the comment would 

have been made had O. J. Simpson not been white -- I

think perhaps the comment would have been made had it 

not been O. J. Simpson but some other high-profile white 

athlete celebrity; and I think it is appropriate, 

putting aside for the moment the assurance to the court 

that he wouldn't mention it -- but it was in response to 

the defense counsel's argument. This defendant was 

tried on a plea of not by season of insanity. The 

murders are committed; several hours later he's 

barricaded in his house, calls the police claiming to be 

suicidal; the police respond.

 He gets up, unbarricades the door, lets the 

police in; then goes back into his fetal position. To 

rebut the -- this perhaps he's thinking, and I think it 

is significant in Defense Exhibit 2 at trial, what --

the defendant's statement taken several hours later, 

he's oriented; he's aware of the situation; he knew he 

had done something wrong, was in -- and was in trouble.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Boudreaux, even 

if -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation 

was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you --

do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy 

if there had been a black juror on the jury?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I think he would have, Your 

Honor. I know the contention is that he didn't, but I 

think the facts are clear on this record that it was not

an appeal to race, but it was an appeal to what was a 

historical fact, common knowledge among most people in 

the country, and the facts of this case. The 

defendant's statement as I said would betray no mental 

lack of wherewithal. When the search warrant was 

executed his bloody shirt was found in the attic of his 

house. That's at page 1311 of the record. It is not in 

the -- it's not in the joint appendix. But when the 

defense attorney brings up the police coming to the 

house and -- and he agreed that the police officer's 

testimony was correct, he's in a fetal position; he's 

saying they're coming to get me, I'm suicidal, the 

defense attorney is bringing up the mental aspects of 

this case. So I think it was appropriate for the 

prosecutor to look at the record and -- and to rebut 

that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before the 

rebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising 

this as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney 

said please, Judge, get him to stop saying that. This 

is long before -- you are painting a picture of someone 

who was answering an argument made by the defense, but 

this prosecutor initiated it, and the defense attorney 

was reacting. She said judge, he's talking in this 

county, that county about this is his O. J. Case; stop

him from doing that.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he says I'm an 

officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: That's correct; and then he 

believes -- despite his assurances, when the defense 

attorneys made the argument they made, they were 

inviting that -- that response.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you 

believe that it would have been appropriate at that 

point for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any 

case from any state in which a criminal defendant had 

unsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide --

for the jurors to decide that this defendant is -- is 

feigning insanity?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I think any historical fact 

well known to people would have been fair game. Just as 

an analogy, remember this situation. The jury is 

instructed, argument of counsel is not evidence; take it 

for what you think it's worth. This was the historical 

reference this prosecutor used: The facts are similar.

 Contrast that with the -- or -- kind of, 

almost similar to that when we're talking about racism 

being part of these proceedings, one of the amicus 

briefs refers to David Duke. If Your Honor is not

David Duke is high profile Ku Klux Klan. In some of the 

voir dire in this case, at page 221, 222 of the joint 

appendix, it is defense counsel who brings up David 

Duke.

 Now you understand if David Duke was on 

trial here today and we had a photo album of him in his 

robes, he would still be entitled to a fair trial. So 

she's using --

JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. He's entitled to 

a fair trial without prejudice.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So I think you have two 

instances here. One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr. 

Brooks. And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read 

in the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy, 

because he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid 

he's going to miss some student teaching time which will 

count against him.

 MR. BRIGHT: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What it says is the clerk 

called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't 

worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told. He's 

challenged for that reason. He might still worry about 

it. But Mr. Laws is not. And Mr. Laws is a

 Okay? He's not challenged.

 So we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried 

about his wife and his business which going down -- you

there, Your Honor, is that Mr. Brooks needs to make

either made his requirements to graduate, or he has not. 

The people with the jobs, the contractors, their jobs 

are there when they got -- when they got out of court, 

when trial was over. If Mr. Brooks didn't meet his 

requirements, he was not going to graduate. And I would 

be a little careful to take it as face value from the 

judge's law clerk calling the dean who then -- she comes 

back and says it is a 300-hour observation. That's 

obviously wrong.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I wouldn't take it at 

face value if there had been a further question asked of 

Mr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have 

nothing to worry about? And he says well, gee, boy, I 

sure hope I -- I'm able to make that requirement. But 

nobody asked that question.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Nobody asked that question.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All we have is got is 

"okay" on the one hand and "I can make arrangements" on 

other.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: We also have, Your Honor, as 

far as the question of Mr. Brooks is concerned, a fact 

that is not articulated by the prosecutor but which 

would be supported by the record. He's an education 

teacher; he's young; prosecutors in a death penalty case 

I think would shy away from asking or leaving on a jury

with that, but maybe that's not who a prosecutors 

seeking a death penalty --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we have to 

go -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry 

for any appellate court, even when we go into the 

allegations that the prosecution did make.

 Now you're saying we also have to imagine 

other reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons 

why he struck, but which might have been. You really 

think that that's enough to --

MR. BOUDREAUX: That's the problem with this

 MR. BOUDREAUX: The plausibility of the 

prosecutor's reasons stand or fall on what he says. The 

other things perhaps the court will say he didn't say 

that; we're not going to consider them.

discretion, Your Honor, the deference afforded the trial 

court who is present for the proceedings, who is there, 

passive or otherwise. He's there. He sees what's going 

on, the demeanor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about Juror 

Hawkins. You haven't talked much about him.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Hawkins?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why did they strike him? 

He seemed to me to be a pretty good juror for the 

prosecution.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Your Honor, that's a 

question I've asked myself; and I can't -- I'm not --

you would think on the surface of it he would have been 

a good juror for the State. What I think is equally 

clear is that the defense would -- objected to his being 

excused but didn't make a Batson claim because I don't 

think they wanted to go there. They would not have 

wanted that juror on their jury. He said he had --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't he struck before 

they back-struck the first black on the jury?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I believe so, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that probably explains 

why they didn't make a Batson objection.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, you're correct about 

that. But I think he would have not -- the jurors --

the defense perhaps would have struck him. He testified 

that he had plenty friends who were police officers in 

this jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand why the 

defense would have struck him. I'm trying to understand 

why the prosecutor --

MR. BOUDREAUX: Well, we don't know that, 

Your Honor, because there was no Batson objection 

raised, and the prosecutor was not called upon to 

articulate any reasons.

 On the face of it, he looks like he could be 

a good juror. But that's a factual matter that the 

trial prosecutor, then and there, made that decision. 

And I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: He knew nothing about that 

juror except what Justice Stevens and you have just been 

reciting. If that's all you knew and you were a 

prosecutor, would you have struck him? Would you have 

said: I don't want -- I don't want anybody on this jury 

who's got friends in the police department? Would you 

have struck him for that reason?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Well, I can say, Your Honor, 

that's not the first time that's happened over years in 

different -- different trials that I've reviewed.

reason one black member. Let's call it five.

 And then they start challenging black 

members. Obviously, he didn't at the beginning impose 

any Batson claim. He had no Batson claim. There were 

five people on the jury who were black. What claim 

could you make?

 And then after you begin to get suspicious 

and start to make them, now they do this thing called 

black strike and they get everybody off the jury.

 How is it supposed to work?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I would disagree they would 

not have a Batson claim to make when the first black is 

struck if they felt there was evidence of that one --

JUSTICE BREYER: They don't know.

can't -- so long as you have some black on the jury, you 

can strike the rest.

curious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question. 

When they go back and back strike at that point can the 

defendant say I don't think you can back strike this 

juror you're doing it on the basis of race.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: They can go back and back 

strike, but the defendant could say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can go back and 

back strike.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can go back and 

object to the back striking? The State would say, well 

here's the reasons we're back striking.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: The back strike is when is 

the challenge exercised. In and of itself you can't say 

if it is racial or not. It is a challenge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That was my question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: My problem -- after the 

back strike of the first black juror who had been 

accepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the 

jurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption 

that there would no --

MR. BOUDREAUX: I think under Miller-El and 

related decisions that would be part of the totality of 

the circumstances. The practical problem --

That was the point that you made.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the third -- the 

back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone 

back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: That could have been argued 

evidence for them to make their prima facie case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.

 There's some ambiguity in your answer. 

Miller-El says others who were struck can be considered 

as part of the totality. My question is -- can they go 

back and object not only to the back struck juror, but 

as Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't 

objected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person 

on the jury?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: To give you a yes or no 

answer, yes. The practical problem with that is those 

two jurors having previously been excused, could be on 

the way to their office or back to their home.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Still, the 

prosecutor is still there. You can ask the prosecutor, 

why did you strike that juror?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, you could. Yes, you 

could. Then you have got a practical problem what if it 

doesn't pass muster. That's the reason for the

contemporaneous objection rule.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you one other 

question. You are the only one who will know the answer 

to, this too. I noticed in looking at the opinion of 

the Louisiana Supreme Court that they start out by 

saying we have conducted another review of the voir dire 

transcript and find nothing there to disparage the 

Batson claim. In reading that opinion in several places 

they refer to their having gone back and having read the 

whole transcript themselves.

 And then they have two full pages, or one 

and a half anyway where they seem to be talking about 

what happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to 

that prior review and covered a factor favorable to the 

State's use of a peremptory challenge.

 They went back and found a factor of 

favorable to. Now, was that factor argued to them in 

the brief? Do you remember that?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I wrote the brief, Your 

Honor, but I don't think -- I don't remember.

might know.

it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking 

about how a judge can't think of everything. But if 

they're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them, 

they ought to think of it for both sides, and not just 

for one side.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: You know to be honest, 

Justice Scalia's comment about looking at the record and 

saying oh, here is another reason that the prosecutor 

didn't articulate.

 Similarly, Your Honor, in reference to the 

Thomas Hawkins being struck with no objections -- there 

was -- Greg Scott was a black juror of peremptory struck 

by the State. Again with no objection. If you want to 

talk about -- if we're talking about two or five here, 

little weight should be given to the exercise of those 

two. Greg Scott -- again like the other juror, I don't 

think was going to survive the challenge by the defense. 

His wife was the victim of a carjacking, and he said if 

he was a defendant and he was innocent, he would 

testify. He would need to testify.

 And in this case, the defendant did not 

testify at either phase of the proceedings.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like 

to ask you a question before you finish. It is not an 

issue in this case, but we are told that

African-Americans are 20 percent of the population of 

Jefferson Parish, but they were less than 11 percent of 

the people summoned for jury duty.

 Is that typical?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Certainly pre-Katrina, Your 

Honor. Yes. The summons go out based on public 

records, driver licenses, voters registrations. That's 

basically at random. To say those numbers would not 

surprise me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and because 

it's almost half of what you would expect.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, and that's going to 

vary, you know, from venire to venire on any given day.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: In the minute or two I have 

left, Your Honors, I would just remind the Court, urge 

the Court to consider its recent opinion last June in 

Uttecht dealing with the deference due the trial court 

in these types of proceedings -- that was a habeas case 

-- what the opinion says to require on direct review, 

and according to the trial court, the deference having 

been present and not just relying on a cold record, that 

the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling should be farmered.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the deference 

in Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror --

than in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue 

of racial discrimination?

 MR. BOUDREAUX: I'm not sure I understood 

the question, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Uttecht --

MR. BOUDREAUX: Whether it's going to the 

issue --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Uttecht was a death 

qualified juror --

MR. BOUDREAUX: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and this is a Batson 

case.

 MR. BOUDREAUX: Right, and it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of our concerns in 

the Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a 

different standard of deference for the trial court? I 

think your --

MR. BOUDREAUX: No. Because you're 

still dealing with --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We haven't discussed 

this --

MR. BOUDREAUX: -- of a factfinder. 

Obviously, there's some differences in Uttecht being

habeas and Witherspoon, but the similarities, I think, 

are enough that this -- the degree of deference has to 

still be there, although there's a statutory deference 

in a habeas.

 Thank you.

Mr. Boudreaux.

 Mr. Bright, you have three minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 If I could just say, first of all about, 

this backstrike, because what we see here is after 

Elaine Scott is struck, that's State number 6, the very 

next peremptory strike by the State it, number 7, is to 

go back and backstrike Jeffrey Brooks.

 Now, notice that with regard to the other 

four backstrikes used, two by the prosecution and two by 

the defense, it's at the very end of the process. It's 

literally when they're down to one juror. Williams 

says, "Do we have 11 jurors?" And then he backstrikes. 

The defense says, "Is this my 11th strike?" Backstrike. 

Williams then, "Are we back to 11?" So these -- the 

only way the backstrike makes sense really, when you

think about it, is to look at the whole jury and then go 

back and cull out the ones based on a comparison.

 But once Brooks had kept them from striking 

Mr. Scott, who as Mr. Boudreaux pointed out, his wife 

was robbed at gunpoint, said he would testify if he were 

a defendant in a case and was innocent.  And then as 

Justice Stevens pointed out, Hawkins, who was -- had 

grown children, engineer, friends in the police 

department -- these two are not struck -- but then once 

Elaine Scott is struck, the third back and the Batson 

challenge is made, we don't have any use for Jeffrey 

Brooks anymore, so he's -- the backstrike is used in 

that way.

 And I think, again, when you look at all the 

relevant circumstances, it's pretty clear what was going 

on here with the acceptance of Brooks at the start and 

the backstrike --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

your friend on the other side, that you could have 

objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors 

to whom you -- with respect to whom you did not object 

because there was -- the juror that was later backstruck 

on the jury?

 MR. BRIGHT: I -- I think yes. The answer 

to that is yes, and I think, if the defense had, we'd be

talking about four jurors here today instead of two. 

But it doesn't diminish from what the Court in Miller-El 

called the numbers. The fact that it is unlikely to be, 

by chance, that all five -- all five African-Americans 

are struck in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Although you could have 

made an objection. As I understand your opponent, he 

very helpfully said that they probably would have left 

the courthouse --

MR. BRIGHT: They would.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So what could you --

MR. BRIGHT: So they're gone. And so if the 

objection had been overruled --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The objection would 

have afforded the state an opportunity to present the --

if there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they 

struck the juror.

 MR. BRIGHT: But the reason for doing that 

would be to have the judge not allow the strike and to 

put that juror in the box and the juror' gone now. So 

that, as a practical matter, is not going to work. 

There's no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason to do it 

would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to 

those jurors.

MR. BRIGHT: But there's no procedural rule 

in Louisiana that says you have to do that. It might 

have been a stronger case if they had done it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe your rule here that 

-- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason 

for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason 

when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to 

set forth a good reason.

 MR. BRIGHT: If I may answer.

 That only goes, though -- the only two 

jurors on the reasons that are before the Court are 

Jeffrey Brooks and Elaine Scott. But the fact that the 

prosecutor struck all five, and as Justice Souter points 

out, you wouldn't have made this argument, I don't think 

-- this O.J. Simpson argument -- not only depending upon 

the race of the defendant, but if there had been black 

people on that jury. This is an argument that resonates 

with an all-white jury.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Bright.

 The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
