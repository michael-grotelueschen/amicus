 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in case 09-5201, Barber v. Thomas, the 

Warden.

 Mr. Sady.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SADY: Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The phrase "term of imprisonment" appears 

three times in the first sentence of the Federal good 

time statute. The first two times the parties are in 

agreement. "Term of imprisonment" means "sentence 

imposed." The third use, which sets the rate for good 

time credit, also means the "sentence imposed" when it's 

used in the phrase "up to 54 days of good time credit 

towards the service of the sentence."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't always mean 

that. I think you say somewhere in your brief that it 

always means that. It surely does not always mean that. 

Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now. 

3624(d) says that, "Upon the release of a prisoner on 

the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau 

of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and

transportation."

 Now there the expiration of his term of 

imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of 

imprisonment. It means the assigned term of 

imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.

 MR. SADY: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless you think they are 

supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several 

months after he leaves.

 MR. SADY: Your Honor, that is a perfect use 

of "term of imprisonment" to mean actual time and any 

good time credits earned.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. SADY: And it uses the term "release." 

"Release" is defined in 3624(a), which says that you are 

released when you have your actual time served and any 

good time.

 The flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is 

that they do not give credit towards the term of 

imprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not addressing that. 

All I'm -- look, it -- the text says "upon the release 

of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of 

imprisonment." My only point is that that -- you have 

to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase "term of

imprisonment" that does not mean the sentence he was 

given, but rather means the sentence that he served.

 MR. SADY: I respectfully disagree because 

it expires. A term of imprisonment, a ten-year 

sentence, expires. When you have 311 days 10 times, 

that means it has expired, because you also are giving 

those 54 days of good time credits 10 times.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But why isn't the term of 

imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term 

that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed? 

So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5 

years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st, 

year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that 

year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st 

of the following year, and so forth.

 MR. SADY: Justice Alito, that would be the 

end of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of 

imprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the 

365 days that person has earned maximum good time 

credit -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Right.

 MR. SADY: That he should receive credit 

towards the service of the sentence. That means on the 

365th day he should move back on the calendar a

adjustment for good time and a reset for the next year. 

That way, if you have a ten-year sentence, you have ten 

opportunities to -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, hang on. I understand 

what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the 

term of imprisonment changes. We look at the -- we look 

at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is 

imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving 

the sentence, and you can say: Year one ends at the end 

of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011.

 Why do you think that the term -- the phrase 

"term of imprisonment" has to change as -- the 

understanding of the "term of imprisonment" has to 

change as the prisoner progresses in serving the 

sentence? I totally fail to understand that.

 MR. SADY: It doesn't change. It's still -­

the two components of a term of imprisonment are actual 

time and good time credits. So the way we are 

presenting it is the first year of the term of 

imprisonment is the 311 days of actual service and the 

54 days -­

JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't know whether 

that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to 

be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.

 MR. SADY: That's fine. We -- if the Bureau

of Prisons determines that the person should receive up 

to 54 days at day 365, then they receive credit towards 

the service of their sentence. That means moving it 

back 54 days because they didn't have to serve those 

days. And then you reset -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not sure where you 

get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the 

statute. But I still don't think you have answered my 

question. I don't want to belabor it too much.

 On the day when the prisoner in my 

hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said, 

When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year 

of your term of imprisonment end? You would say 

December 31st, 2010. When will the second year of the 

term of imprisonment end? December 31st, 2011. That's 

what you would have to say at that point, because you 

don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time 

credits. So why do you think that the meaning of the 

year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence 

goes on?

 MR. SADY: I do -- do not think it changes. 

I think that it is adjusted for good time, which is 

exactly what Congress intended. They said that every 

day, you get credit beyond time served. They use the 

phrase "beyond time served" for credit towards the

service -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- perhaps 

I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's 

question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at 

it.

 Why is it that we have to do the calculation 

that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days 

and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their 

very complicated ten-page number?

 Why can't they just take 54 days at the end 

of every year that there is actual service, and that the 

time served, plus whatever number of days have been 

earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment? 

So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days 

for whatever it is. At the end of the 9th year, he made 

up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it 

away from 10. He serves 9 and that. That would make 

sense of "beyond the time served" language that's in 

this provision.

 MR. SADY: Justice Sotomayor, we are not 

asking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when 

they determine whether they should receive it. We are 

saying, go ahead, assume exactly what they are doing 

now. Go up to 365 days.

 But they do make a determination. At that

point of making the determination, that's when they go 

back to 54 days and have to reset. That way on a 

10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress 

intended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in 

each of those blocks.

 Now, the way that we were hearing it posited 

from Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of 

time served without any adjustment, then we end up with 

a 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit 

8 opportunities to earn the 54 days.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, not at all. No. At the 

end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you 

would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice 

Sotomayor suggested.

 MR. SADY: And the -­

JUSTICE ALITO: And -- but it doesn't mean 

that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is 

predicated on the idea that service of year two begins 

on the 311th day.

 MR. SADY: If there is an adjustment for 

good time, because "term of imprisonment" is a term of 

art that doesn't mean time served only. It can mean -­

JUSTICE ALITO: But I don't understand that. 

I will not belabor it. I don't understand why the 

parties have spent so much time sparring over that

issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and 

irrelevant.

 MR. SADY: Justice Alito, if I could refer 

you to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those 

refers -- when they are talking about a term of 

imprisonment, each refers to it as "less good time." 

And -- and unless you do that, the reason -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, do you do it if 

you take (a), and (a) says: A prisoner shall be 

released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the 

expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10 

years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time 

credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence, 

as provided in subsection (b).

 MR. SADY: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So each year that he 

served, you add up the number of days he has served, the 

good time credit, and you subtract them from the 

120 months that you have given him, and you figure out 

when he's going to get out. You work backwards, not 

forward, the way everyone seems to be doing.

 MR. SADY: If you do that, you only end up 

with eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days. That's 

why it's the difference between -- I think anybody

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the way the 

language is written. So I mean you may want the greater 

opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase: Terms: 

At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the 

prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and 

subtract from it time credited towards the service of 

the prisoner's sentence.

 MR. SADY: We are going to -- the rate 

phrase is: Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the 

term of imprisonment.

 If there is a 10-year term of imprisonment, 

that means there's 10 opportunities to earn 54 days. 

The Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with 470 days, 

70 days less. And the reason for that is that they do 

not interpret "term of imprisonment" to encompass the 

possibility of good time.

 That is the only -- because you should have 

10 blocks of 365 days. Each of those blocks, you may be 

able to get 54 days. Then it's 311. But maybe you 

didn't earn any time. Then it would be a 365-block. 

But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress 

had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your 

term of imprisonment for good behavior.

 Even if you were misbehaving early in your 

prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity

to earn 54 days against that last 365 days. It counts 

for every word in the statute. It gives every statute 

meaning. And it doesn't put us in the position of 

giving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the 

same sentence.

 This Court has never found that phrases -­

two phrases, uses of "term of imprisonment" in the same 

sentence, mean different things.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do with -­

if -- it's a very short sentence? A year and a day, in 

your view, is a year and a day less 54.

 MR. SADY: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But 360 days, what do you 

do with that?

 MR. SADY: With 360 -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. If -- suppose it's 

for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.

 MR. SADY: If it says 366 days, so that the 

year -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, 360. In other words, 

short of a year.

 MR. SADY: Then it -- a 360-day sentence 

would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are 

agreed that "term of imprisonment" means a sentence of 

more than a year. So it has to be more than 365 days.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the person that gets a 

year and a day serves less than the person that gets 

less than a year?

 MR. SADY: That is correct. And district 

courts frequently address that problem. When you have a 

relatively short sentence, you say: Judge, could you 

give us -- instead of an 11-month sentence, could you 

give us a year and a day sentence, so that you could 

earn the good time on that?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you earn the good 

time? I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you 

are a good prisoner for a year.

 MR. SADY: That gets us to the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are going to let him 

out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't 

earned the good time in the year?

 MR. SADY: He has.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What did he do? How has 

he?

 MR. SADY: He has because of the last 

sentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or 

portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the 

two-step process. First, you figure out the projected 

release date, which is a release date with maximum good 

time. Then you make the decision about whether the

prisoner should receive that within six weeks of that -­

of that projected release date.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that still 

couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only 

42 days in six weeks.

 MR. SADY: That's only a measure when you 

make the determination. They -- they were recognizing 

that for the last period of time, or for a year and a 

day sentence, that you are not going to be able to do 

the time all the time, but you will, so that's why there 

is a special mechanism at the end.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm saying the special 

mechanism can't give the full 54 days.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because they don't make it 

until 42 days before the end of the sentence.

 MR. SADY: They make it until 311 days at 

the end of the sentence, because what they do is they 

make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time 

would be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a 

year and a day sentence, and they make that 

determination earlier.

 They say, okay, you have been good for that 

period of time. We recognize that this is going to be a 

problem, the same problem you would have on a sentence

of 10 years and 6 months, where you have to prorate the 

credit, 27 days instead of 54, half, and then figure out 

the projected release date with 180 days, subtract the 

27 days, and then make the determination sometime within 

the 6 weeks up to that last point.

 So that there is a mechanism for 

understanding that it is -- that in the last year there 

is going -- going to be an assumption that if you are 

behaving all the way up to -- in the full sentence -­

day 311, you should get the full 54 days.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sure there is 

something wrong with this predicate to this question, 

but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a 

determination of good time credit within 15 days after 

the end of each year of the sentence.

 MR. SADY: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They cannot make 

that determination within 15 days of the 311 days. And 

so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the 

full year, the 365 days.

 MR. SADY: Our position is that the Bureau 

of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases. 

We -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a 

statute, not write a policy statement. So we understand 

that there are going to be some mechanics of it. But

the mechanics in this work very easily with the 

assurance that they are receiving good time credit 

against the period of the sentence imposed by the judge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You treat each year 

of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good 

behavior, no?

 MR. SADY: Not necessarily. We are --

I'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that 

determination at day 365, that's fine, as long as they 

adjust by doing exactly what the statute says: Credit 

towards the service of the sentence, move it back 40 -­

54 days, and then reset. If you do that, you have 10 

blocks of 365 days.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do you do have to 

do that? I mean you read it. It so complicated. Just 

reading this, I -- I think the language should say this: 

10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence. At the end of 

the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of 

paper if he has done well.

 Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay? So 

January 2, after the first year, you write the word 

50 -- the number 54. And you do that each year. And by 

the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is 

you have got 432 days.

 So then you subtract the 430 days from 10

years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9 

years. So now you look at the last sentence, and what 

you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and 

you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298. 

And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days 

or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it.

 And that's following the statute, it seems 

to me, absolutely literally. And it also seems to me to 

make sense, because you don't want to give him credit 

for time he never serves.

 MR. SADY: Justice Breyer, I think it 

doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates 

an 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note 

that the sentencing table upon which every Federal 

sentence is predicated is based on 85 percent. That 

being -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't what the -­

if you want to know what the sentencing commission did, 

I think the best evidence of that is you read the 

introduction to the guidelines. And what the 

introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly 

speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time 

actually served before.

 Now, what to me that suggests is that the 

sentencing commission never considered this question.

And if there's something more specific than that, that 

shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because 

I don't trust memory.

 MR. SADY: Your Honor, we are relying very 

heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of 

the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by .85 

in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include 

good time. That means that every sentence has been 

calibrated based on assuming 10 opportunities to earn 

54 days, which -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the government 

contends it's none of the sentencing commission's 

business. It's up to the Bureau of Prisons. Isn't that 

the government's position?

 MR. SADY: That is their position. And our 

position is that it's -- administering the statute is 

the Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the 

minimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be 

served to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy 

decision, and that the policy is properly placed -­

JUSTICE BREYER: But there is nothing in 

there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a 

guideline. That's a staff conclusion. And the staff 

conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in 

the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is

that all of this was very approximate. I don't see 

how -- how -- a court would be bound by that.

 MR. SADY: I think that the court could be 

advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at 

a harsher sentence. Everybody is serving more time than 

-- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it 

was advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the 

sentencing table provided the initial baseline.

 And that initial baseline was boosted by 2.2 

percent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there 

is a very simple way for the court to construe the 

statute consistently throughout to conform the two, so 

that people are not serving 2.2 percent more time in 

custody than the sentencing table that every judge uses 

in imposing their sentence.

 We are institutionalizing a harsher system 

in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language, 

because the statutory language says "term of 

imprisonment."

 And if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years 

of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain 

meaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn 

54 days.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Sady, you -- you said 

something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more

workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent?

 Do we have any information on, (A), the 

number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in 

that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get 

the full credit and how many get something less than the 

full 54 days?

 MR. SADY: Justice Ginsburg, there are 

approximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about 

195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits.

 My anecdotal experience is that most 

prisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so 

it's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of 

that. There is some that have minor amounts, and there 

is a relatively smaller number, at least in my 

experience, who do not get a lot of it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? I'm -- I'm 

sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the 

math of this sometimes.

 Do you remember my example I just gave, you 

know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of 

paper?

 MR. SADY: Yes, the 419 -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I take it what you want is 

you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for 

54 days for that tenth year?

MR. SADY: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And the argument 

against that, reading the language and so forth, is, 

well, look this is an imaginary 10th year. He is not 

actually in prison for 10 years. He is going to be 

released sometime late in year 8. And so why should we 

add 54 days? I mean maybe it would be a nice thing 

because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would 

anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's 

never going to be served?

 MR. SADY: Each year is served in the -- if 

you take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the 

service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset 

that we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10 

opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when 

you are in -- you go to the last sentence that 

acknowledges that you are going to have to make some 

arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are 

going to decide that you have done well enough that you 

are going to be able to get the full credit for the last 

year.

 But the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by 

having the 54 days and actual time and that that's what 

happens at the first year, that's a 419-day first year. 

You can only squeeze 8 of those in. The prisoners look

at it and they see, plain statute, what was your term of 

imprisonment, how many ends of each year of a term of 

imprisonment should you have in a 10-year sentence. Ten 

years.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the statute says that 

it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the 

end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment 

beginning at the end of the first year of the term.

 MR. SADY: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, when does -- when is 

that point, in your opinion?

 MR. SADY: The Bureau of Prisons probably 

has discretion in administering. I'm accepting as a 

proposition on the day 365 they make that determination.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So the -- day 365 is 

the end of the first year of -- of the term of 

imprisonment?

making the determination. If they make a determination

 MR. SADY: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what I'm asking is, when 

is the end of the first year of the term within the 

meaning of that language?

 MR. SADY: The meaning of that language is 

day 3 -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 3 -­

MR. SADY: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it day 365, or is it day 

311?

 MR. SADY: It depends. And the reason it 

depends is because the language of the statute says 

"credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond 

time served," so if you do it beyond time served and you 

give him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of 

Prisons is making a determination. Once we -- they make 

their determination, and we respect that determination, 

we then have to go -- from the 365th day, back, because 

for 54 of those days he doesn't have to be there. He 

has earned that time and you can -­

various people who were there, which say that for this

when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of 

Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's 

interpretation. They're all going to let him out if 

it's a year and a day. They are going to let him out

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Justice Breyer, I think you stole my 

thunder. I wanted to explain how the bureau does it, 

and you laid it out exactly right. If you have -- and I 

think just looking at the language of the statute, it 

tracks perfectly. If you have a prisoner serving a 

10-year sentence and he comes in on January 1st, the end 

of his first year of imprisonment is December 31st, and 

on that date he gets 54 days taken off the back end of 

the sentence. That cycle repeats itself for the next 8 

years. And -­

JUSTICE BREYER: But the trouble with that, 

and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, 

because then -­

MR. WALL: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- we never considered it 

when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that 

time because the language was different.

 But now that you had have got this language

now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year. He is 

sentenced for a year and a day, you see. So literally, 

it says calculated on January 2 of the next year. But 

he's already been in for longer than he should be by 

that point. So you really have to calculate it before 

the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by 

October.

 And -- and -- and once you start calculating 

it before, the statute literally says, we are into a 

more complicated thing than I thought.

 MR. WALL: Well, and that's why they have 

the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the 

proration. So when the -- when the statute says, what 

it says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a 

sentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good 

time credit. So you are earning credit as you go 

through that first year.

 Congress knew then if you had have a year 

and a day sentence, you wouldn't be actually serving a 

full year because of the credits bringing you below the 

year mark. So what it does in the last sentence, it 

says if you are in your last year and that's a partial 

year, we prorate. So on your 319th day you have earned 

47 days of good time credit. Those combined equal a 

sentence of a year and a day, and you are out after your

319th day. On the hypothetical -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a premise flaw 

there. And that premise flaw is that you have told us 

that you don't earn the credit until the end of the 

year.

 MR. WALL: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer about 

this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your 

premise is not the same.

 MR. WALL: That's why for each full year 

served, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that 

you are making a determination at the end of the year 

for the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth 

year, as Justice Breyer pointed out -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not worried about 

sentences that are more than 2 years. I'm worried about 

the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day. How 

does that proration help that individual, since they are 

not going to get the good time credit until they've 

served a year?

 MR. WALL: So, the way this works is that 

for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or 

13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving 

credit through that first year, their good time credit 

brings them below a year. They'll never serve a full

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -­

MR. WALL: And what the law -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I'm saying 

to you. The whole brief says to us, they measure the 

entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first 

year.

 MR. WALL: Except for the last year or 

partial year. And what the final sentence of B1 says 

is, credit for the last year or portion of a year of the 

term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited 

within the last 6 weeks. So for the prisoner who has a 

year and a day sentence, his sentence is literally all 

proration. He is just serving a partial year.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is not going to get 

54 days? He's going to get -­

MR. WALL: That's right. On the 319th day 

he has come through about nine tenths of the year, he 

has accrued 47 days.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I just want to make 

absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward; 

I did the math backwards.

earned back for each year, and you take it off the full 

term of imprisonment.

 The -- you are representing to me that the 

math that is in your program statement is accomplishing 

that result?

 MR. WALL: Absolutely. Which is to say when 

the prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial 

year, he is not going to get the 54 days, he's going to 

get some portion of the 54 days, based on what part of a 

year he served. And that is prorated and credited 

within the last 6 weeks. Now, it's normally done on the 

release date. So in that 9th year for the 10-year 

prisoner -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt with 

one question? If he got a total of 540 or whatever it 

is, he should never enter the 9th year because he would 

finish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years.

 MR. WALL: Well -­

rather.

wouldn't be quite 2 years, but setting that to the

get it under your -­

MR. WALL: Well, under the government's view 

he can only earn good time credit when he is actually 

incarcerated. And what Petitioners are coming in and 

saying -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I understand. But 

explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of 

good time credit before the 10th year begins?

 MR. WALL: Well, so, if you take a 10-year 

prisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way 

it currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has 

accrued 432 days of good time credit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is more than a year.

 MR. WALL: Right. So he knocked off his 

full 10th year and he's knocked off a part of his 9th 

year. Now we are at that final 9th year, which is a 

prorated year. He has got 298 days left and by the 

260th day he earned 38 days of credit. So he is 

released after the 260th day of his 9th year.

 And as Justice Breyer pointed out, that 

precisely tracks the language of the statute. You do it 

at the end of each full year until you get to the last 

partial year, and then you prorate and you do it in the

last 6 weeks.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And each of those 4 years 

included 54 days of credit?

 MR. WALL: That's right. So the -- the 

Petitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has 

been incarcerated for over 17 years. At the end of each 

of his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of 

credit. What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am 

going to get 3 whole years knocked off the end of my 

sentence; I want the 54 days for those years, too.

 I want 54 days for every year of my sentence 

as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind 

bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the 

statute. Because the only way you can do that, as 

Justice Alito pointed out, is to read "year" to mean 

311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do, 

well, you can do the determination whenever. What they 

are saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should 

determine whether the prisoner gets the credit.

 But what the statute says is the 

determination itself has to occur at the end of the 

year. So you can't fold the 54 days into the year 

because you haven't made the determination yet.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I didn't understand 

them to be saying that. I understood them to be saying

that the determination could be made at the end of 

365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is 

entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be 

regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than 

the 366th day.

 MR. WALL: I think that's right, which first 

it is inconsistent with the language of the statute, 

which says at the end of each year, so that reads "year" 

to be an 311-day cycle. But it also sets up a very odd 

system. What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during 

days 312 and day 365?

 On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me, 

the new year has started on day 312. Now, but take the 

example, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day. 

Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that 

coming out of the first year or out of the second year.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think that they 

would say you won't know when the second year has begun 

until the full calendar year has been completed.

 MR. WALL: And I guess the -- the difficulty 

with that approach is that it seems to me that once the 

311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new 

311-day cycle on day 312.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they are just not 

vested until the year has -- the full year has passed.

MR. WALL: Well, so vesting is a little bit 

unique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none 

of the time vests under (b)(2) until they are actually 

released. But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I use it just 

in the calculating sense.

 MR. WALL: I see -- I see what you're 

saying. They could do the bookkeeping determination on 

day 365. But I don't think that's what's important. 

What is important is that on Petitioner's view, the 

second year, for credit purposes, has to start on day 

312. You have to have 10 blocks of 311 days and you 

have to be measuring after every 311th day.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, you don't 

measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin 

measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from 

311. And if he has behaved well during all -- all of 

those 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or 

whatever it is. And you begin the third year from then,

he has behaved well.

you're doing -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: He did. He did. You 

didn't give him the credit until he served the whole 

365 days. At that point, he gets the credit and you 

count the second year as though it begins on day 311.

 MR. WALL: Well, the -- I was half with you 

there.

 The bureau does do it by looking at what 

they do during the full year, from January 1 to 

December 31, and then it determines whether you get 

54 days knocked off the end of your sentence. What 

happens between day 311 and day 365 is not different 

than what happens during the rest of the year.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 MR. WALL: What the -- what the statute asks 

the bureau to determine is, at the end of each year, 

has, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated 

exemplary compliance with institutional regulations? So 

the prisoner has got to go a full year, a full 365 days, 

and be well-behaved. Then he gets 54 days taken off the 

back end of the sentence. And if that's the way that 

you're saying it should work, that is precisely how the 

bureau interprets the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that they're not

taking it off from the back end. They are taking it off 

from the next year. So that in the second year, if he 

-- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay? He 

behaves well for the next 365 days. The next year will 

begin at 622.

 But then he has to serve another 365 days 

before he gets good time credit. And then the next year 

will begin three times 311: 933. And so forth.

 MR. WALL: Justice Alito, I think that sets 

up an odd system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that right? See, he 

agrees with me.

 (Laughter.)

 No, I'm not saying that's right. I'm saying 

that that's -- that is what he is proposing.

 MR. WALL: No, I -- I agree. That is the 

difference. Petitioners think that you measure credit 

over these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you 

get to the 311th day, you take the 54 days of credit, 

and together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed.

 But what the statute says is you make the 

determination at the end of the year. And we don't read 

"year" to be a 311-day period. We read it to be a 

365-day period.

says, you know, you do make the determination on the 

365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having 

been a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days 

earlier, and then you start over.

 MR. WALL: But what -- that's right. But 

what the statute -- the statute doesn't just say, 

Justice Stevens, you make the determination at the end 

of the first year of the term. The determination is 

that during that year, the prisoner has displayed 

compliance. So he has got to display compliance through 

day 1 through day 365.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me interrupt and get 

one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he 

misbehaves in year 3. Does that just affect his good 

time credits in year 3, or does it mean he is canceled 

for years 1 and 2?

 MR. WALL: No. He can lose credit that he 

has accrued up to that point, but he can't lose credit 

that he has -- that he is eligible for in future years. 

So let's say that we are coming up on the end of the 3rd 

year. He's earned his full 108 days for his first two 

years, and he has earned some prorated portion. He can 

lose any of that, but he is still eligible going forward 

to keep getting 54 days at the end of each year.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But he can lose his

108 days?

 MR. WALL: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can he do that? 

I'm looking at page 14A of your appendix. It says: 

Such credit toward service of sentence vests at the time 

that it is received. Credit that is vested may not 

later be withdrawn.

 MR. WALL: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. I 

should have been more clear.

 For prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA, 

which was in effect from 1987 to 1994, you are right. 

And that is the SRA according to your brief.

 Their credit vests. That vesting 

requirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs 

prisoner's sentences since 1986. So for the vast bulk 

of prisoners in the Federal system who are subject to 

the PLRA, their credit does not vest until they are 

released.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, the -- if we 

consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 

15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent. It's a more 

workable number, and there are some hints in the 

legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent, 

not 87.2 or whatever it is.

 So in choosing between those two methods,

why not take the easier number to work with?

 MR. WALL: Well, two reasons. I think to 

the extent that you are suggesting the statute is 

ambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress 

with administering the statute in both Reno v. Koray and 

Lopez v. Davis. This Court deferred to the bureau's 

interpretation of other prisoner credit statutes. We 

think the bureau is equally entitled to the same 

discretion here to interpret this statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We -- if we disagree with 

that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this 

area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, 

suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?

 MR. WALL: Well, this Court's been clear -­

and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice 

Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this 

is not a criminal statute. It neither imposes a 

criminal prohibition on conduct nor -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you explain 

the Granderson case?

case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the 

proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable. I 

know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either. 

That was a parole revocation case.

 But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the 

Rule of Lenity apply? If the Rule of Lenity is thought 

of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning 

to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but 

doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that? It's a 

check against the power of the State, so that you simply 

mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the 

individual. In a case like this, apply the Rule of 

Lenity.

 MR. WALL: I think it's a check against the 

power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when 

it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition. 

But in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering 

what prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner 

credit statutes. 18 U.S.C. 3585 and 3621. And in both 

of those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation. 

And in both, it specifically rejected application of the 

Rule of Lenity.

 And I think the notion there is that this 

statute is not a criminal statute. It's about an 

administrative reward for compliance with institutional

regulations. And that's different from setting forth a 

prohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is 

sentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of 

a criminal offense -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Granderson case 

is cited in the brief for the National Association Of 

Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies 

to this area and it seems to me that it ought to.

 I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal 

statute. I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all 

the impact and force of the State detaining a person for 

a criminal act.

 MR. WALL: Well, it is a statute that 

determines in some sense how long you will be in prison, 

so I take your point. But it does so not by extending 

the penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering 

an administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part 

of the burden of that -- that penalty.

 And I am not aware of any case -- and I am 

obviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not 

aware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower 

court, finding that section 3624 is a criminal statute, 

as this Court's cases uses the term.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but isn't there 

another consideration? It's not the Rule of Lenity, but

it's something else we should take into account.

 In the -- in their reply brief, they say it 

costs about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular 

prisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is -­

something like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at 

issue in this case. It -- is -- you don't disagree with 

that general figure, do you?

 MR. WALL: I'm -- I think the basis for that 

is just math that the Petitioners have done. I don't 

have any independent basis for confirming or denying it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in any event, it's 

clear it's a lot of money. And -- and is that not a 

factor that we should be aware of in this case, because, 

all other things being equal -- assume the statute is 

totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one 

version will save the -- the government $100 million a 

year and the other version will cost it, is that -­

isn't that a factor we -- we should take into 

consideration?

 MR. WALL: I think it's a factor that the 

bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in 

the developing its interpretation as the agency in 

charge of administering the statute. But what the 

bureau has found is that it's method allows you to earn 

good time for all the time you are incarcerated, so you

always have incentive to follow prison regulations.

 And what Petitioners haven't responded to 

and the government's point in our brief that if you 

start measuring by 311-day cycles, you are assuming that 

they getting the full 54 days of credit. And to the 

extent that they don't, no matter how they calculate it, 

Justice Scalia, no matter what their matter of 

bookkeeping is, if they don't get the 54 days of credit 

for each cycle, there will be some corresponding period 

at the end of the sentence when they are serving time 

and they have already had their ten -- you know, their 

reviews and they are no longer eligible for the -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That's true. But the 

strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in 

his mouth because this is complicated. But I see it as 

this. Let's call that time you are talking about, that 

tenth year, phantom time.

 MR. WALL: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, you are saying don't 

put in any phantom time. And he's saying let's put some 

in.

 Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I 

think, for his is the following -- think about that 

first year. That first year we are going to calculate 

54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to

the number 311, right?

 But if you were to apply the last sentence 

to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't 

get 54. You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something 

like that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of 

Prisons system that it is 54. And, therefore, in 

respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom 

time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a 

sentence to a year and a day. If you had a sentence to 

a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody 

agrees with that, and that includes phantom time.

 So he said, well, if you include it for the 

first year, since the statute says nothing about the 

first year, why not include it for the other years, too? 

How can you possibly justify phantom time being included 

in the first year but not in the other years?

 MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I disagree with 

your premise. Someone sentenced to a year and a day is 

eligible for credit, but because that person is accruing 

credit as he serves, he will never actually get 54 days. 

By the time he gets to the 319th day, he has accrued 

47 days of credit, those combine to equal his 366-day 

sentence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, they 

don't let him out under 311?

MR. WALL: That's -- that's exactly -­

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, the Bureau 

of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year 

and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather 

they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the 

last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?

 MR. WALL: And that's exactly our difference 

with Petitioner's view. Exactly. What Petitioner -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- is that what 

happens?

 MR. WALL: Yes. Yes. He is released after 

the 319th day.

 And I think what Petitioners actually want 

is phantom time even in the first year. What they are 

saying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days, 

319 days, we want the full 54. So, instead of letting 

him out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom 

week in the first year.

 And, so, I think the way the bureau 

interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year. 

The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom 

time in every year, no matter the length of the 

sentence. As I said I think it creates a gap in 

coverage. It rests on this assumption that prisoners 

are always getting 54 days. That is just not the case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you disagree with your 

colleague that that is the case most of the time, that 

most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the 

ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?

 MR. WALL: There are no statistics on this, 

but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of 

prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these 

Petitioners have. But I would say that there are, say, 

15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat 

offenders, and they are often being docked to good time 

credit.

 So, I think what you will see is that the 

ones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones 

not getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently. 

And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is 

that no matter when you want to do that calculation, 

Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be 

looking at is a 311-day period, and you take the 

311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and 

together they give you a year of the sentence imposed.

 And not only does that not serve penological 

interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't 

track the language of the statute, which says during 

each year you have got to comply with the regulations. 

The statute cares not just about your conduct from days

1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365. All of 

those days are equal in the statute's eyes. If you want 

54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your 

sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the 

rules for a full year each time you want the credit.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this 

explanation that has been given in your brief and the 

one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it 

did, is there any statement outside of the penned 

affidavit that explains why this choice was made?

what -­

MR. WALL: Two points, Justice Sotomayor. I 

don't think the bureau has always taken the position 

that the statute is unambiguous. It has taken the 

fallback position, and it has prevailed on this position 

in a number of courts of appeals. And it is worth 

pointing out the bureau has prevailed in the First

that it had discretion to interpret the statute to the 

extended it was ambiguous.

 Your second point, what would you defer 

to -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, did they exercise 

discretion when they took the position that it was 

unambiguous?

 MR. WALL: As the pen declaration makes 

clear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix, 

when the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did 

that based on the statutory language and on making a 

policy choice to accommodate penological interest, 

ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to 

good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of 

their projected release dates. So, I think -- you know, 

the government has -­

deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in 

litigation to explain something that on its face is not

deference to an affidavit.

the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that 

the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion. So 

far as I know, the court has never faced that question 

but the lower courts have. And a number of courts of 

appeals faced with rulemaking and informal adjudication 

have accepted supplementation of the record with 

affidavits and declarations very much like this one. 

Because what we are talking about here is an affidavit 

from one of the agency's original decisionmakers.

 If this was just a post hyperactualization, 

I grant you it might not be enough. But this is one of 

the bureau's lawyers involved in the decisionmaking in 

the mid-1980's coming in and saying, here is why we

out.

 Why is it any different for an agency's

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I think it is 

different because that would be broadside in Overton 

Park. And what this Court said is if there is not 

enough in the agency action itself to enable judicial 

review, the right answer is not to set it aside, the 

right answer is to send it back to the agency to let the 

agency decision makers explain why they did what they 

did.

 And while that might normally be the right 

course here, the agency has already done that. It has 

put forward its explanation, so I think this is one of 

the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on 

Overton Park. We know why the agency adopted the rule, 

and it did it both because of the statutory language and 

because they thought it was the most sensible policy 

choice.

 And I guess I would turn it around a little 

bit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency 

charged with administering the statute, an agency to 

which this Court has twice deferred in the 

interpretation of similar statutes. That rule has been 

upheld as a substantive matter now in 11 courts of 

appeals.

 The Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a 

procedural basis, which has now been corrected by the

agency. It's a republished rule which corrects the 

infirmities that the court of appeals identified.

 And, so, the question is, faced with those 

facts, what would be the point of asking the government 

to recalculate 195,000 Federal sentences?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we sent cases 

back under Overton Park for an agency's description of 

history. I think we sent it back for the agency to give 

a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason 

or its past reason. It -- it's the current reason that 

counts.

 MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, even -- even if 

you thought as the court of appeals did that the rule

of appeals did, defer to the program statement under 

some level of deference, at least Skidmore.

about me.

 (Laughter.)

accept the -- the government's assertion here that 

that's the government's position.

MR. WALL: I -- I -­

(Laughter.)

 MR. WALL: My only point, Justice Scalia, 

was that whether you get there by deferring to the rule 

or by deferring to the program statement, as the court 

of appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it 

has come out in the same place, which is that by hook or 

by crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to 

answer this question. And I -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: You say there are 195,000 

sentences affected by this rule. I don't know which way 

that cuts. If there are 195,000 people spending more 

time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail 

than they should, that's kind of troublesome.

 MR. WALL: Justice Stevens, I think what I 

would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way 

since 1987. Congress has amended this statute five 

times in the last 20 years. It has never moved to alter 

the bureau's methods.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the cumulated -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: Probably they didn't 

understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to 

understand.

 MR. WALL: Justice Stevens, with all 

respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes.

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he's a lot smarter 

than I am.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even Justice Breyer has got 

it! Whoa!

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what we 

were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of 

prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than 

Marbury versus Madison.

 MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, that's true. I 

think the point is that the language of the statute has 

remained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau 

has interpreted that in a reasonable way. The language 

is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the 

bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11 

courts of appeals have deferred to it.

 And so I take your point that they are 

serving more time than under Petitioner's 

interpretation, but I don't think that that policy 

rationale is properly before this Court. It is properly 

before the bureau, which has found that policy 

consideration outweighed by other penological interests, 

and I think that's the judgment to which this Court

should defer, not its own judgment about how much time 

these prisoners should -- should be serving.

 And I do think it's important in that regard 

that Congress has returned the statute several times. 

And I take your point that it is complicated, Justice 

Stevens, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SADY: Thank you.

 The -- the idea that there could be time at 

the end of the sentences is premised on "term of 

imprisonment" mean "time served," which it cannot mean 

in the same sentence where it says "beyond time served."

 If you make the adjustment for good time 

credit that is earned at the end of the year, it is 

credit towards the service of the sentence; that means

that it's blocks of 365 days, that at the last day of 

Mr. Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he 

would be looking at 365 days. If he behaved well until 

close to the end, if we go to the last statute that says 

prorate the remaining period of time, the 30 -­

remaining 36 days he could earn, and credit it in the 

last 6 weeks, because they are doing that simply as an 

administrative technique.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so -- in your 

system they do the measurement at the end of the 

365 days. He misbehaves on the 340th day. And they say 

for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of 

full time -- of good time credit.

 MR. SADY: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now your year starts 

at 350?

 MR. SADY: 355. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, they said they are 

only giving you 10 days of good time credit. Because at 

the end of -- 355.

MR. SADY: 365, and if he behaves very badly 

he has to go all the way to the end of that 365 and 

doesn't get any adjustment, but if he -- next year he 

starts all over again for 365 days, and if he is very 

good he gets the 54 days.

 If I could address the question that was 

raised by Justice Ginsburg on the Rule of Lenity. I 

would like to point out that in the -- we have relied on 

both R.L.C. and in -- on Granderson for your 

articulation of the Rule of Lenity as it would apply in 

this case. Which, if after we're looking at all the 

other -- the statute, the history, the context, and if 

we cannot -- if we apply the Rule of Lenity, if the 

government's position cannot be shown to be 

unambiguously correct, we have at least ambiguity here, 

and then we go to Chief Justice Marshall's seminal 

discussion of lenity.

 And what he said was that we look at lenity 

for the proposition -- to back the principle that the 

power of punishment belongs to the legislative 

department; and the tenderness of the law for the rights 

of individuals, both of -­

is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.

 MR. SADY: The Court in -- in Lynce and in 

Weaver used the term "increase in punishment" when there 

was no longer available good time credit. For -- to say 

that somebody has to serve 87.2 percent of the term of 

imprisonment imposed by the judge instead of 85 percent, 

that is imprisonment.

 For Mr. Barber that's over 6 months' 

additional time behind bars in a prison. That's -­

that's penal; that is affecting individual liberty, it's 

the type of liberty that was intended to be covered by 

the Rule of Lenity; and especially in the situation 

where the initial sentence was imposed based on a grid 

that was calibrated assuming 85 percent, he's ending up 

serving 2.2 percent more time than the sentencing judge, 

in imposing the sentence. So that aspect of punishment. 

And in actual raw time behind bars in a prison.
