 JUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in 

Schaffer against Weast.

 Mr. Hurd, you may proceed.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. HURD: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court: 

As Congress recently reaffirmed, the IDEA was 

enacted to protect the rights of children with 

disabilities, and the rights of their parents. It is an 

Act intended by Congress to remedy a long history of 

discrimination that once kept these children from the 

schoolhouse door. It is an Act intended, as this Court 

said in Rowley, to maximize parental involvement and to 

ensure that these children have access to an appropriate 

education.

 Today, the intent of Congress, as shown by the 

text, structure, and purposes of the Act, calls for the 

burden of proof in administrative hearings to be placed on 

the school system, not on the parent.

 The Fourth Circuit said that placing the burden 

on the party who initiates proceeding is the traditional 

rule. But, there is no single traditional rule. Instead,

there is a collection of different rules.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, Congress was silent on 

this subject of the burden of proof, was it not?

 MR. HURD: Yes, it was, Justice O'Connor.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there -- did you find 

anything in the legislative history -- I know some members 

don't care to look at that, but I would be willing --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- that shows any discussion 

at all about the burden-of-proof question?

 MR. HURD: We are aware of none, Your Honor. 

What we -- what we have here is a situation where 

Congress, when it wishes to allocate the burden of proof 

one way or the other legislatively, knows how to do so. 

It did so in the APA, for example, while adopting the rule 

that the Fourth Circuit said applies in this case. But 

Congress did not adopt the rule in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why didn't it? I 

-- why wasn't the APA applicable?

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the APA governs 

Federal agencies, it doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

 MR. HURD: -- govern proceedings --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

 MR. HURD: -- under the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So --


MR. HURD: -- under the IDEA.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what it if were -- what it 


were a school on a Federal base? Are they covered by this 

Act, by the way? You know --

MR. HURD: Your Honor, there are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- military schools on military 

MR. HURD: -- DOD schools --

JUSTICE SCALIA: DOD schools. What do you do 

with them? 	 Are they governed by the APA?

 MR. HURD: We don't believe so, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

 MR. HURD: They are not. And part of the reason 

for that has to do with this unique structure of the Act. 

It is a very nontraditional statute. It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you'd be suing some 

Federal agency. I mean, it has to be some Federal agency 

that's running that school, and at least for that kind of 

a school the burden is clearly going to be on the person 

challenging the agency action.

 MR. HURD: I don't agree, Your Honor, and let 

me explain why, because of the unique structure of this 

Act, it creates an equal partnership between parents and 

the school system, with the purpose of that partnership

being to produce an Individualized Education Program for 

the benefit of the child. And, as this Court recognized 

in Honig, that IEP is the centerpiece of the entire 

statute.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, well, what if you had 

an IEP that the parents had initially agreed with, and 

then they decide it isn't working well, they want to 

challenge it. They shouldn't have a burden of proof?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, that would be a different 

situation, and courts below have reached different results 

on that. We believe that the school system --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you mean the court has 

-- every court faced with this problem is supposed to 

decide, in that particular case, who has the 

burden?

 MR. HURD: No, Your Honor. Some courts have 

decided that, where either party -- the school system or 

the parents -- challenges an existing IEP or wants to 

change an existing IEP, some courts have said the burden 

is always on the school system, some have said the party 

challenging has the burden. But --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you --

MR. HURD: -- in this case --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you think it's open to 

a State to adopt a general rule on who has the burden of

proof under this statute?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we think that it is not. 

We believe it is a Federal question that --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Have some States purported to 

adopt a general rule on this?

 MR. HURD: Some have, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you think that's invalid?

 MR. HURD: Well, we believe -- yes, Your Honor, 

we believe it is a -- it is a Federal-law question. What 

we do know, however, is that Maryland has adopted no rule 

on this question, no statute to allocate the burden, one 

way or the other. And even if a State has the ability to 

adopt a rule, if it wishes to do so, that still leaves 

open the question of what rules should apply in the 

absence of a State-based rule. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hurd, do you recognize --

to narrow what's at issue -- that the parent objecting 

to the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming 

forward? In other words, I -- are you speaking just of 

the ultimate persuasion burden? Wouldn't the parents at 

least be required to come forward with some reason to 

believe that the State -- the school district's plan is 

inadequate?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we don't believe that 

it's necessary. We do recognize that is a different

question. In this case, for example, the school system 

was required to go first, but, initially, the parents were 

given the burden of proof. It is a -- it is a different 

question.

 And let me address, if I may, the different 

paradigm that this kind of action presents, because it's 

very different than a traditional statute. It goes back 

to this unique equal partnership. Congress intends for 

that child to have an IEP. And there are only two ways to 

get that IEP. One is a consensus between parent and 

school system. But if there is an impasse, Congress still 

wants that child to have an IEP, and there's only one way 

to carry out that congressional purpose; somebody has to 

step forward and ask for the hearing officer to make a 

decision. And it makes little sense to burden a party 

just because that party is the one who stepped forward to 

advance the congressional goal by asking for the IE- --

hearing officer first.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What case is your closest one 

to support the view that the Court should adopt some 

particular rule here, based on the scheme?

 MR. HURD: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What do you rely on? I just 

don't know where we look for the --

MR. HURD: Your Honor, I would --

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- guiding principle.

 MR. HURD: -- I would -- Justice O'Connor, I 

would point, for example, to your opinion in Gebser vs. 

Lago Vista, where you said that the general rule -- this 

was not a burden-of-proof case, but, in any event, you 

said the general rule must yield to the purposes of the 

statute --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, but let --

MR. HURD: -- in order to figure out --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- let's talk about--

MR. HURD: -- congressional intent.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- burden-of-proof cases. 

What is your closest one where the courts are left to do 

this? What do we look to?

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the Court, last 

year, in Alaska versus EPA, said, there is no single rule, 

or principle, governing the allocation of the burden. And 

in that case, this Court also said two other things that 

are important here. One is, it put the burden on the 

Government in that case, regardless of whether the 

Government was the plaintiff or the defendant. So, the 

idea of burdening the party who initiates the proceedings 

was rejected there, and this Court said it looked at the 

purposes of the statute and saw no reason to place the 

burden differently, depending upon whether the Government

came to court as the plaintiff or took unilateral action 

forcing the other side to come to court where the 

Government would be the defendant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand the purposes-of-

the-statute argument. The purpose of the statute is 

always to provide relief to someone who's been injured. 

And to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden 

should be on the other side, in order -- in order that 

people who are injured can get relief, is -- I mean --

MR. HURD: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that will always be the 

case.

 MR. HURD: Justice Scalia, the purpose of the 

statute is to obtain for the child an Individualized 

Education Program.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. I -- that's one 

sort of relief. But, I mean, you have some relief at 

issue under every statute. They want a needy person to be 

given justice. And to say that, since that's their 

purpose, you should always put the burden on the other 

side, is -- I just don't understand that argument.

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, this is a unique 

statutory scheme. The purposes of the Act are set forth 

in the law very clearly -- page 6 and 7 of the addendum to 

the blue brief -- one is to ensure that all children with

disabilities have available to them a free, appropriate 

public education. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.

 MR. HURD: -- that purpose is served far more, 

Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Federal Tort Claims 

Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue -- or, if it 

doesn't, it should have, or it could have -- the purpose 

of this is to assure that every person who's been injured 

by a -- by a Government tort obtains relief.

 MR. HURD: But let me, then, point out the very 

different paradigm between the ordinary tort claim statute 

and this statute. In your ordinary tort claim statute, 

your ordinary litigation, the law starts out by being 

neutral with respect to the status quo. And that's the 

reason why you have this rule -- we don't think it is 

called "traditional rule" appropriately -- but the general 

rule that you place the burden on the party who initiates 

litigation is because the law is neutral with respect to 

the status quo at the beginning of the lawsuit. Here, the 

law is not neutral, because the status quo before the 

hearing is: the child has no Individualized Education 

Program.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's where I am not 

understanding your argument. There is an IEP in all of 

11

these cases. I would understand your argument if the 

State -- the school district said, "We're not going to 

educate this kid. Throw him into the pot with everybody 

else. We won't give you an IEP." That's not what we've 

got here. And, in fact, if that's what we had here, the 

burden-of-proof issue would be of no significance, because 

the State -- the parents would walk in, and the only thing 

they'd have to do to satisfy "a" burden of proof would be 

to say, "They didn't come up with an IEP." 

MR. HURD: Justice Scalia [sic] --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Instead, what we have here is a 

fight about whether it's a good IEP or no IEP.

 MR. HURD: Justice Scalia, with all due respect, 

there is no IEP; there's only a proposed IEP. And that is 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then --

MR. HURD: -- the crucial difference --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- then we're arguing about 

words.

 MR. HURD: The point, though, is that with --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The State is not saying, "We 

will not come up with an IEP." The State is saying, "This 

is what we're going to give you," and the parents say, 

"It's not good enough."

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, that is not an IEP; that

is a proposed IEP. And it is not merely arguing about 

words; it goes to the heart of the statute. Let me 

explain why.

 Three things this Court has said -- or the 

regulations say. Number one, the regulations say that the 

parents and the school system are equal partners. This 

Court said, in the Honig case, that Congress very much 

intended to strip school systems of the power to act 

unilaterally with respect to these children. Thirdly, 

this Court said, in Rowley, the purpose of the statute is 

to maximize parental involvement.

 Now, if we're equal partners at the table, what 

sense does it make for the school system to tell the 

parents that, "We are equal partners here, but, if you 

disagree with me once we leave the table, I am presumed 

correct"?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What sense does it make for the 

parents to tell that to the school system? I mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In an -- in an equal-

partnership argument, nobody's got the burden of proof.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, in an equal-partnership 

argument, nobody has the burden, because they initiated 

the proceeding to ask for the goal that Congress had in 

mind --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In all events --

 MR. HURD: -- that the child have an IEP.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in all events, it seems to 

me that it's still cut against you. This is a statutory 

scheme where, you point out, the parents have access to 

some initial consultation. In most instances -- or in 

many instances, people who are suing an institution don't 

have that initial access. Here, the parents get much more 

initial information than most -- than most petitioners do 

MR. HURD: They --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- than most -- than most 

complainants, than most aggrieved persons do.

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, actually their 

discovery rights are less than what they would normally 

have. But let me go to the idea, then, that we are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then let --

MR. HURD: -- equal partners --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let me point -- let me 

point out something else. Let's assume a state of affairs 

-- just assume that school districts -- many of them --

independently and, I think, collectively, because school 

districts talk to each other -- have a growing body of 

data and expertise about IEP. And this is the basis on 

which you say that they should come forward. It seems to 

me that, too, though, cuts against you, because when a

school district has expertise, I think it's entitled to a 

presumption of governmental deregularity. And you have 

to challenge it.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, we disagree with that, 

because of the structure of the Act. Again, it makes no 

sense to be equal partners at the table, and, once you 

reach an impasse, to say, well, you're going to presume 

one side is right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a well-established 

principle of administrative law. I've never seen a case 

in administrative law where a party -- a private party 

coming in and challenging a Government's action doesn't 

bear the burden of proof. And Alaska isn't contrary to 

that. Alaska, they were citing hornbook law, whether --

what happens with the -- if EPA normally does have a 

burden of proof when it challenges a State action, and 

that doesn't change, whether they bring it in a State 

proceeding or whether it's in a Federal proceeding. I 

didn't think it was quite on point. But maybe you know 

that I'm wrong on this. And so --

MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is there a -- can you think 

of any instance, in all of administrative law, where you 

didn't start out with the idea that a person challenging a 

-- an agency action that's been taken, and so forth,

doesn't have the burden of proof?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, there is no analogous 

case, because --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I --

MR. HURD: -- because --

JUSTICE BREYER: I do think that, yes.

 MR. HURD: -- because there is no analogous 

statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There isn't?

 MR. HURD: There's no analogous statute. There 

is no other statute we've been able to find where private 

citizens are made equal partners with Government in the 

design and approval of Government actions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Does this every 

come up? I mean, the other thing I wondered about this --

it seems to me you have a hearing examiner and a district 

judge who have actually said what is only a law 

professor's dream. They say, "Oh, the evidence is 

precisely and equally in balance." I didn't know that 

happened in the real world. I --

[Laughter.]

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought that their --

that judges normally did their job, which is, you look at 

complicated evidence, and you say, "This side is a little 

bit better, or that side is a little bit better." Has

this come up in -- a lot, where they say, in this area, 

"Oh, it's exactly" --

MR. HURD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- "in equipoise"?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't know 

how many times the hearing officer has said that. I do 

think the burden of proof is not -- is not -- or the 

evidence is not balanced on a razor's edge. I think it is 

a -- is a broader table than that. But let me explain, if 

I may, three reasons.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you, before you get 

to your three reasons, to go back to your -- something 

that you said? I asked you, Are you dividing the burden 

of production and persuasion? And you said no, it's all 

on one side or the other. But it seems to me your 

description of this proceeding, you said the school 

district goes first. So --

MR. HURD: In this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the school district did 

come forward. And is that the usual practice in these 

administrative hearings -- that the first one to go to 

defend the plan is the school district, not the parents 

who are attacking it?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, I believe that the 

typical procedure would be that the -- whichever party has

the burden of proof would go first.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said, in this case --

MR. HURD: It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the school district went 

first.

 MR. HURD: Yes, Your Honor. In this particular 

case, the hearing officer had not yet resolved the burden-

of-proof issue at the beginning of the hearing, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, now, as a result of the 

Fourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first 

MR. HURD: Oh --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and not the school 

district? The school district has a plan that it has put 

forward. And it seemed to me logical, well, it has a 

plan, so it should defend it.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, the typical rule is, 

obviously, that whichever party has the burden of proof in 

that proceeding would go first, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you think the ALJ -- or 

the administrative hearing officer in this case told the 

State to go first -- the school district to go first 

because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, 

and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, there was a -- it's

unclear why he had them go first. There was some State 

regulation -- then in effect, no longer in effect -- that 

suggested that perhaps the State had some initial burden 

in that case. We're not necessarily asking that the --

that the -- that the State be required to go first. What 

we are asking is that the State -- excuse me, not the 

State -- the local school system bear the burden of 

persuasion. And there are three --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, but you're saying this --

this is an ad hoc thing. There is no general practice 

about which one goes first.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, the general practice 

would be that whoever has the burden of proof, the burden 

of persuasion, would also be the one to go first and go 

last. That's the general practice in procedures. And we 

believe it also applies here. But we're not -- what I'm 

-- my point is that we are not wedded -- this Court was to 

decide that the parents should go first, but the school 

system had the burden of persuasion, that would be fine 

with us. In the cases where the burden of persuasion is 

going to be determinative, both sides are going to have 

substantial evidence before the hearing officer. 

The question we think is most important here, 

if I may, is, Which allocation of the burden of proof best 

advances the purposes of Congress? There are three

reasons, at least, why we believe putting the burden on 

the school system best advances purposes of the 

Congress.

 Number one has to do with the risk of an 

erroneous decision. This Court, for example, in Santosky, 

said: What will happen if there is an erroneous decision? 

It asked that question in the context of the standard of 

proof. It is important to ask that same question here.

 If the hearing officer makes a mistake and 

awards the child services that are not really needed, then 

the child will receive a somewhat better education than 

the law requires, and the school --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's only play money, 

right?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well I think it's only right 

- this isn't the question, Who's going to pay for it? 

Because this -- doesn't the parent often go ahead and get 

the other -- the better program, and then they ask for 

reimbursement for the -- from the Government?

 MR. HURD: Well, not in that case, where the --

my hypothetical was, where the hearing officer has awarded 

services --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that many of 

these fights occur after much of the education has already 

taken place --

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, because of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and they're fighting about 

who pays for it?

 MR. HURD: -- the wheels of justice grind slowly 

-- sometimes they do, but they -- the key point here is, 

look at what happens if the hearing officer denies 

services the child needs. The child is going to be 

harmed, and, in the long run, society is going to be 

harmed, as this Court recognized in Rowley. The harm to 

the child if the burden is erroneously -- excuse me -- the 

harm --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's --

MR. HURD: -- to the child --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's not true if the 

parents can afford to pay for it, and have, in fact, paid 

for it. Then the child is the neutral factor in it. Of 

course, in some cases, what you say would be true, but not 

in --

MR. HURD: Your Honor, in most cases --


JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not in all cases.


 MR. HURD: -- it would be true. These parents 


were fortunate -- this child was fortunate, that they were 

able to pay for Brian's services until Montgomery County 

finally changed its mind and gave him the kind of services 

he had sought from the beginning, services they gave him

once they were given the burden of proof. But most 

parents are not going to be in that situation. Most 

parents of children with disabilities are not going to be 

able to go out and obtain the services they need if the 

hearing officer does not award --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hurd, here's --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- here's my problem with your 

assertion that we have to decide it in the way that 

furthers the purposes of the statute. We said, in other 

cases -- and correctly, I think -- that no statute pursues 

its purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon 

its purpose. It, of course, wants students who need this 

special help to get it, but it also does not want students 

who don't need this special help to get it. And for you 

to say, "There's no harm done." You know, "If he -- if 

he's given it when he doesn't need it. What's the 

problem? He goes to a better school." The problem is 

that this is not play money. It's coming from somewhere; 

and, namely, on the citizens who have to pay for it.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, my purpose is not to 

minimize the monetary interests involved, but it is to 

focus the Court's attention on the aspect of it that 

Congress had focused on. Certainly, if we have an 

erroneous decision either way, there will be some loss.

If the loss is on the school system, it will not be 

unimportant; it will be some money. If the loss is on the 

child, it will be in the squandering of human potential --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, that's true. That's 

-- I understand. I sympathize with that point. I'm 

worried, however, about the fact that this statute doesn't 

just cover the initial IEP. It covers a whole range of 

things, including, for example, you have a hyperactive 

child. The hyperactive child behaves badly in class. The 

hyperactive child receives discipline related, say, to how 

it's placed. Well, the parents might -- properly, perhaps 

-- think that was very unfair and wrong, and they might 

challenge that disciplinary mark. There can be thousands 

of different kinds of issues that come up. And, in all of 

these issues, is it supposed to be the burden of the 

school board, for example, to show that the teacher who 

had the child sit in the back of the class or received a 

bad discipline mark or something? Does the -- does the 

school board have to prove that the teacher was right?

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, those cases would 

not arise under the IDEA --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wouldn't it, if it were related 

to the placement?

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, your hypothetical did not 

change the child's placement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I say that there are a 

number of -- what I'm thinking of is a lot of interim 

decisions that come up that are affecting how the child is 

placed -- whether in class, whether in that class, whether 

with a special teacher, whether without a special teacher, 

whether with somebody during the recess periods, whether 

not. I mean, they're -- these are very complicated 

matters, and there can be important overall matters, and 

there can be what I'd call interstitial matters.

 MR. HURD: Your Honor, the initial matters you 

discussed -- sent to the back of the room -- the IDEA is 

not implicated there. If the school system tries to 

change the child's placement, then this Court has already 

said that the school system bears --

JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm driving at is -- and I 

think it was well expressed in one of these cases, a New 

Jersey case, perhaps -- that is it the same burden of proof 

whether the matter is interstitial or whether it's an 

initial placement or a change of --

MR. HURD: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- placement? Do we have the 

same burden of proof always on the school board, no matter 

what?

 MR. HURD: I understand your question, Your 

Honor. We believe the strongest possible case is,

initially, where there is no IEP, where this is equal 

partnership, and the school system should be required to 

come forward and demonstrate this program is appropriate.

 If, however, you have a -- an agreed IEP and the 

parents say, "Well, now we want to change that," then the 

case for the parents is, frankly, not so strong. It is a 

different case. And some courts have said, in those 

cases, the parents have the burden, as the District Court 

did, actually, in this case, by way of dictum. Other 

courts have said, no, the school system always have the --

has the burden.

 The Court need not go so far here as the New 

Jersey court went in Lascari, and say the school system 

always has the burden in order to the rule -- rule for the 

parents in this case and say that, initially, when there 

is no IEP, only a proposed IEP -- and, Justice Souter, 

Burlington used that word three times, "IEP proposal," 

which we think implies that it was not a real IEP -- this 

-- the Court need not decide the other issue in order to 

decide that when there is no IEP, only a proposal, and 

when you have equal parties before the hearing officer, 

that it makes no sense to allocate the burden on which one 

filed for the hearing officer first, who asked for the 

tiebreaker first. That really makes no sense.

 You have to, instead, we submit, decide the

case based on which allocation of the burden in this 

situation is most in accord with the purposes of the 

statute. Two purposes, if I may. Protecting the rights 

of children with disabilities, and the rights of their 

parents, is what the statute says.

 Protect them from whom? What did Congress have 

in mind? Obviously, to protect them, quite frankly, from 

the school systems, who had this history of 

discrimination, who are more powerful, if you will, in 

terms of both information and resources, and who have a 

financial incentive, as the Deal court recognized, to 

minimize the needs of the child. Protecting the side that 

Congress meant to protect means putting the burden on the 

other side: the school system.

 Secondly, more fundamentally, the purpose is to 

ensure the children have an appropriate education. The 

law doesn't say "promote." It doesn't say "presume." It 

doesn't say "risk." It says "ensure."

 In baseball, there's an old umpires' rule that 

the tie goes to the runner. In order to carry out 

purposes of this statute, when the evidence is in 

equipoise, the tie should go to the child.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for 

rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may 

it please the Court:

 Petitioners rejected the educational plan found 

appropriate by local school officials, enrolled their 

child in an expensive private school, and then filed a 

due-process complaint seeking reimbursement of $21,000 in 

private tuition expenses. The Court of Appeals properly 

held that petitioners bore the burden of proof in that 

proceeding, just like --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is a case where the 

parents unilaterally decided to move the child to a 

private school, and then they sought tuition 

reimbursement?

 MR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.

 MR. GARRE: -- O'Connor. Petitioners bore the 

burden of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't contend the rule 

would be different if we were -- if it was all 

prospective, do you?

 MR. GARRE: No. Your Honor, we think the rule 

is the same in all of the various situations that could

arise under the statute -- the complaining party, whether 

it's the parents, as in this case, or the school district, 

as in many other instances. And, Justice Breyer, you're 

right, one of the situations that is covered by this 

statute is where a child with a disability acts out in 

class, and the school has to take disciplinary action 

against that child. In that situation, IDEA regulates the 

actions that the school district can take. And if the 

parents believe that the school district has -- take a 

more severe disciplinary action than is required by the 

statute, school -- the school district, or the parents, 

could initiate a challenge in that situation.

 In fact, there are many parts of the statute 

that we think speak to the question, or at least --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we -- you go onto the 

argument, your answer to Justice O'Connor, if I remember 

the facts correctly, wasn't quite right. This child was 

in private school for years, and the parents weren't 

asking anybody to do anything, because -- and it's only 

when the private school said, "We have to -- we can no 

longer put up with your child. Your child has all these 

problems" -- at that time, the parents then came to the 

school district and asked for an IEP.

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. 

The child was in a private school, at which point in time,

the private school suggested that they find -- the parents 

find another environment for the child suitable for what 

they determined to be "special needs." The parents 

contacted the local school district, and, at that point, 

the school district, in conjunction with the parents, 

devised an educational plan for the child.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which the parents didn't 

think was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child 

in another private school. But it was not a case that 

they put the child in a private school first, and then 

sought reimbursement.

 MR. GARRE: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, 

except that the record does show that, during the time 

that the IEP was being developed, the parents applied for 

the child to attend a private school and actually accepted 

an application fee and enrolled the child in that school, 

and the ALJ in this case found that the parents had made a 

predetermined decision to send the student to child -- the 

student --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought --

MR. GARRE: -- to private school. But we don't 

think that the facts of this case bear on the question of 

who bears the burden of proof in the run of the Mine case. 

It's --

Garre, you said, in your earlier statement, that sometimes 

the school district will be the complaining party. How 

does that -- how does that come up?

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, there are three 

situations in which the school district can be the 

complaining party. First, where a parent refuses to 

subject his child to evaluation for special services under 

the Act, and the school district disagrees and initiates 

that action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why would the school 

district have to take any action? Why wouldn't it just --

MR. GARRE: Well, under the statute Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just say, "The child can't 

come to class. He's too disruptive," period?

 MR. GARRE: The Congress placed on school 

districts the obligation to identify disabled children 

within their jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. GARRE: And when they have -- they believe 

they identified such children, and they request the 

parents to subject them to the evaluation -- Congress 

placed on the school districts to at least conduct an 

evaluation in that situation, and if parents disagree --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. GARRE: -- school districts can initiate.

 The second situation is in -- is where children 

act up in the classroom. The school -- the statute places 

restrictions on how the school district can discipline a 

child if the school district determines that the 

misbehavior is a manifestation of the child's disability. 

In that situation, if the -- if the school district 

believes that more severe discipline is warranted than 

would be allowed under the statute, the school district 

has to initiate the hearing in order to get an ALJ to 

allow it to take more severe action.

 And the third situation is where the school 

district disagrees with a parent's request for an 

independent educational evaluation. Parents can request, 

as part of the developmental process of an educational 

plan, to have an independent educational evaluation 

conducted on their child, paid for at public expense. 

Most of the times, that's conducted without incidence. In 

some situations, if school districts believe that that 

expense was not warranted, they could initiate a 

proceeding.

 And in all those cases, we acknowledge that --

under the traditional rule, that the complaining party, 

the party that initiates the action and seeks relief, 

bears the burden of proof in that proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, do you have any

numbers, overall, how -- of the incidence of the parents 

going to the administrative hearing first, as opposed to 

the school district? Isn't it overwhelming that, in these 

proceedings, the parents are the one -- ones who initiate 

the hearing?

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't have those 

statistics. I would -- I think it's probably true that in 

most instances it's the parents who are initiating the 

hearing. That would not have been news to Congress, 

however. Congress, in the statute -- and this is one of 

the things that we think is important, bearing on the 

burden of proof -- placed on parents the obligation to 

plead their case -- that is, to identify both the problem 

with the educational plan that they've seen -- and this is 

in 20 U.S.C. 1450(b)(7) -- as well as the proposed 

solution that they would -- that they would like to see 

the Court adopt. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now we go back to the --

an answer you gave before, when we were going through 

what, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the 

parents were just trying to get the private-school tuition 

reimbursed, the -- there was a finding, wasn't there, in 

the District Court, in the -- this is in the Petitioner's 

appendix, at 46 and 47 -- the district court said, "The 

parents in no way prevented the IEP from being formulated

or otherwise failed, in good faith, to consider it."

 MR. GARRE: The -- Your Honor, that's correct. 

I think that the District Court also acknowledged, though, 

that the parents probably were interested in sending their 

child to private school. I think, either way, we're not 

suggesting that the record in this case requires the Court 

to take one result or another on the fundamental question 

of who bears the burden of proof. We think that the 

complaining party bears the burden of proof. That's the 

rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if I take -- if I accept 

your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written 

into the statute. And that would mean that, even if the 

Department of Education came to a different conclusion, or 

even if we have a bunch of States that come to a different 

conclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to 

have a rule that "sometimes it's one way, sometimes the 

other way," we couldn't do that. But if I were a Member 

of Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I 

think this void in the statute suggests, I might think it 

would work out better if we left it up to each State to do 

it whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the 

Department of Education to promulgate whatever rules they 

wanted. Now, couldn't we hold that?

 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor, and, in fact,

we've suggested that. In fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you haven't suggested 

leaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a 

uniform rule. So, what -- how would you have it?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, to be clear, we 

think that this -- that the statute establishes a Federal 

floor. It is spending clause -- a federal floor -- it is 

-- or a default rule that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it's just --

MR. GARRE: -- unless --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- a default rule.

 MR. GARRE: Exactly. That the --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's just a 

default rule, that's a big improvement, because any State 

can do it any way it wants.

 MR. GARRE: And that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But then, why not, here, send 

it back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong 

question? He tried to answer the question of what was the 

Federal law, but what he really should have done was ask 

about what's the State law. And if he has a hard time 

figuring it out, perhaps he should look at that evidence 

harder and see. Maybe --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is there any doubt, 

here, that there's no State law?

 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and I believe you 

just heard Mr. Hurd acknowledge that there is no statute 

or regulation on this.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I've never heard of a 

State without law. There is no --

MR. GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- black hole in the law --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the burden of proof in IEP 

cases --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I should have explained.

 MR. GARRE: And, Your Honor, the Maryland case 

law adopts a traditional rule for administrative 

proceedings. We cite the case, in page 18 of the red 

brief. Importantly, though, what petitioners --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These cases are appealed to 

Federal courts normally, aren't they?

 MR. GARRE: These cases -- the Congress gave 

them the right to bring a civil action in Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Federal courts. And most of 

these cases are in Federal courts. And you're -- you want 

to condemn Federal courts to figuring out what the State 

burden of proof is?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think -- we 

analogize it to the question of the substantive amount of

benefits to which parents are entitled under the Act. We 

think that this spending-clause legislation would allow a 

State to adopt a higher standard than the standard that 

this Court established in Rowley for free and 

appropriate public education, and that that would be the 

standard that would apply in a proceeding. And so, too, 

we think, with the question of the burden of proof. If 

States wanted to voluntarily assume the burden of proof 

for their own school districts in these proceedings, which 

this Court has characterized as a substantive rule of law 

-- the question of who bears the burden of proof -- we 

think that States could do so, and that that would be the 

rule that applies. We don't quarrel with that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not hypothetical. Isn't 

it -- it isn't hypothetical. States -- isn't it true that 

some States have said that, in these hearings, the school 

district will have the burden of proof?

 MR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. We believe -- I 

believe eight States have said that. Three States -- at 

least three States have said that the burden of proof is 

on the parents in these proceedings. Some States have 

taken different views and said if -- I believe it's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

MR. GARRE: -- Minnesota has said that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the -- to the extent

that we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs 

on school districts, and burdens on school districts, why 

shouldn't we have a uniform Federal rule? In other words, 

if we agree with your position that ordinary allocations 

puts this on the complainant, we have to conserve 

resources, and so forth, why should we allow States to 

have a different rule, when we're dealing with the 

administration of a Federal program? 

MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, because of the 

spending-clause nature of the legislation. That's what we 

think, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, would you --

MR. GARRE: -- this establishes a Federal floor 

that States can go beyond if they want to assume more 

costs under the Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have a statute that 

-- you know, it's in -- it's in great detail -- on 

administrative procedures. It obviously -- you know, 

decision of hearing officer, administrative procedures, 

disclosure, evaluations, and recommendations. And you 

think the Federal Government goes into all this detail and 

doesn't care who has the burden of proof? That seems, to 

me, most unlikely. 

MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Scalia, we agree, in 

the sense that we think that the statute establishes at

least a default rule. And, just to be clear, if the Court 

holds that Federal law establishes the traditional rule, 

then, obviously, we would be very happy with that 

decision. What we -- what we reject to strenuously is 

petitioner's position that Federal law imposes an unstated 

burden on the school districts in all proceedings 

initiated under the Act. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --

MR. GARRE: That would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- ask this question? You've 

described three situations in which you have the burden of 

at least proceeding, and I guess persuasion, too -- and, 

of course, there's a difference between the two. And I 

was just trying to think, if I were a hearing officer, and 

I thought, well, the issue in this case is whether the 

parents' objections to the IEP are valid, I think the 

first thing I'd want to know is, What is the IEP, and 

who's the best person to tell me about it? And wouldn't 

the county be in the best position to explain what has 

been done and, sort of, get the -- get the hearing 

started, and so forth?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Justice Stevens, Congress has 

answered that problem, in the sense that it requires, in 

response to a complaint, the school district to submit the 

proposed -- the IEP, the educational plan, it's adopted,

as well as the other considerations -- the other options 

it considered and why it didn't accept those other 

options. So, that evidence -- and I think we're talking 

about the burden of production --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I --

MR. GARRE: -- not the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- understand.

 MR. GARRE: -- burden persuasion there -- that 

evidence already is required to be exchanged and 

disclosed. Here --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But then, at the hearing, who 

-- who introduces the first exhibit or the first witness?

 MR. GARRE: Well, the way it's done in the 

States right now is, where, in the jurisdictions where 

school districts bear the burden of persuasion, they are 

required to go first. And that increases the costs and 

complexity of these trials for school districts, because 

the -- before the parents have put on their evidence as to 

why they think an educational plan is inappropriate or is 

-- in this case, why they think the school district hasn't 

properly characterized their child's disability, the 

school district has to go forward and present its case, 

which is a more complex -- it's -- there's more guesswork 

involved --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? Are there

any jurisdictions in which the burden of proceeding is 

different from the burden of persuasion?

 MR. GARRE: I don't know the answer to that 

question, Justice Stevens. I think it would be a very 

unusual rule.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, analytically, it's a 

different issue. But it would seem to me the normal rule 

would be whoever goes first has the burden of the 

persuasion.

 MR. GARRE: That's absolutely correct, and 

that's certainly the way that we think it would -- it 

would, more preferably, operate under the statute. But 

the question before the Court in this case is, Who bears 

the burden of persuasion? That's a very important 

question under the Act. It's not just, with respect, an 

academic question about the number of cases in with -- in 

which the evidence is mathematically in equipoise. It is 

going not have a much broader impact on the implementation 

of this statute, because it's going to be decisive, or at 

least potentially decisive, in cases like this, where 

you've got a battle of the experts. I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why should it be? I 

mean, that's very interesting to me. Why shouldn't the 

law be such that particularly -- you have evidence on both 

sides and a neutral decision-maker who sits there -- that

it encourages that decision-maker to decide. It's one 

thing if the record's blank. But not where they have a 

lot of experts. Decide. Don't retreat to something like 

announcing, "Oh, it's in equipoise."

 MR. GARRE: The -- we would agree with you, 

Justice Breyer, but, in practice, many of these cases, the 

dispute is over the provision of experimental therapies 

for children with disabilities, particularly children with 

autism, where medically and educationally --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but then to do that 

is not really to look to the interests of the child or the 

board. I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from 

left field, nothing to do with the merits, to decide the 

case.

 MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. We think that what 

it is to do is to give effect to the traditional 

presumption of regularity, which is, ultimately -- if you 

do have a tie, whose judgment ought to be given effect? 

And under the statute, where Congress recognized that 

State and local governments would retain the primary 

authority over educational decisions -- and in the Rowley 

case, where this Court reaffirmed that -- we think that, 

combined with the traditional presumption of regularity --

which is that the actions and decisions of public 

officials are presumed to be taken in good faith, and

presumed to be correct -- those factors counsel strongly 

in favor of the traditional rule here. Petitioners --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, if you -- if you 

had a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out 

in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- the 

person -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who 

is making the claim has the burden of proof. But there is 

something different about this setup, because the statute 

does obligate the school district to come up with a plan. 

And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and 

the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a 

question of remedy, and the employer said, "I propose this 

-- these changes to remedy the violation," wouldn't the 

employer in that case have the burden of establishing the 

adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy 

the problem?

 MR. GARRE: I think if you're talking about an 

affirmative defense or something beyond the threshold 

question of whether there has been discrimination, or as 

in a Social Security Act case question of whether an 

eligible person has been denied the benefits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, you made --

MR. GARRE: -- to which he's entitled --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that determination has 

been made --

And the employer proposes a remedy. Wouldn't the 

employer have the burden of showing the adequacy of the 

remedy that the employer --

MR. GARRE: I think the plaintiff would still 

bear the burden of showing that he is -- he or she has 

been discriminated against --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's no violation 

here. I mean, this is a totally different --

MR. GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- situation. I mean --

MR. GARRE: And that's my threshold --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- there hasn't been finding 

of any violation by the school district. The school 

district --

MR. GARRE: That's my threshold point --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- but I'm interested in 

MR. GARRE: -- that that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I'm interested in Justice 

Ginsburg's question. Let's assume you show a violation. 

Is there -- is there any law on who has the burden of 

showing that the remedy is sufficient?

 MR. GARRE: I think when we talk about the 

burden of proof, we're talking about the essential 

elements of the claim, whether there's been a violation. 

So I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when I ask --

MR. GARRE: -- so I think we're asking --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're asking about the --

MR. GARRE: -- a different question.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- about the -- wait a minute. 

Let's say that the -- we find that there's a violation.

 MR. GARRE: I don't -- in that situation, there 

may be -- I mean, in the same way that, in the sentencing, 

in the criminal context, other considerations come into 

play, it doesn't resolve it here.

 Placing the burden of proof on school 

districts in these proceedings would erode the trust and 

confidence that Congress placed in the judgments of State 

and local educational officials. It would create a 

demoralizing and destabilizing educational regime in which 

the judgments --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the background --

MR. GARRE: -- of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the Act is, Congress was 

very dissatisfied with most of the judgments being made by 

local officials --

established the rules --

districts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any --

MR. GARRE: Here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now we have a number of 

States that do put the burden on the school district. Is 

there any indication that the cost is higher in those 

States than in States that put the burden on the parents?

 MR. GARRE: I think that the cost of the 

hearings -- there are not statistics on that, precisely, 

but the cost of hearings are going to be greater, because 

school districts --

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have the heavens fall -- we 

don't want the heavens to fall.

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the Government has 

always understood -- and this Court has understood -- that 

this is spending-clause legislation, and that the 

requirements of the Act establish a floor, and that that's 

true with regard with the substantive provisions of the 

Act, as well as the procedural ones. And let me give you 

one example. I will concede that this may seem somewhat 

anomalous, but this an unusual statute. In Rowley, for 

example, this Court construed the meaning of the term "a 

free, appropriate public education," and it determined --

in fact, it rejected a construction of that term that 

would have required maximizing the educational benefit to 

the child.

 There are States that have adopted that high 

substantive requirement for their schools. And when 

someone brings an action, either at a due-process hearing 

or in Federal or State court, a separate civil action 

under statute, the courts apply that higher State

standard. We think the same would be true with regard to 

a State's decision to adopt more restrictive -- or more 

protective, excuse me, procedural provisions for the 

parents with children with disabilities. It is left up to 

the States. The Federal law --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In other words --

MR. SALMONS: -- just establishes a floor.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- your answer is yes, the 

States may adopt a burden-of-proof -- here -- standard?

 MR. SALMONS: States may, and States have. What 

we think is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you have --

MR. SALMONS: -- improper --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- do you have any 

information in -- to the question I asked earlier -- in 

the States that have said, "School district, you bear the 

burden," do we know whether there's more litigation? Do 

we know whether there has been a notable increase in the 

costs in those States that have placed the burden on the 

school districts?

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would say that we 

don't have any evidence that is as strong as we would like 

on that. What we do have, and what I would refer the 

Court to, is the 2003 GAO report on the way in which the 

-- these provisions have been implemented. That is --

it's cited in both respondent's and petitioner's brief, 

and it was relied on by Congress in the 2004 amendments. 

And what it -- what it demonstrates is that 80 percent --

nearly 80 percent of all due-process hearings nationwide 

have occurred in just six jurisdictions, five States and 

the District of Columbia, and that -- and that, in those 

States -- it happens to be the case at all, but Maryland, 

which is one of those states -- have clear rules that put 

the burden of proof on the school districts, and that the 

costs --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This --

MR. SALMONS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: These other cases that you 

refer to, where -- that involve spending legislation, 

where the States go beyond what is minimally required -- I 

suspect that they are cases where it really is an 

imposition on the States, and they accept it. Here, the 

imposition is not on the States, it's on the local school 

districts. And very often, the interests of the local 

school district is quite different from the interests of 

the people, you know, down-State, in the State capital. 

I'm -- I am loath to think that just because a State 

supreme court says that every school district in the State 

has to bear the burden of proof, that Congress intended

different situation, where the spending is money that's 

coming out of the -- ultimately, out of the pocket of the 

school district.

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it may very well be 

that you would want something more than just a court 

decision. And I --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to --

MR. SALMONS: -- and the States that have done 

it --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- decide that here?

 MR. SALMONS: No, I don't think --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Maryland --

MR. SALMONS: -- we do, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- doesn't have --

MR. SALMONS: Maryland --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- such a rule.

 MR. SALMONS: -- Maryland does not. And I 

think, in fact, the only thing -- the only question that's 

truly presented in this case is whether the Federal 

statute mandates the unusual burden -- shift of placing 

the burden on the schools in all cases. And we think that 

clearly wasn't what Congress intended.

 And let me point to the provision of the 

statute we think is the most relevant, and that is the 

requirement that the parents -- or the complaining party

file a complaint to initiate the due-process hearing. And 

that traditional pleading regime requires that the -- in 

this context, the parents come forward and identify, with 

specificity and with supporting facts, the problem with 

the school's educational program and how they would 

propose to solve that problem.

 And, in 2004, Congress went even further and 

mandated that parents cannot even obtain a due-process 

hearing until they've first complied with this due-process 

notice requirement, and that the contents of the parents' 

complaint will strictly define the subjects that can be 

addressed at the hearing. And we think that is strong 

evidence that Congress intended the traditional allocation 

of the burden of proof.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And may I be sure I didn't 

misunderstand something you said earlier? Did you say 

that in most jurisdictions the -- by local option, the 

States have elected to adopt your adversary's --

MR. SALMONS: No --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- position?

 MR. SALMONS: -- no, Your Honor, I did not. 

What I indicated is that one of the unusual aspects of 

these due-process hearings is that they occur very 

infrequently, only about 5 for every 10,000 children 

receiving educational benefits under the Act nationwide.

In certain jurisdictions, there is a very high incidence 

of these hearings. And Congress, in 2004, was clearly 

concerned about the costs that those hearings were 

imposing, and were diverting funds away from the real 

purposes of the Act.

 Now, getting back to the statute, we think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure you answered my 

question. Did you not tell us that in the States where 

there -- the largest volume of these hearings -- in most 

of those States the burden is on the school board?

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. What 

I was saying is that I can't tell you that more States 

than not have adopted one rule --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I --


MR. SALMONS: -- or the other.


 JUSTICE STEVENS: Not the number of States.


 MR. SALMONS: But most --


JUSTICE STEVENS: Number of hearings.

that occur in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. SALMONS: -- in the country --

 MR. SALMONS: -- where, either by court or by 

rule the burden has been placed --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And this was -- I wanted to 

point -- was that mostly -- in those jurisdictions, was it 

by court or by rule?

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I don't have that 

information. Most, I think, of the jurisdictions were --

most of the jurisdictions have the burden on the schools, 

because that's what the courts -- the Federal courts have 

construed the Federal statute to require. What -- the 

reason I have a difficult time answering that is because 

the amount of due process hearings varies so widely from 

one jurisdiction to another.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. SALMONS: And part of that is because of the 

rules and the ways in which it's been adopted.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: See, this is really a unique 

statute in so many ways. We've learned, over the years, 

that discrimination is being treated like everybody else 

in this -- in this statute, unusual discrimination. And 

I'm just wondering, it's -- I find it surprising and 

significant that those who have been free to pick the 

right rule have picked the rule your opponent --

MR. SALMONS: Well, no -- Your Honor, there are 

several States that have clearly placed the rule -- by

rule, on the -- on the -- on the person initiating --

 MR. SALMONS: -- the hearing. And, in fact, I 

would say most States probably have a sort of State APA --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the States that have --

MR. SALMONS: -- very similar to the Federal 

APA.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the States where most of 

the hearings have taken place and have taken the opposite 

view, has --

MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that been true for a number 

MR. SALMONS: It --


JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of years?


 MR. SALMONS: There may be a cause-and-effect 


issue there, Your Honor. It may be the case that the 

types -- that by encouraging the type of litigation under 

the Act by switching the burden of proof has resulted in 

more cases being brought. The interesting fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I see what you mean.

 MR. SALMONS: -- from the 2004 amendments is 

that Congress sought to reduce the amount of litigation 

under the Act by, for example, allowing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But those States --

 MR. SALMONS: -- for the first time --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Apparently that's -- this has 

been -- this is not really a brand-new statute. We're 

going back to the '70s --

MR. SALMONS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- with this statute. And is 

it true that for most of that period that's been the rule, 

where most of litigation has taken place --

MR. SALMONS: I -- Your Honor, I believe it's 

the -- I can't answer that. I think it's -- it's most --

it's more recent than that. And I think the explosion of 

litigation under the Act is more recent than that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. SALMONS: And Congress has been very 

concerned about that.

 Now, by requiring that the parent's due-process 

complaint define the contours of the hearing, we think 

Congress has signaled where the burden of proof should be. 

And, in addition to that, it seems -- it seems to us that 

it has addressed the policy and fairness concerns the 

petitioners rely on so much. As this Court recognized in 

Rowley, it's through the procedural protections of the Act 

that Congress sought to ensure that parents had sufficient 

information and resources to defend the interests of their 

child. And we think, by place -- this complaint notice

requirement represents a considered judgment by Congress 

that those procedural protections will have done their 

jobs and that parents will be in a strong enough position 

to adequately defend the interests of their child in any 

hearing. And that's certainly true if you would compare 

the position of the parents under this Act with benefits 

claimants and civil rights plaintiffs in any number of 

other Federal statutes.

 If Your Honors have no more questions, thank 

you.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hurd, you have about three 

minutes left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. HURD

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. HURD: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Let me begin by focusing on the costs of placing 

the burden on the school system. Five years ago, the 

United States said, when it was then, in this case, on the 

side of the parents, that placing the burden on the school 

district, quote, "should not substantially increase the 

workload for the school," end quote, page 12 of its brief 

in 2000.

 The National School Board Association figures 

show that the total costs of mediation, due-process 

hearings and litigation works out to about $22 per head

for every child in special education. That's not a lot of 

money to devote to the enforcement of civil rights law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: For each hearing or -- for each 

hearing or just --

MR. HURD: Total, Your Honor. The total figure, 

nationwide, is 146.5 million. If you divide that number 

by the 6.7 children in special ed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.


 MR. HURD: -- it's about --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.


 MR. HURD: -- $22 a head. And that --


JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be more 


realistic to divide it by the number of hearings, rather 

than by the number of heads.

 MR. HURD: Well, Your Honor, the total -- the 

total figure is 146.5 million. It is a drop in the bucket 

compared to the 11.4 billion that Congress appropriates. 

Moreover, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know what the --

MR. HURD: -- there's no indication --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you know what the figure 

is per hearing?

 MR. HURD: Per hearing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. HURD: -- Your Honor, is going to vary.

But there's no indication --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no. You divide the 

number of hearings by the figure you've just mentioned, 

and that's the result. Have you -- have you done --

MR. HURD: There are about 3,000 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the arithmetic?

 MR. HURD: -- there are about 3,000 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Three- --

MR. HURD: -- hearings, but that $146 million is 

not just the hearings; it also includes mediation, it 

includes litigation. And there's no basis to conclude 

that putting the burden on the parents is going to 

decrease, rather than increase, hearings. If you let the 

school systems slide by without being held accountable, 

they are likely to be less thorough in preparing their 

IEPs, as they were in this case. And when they're less 

thorough, there will be more understatement, more 

disputes, and less consensus.

 May I also point out, in response to Justice 

Breyer's point, if there is to be no Federal law on this 

question, if it is purely State law -- then it ought to be 

remanded back to the Maryland district court to ascertain 

what Maryland law is on this point.

 And, Justice O'Connor, while there is no 

statute or regulation on point, there are certainly

background principles of law that Maryland has, just as 

we've been arguing here at the Federal level, that would 

dictate for Maryland where that burden of proof should 

lie.

 Now, opposing counsel, the Government, has 

pointed out that there are these pleading requirements. 

But these are not traditional pleading requirements, where 

one side makes allegations and the other side goes, 

"admit, admit, deny, deny." If you look on page 12 of the 

addendum, you see the portion of the statute that requires 

the kind of response the Government must make. It's not 

admit/deny. It is to give, essentially, a detailed 

explanation for its position, just as the parents have 

given a detailed explanation for their position. And, 

between those two positions, you can tell who should have 

the burden of proof. 

I see my time is up.

 Thank the Court.
