CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-970, Perdue v. Kenny A. 

Counsel. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK H. COHEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. COHEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Plaintiff's counsel in this case earned a 

large fee award based on prevailing market hourly rates 

and a substantial number of hours expended. 

However, the district court determined that 

the $6 million lodestar was insufficient to compensate 

them for the quality of their representation or their 

results obtained. 

This Court has previously held that factors, 

such as novelty and complexity of the issues, 

contingency, and superior performance cannot be used to 

increase the lodestar amount because the factors are 

subsumed within that determination. 

But because of this Court's indication that, 

in rare or exceptional circumstances, upward adjustments 

may be permissible, district courts, such as the one 

below, have used quality and results to increase

lodestar awards, even though the -- the multiplication 

of the reasonable number of hours expended times the 

reasonable hourly rate constitutes a fully compensatory 

fee and serves the purpose of the statute, which is to 

attract competent counsel without providing a windfall. 

Now, with respect to quality of 

representation, that normally involves two factors: 

the skill and experience of the attorney, and also the 

effort it takes to succeed in the case. 

In this case, the lead counsel submitted 

affidavits indicating that they sought hourly rates that 

were within the prevailing market rates in the Atlanta 

market; and, in fact, lead counsel's market rate, the 

court found, was at the upper end of that market. 

When the district court determined --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Could you 

repeat what the market was? Was it the market for all 

attorneys or only for attorneys doing this type of work? 

MR. COHEN: It was the market for attorneys 

with similar skill or experience doing similar work as 

these counsel did. So what the court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is similar -- what is 

similar work? 

MR. COHEN: Similar work would be Federal 

court work, where you -- involving class actions, for

example. But the focus is mostly on the skill and 

experience and reputation of the attorney. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. COHEN: What the court did in this case, 

though, was, rather than take those hourly rates, which 

were prevailing, which the record was clear were 

prevailing, the court determined the quality factor 

justified an increase because they advanced case 

expenses, because they were not paid on an ongoing 

basis, and because their fees were contingent upon the 

success of the case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that has nothing to 

do with the -- with the quality of the representation, 

does it? 

MR. COHEN: No, it doesn't, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't it name those 

factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of 

saying, and therefore they should get more money for 

quality? 

MR. COHEN: Well, for whatever reason, the 

court determined to use contingency-related factors to 

increase the fee award based on the quality factor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. They advanced --

they advanced money for experts --

MR. COHEN: Correct.

MR. COHEN: And the third one was that they 

weren't paid on an ongoing basis. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They weren't paid on --

MR. COHEN: That's right. But that is not 

a rare --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that -- isn't that 

the same as contingency? 

MR. COHEN: Yes, it is, Your Honor, and it's 

not a rare or exceptional circumstance when you're 

talking about a fee-shifting statute. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cohen, I thought this 

judge, Judge Shoob, said: These lawyers were amazingly 

good; I have never seen a better performance. So don't 

we take him at his word? I mean, he certainly talked 

about the quality of the performance of these lawyers. 

MR. COHEN: He did say that they exhibited 

the best skill and professionalism, Justice Ginsburg, 

that he had seen in his time on the bench. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. COHEN: But I would submit to you that 

that is not a reason to enhance the lodestar because --

second-year associate whose billing rate for 2 years 

of experience is $200, and a partner's rate is $500, and 

a judge says: This individual didn't perform like a 

2-year associate; he did the quality and kind of work of 

someone far superior in years in skill and experience. 

That would not, under your argument, entitle 

the court to give an enhancement? 

MR. COHEN: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor, 

because, if that $200-an-hour associate was doing other 

work for other clients, the bill would be for $200 an 

hour, regardless of what the result would have been or 

how good that associate would have been. 

It's basically --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cohen, you said in 

your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party 

could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly 

rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she 

charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice 

Sotomayor inquired about. 

But that sounds to me -- you take the 

second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top 

partner because her performance was so outstanding. 

That’s an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as 

the one that Judge Shoob gave. 

But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are

going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate 

to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher 

hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate. 

MR. COHEN: What I meant by that position in 

the brief, Your Honor, was that, in presenting 

affidavits to support the hourly rate of that associate, 

that associate may present hourly affidavits that the 

rate was between $200 and $300 per hour, and the judge 

could determine, because of how good he did, I'm going 

to give him at the upper end of that market. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you haven't dealt 

with my hypothetical. He didn't perform like a 

second-year associate. He performed like a 15-year 

lawyer. The difference is not with respect to skill and 

experience. It's with respect to performance. 

And so what Justice Ginsburg was asking is, 

what you are basically saying, the quality of that 

representation, even though it reflected more than the 

market one would look at objectively on the basis of the 

years of experience, that judge can't enhance, even 

though someone performed far above whatever else the 

market would consider his or her skills at the moment. 

MR. COHEN: Well, remember, Your Honor, 

that, when the statute was enacted, it was said in the 

congressional reports that they wanted to compensate for

the expenditure of time and to reimburse the plaintiff, 

if you will, for what the plaintiff put out in terms of 

expenses and fees. 

Well, if you are -- if you are going to 

basically treat that second-year associate as a 15-year 

partner and award him a $500-an-hour rate, what you are 

actually doing is overcompensating that person for what 

the expenditure of time was and for what the actual fee 

they would have charged to their client was. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose the 

question under the statute is whether it would be a 

reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to 

determine that is to ask whether it would be considered 

reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according 

to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but 

we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another 

$10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy, 

he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner. So 

we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate, 

instead of the $200. Would -- would that be considered 

a reasonable attorney's fee? 

MR. COHEN: No, it wouldn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn’t think so. 

MR. COHEN: -- and no reasonable law firm 

would do that, which is why a judge would be beyond his

discretion -- or her discretion --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not true. Law 

firms get bonuses from clients all the time. They get 

negotiated. Some of the amici gave examples of what's 

happening in the -- what happens in the marketplace. 

MR. COHEN: But those are private agreements 

that are entered into with a client. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't the judge 

determine a reasonable fee in the same way the market 

does? Which is --

MR. COHEN: That's not the -- I'm sorry. 

That’s not the traditional market, Your Honor. The 

traditional market is the hourly rate that’s envisioned 

by the lodestar. We don't replicate all possible 

private fee agreements into fee-shifting statutes. 

That's what this Court has said. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but the -- but the 

Congress didn't use the per-hour lodestar --

MR. COHEN: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as the method. If 

that's all it wanted, it could have, and there were 

suggestions that it consider limiting the -- the award 

to just a lodestar calculation. So obviously Congress 

was thinking of something broader than just that. 

MR. COHEN: Well, Congress was --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That part of the market 

anyway. 

MR. COHEN: I'm sorry. 

Congress also was not thinking of 

replicating all possible private fee arrangements 

because they also indicated that the -- the amount of 

the fee should not be dependent on a proportion of the 

damage award. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's why we 

have held in our cases that it should be a rare and 

exceptional circumstance. The difference that we are 

engaged in is whether the quality of performance can 

ever constitute that rare exception that would justify a 

district court saying, you performed greater than what 

the market would have valued you at before your 

performance. That's really what the issue is. 

MR. COHEN: Well, that's -- in answer to 

your hypothetical, again, in the market where you have 

an hourly rate for an associate, that’s the hourly rate 

that that client is going to be billed by that law firm, 

and they are not going to have a results fee or a bonus 

fee because that attorney happened to do better. The 

hourly rates --

about, the way these submissions to the Court are -- the 

way they're presented, do they carve out her 

contribution to a particular filing? To the extent I 

have looked at them they have something like, you know, 

draft motion to dismiss, and the associate has 40 hours 

and the junior partner has 10 hours and the senior 

partner has 5 hours dedicated to that. 

I mean, if the associate is doing -- in the 

hypothetical, is doing work at the partner level, how do 

you know that the brilliance isn't contributed by the 4 

hours of the partner rather than the 40 hours of the 

associate? 

MR. COHEN: You don't in the traditional way 

of billing that you are talking about, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or, indeed, you don't know 

that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables 

the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the 

matter. Presumably it does. It's so great when it 

comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work. 

MR. COHEN: Well, that's true, Your Honor. 

The other thing to point out is that when the 

submissions are made to the court, they are supposed to 

be broken down by tasks actually. And here the district 

court considered the submissions not by what lawyer did 

what task, but how many hours were expended on

individual tasks. 

And when the court determined to actually 

lower the amount because of excessive hours, they looked 

at tasks and said, for summary judgment, for example, 

too many hours were expended. So they -- the court 

doesn't normally look at lawyer doing particular tasks. 

It looks at tasks being done by the lawyers in general. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is not clear to 

me what the district judge should do in making the 

lodestar calculation when he considers quality of 

performance. I guess you are saying -- I think maybe 

you have already said -- that he can consider quality 

of performance, but only within the confines of what is 

a reasonable rate. 

MR. COHEN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the brief for the 

Respondent said: Well, you know, you are really 

counting this at the front end, and if you can do that, 

why not put it in at the back end? And I'm just having 

problems with that still. Suppose the judge at the 

outset said: This quality of performance is so good 

that, so far as the lodestar is concerned, I think a 

reasonable fee is above the usual hourly rate. 

MR. COHEN: Well, I would submit, though, 

that when the judge decides how to do the lodestar rate,

he is looking at the affidavits, talking about what the 

range of the market is for that area. He's also looking 

at the number of hours reasonably expended. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- so that in 

computing the lodestar rate, he cannot consider quality 

of performance? 

MR. COHEN: Quality of performance is built 

within, I would say subsumed within, the hourly rate and 

the number of hours expended, as this Court has said in 

Delaware Valley I. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then it seems to me 

you're saying that he does not look to actual quality of 

performance. He just looks to market rates without 

reference to that. I -- I --

MR. COHEN: Well, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why I'm having --

I'm -- I mean, you know, the -- the question presented 

is -- is just quality of performance and results 

obtained; that's all we're talking about. 

MR. COHEN: Correct. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see why that 

can't be considered as part of the lodestar, and if it 

can be, then I don't see what the argument is about. 

MR. COHEN: But superior performance is just 

the reason that hourly rates are what they are. That's

what this Court said in Pierce v. Underwood. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not necessarily –-

JUSTICE STEVENS: But does that -- does that 

mean that the fee would be the same under the lodestar 

whether the lawyer won or lost? 

MR. COHEN: Well, no. The -- the lawyer 

doesn't get a fee in a fee-shifting statute if he loses. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if for some reason, if 

-- if you did had some reason to calculate it, 

theoretically it would be the same fee as if he had 

lost? 

MR. COHEN: That's correct. That's correct. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And so the quality of 

performance really is totally irrelevant. 

MR. COHEN: As it is for the normal lawyer 

working on a private matter for a client. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. COHEN: They get paid an hourly rate and 

it's win or lose. And what the judge tried to do here 

is to say, well, I need to give them a little extra 

because their winning this case was dependent upon a 

contingency, and the factors that he built into that 

enhancement were contingency-related factors. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are going back to 

the judge, who did say that this was the best

performance he ever saw. So I can't credit just that it 

was just contingency. 

But, first, you have clarified that what you 

said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer 

of this, period. So this is more limited than -- than 

one might take it to be. 

In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the 

rate is set by the number of years that the person is 

out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility. I 

mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year 

associate so much. So how in a system like that could 

you take into account quality at all? 

MR. COHEN: Well, but in the normal system, 

Your Honor -- and I would ask to reserve some time for 

rebuttal -- that that hourly rate that that first-year 

or second-year associate gets is the rate that they bill 

their clients. They don't adjust it afterwards unless 

they have a special fee arrangement, as -- as Justice 

Sotomayor said. They don't adjust it when they send the 

final bill and they say: This associate is the best --

did the best work that you have ever seen, and we're 

going to increase that hourly rate exponentially because 

of that work. That's not the market with respect to 

billable rates.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Section 1988 permits reasonable attorney's 

fees. That means going above and beyond the lodestar 

amount can be justified only if the lodestar is 

unreasonably low. We submit that a lodestar based on 

prevailing market rates does not require a performance 

bonus on top of the lodestar to make an award 

reasonable. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying we can never 

exceed the lodestar amount? I mean, we have said in 

some cases that in extraordinary circumstances it can. 

What are those extraordinary circumstances, or do you 

think there are none? 

MR. SHAH: There are none for attorney 

performance, Your Honor. There may be other 

circumstances --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Such as? That's what I'm

MR. SHAH: Right. The government sets out 

one example in our brief of where we think an upward 

enhancement might be appropriate, and that’s where an 

attorney takes on a particularly unpopular client or 

cause that causes some external harm, external to the 

case, to his practice or income, where --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's one of the 

long-standing traditions of the bar that lawyers are 

expected to do that in the normal course. So why would 

that be a special circumstance? 

MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

circumstance is much more closely tied to the statutory 

purpose of section 1988, which is to attract competent 

counsel in this subset of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you 

tell -- how do you tell whether a client is popular or 

unpopular? I mean, a lot of unpopular clients in the 

abstract sense are in fact -- they have a lot of support 

in the community. I suppose one of the more unpopular 

clients these days is a Wall Street banker.

charge more when they represent them? 

MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor. I think what our 

-- what our enhancement would allow for, even if you 

can't make the ex ante determination that taking on this 

representation is going to cause me some special harm; 

that is, all my clients will leave my firm if I take on 

this case -- even if you don't know that before the 

fact, the fact that there is an ability for the court to 

give you an enhancement when that occurs -- remember, 

this is done after -- after the case is already complete 

is when the -- fee hearing determination is made. The 

ability of a court to give that sort of compensation 

would provide an insurance, a guarantee to the attorney 

before they take on a case that if it turns out badly 

that -- that they will still get compensated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that’s what we 

had in mind, huh? You think that’s what we had in mind

never; it is sometimes. And you have given us one 

sometime. Is there any other illustration? 

MR. SHAH: Your Honor, that is the only one 

that I think is left after this Court's fee-setting 

jurisprudence over the last 25 years. It has 

consistently knocked down other bases for an enhancement 

such as complexity of issues, novelty of issues, 

contingency risk, delayed payment. All of those other 

grounds of potential enhancement that the legislative 

history refers to have been categorically prohibited by 

this Court's jurisprudence. I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a downward 

adjustment? You have the hourly rate, the number of 

hours, and the judge, after trimming the hours, then 

says: This has been a case, even though they prevailed, 

the lawyer wasn't prepared; I am not going to give the 

hourly rate. Can a judge adjust the lodestar down for 

poor performance?

MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think the limited 

circumstances which allow for a downward adjustment 

would be those set forth in this Court's decision in 

Hensley. I don't think that poor performance alone 

would justify a downward departure --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Hensley is you lost on an 

issue, so you don't get paid for what you’ve done. 

MR. SHAH: Right. So if there were certain 

claims that the poor performance led -- led the 

plaintiff to be unsuccessful on certain claims but not 

all the claims, I think a downward departure would be 

appropriate. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the plaintiff -- the 

plaintiff prevailed on everything. It’s just that the 

judge said this was a really poor -- poor performance. 

MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor, I don't think a 

downward departure would be appropriate in that 

circumstance, because that's what the -- the 

prevailing market would not allow for a downward 

departure. Normally, these are standard --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the judge found as 

a fact that this lawyer spent 50 hours doing what any 

good lawyer could do in 5 hours? 

MR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, that 

would be taken care of in the setting of the lodestar

rate. Remember, there are two components --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't -- I don't see how 

that is set forth in the lodestar rate. 

MR. SHAH: Well, it -- not in the lodestar 

rate, but in the number of reasonable -- there are two 

components to the lodestar calculation: the number of –-

number of hours reasonably spent on the matter and the 

reasonable hourly rate. 

The situation you posit would be addressed 

by a downward adjustment of the number of hours 

reasonably spent working on the case. If the judge made 

a determination that any competent lawyer could have 

done this in 10 hours, he would not credit 50 hours of 

work. And that's -- that's how that situation would be 

taken care of. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: For extraordinary 

circumstances, what about a very, very popular cause and 

he wins and they are beating his door down? Can we 

reduce it for that? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. SHAH: No, Your Honor, that would not 

require a reduction. That would be an extra award for 

the attorney taking on that type of -- of case.

MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

there is any basis in the -- in the private market for 

that sort of downward adjustment. 

Justice Sotomayor, if I can address your 

concern about these alternative arrangements that --

that occur in -- that are starting to emerge -- at least 

Respondents suggest in their brief to this Court by 

citing a few newspaper articles and the proverbial word 

on the street that these are an emerging trend. 

First of all, there’s no -- absolutely no 

evidence in the record in this case that those type of 

arrangements were available in the relevant market. But 

even if they were, those sort of alternative 

arrangements are essentially modified contingency 

arrangements. And this is made most clear in 

Respondents' own amicus brief, the brief of the law and 

economic scholars. And this is at page 10 and 11 of 

their brief.

They call these partial contingency or 

hybrid contingency arrangements. It's not the same 

standard hourly rate and then a client decides to throw 

in a kicker of a million dollar bonus. Rather, these 

are discounted rates with a success bonus, essentially a 

modified form of contingency arrangement. They are 

prohibited for exactly the same reason that this Court 

prohibited a contingency risk enhancement in Dague. The 

same reasons would prohibit relying on those sort of 

alternative arrangements to provide an attorney 

enhancement for performance. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the purposes of 

Congress -- one of the purposes of Congress was to 

ensure that litigants under these fee-shifting statutes 

could attract competent counsel, correct? 

MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the market doesn't 

give them attorneys to start with because there are so 

many risks involved in this process and it sets a 

reduced fee because of those risks, how do you attract 

competent counsel? How do you attract counsel that is 

better than the norm in that field to pursue as private 

attorney generals cases that Congress has determined are 

worthy of being pursued, unless you have a quality 

adjustment factor?

MR. SHAH: Two responses, Your Honor: 

First, the problem that you posit about attorneys 

having -- being deterred by having to absorb, you know, 

the -- the upfront outlay of significant expert expenses 

or to having absorbed the contingency risks, those are 

problems created by this Court's precedent in Dague, not 

before this Court now. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't mean Dague 

was right, right? 

MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, no one has 

asked --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one is arguing a 

different point? 

MR. SHAH: No one in this case has asked the 

Court to revisit Dague. 

But more -- more to the point of your 

question, the type -- even accepting Respondents' 

formulation of this enhancement, it would only be 

available in the rare and exceptional case. And no 

reasonable attorney making an ex ante determination to 

whether to take on a representation would rely on the 

speculative and remote possibility that the district 

judge is going to have found this to be one of the best 

cases he has ever seen in making that calculation. 

Respondents' own numbers suggest that these

are granted less than one time -- once a year. That 

suggests that no reasonable attorney would take that 

into consideration, and it does not, in fact, further 

the statutory purpose in that event of attracting 

competent counsel. 

I would like to make one last point, and 

this is to bring us back to the facts of this case. I 

think Respondents' own trial counsel -- the discussion 

that they give of the lodestar rates used in this case I 

think is particularly telling. And this is the 

affidavit of Marcia Lowry, who was the lead plaintiff’s 

trial counsel, and this was submitted during the fee-

setting hearing, and the relevant excerpt appears on 

page 41 of the Joint Appendix. And I want to read from 

paragraph 25, and here's what she has to say about the 

rates used by the court: 

"The standard hourly rates reflected in 

Exhibit 2" -- and those are the rates used by the 

district court -- "are fair, reasonable and consistent 

with the hourly rates in the Atlanta market for the 

price of legal services of comparable quality rendered 

in cases demanding similar skill, judgment, and 

performance." 

Now, the affidavit goes on to say that the 

rates are still too low for the other factors that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Let me begin with the colloquy that involved 

Justices Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy about the rates 

and whether you can have sort of pre-enhanced rates as 

part of the lodestar or whether you can only do the 

enhancement after the fact. 

At the end of the day, as long as it is 

established in this case that you can have an 

enhancement for quality, I suppose that my -- my clients 

would be satisfied. The point is, though, that the 

preexisting law in the Eleventh Circuit and most 

circuits does not allow for a pre-enhanced rate to be 

used to calculate the lodestar. They are either done 

completely mechanically, as Justice Ginsburg suggests --

the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit -- or they are done 

through a simple calculation of the prevailing market

rates. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But sometimes there’s a 

great advantage in doing things mechanically, because 

it -- it provides an element of fairness. And I’ll 

tell you what troubles me about this, and maybe you can 

convince me that I shouldn't be troubled by it. Here 

the district judge in effect takes four plus million 

dollars from the taxpayers of Georgia and -- and awards 

it above the lodestar calculation to these attorneys and 

says -- and I -- I certainly take him at his word --

this was the best performance I have seen in 28 years. 

But it seems totally standardless, and I see no way of 

policing it, and I see a great danger that trial judges 

are going to use this as a way of favoring their 

favorite nonprofit foundation or their favorite cause or 

their favorite attorneys, because they think they 

generally do good work. 

And this is not -- this is not like private 

litigation where the money is coming out of the pocket 

of a corporation. It's coming out of the pocket of 

taxpayers. So that is very troubling. And I don't know 

how you can provide standards for determining whether 

this kind of transfer is based on anything reasonable. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let me 

say that I don't think that you need any more standards

for the possibility of an upward departure than you need 

for the possibility of a downward departure. And this 

Court has already held in Farrar v. Hobby that the 

results obtained is an adequate basis for departure, and 

not a small departure. In Farrar v. Hobby, the lodestar 

amount, the mechanical calculation that we're talking 

about, was $280,000. What was the reasonable attorney's 

fee? This Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but wait. That's 

pretty objective: results obtained. I mean, if, you 

know, the -- what was sought in the complaint was 100, 

and in fact you got only 30, you are still a prevailing 

party, but you shouldn't -- you shouldn't be compensated 

as though you got everything that was sought. I think 

that's much more objective than whether -- whether this 

attorney is the best one I've seen in 28 years. 

I have another problem with it. I don't 

like judges -- it's certainly not in the tradition of 

the bench to comment upon the performance of lawyers. I 

can't tell you how often I would like to give a separate 

grade for --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for the lawyer who won a 

case. You know, one grade for the case and the other 

for the lawyer. But we don't do that.

And if you do this going up, you've got to 

do it going down. And you could expect the judge to 

say: This is the worst performance I have seen in 

28 years. Judges don't do that in our system, and I 

don't think -- I don't think we should set up a 

mechanism that induces them to do it. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, two things, Your Honor. 

I mean, the results obtained is one of the two factors 

that are at issue in this case. And I think results 

obtained can be objective and be a basis for an upward 

adjustment as well as a downward adjustment. 

As you heard the lawyer in the earlier case 

say, you know, in a complaint, it is a wish list. And 

it's a rare case where the attorney gets everything they 

ask for in the complaint. This is that rare case where 

everything that was asked for in the complaint was 

obtained. So that's one factor, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I will let you 

answer your second point, but just on that, I don't 

understand the concept of extraordinary success or 

results obtained. The results that are obtained are 

presumably the results that are dictated or command or 

required under the law. And it's not like, well, you 

had a really good attorney, so I'm going to say the law 

means this, which gives you a lot more, but if you had a

bad attorney I would say the law has this and so he 

doesn't get a multiplier. 

The results obtained under our theory should 

be what the law requires, and not different results 

because you have different lawyers. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

mean, I defer to you, but I'm not sure that comports 

with my experience. I have seen lawyers come into this 

Court and concede a point in oral argument, and I have 

seen that prominently featured in this Court's opinion, 

so it does seem to me that sometimes the quality of the 

performance and the results obtained do depend on the 

lawyer's performance and are not foreordained just by 

the four corners of the complaint. 

And so I think, again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what does 

a judge say when he said, you have achieved 

extraordinary results? That if you weren't there, I 

would have made a mistake on the law? 

MR. CLEMENT: No, I think what he says is, 

in the hands of another counsel, the relief that was 

obtained might have been significantly less. This was 

an enormous --

saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe we have a 

different perspective. You think the lawyers are 

responsible for a good result, and I think the judges 

are. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: And maybe your perspective's 

changed, Your Honor. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: But I would say certainly in 

the context of a consent decree, when to give up, when 

to fight further, is going to be factored into the 

results. And I think it's a fair point that a judge in 

today's system, especially in the context of class 

relief like this, sees a lot of cases that end up with a 

coupon settlement that really doesn't do any good for 

the class. They're --

JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe -- maybe your

lawyer? You need to have -- you need to pay more than 

that? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, on that my perspective 

has changed, Your Honor. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: But let me say two things: 

One is, less than 10 percent of the total 

rates here, the total compensable hours here, were 

top-of-the-market rates. Only the two lead counsel were 

compensated, at sort of $495 and $450 an hour. 

If you want to talk about the -- the Lowry 

declaration, which is one thing that Mr. Shah brought 

up, what he quoted from was essentially the conclusion 

of that, where as part of the existing Eleventh Circuit 

precedent that looks to prevailing rates in the Atlanta 

market, there is a recitation that that is the sort of 

the prevailing rate consistent with the quality. That’s 

essentially something that the Eleventh Circuit 

requires you to say. 

I think the more relevant part of that 

declaration is at Joint Appendix at page 35, where 

Ms. Lowry points out that as a matter of fact these 

rates in the Atlanta market do nothing to account for 

the fact that she has to pay New York overhead, and that

her real rates are a national rate based on providing a 

service that almost no one else in the country can 

provide. This is really a unique --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the overhead? 

MR. CLEMENT: What's that? 

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the overhead? I 

mean, that's something that I find interesting and 

important, and I can't find it anywhere. The numbers 

began to bother me in the same way they did with Justice 

Alito. I’m thinking: There are 30,000 hours. They 

got 10.5 million. That translates into, what is it, 

$350 an hour. Now, if the lawyer works for 2,000 hours 

of the year, which is a little high, he is being 

compensated at $700,000 on average in this case. But he 

has to pay overhead. So what's that? 40 percent? 30? 

20? 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, the numbers 

aren't broken down. But I can tell you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, if you have 

any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere 

near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer: You 

are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99 

percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and 

suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which 

is -- I could say: Okay, pay them 400,000. That's

what he would get as the average fee for the toppest,

And -- but $700,000 a year for a lawyer. Wow. And 

that's what this judge paid. 

Now, what is it that came out of that? 

That's what I want to know before I make up my mind, 

frankly. And I'm going to try to look it up, but I'm 

trying -- I'm trying to get a rough idea here. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, what I think you can say 

for sure, Justice Breyer, is that what came out of that 

is a lot more if you have your office in New York --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I know, but --

MR. CLEMENT: -- than if you have your office 

in Atlanta. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that doesn't help me, 

and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a 

very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am 

tempted to think: Well, very high is enough. You don't 

need very, very, very high. 

You see my point? 

MR. CLEMENT: I do, Justice Breyer, but I 

also think the question presented here is whether you 

can ever have an enhancement.

made a difference to incentives on that one, for the 

reason that the Solicitor General said -- and my 

goodness, how do we explain this to the average person? 

That -- those are the questions that are genuinely going 

through my mind. I haven't made up my mind how I will 

come out in this case. So it's not a kind of putting 

this to you. I don't know. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. Well, Justice Breyer, 

let me take issue, though, with the hypothetical that 

all these lawyers are getting the top, top rate. That's 

not -- that's not what is happening, either in this case 

or in general. 

And one of the things, if you look out at 

the circuits, you will see that, because this Court has 

always said that the lodestar method is a two-step 

process, the first step, as this Court has repeatedly 

described it, is an estimate. Because of that, the 

circuits have some looseness as to how they go about 

estimating the reasonable hourly rate. They do not say: 

Let's take the tippy-tip-top rate and use that to 

calculate the rate. They use a variety of formulas. As 

I say, the Laffey index in the D.C. Circuit is quite

formulistic and doesn't -- it puts you in three-year 

groups and doesn't change your compensation between your 

8th and 11th year and your 12th and 20th year, so it's 

very mechanical. In some circuits, you can get a 

national rate. So in a circuit -- if this case would 

have been litigated in Cincinnati in the Sixth Circuit, 

then Ms. Lowry may have been able to get $700 an hour, 

which is a national rate. On the other hand, because 

this was in Atlanta, she was able to get the prevailing 

market rate in Atlanta, which was 495. Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this lawyer 

-- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily 

good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff? If the judge 

said, this is in the top 10 lawyers I’ve ever seen, or 

the top 20, where do you get an enhancement and where do 

you not? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, that's the 

thing. It's hard to tell. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, no. But I don't mean to

to be in a rare case. Now, they say that repeatedly, so 

I take this Court at its word, and I would think that

28 years, so, I mean, whatever the denominator is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are trying to

lawyers we had 3 years ago; they were really good.

the rare case. I am not -- I don’t want to see --

she know that that -- that may be as good as it gets, 

for the next 28 years? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, maybe the judge stays 

his or her hand in the first year. I mean, this is a 

discretionary judgment. There is an element of 

discretion in this, that starts with the statutory text --

which is “may,” not “must” -- and this Court has 

recognized time and time again that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say discretion. I say 

randomness. I mean, that is not a matter of discretion. 

It is a matter of randomness. How -- how long has the 

judge who observed this case been on the bench? 

If he has been there just a couple of years, 

kiss good-bye to your -- your extra money for being 

excellent. That's random. That's not discretion. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, no, I think it's a –-

it’s a discretionary judgment. I mean, the –- the 

district courts are going to be exercising that 

discretion guided by what this Court has said. 

This Court has said it should be the rare 

case in which there’s an enhancement. I think they are 

entitled to take this case -- this Court at its word, 

and I think there’s a reason, by the way, as this Court 

has rejected enhancement based on other factors, that it

has always held out the possibility for the enhancement 

in the rare case, for the quality of service and the 

excellence of results. 

The reason is, if you take that off the 

table, then the statute becomes unrecognizable to the 

Congress that passed it. This is not a difficult 

question about whether the Congress that passed the 

statute intended for there to be bonuses or enhancements 

based on exceptional quality and results. 

Those of you that look to legislative 

history, in this context of interpreting this statute, 

have repeatedly looked to the Senate report. The Senate 

report provides three exemplary cases as to how you 

should correctly apply an attorney's fee. 

Two of those three cases applied 

enhancements based on exceptional performance and 

results. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want this Court to 

look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned 

upside down. Instead of the lower courts reading our 

cases, we have to read lower court cases to decide what 

this statute means. Is that it? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, two -- two responses, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't do that.

the Court did that in Blanchard, and I think it should 

continue to do that because you are interpreting a word 

like “reasonable,” and I think have you to look 

somewhere, and the -- and the Senate report provides 

guidance. 

The second thing though is, Justice Scalia, 

you, in a number of contexts, have pointed out that, if 

you don't look to legislative history, it's okay to look 

at how a term was interpreted by courts at the time that 

Congress adopted it. 

And that's another way to get at the same 

result, which is, in this is case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Should I -- should I look 

at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was 

done, legal fees were not quite so high? And perhaps, 

comparatively so, they weren't quite so high, either. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I would 

say that -- you know, you can look to the fact that we 

have had a lot of inflation since then. You can make

JUSTICE BREYER: Not just inflation. I 

think the discrepancy between these top legal fees and 

the fee of the average person -- or the work of the 

average person, the average wage for a family of four 

has changed quite a lot. I suspect that's true, but I 

could look it up. But should I look it up? 

MR. CLEMENT: I don't think you should 

because, again, what Congress said it was trying to do 

here was not to try to make people indifferent between 

whether they became lawyers or not. 

They were looking at lawyers and they were 

trying to determine, we want to essentially make you 

indifferent between engaging in civil rights work and 

other complex civil litigation, like antitrust, and if 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this statute was 

passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't 

it? 

MR. CLEMENT: Before you adopted the 

lodestar, sure. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before this Court --

MR. CLEMENT: But not before the lower 

courts had adopted the lodestar, and which way does that 

cut? 

I think that cuts very strongly against adopting a rule

that says, the lodestar is not just a guiding principle 

but is an absolute ceiling on the award. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I would think it cuts 

the other way. Congress was not contemplating that we 

would adopt approach -- an approach which takes into 

account the excellence of counsel. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, again, Your Honor, with 

respect, I don't think, in any direct way, the lodestar 

takes into account the quality of counsel. Prevailing 

market rates, as Justice Stevens indicated, win or lose 

-- those are the prevailing market rates. 

So I don't think it directly takes it into 

Account. And, the question here is whether you can ever 

take that into account. 

And I actually think, if you are looking for 

guidance, you can look to the early Third Circuit cases 

that were decided before Congress passed the statute, 

and what those Third Circuit cases decided -- there was 

an en banc case, Lindy II, by Judge Aldisert and a panel 

opinion in Merola by Judge Garth. 

And what those decisions did is they said 

the great thing about having a lodestar with adjustments 

is that, in the mine run of cases, the rates are going 

to get quality of performance results about right. 

But what they --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you, yourself, make the 

point in your brief that the -- that legal fees are 

changing. And do you think that’s relevant? Are they 

going up? Or are they going down now? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, right now, they 

are sort of, at best, staying stagnant and maybe going 

down a little bit. I think this Court has always looked 

to the market in setting rates a bit. 

I think the main thing the fact that 

rates are not going up in sort of an inevitable cycle 

suggests to me is that this Court has to recognize that 

the one basis for enhancement that it has already 

consistently recognized, which is an enhancement for 

delay, which is not the same thing as contingency. 

This Court recognized that enhancement for 

delay was appropriate in the case of Missouri v. 

Jenkins. Now, this Court indicated that you can take 

account for delay, either through current rates, instead 

of historical rates, or through an enhancement. 

I think the one thing we know now is you 

have to be careful about using current rates to take 

into account for delay because the assumption that that 

would work was based on this assumption that rates 

inevitably go up.

to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about, 

which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a 

particular high-profile case to increase their profile, 

and they would have done it for a lot less. 

We have lawyers who argue here, who are 

doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be 

recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court. So 

when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type 

of work, you are overcompensating them. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well -- and maybe that's 

right, and maybe there should be adjustment in those 

cases. Maybe you shouldn't just take the prevailing 

rate for the general provision of services. 

You should take into account that, actually, 

you have lawyers here who are willing to do it for free. 

Sometimes, I think you get what you pay for, but that's 

a different subject. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: I do think that you can make 

adjustments, and that’s what is -- think about the term 

“the lodestar.” I mean, the lodestar is not a 

destination. It's not a complete calculation. The 

lodestar is a guiding light. It gets you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's also not 

the term Congress used.

what Congress said, which was --

MR. CLEMENT: And the term is “reasonable,” 

and, again, I think, if you were looking for fertile 

ground to derive a bright-line rule that you never, ever 

have an enhancement for quality --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't you -- most of 

your arguments are suggesting that the counter -- that 

your adversary is now limiting, that the adjustment 

should be made -- tied to something, and that something 

would be the actual rate. 

And most of the factors you are talking 

about -- whether the person's a national attorney with 

overhead or whether that person's a -- has done better 

work -- the example I used, a second-year associate, 

could be adjusted just in the rate, and that would give 

you a grounded place to make a judgment about the 

exercise of a court's discretion. Why isn't that a more 

structured, more --

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess what I would 

say, Justice Sotomayor, is that that potentially could

be more structured. I'm not sure it inherently is, 

which is to say I think -- you know, in some ways, it 

may be more transparent to say, we are just going to use 

the Laffey index, or we are going to use the prevailing 

market rates, and then we are really going to hone in on 

the issue of quality and exceptional results after the 

fact. 

I think, if the Court wants to suggest that 

you should take those factors into account in setting 

the rate -- and the rate should not be just a rigidly 

calculated rate that comes from an index or comes from 

the prevailing market -- I think the one thing I would 

very much want to urge on you is, if you take that 

route, that you allow a remand for an opportunity for my 

clients to make that showing to the district court 

because there’s no question, from the record here, that 

they were responding to extant law of the Eleventh 

Circuit. 

And that extant law did not provide that 

possibility for adjustment with the prevailing market 

rates. Those were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Cohen said that 

that would be a very limited adjustment. He wasn't 

contemplating in his suggestion in his brief that you 

could go outside what the associate would get; you just

go to the top. Let's say it could be 200 to 400, you 

give him 400, but you don't give him 500. 

Justice Alito asked -- he was concerned about 

standard list enhancements, so one question is when do 

you enhance? Another is, in this case it was 75 percent. 

How do you know what's the right multiplier? 

That -- the concern is you are going to have 

variations from district judge to district judge in how 

good the performance was, in what is the appropriate 

multiplier. Are there any handles that would prevent 

this from becoming just random, just rudderless? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first 

let me say that I had understood, and perhaps this was 

wishful thinking, but I had understood that Justice 

Sotomayor was suggesting the possibility of a broader 

inquiry at the rate-setting stage, not just a narrow 

focus sort of within bands. So I just -- that's what I 

was trying to respond to. 

As to trying to cabin the discretion, let me 

try to offer some thoughts about cabining the 

discretion, but let me also say that, to paraphrase 

Justice Scalia, what sauce for the goose is sauce for 

the gander. I mean, this Court has said that there are 

bases for downward departures, and including downward 

departures all the way to zero in Farrar v. Hobby, and

the Court has not been overly concerned about cabining 

that discretion. 

And that kind of discretion goes on downward 

all the time. It can take place in the terms of looking 

at a particular motion and saying that wasn't a very 

good motion; you were wasting your time. There are a 

variety of ways that that can be taken into account 

downward, and this Court hasn't felt that concerned 

about cabining the discretion. 

Now, if this Court wants to cabin the 

discretion, I think certainly there’s two factors here: 

There’s the quality of service and there is the 

exceptional results. As to the quality of service, I 

would certainly say that you ought not to have a rigid 

rule, which is essentially what Petitioners are asking 

for, that would cap you with prevailing market rates. 

There ought to be some flexibility for that, 

for the judge to take into account the actual experience 

that the judge has with the lawyers in the courtroom. 

The second thing I would say is that I do 

think it ought to be fair, if you are going to do this 

kind of calculation, that you don't base it on something 

like the Laffey index, and you don't base it on a rule 

that a national expert can never get a national 

prevailing rate, but even though they are sitting in New

York, they have to get the top rate only in the Atlanta 

market. I think those differences should be taken into 

account on the compensation side of things. 

And then if at some point, the judge wants 

to say, and I want to give either this rate or this 

multiplier for the quality of the performance, then 

that's something that you can certainly assess. 

As to the exceptional results, I also think 

there, too, you can focus on specific factors of the 

case before you, and you can say things. Now, I would 

say, for example in this case, part of the reason the 

results are exceptional -- I would point to at least three 

things: One is the advance of capital here in order to 

take on a case of this breadth and undertaking is really 

an exceptional undertaking. And if you look at the 

Goldberg declaration at Joint Appendix 75, that 

declaration points out that a smaller firm would have 

essentially been bankrupted by this case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were -- were expert 

witness fees reimbursable in this case, under -- under 

the statute? I noticed they were cut down, but I didn't 

know if he cut out all of them or just part of them. 

MR. CLEMENT: The district judge cut -- cut 

out all of them following this Court's decision in 

Casey, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. 

MR. CLEMENT: There was still, though, I 

should say, something on the order of $750,000 in 

reimbursable expenses that had to be advanced. It’s 

worth pointing out that one factor that Judge Shoob took 

into account in giving an enhancement here was the delay 

in payment. That is a permissible factor under 

Missouri v. Jenkins, and even if you use current rates, 

that doesn't do anything to compensate you for the delay 

in reimbursement of expenses. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I think it 

does. I think rates are set with -- based on a law 

firm's record of -- I mean, just because you bill a 

client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that 

they are going to pay at what you billed them. And I 

think the rates are set to take into account that over 

the past year whatever you have a realization rate 

of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent. 

MR. CLEMENT: Oh, I was just making a narrow 

point, Mr. Chief Justice, which is the current rates 

don't take into account the fact that there was a delay 

in repayment for reimbursable expenses. Some of these 

expenses were paid out 4 years ago, I mean at the 

time of the fee calculation. You don't get sort of, you 

know, today's copying expenses or today's FedEx

expenses. You get the expenses at the time you did 

them, and you don't get any prejudgment interest on 

that. So that is one thing Judge Shoob thought ought to 

be compensated here. 

Again, that’s one factor that makes this 

exceptional. Another factor is that this was an 

entrenched problem that they were dealing with. In 1989 

the foster care child system in Georgia was described as 

a crisis; by 1996 it had been upgraded to a catastrophe. 

This is a very difficult problem. 

The last thing is the scope of the relief, 

which really is, I think, very broad here and that's what 

Judge Shoob was recognizing. And as I said earlier, I do 

think in an era of coupon settlements, a judge is 

entitled to look at a case like this and say this is 

really a remarkable result that has been achieved here, 

and the normal rates -- normal prevailing market rates 

don't compensate for this kind of result. 

So I do think there are things that the 

Court could point to in this case or in other cases to 

try to cabin that discretion. I do think, though, that 

discretion is an inherent feature of this statutory 

regime, and this Court has tolerated a degree of 

discretion in a variety of contexts including with 

respect in the area of downward departures.

I do want to get, before I sit down, this 

point about getting the incentives right, because one 

thing that Congress was clearly very concerned about was 

getting the incentive rights for counsel. And if you 

accept Petitioner's position that the lodestar is a 

ceiling and not something that is subject to adjustment 

up or down, then what you are telling lawyers is the 

that the maximum amount they can make in a civil rights 

case is the minimum amount they can make in a different 

case, where by the way they will get paid every 30 days 

and their expenses will get reimbursed in real time. 

Then you are also telling them something 

else, which is, that's actually just a starter because 

there are multiple ways for district courts to cut down 

on the lodestar amount, either because you spent too 

much time on this or we didn't like your travel 

expenditures. And so there are multiple ways for those 

hours to be cut down. 

If you accept Petitioner's rule and there is 

no way to get those rates bumped up in any 

circumstances, then you are basically guaranteeing that, 

as I say, the maximum you can make in a civil rights is 

the minimum you can make in any other kind of cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there --

general counsel do that all the time when they get a

bill from a law firm. They cut it down. They say you 

spent -- you’ve spent too much time with this associate 

only because he or she is a first-year associate and is 

learning and training; I'm not going to pay for that. 

MR. CLEMENT: Two things, Mr. Chief --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's the same--

it's the same thing that happens when a district court 

looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down. 

MR. CLEMENT: Two things, Mr. Chief Justice: 

One, it's the law of the Eleventh Circuit and I think 

every circuit that before submitting your fees to the 

court you are supposed to use billing judgment and take 

care of some of those things, approximating maybe what 

your client would do for you. But, second, and I think 

more tellingly, the client may do that to you. The 

client doesn't have the help of your opposing counsel to 

egg them on and give them suggestions, and that's what a 

district court does in the context of one of these 

cases. 

So I really think, as a practical matter, 

you are systematically undercompensating counsel. And I 

mean, if you want to take into account practicalities, I 

am not here to reargue the Dague case, but if you want 

to talk about practicalities, the fact that all of these 

cases are contingency cases and the rational market for

those would be much higher than -- if you are worried 

about sort of windfalls for plaintiff counsel in 

these kind of cases, you really can worry about 

something else, with all due respect, because the 

combined effect of Dague and Casey makes it very 

difficult to get sort of comparable compensation. 

As I say, I am not here to reargue those 

cases. I do think, frankly, Dague is distinguishable 

because there you had the prevailing party language. 

The other thing about Dague that’s distinguishable that 

I will say before I sit down is one of this Court's 

concerns in Dague was creating an asymmetry. Blanchard 

had already said that contingency fees could not cap 

your awards; they didn't want to have an asymmetrical 

system. That's exactly what Petitioners are asking you 

for, is a completely asymmetrical system. Farrar v. 

Hobby says you can reduce downwards based on 

exceptionally poor results. There would be no basis 

whatsoever to even adjust a little bit under their rule 

for exceptional results on the upside. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. 

Clement. 

Mr. Cohen, you have 4 minutes.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. COHEN: Than you, Your Honor. 

I would like to start out with the little 

joke that Mr. Clement made, is that you get what you pay 

for. You do get what you pay for. Is because I am 

getting paid half my hourly rate in this case means I 

exert 

half of what I would do for another client who would pay 

my full rate? No. Because my professional 

responsibility is that when I’m hired by a client for 

an hourly rate, I’m supposed to represent that client 

zealously within the bounds of the law. 

So to say that in a case like this that 

these lawyers would have done a different type of job 

had they not known there was a possibility of a quality 

enhancement is an insult, frankly, to Ms. Lowry and her 

group, because they do this all the time. They do it 

without getting an enhancement; they never asked for one 

before. And, clearly, if this Court determines that a 

quality enhancement is going to be available even in 

rare or exceptional circumstances, you are going to have 

arbitrary results and you are going to have 

inconsistency which the analytical part of the lodestar 

guards against. 

Second point I would make is that Mr.

Clement mentioned about the New York rates and the 

overhead. That was not the rationale for the district 

court's awarding a quality -- or an enhancement here. 

That was not part of it at all. 

Getting back to what the court has 

mentioned: "The best lawyer I have ever seen." Look at 

what the purpose of this fee-shifting statute is. It's 

to attract competent counsel by awarding them a 

reasonable fee. What attorney is going -- who wouldn't 

normally take a civil rights case is going to say: 

Maybe I will take it, because maybe the judge will say 

I'm the best he's ever seen or one of the best I've ever 

seen? It's not a rational reason to give out there to 

attract competent counsel. Counsel are going to take a 

civil rights case because they know if they prevail they 

are going to get their prevailing market rate, they are 

going to get all their hours, their reasonable number of 

hours put in. In this case, it was 25,000 hours over a 

3-year period. And they got their reasonable rates. 

The judge also double-counted for quality 

because Ms. Lowry got a $495 rate in part because of 

her, quote, "stellar performance," as the district judge 

decided. So to count that again by giving an 

enhancement is impermissible double-counting, as this 

Court has held in previous cases, including Delaware

Valley. 

Finally, I would say that the district 

judge's order in this case, if left undisturbed, will 

create additional applications for enhancements and 

whether they are granted or not, as Justice O'Connor 

pointed out in the Delaware Valley II case in her 

concurrence, it's not the issue of the rarity of the 

granting of the enhancement. The issue is the 

requesting of it. And the requests are going to come 

out the wazoo, and district courts are going to be 

deciding things arbitrarily and on different bases. 

And for those reasons, we would respectfully 

urge this Court to reverse. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this one final 

question: We have a question of law before us, whether 

there’s an absolute ceiling here. 

Am I justified in assuming that if we could 

reach the question of whether it was a reasonable 

enhancement, there’s no argument about that? 

MR. COHEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor. If you 

determine that the enhancement was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: We are assuming for 

purposes of decision that the enhancement was 

reasonable, if that was -- if it's ever available, 

because you are not challenging the amount. In other

words, you are making an argument of law. Even if they 

give them a $10 enhancement, it would be exactly the 

same issue before us. 

MR. COHEN: We are arguing that the 

enhancement in this case was unreasonable, Your Honor, 

and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That is not the question 

presented in the cert petition. 

MR. COHEN: Well, no, I understand that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: If I understand it, the 

question of law presented is that even if the 

enhancement had only been $1,000 --

MR. COHEN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you would say that was 

equally wrong. 

MR. COHEN: For quality or result. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. COHEN: For those two factors.
