 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

 Ms. Cain.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CAIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Recognizing that certain offenders convicted 

before enactment or an implementation of SORNA would be 

unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration 

requirement, Congress included section 16913(d) 

delegating to the Attorney General the authority to 

determine whether and how to apply SORNA's registration 

requirements to those offenders.

 Mr. Reynolds is one of those offenders 

because he was convicted, sentenced, and released from 

prison a year before SORNA was enacted. But for a valid 

exercise of the Attorney General's authority under 

subsection (d), Mr. Reynolds had no obligation to 

register under SORNA, could not initially register under 

SORNA, and, therefore, was not subject to SORNA's 

criminal penalties. Action by the Attorney General was 

needed to bring offenders like Mr. Reynolds into the new

system.

 And because both implementing SORNA and 

determining whether and how SORNA would be applied to 

pre-enactment offenders would require time and 

consideration, Congress left the Wetterling Act 

registration law in place for 3 years to ensure that all 

offenders would be covered under the old law. And 

until -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the -- is the 

Wetterling Act retroactive?

 MS. CAIN: The Wetterling Act, Your Honor, 

was remaining in place for 3 years and had a sort of a 

sunset provision under -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I know. 

That's going forward. But was the requirement to 

register under the Wetterling Act -- did that apply as 

of the enactment date or did that reach back?

 MS. CAIN: Your Honor, actually the 

Wetterling Act was not effective for a year into the 

future.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you think it 

only applied to that year?

 MS. CAIN: No, I'm sorry. The Wetterling 

Act was enacted in -- in 1996.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if the offense

were committed in 1994, did that person have to register 

under the Wetterling Act?

 MS. CAIN: They had to register, but there 

were no criminal penalties. At that point, it was a 

1994 law called Wetterling, and then 2 years later under 

the Lychner Act, criminal penalties were added.

 Our reading better accords with the text and 

congressional intent -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify that 

answer? The -- are you admitting that there were no 

criminal enforcement options for the Attorney General 

under the Wetterling Act for acts committed prior to 

1996? Is that what you're saying?

 MS. CAIN: Your Honor, the Wetterling Act, 

as it was enacted in 1994, was a registration 

requirement without criminal penalties. In 1996, the 

Lychner Act was enacted amending Wetterling and added 

the criminal penalty, the Federal criminal penalty of 

1-year punishment for failure to register.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that included all 

individuals who had -- who had been convicted of -- of 

sex abuse acts before 1996?

 MS. CAIN: I don't know.

 Our reading better accords with the text of 

SORNA and congressional intent, but the Government

reading is simply not reasonable. If SORNA were to 

apply to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation 

offenders on day one, and the Attorney General could 

then modify in the future, which would in fact -- in 

effect repeal SORNA as to some offenders, then you could 

have a situation where someone was convicted of an 

offense and then have to be covered under SORNA, and 

then later the AG could decide that that group was 

not required to register.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe -- maybe the 

Attorney General doesn't have that power. But your 

position is that whether this behavior, not registering, 

is criminal or not is left up to the Attorney General, 

is left up to the executive. Do we have other examples 

where Congress says, well, we don't know whether this 

should be a criminal offense; so, we're going to leave 

it to the Attorney General?

 It's quite different to say the Attorney 

General will implement it in the technical details, but 

to say that whether it's a criminal offense or not is up 

to the Attorney General -- is there any other instance 

where that's so?

 MS. CAIN: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any, 

but we don't -- this is not what the Attorney General is 

doing. This is -- SORNA is a civil registration

requirement, and the Attorney General is deciding 

whether someone has to register. In order for a 

criminal indictment to be brought, a person would have 

to travel and then fail to register. So, it's really 

not actually deciding whether someone would be guilty of 

a crime or convicted of a crime or exposed to a crime.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- maybe I just don't 

grasp the core of the case then. I thought this was a 

criminal conviction and that you were arguing that it's 

a criminal conviction because the conduct that's 

prohibited by the statute was conduct that covered this 

class of people by order of the Attorney General under 

the interim regs. I mean, is that wrong?

 MS. CAIN: Your Honor, actually what we are 

seeking is the ability to contest the Attorney General's 

rule. We're saying -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking, isn't this is 

criminal conviction that resulted from the fact that 

your client was within the class of persons covered by 

the statute? The Government says they're covered 

anyway. You say they're covered only because the 

Attorney General acted, but then you say it's a criminal 

-- it's a civil provision? I -- I -­

MS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, it is -­

and then fail to register after you are obligated under 

SORNA to register is a crime, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- you know, my 

problem is that's very strange. I find it very strange 

to leave it up to the Attorney General whether something 

will be a crime or not. It will be a crime if the 

Attorney General says so, and it won't be a crime if he 

doesn't. I mean, especially leave it up to the Attorney 

General, for Pete's sake; he's the prosecutor. You 

know, it will be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it is, 

and it won't be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it 

isn't. I don't -- I don't know of any parallel, and -­

and I -- I think it's sailing close to the edge of 

unconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims 

is simply it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney 

General can make it not a crime. That -- that's sort of 

like prosecutorial discretion. In -- in his -- in his 

judgment, if it shouldn't be a crime, you know -- I have 

trouble with that, too. But it's a lot -­

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's a lot closer to 

prosecutorial discretion than -- than what you're asking 

us to accept, that something is a crime only if the 

Attorney General says it's a crime. That seems to me 

very strange.

what the text says, and our reading -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you -- now -- now 

we do -- the Attorney General has spoken. The first 

time, you say it was ineffective because there was no 

notice and comment. But from -- what is it -- August of 

1908, we have a rule, a final rule, that did go through 

notice and comment. So, are we talking about, is this 

case simply about the period from February 1907 to 

August 1908, and that's -- that's all that's involved in 

this case, only those people? Or are you contesting 

that after August 1908, you still have some kind of 

claim?

 MS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, our -- our case 

does not involve the time period after August of 2008.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it's -- so, this 

whole case is about what happens between February '07 

and August '08, and that's the limit of it.

 MS. CAIN: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no rule 

at all before February '07, and there was a rule August 

'08. So, it's just that period this case is about.

 MS. CAIN: Yes. Our client traveled in '07.

enactment of SORNA until the adoption of the SMART 

guidelines, right? That's what we're talking about?

 MS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, if the SMART 

guidelines are deemed valid, yes. But that was -- in 

2008. Our client traveled in 2007. And so, the 

Attorney General's interim rule is the rule that would 

subject him to criminal liability.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. I'm -- let 

me go back to that question, counselor -- to that 

answer. Let's assume we accepted the Solicitor 

General's understanding of the rule, that it was illegal 

to travel -- that you had to be -- had to register from 

the start of SORNA. What challenge do you have left 

either to the interim rule in 2007 or to the final rules 

in 2008? What -- what challenge could you conceivably 

make?

 MS. CAIN: Your Honor, if the -- if the 

statute applies from day one, we would still contest the 

interim rule for -- the Attorney General took action but 

did not exclude our client. The Attorney General did 

what he was authorized to do in subsection (d).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be the basis 

of that challenge?

 MS. CAIN: Because -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You -- you would have to 

bring some sort of suit that said he abused his 

discretion. On what basis would he have -- what would 

be your claim of abuse other than I really want my 

client out?

 MS. CAIN: Well, that he would have 

standing. That's what we're trying to -- we're trying 

to get standing to contest the interim rule.

interim rule is the only rule that gave -- gave the 

government the ability to include Mr. Reynolds in the 

prosecution.

notice and comment claim, right?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- but what 

you're challenging is interim rule, because there was no 

notice and comment. So, you would have had no 

challenge, not from the date of SORNA's enactment, but 

from the date of the rule that you're challenging -- and 

that rule was February '07. Your challenge is to the 

invalidity of the interim rule, right?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So -- but before 

there was an interim rule, you would have no such 

challenge.

apply to Mr. Reynolds before then.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You might have some other 

case, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as 

invalid. Is that -- that's as I understand it. So, 

there had to be the rule for you to make the challenge.

 MS. CAIN: I'm sorry. I missed the last 

part.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are challenging the 

Attorney General's first rule as invalid, the 

February '07 rule.

 MS. CAIN: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You say it's invalid 

because there was no notice and comment. You have no 

challenge -- your challenge doesn't reach before that, 

because there was no rule before that so that you can -­

the earliest point is when the rule was adopted, you're 

saying, the rule was invalid. So, that's why I said the 

brackets are from when there was an allegedly invalid 

rule, which was in February '07, until when there's a 

valid rule, which is in August of '08.

 MS. CAIN: That's right, Your Honor. I 

mean, that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not -­

no. Your argument, as I understand it, is there was no 

notice and comment when he issued the interim rule.

So, he could not meet either one of the descriptions of 

initial registration.

doesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply; it means 2250 doesn't 

apply.

metaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the 

statute to apply to people like your client, but the 

question is when the initial registration has to take 

place. And I took you as saying until the Attorney 

General acts, we don't know. So, 2250 doesn't -­

doesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when 

he's supposed to register.

 MS. CAIN: Register under SORNA. That's 

right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. Okay.

 MS. CAIN: The problem is here that the 

prosecution -- the Attorney General's office is 

substituting a State registration for the initial 

registration under SORNA, and that's just not what the 

text says.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Cain, why do you think 

Congress would have written the statute in this way? 

mean, in your brief, you say it was all very complicated 

and Congress was worried about certain problems, the way 

different registrations overlapped on each other. But 

exactly what was so complicated? Why couldn't Congress 

just have applied the statute to people in 

Mr. Reynolds's situation itself?

 MS. CAIN: Well, even the Government agrees, 

in their brief, that there are complications.

JUSTICE KAGAN: I was going to ask the

complications -­

MS. CAIN: Well -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that Congress was so 

worried about?

 MS. CAIN: Some sex offenders, you know, 

from the various States -- there were State laws that 

were varied amongst each other. There was the Federal 

Wetterling Act that had its own different periods of 

registration and different requirements.

 And I think that one of the permutations -­

some of them are that some sex offenders never had to 

register in some States; some had been convicted before 

and had served out their time and no longer had to 

register; and some were released from prison, you know, 

before the enactment or implementation of -- of SORNA.

 And an example of a permutation that 

was going to take some thought and some consideration is 

the one that sort of is an example in a different 

context, in the Federal Register and in the Government's 

brief, which is that certain people who had served their 

time and were completely out of the system, if they got 

re-arrested for a misdemeanor, the Attorney General 

decided that those individuals did not have to register

for a State to be deemed substantially implemented with 

respect to SORNA. And so, that's an example of a type 

of decision, a complication that the Attorney General 

was particularly well-suited to deciding and making that 

determination.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Arrested for a 

misdemeanor to do what?

 MS. CAIN: Any arrest for a misdemeanor that 

would bring a previous offender back in the system -- if 

that person was just convicted of a misdemeanor, they 

would not -- the State would not have to re-register 

them in order to be deemed substantially compliant with 

SORNA and get the Byrne grant money.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought Justice 

Kagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress 

from just saying you have to register on the day of 

passage? There was nothing to stop Congress from doing 

that, correct?

 MS. CAIN: They could have done that, but 

they were concerned about how you get the older 

conviction, the older pre-enactment people into the new 

system.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your reason for 

why they didn't do that. They didn't make it automatic, 

correct? That's your argument?

MS. CAIN: Right. They wanted to have a new 

registration, a new system that would start from a 

certain point that would bring in new requirements. And 

the problem is how to get the people with the older 

convictions and the older registrations into the system. 

And that would be done with initial registration. But 

Mr. Reynolds -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why is -­

MS CAIN: -- can't register.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it easier for the 

Attorney General to do that by regulation than for 

Congress simply to do it by the statute itself? What 

did they expect to happen in the regulatory process that 

would solve these problems for them?

 MS. CAIN: Well, I think that it's more 

flexible to have a regulation and takes perhaps less 

time than legislation to think of all the different 

permutations. They don't know every State's laws and 

every State's capabilities. And so, it was more 

flexible, and -- and they could respond more quickly to 

changes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, take this case. 

What would compliance entail other than simply telling 

the Missouri authority -- I mean, he had to register, 

was registered in Missouri -- telling the Missouri

all he had to do, right, to comply?

 MS. CAIN: Comply with Missouri's law? The 

State law?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To comply with the -- the 

SORNA requirement, that he'd have to tell the Missouri 

authority that he was moving to another State. And then 

Missouri would have an obligation to tell that other 

State he's there.

 MS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, that -- your 

question assumes that State registration would suffice 

for SORNA. And, respectfully, the -- SORNA was not 

enacted until -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm talking about 

SORNA has been enacted, and now he's moving after SORNA 

is enacted, right?

 MS. CAIN: Right. Well, that's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So -- so, SORNA is 

on the books. He's registered in Missouri. He's 

leaving the State. To comply with SORNA, what does he 

have to do other than tell the original State, I'm 

moving to another State?

 MS. CAIN: Well, he would have to comply 

with the requirements of initial registration under 

SORNA. Those contain more requirements than under the

have to do to be in compliance?

 MS. CAIN: With Missouri law, with State 

law, would be, to comply with Missouri law, tell 

Missouri he is leaving and then go to Pennsylvania and 

comply with Pennsylvania law, perhaps. And that's also 

not a SORNA registration; that is a registration under 

State law.

 We know from Carr that SORNA is -- doesn't 

create an obligation until the statute's effective date. 

And the statute's effective date is after a valid 

Attorney General regulation for purposes of people like 

Mr. Reynolds.

Cain -- you may have said this, and I may just have 

missed it. But under the new regulations, a man who's

register under (b) -- (b) just doesn't fit his 

circumstances -- does he now have to initially register 

again, or does his initial registration stick and he

just has to update it when he moves?

 MS. CAIN: The initial registration under 

SORNA could be updated. The State registration that he 

may have already done in the past is not a SORNA 

registration. He would have to register initially 

again, and that is a new registration. And that would 

be what Congress intended, because their goal was to not 

have a patchwork of regulations and rules. So, it would 

be a new registration, but an update of a SORNA 

registration is certainly possible, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the current 

regulation, under the 19 -- I mean, the '08 regulations, 

would it be enough to comply -- for somebody in his 

situation, to comply simply by telling his parole 

officer, I'm moving to the other State? Under the 

regulation that says how this is implemented?

 MS. CAIN: Actually, Your Honor, no. We 

actually don't know the answer to that question, because 

the Attorney General has not issued regulations 

instructing offenders what to do. They have simply 

issued guidelines telling the States what they can do to 

substantially implement SORNA. So, we don't really know 

the answer to that question.

 The point is that the requirement to 

initially register under SORNA was not effective until

says under (d). And that if you look at how the 

Government is reading the statue, you apply it from day 

one, but yet they have the ability to modify SORNA, 

which in effect means to repeal SORNA's effect as to 

some people in the future. That also would cause a lot 

of complications, especially in the context I mentioned 

where someone with a misdemeanor, you know, may be part

General's position, all your client had to do after 

SORNA was passed was, after a reasonable amount of time

State of conviction, that he was moving. Correct?

 MS. CAIN: If you -- they say that he was 

not part of the people that could register within a

the State registration.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 If I could start by answering your question, 

Your Honor, about the Wetterling Act, it was not 

retroactive. It didn't apply to pre-enactment conduct. 

It defined a sex offender, unlike SORNA, as somebody who 

is convicted of a sex offense, and in guidelines issued 

after Wetterling and after several subsequent amendments 

to the Wetterling Act, the Attorney General interpreted 

it as only requiring States to register offenders that 

are convicted not only post-enactment but 

post-implementation by the States. And one such cite 

is 61 -­

Official 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Post-implementation by 

the States. And so, 61 Federal Register cite 15,112 is 

just one example of that type of regulation. And so, 

when Congress enacted SORNA, it switched from "is 

convicted" to "was convicted" in order to include 

pre-enactment offenders.

 Justice Kagan, to get to your question about 

why is it all so complicated, our answer is that it 

really is not. There's no reason why it couldn't have 

applied on day one to all pre-enactment and 

pre-implementation offenders. And to start off, when 

you look about all pre-enactment and pre-implementation, 

this is an incredibly large class. This is all existing 

sex offenders on day one and all existing sex offenders 

from many months and years going forward while the 

States proceed towards implementation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, why -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But then, as I indicated, 

why would Congress have given you the authority to 

exempt people? It seems to me that the -- the burden is 

on you in the exact same way it's on Ms. Cain.

 MS. SHERRY: In our view, what subsection 

(d) was, essentially, was a safety valve. It wasn't 

something that Congress thought the Attorney General was 

going to need to use, but it was something that was

there for the Attorney General, should problems arise in 

the course of implementation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen in -- in 

this situation: Someone is convicted of a sex offense 

before SORNA is enacted; then shortly after the statute 

is enacted, the person moves to a new State, does not 

register; then after that, the Attorney General, 

exercising the authority that you say he has under -­

exercising -- excuse me, exercising the authority under 

subsection (d), determines that SORNA shouldn't apply to 

people who were convicted of offenses before its 

enactment? Would that person have committed a criminal 

offense?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think at the -- at the 

time he acted, yes. I suppose the Attorney General 

could decide whether or not he was going to apply his 

regulation prospectively or retrospectively. But I 

think the important point is the same result is reached 

under Petitioner's view.

 On Petitioner's view, the Attorney General 

has full and complete control of the light switch. 

Congress didn't do anything and simply left it for the 

Attorney General to turn the lights on. We don't think 

that's right for a number of different reasons, one of 

which is the way that Congress delegated authority to

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if Congress wasn't 

sure whether it wanted -- whether it was appropriate to 

apply SORNA retroactively, then I just -- and, 

therefore, was willing to leave that to the Attorney 

General, then I don't understand why it would have made 

the Act applicable immediately upon enactment -­

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Our -­

JUSTICE ALITO: -- pending a determination 

by the Attorney General.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Our understanding is that 

Congress did know that it wanted to include as a general 

matter all pre-enactment -- and again, not just 

pre-enactment but pre-implementation offenders as -­

offenders as well. And I think we know that because 

when you look to the provisions that actually speak to 

what a sex offender was required to do under the Act -­

and there are six such provisions -- they all start the 

same way. They say that the sex offender shall do 

something. And it defines the sex offender as somebody 

who was convicted.

 When you look at all six of those provisions 

on their face, they apply to all sex offenders so 

defined without any qualification. And Petitioner's 

view is that despite that clear language, despite the

lack of any qualification within those provisions, by 

virtue of subsection (d) what Congress is really saying 

is that nobody has to register until the Attorney 

General says otherwise.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how do they know 

where to register? Do you agree with your adversary 

that -- that they have to register under SORNA?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I -- they don't have 

to register under SORNA -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how were they 

supposed to know when or how they would register until 

the Attorney General acted?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Sure. If I could break 

it up into a few classes. Again, we are talking about 

pretty much -- actually, we are talking about everybody 

on day one. And so, for a number of pre-enactment and 

pre-implementation offenders, they're still going to be 

in prison on the day that SORNA was enacted.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking about 

those people.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about the -­

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: So, people -- and then 

the second group I was going to talk about are offenders 

like Reynolds, who have already registered before SORNA 

was enacted. They're already initially registered. 

It's the very same State registry system that 

pre-existed SORNA. There is no creation of any SORNA 

registry, and the statute itself doesn't talk about a 

SORNA-compliant registry. To the contrary, it defines a 

sex offender registry in 16911, subsection (9). And 

it's on page 10a of our brief. It defines a sex 

offender registry as a registry of sex offenders 

maintained by a jurisdiction.

 So, these are the same registries that have 

been in existence in all 50 States for the last decade. 

So, offenders like Reynolds don't have to do anything 

under (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them. They do, 

however, as pointed out, have to comply with the other 

provisions. They do have to do what (c) requires, which 

is when Reynolds moved from Missouri to Pennsylvania, he 

had to tell somebody. That is what (c) requires; it's 

what he was required to do even before SORNA was 

enacted. And what Congress did with respect to the 

subset of sex offenders that haven't already registered 

before SORNA but that need to get on the registry rolls

afterwards because, for example, their sex offense 

wasn't covered before SORNA -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your -- your 

argument is that "requirements" in the heading for 42 

U.S.C. 16913, Registration requirements for sex 

offenders, means something different than "requirements" 

in subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue 

rules about, because you're saying, although there is 

the requirement that they register and comply with (c) 

and all those other things, when it says that the 

Attorney General can issue regulations specifying the 

applicability of the requirements of this subchapter, 

that only meant the administration, you know, 

provisions, not the general requirement that you 

register and keep current and all that.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I don't think that 

that is what we are saying. What we view (d) as, 

essentially, is a safety valve. It does give the 

Attorney General that authority with respect to the 

requirements, but going forward. Congress has set the 

baseline; Congress has set the default rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a safety valve 

to release what?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: To release sex offenders 

if needed to -- to perhaps suspend certain registration

requirements. And let me give a couple of examples.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you are 

talking about sort of in the weeds, the little details, 

not the underlying requirement of registration, right?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I think it -- I think 

arguably it could be both. Again, I don't think this is 

something that Congress thought the Attorney General was 

necessarily going to have to exercise. And, in fact, 

the Attorney General has not done so.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But does that mean, Ms. 

Sherry, that -- that the Attorney General could, if he 

wanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all 

pre-enactment offenders from SORNA?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think as a theoretical 

matter, on its face, the delegation of authority in (d) 

is -- is quite broad and plenary. But I think as -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: And would allow that. So, 

when you say it gave the Attorney General the ability to 

confirm or modify the requirement in section (a), you 

mean he could, if he wanted to, exempt all pre-enactment 

offenders.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And, again, I say in 

theory because I think, like all delegations of 

authority, the Attorney General is certainly limited to 

acting in furtherance of the purpose of Congress, and

asking. We are talking, it seems to me, about section 

2250. He was convicted of violating, criminally, that 

section. So, I have no problem about the statute 

applying to all these people; it's a question of how it 

applies.

 All right. Imagine with me that we have an 

individual who was convicted a year ago and sentenced to 

a 5-year term. Does the statute apply to him?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: He was convicted a year 

ago -­

does apply.

course, it does.

 Now, he hasn't registered yet. He's in jail 

for 4 more years. So, has he violated 2250 so far?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: He has not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not? Thank you.

not yet expired. Now let's go back to a person who is 

far less certain how it applies. He committed the crime 

10 or 15 years ago. He has long since been released 

from prison.

 There are, as you point out, several 

categories. One is a person who has to -- who should, 

under Michigan State law, register, but he didn't. 

Another is a person who did and moved. You know, there 

are several categories.

 Now, is he in violation of 2250? Your point 

is he is immediately, even though it was much less clear 

that it applied to him, much less clear. And much less 

clear -- in fact, it doesn't say when he is supposed to 

register, but still 2250 applies to him.

 I just wonder how that could be, 

particularly when we have three sentences, indeed, which 

seem to me to tell the Attorney General, certainly, 

please deal with that kind of a case.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: If I could start with 

2250 and then go back to subsection (d), that is not our 

position. 2250 is the criminal provision. What we're 

actually looking at here are the registration -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought he was convicted

And his lawyer said, in response to my question, that 

one of the things she wants to argue is that he cannot 

be convicted under 2250 until he is under a legal 

obligation to register, and that initial registration is 

not a legal obligation until the Attorney General makes 

his rules. I thought that was the argument.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Let me make an important 

distinction. If we're actually talking about Reynolds 

here, you are right, but Reynolds was not convicted and 

was not prosecuted for failing to comply with the 

initial registration requirements in subsection (b). He 

was convicted and prosecuted for failing to comply with 

the timing requirements in subsection (c), which are 

quite clear as applied to offenders like Reynolds, who 

have already registered or already in the system.

 What he did was he traveled from Missouri -­

has to, not later than 3 days -­

what you're talking about.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're suggesting, Ms. 

Sherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each 

other. And, in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as 

all integrally linked and referring only to 

post-enactment offenders. So, (a) is the umbrella 

provision. It says "a sex offender shall register, and 

keep the registration current"; (b) says how you shall 

register initially; and (c) says how you shall keep that 

registration current.

 So, all three of these refer only to 

post-enactment offenders. And then (d) comes along and 

says, by the way, the Attorney General can apply all of 

this to pre-enactment offenders as well and can specify 

how to do that.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Again, I don't think 

that's right. And if it helps, I'd like to walk through 

the different provisions. The one thing I would say on 

the outset, however, is when you say that -- when you 

read those sections, you can read them as only applying 

to post-enactment offenders -- I don't think that's 

right, especially because of subsection (b), because on 

the day that SORNA was enacted, every single person in 

prison at that time was by definition a pre-enactment

offender. And so, on its face when you read subsection 

(b), it quite easily applies to quite a number of 

pre-enactment offenders.

 And the other point I would make along those 

lines is the fact that subsection (d) just doesn't talk 

about pre-enactment; it talks about pre-implementation 

offenders. So, offenders that were convicted after 

SORNA's enactment but before a State had implemented, 

again, quite easily fit not only within subsection (b) 

but within all the other subsections as well.

 And with respect to the interrelationship 

between them, I think subsection (a) really identifies 

the jurisdictions in which an offender needs to 

register. And so, the first sentence sets out three 

jurisdictions and where an offender both needs to 

register and to keep the information current.

 Subsection (b) really serves a limited 

purpose. It's an intake process. It's getting an 

offender into the system. For offenders like Reynolds 

who are already in the very same system, there's nothing 

to be done under (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them. 

(B) is applied to people who are not already in that 

system, and for those that can comply with the timing, 

it gets them in before they're released to the 

community.

But the inability to comply with subsection 

(b) for the small set of offenders that cannot comply 

with the timing requirements, it doesn't immunize them 

from complying with all of the other registration 

requirements.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you're 

reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the 

person who was convicted last year and has 4 more years 

to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he 

changes his name, if he stops being a student while in 

prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after. 

would say if that's your reading of those two sections, 

it's -- it's going to confuse everybody who is in 

prison, as it did confuse me.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: That is not my reading of 

the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I take it 

your reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until 

after he has to have initially registered. And so, 

we're back to the question of why you treat somebody who 

committed the crime long ago with less clarity, with 

less time to initially register, with more confusion 

from one jurisdiction than another, than you would treat 

a person who was convicted last year, is still in jail, 

and has 4 more years to register. That's why I read (d)

as trying to sort that kind of thing out.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Two points on that: 

Number one, for offenders like Reynolds that are already 

registered, there's nothing more to be done as far as 

registration goes. All they need to do is to keep the 

information current and to keep it updated.

 The other point I would make, since we're 

talking about 2250, Congress provided other protections 

for offenders that were unable to comply with the timing 

requirements. Number one, it -- it provided an 

impossibility affirmative defense in 2250(b). And the 

other thing that Congress did is it required that any 

failure to register, in order to be subject to criminal 

sanctions, that it be a knowing failure to register. In 

other words, that the offender know he has a 

registration requirement and know that he is not 

complying with that requirement.

 So, the idea that there are some 

hypothetical, or maybe even not so hypothetical, sex 

offenders out there who can't comply with the precise 

timing in (b) and will -- have no idea what they're 

required to do, they're not going to be -- they're not 

going to be criminally liable under 2250 because there 

is an impossibility defense. And to the extent they 

don't know that they have a registration requirement,

they're also not going to be criminally liable under

 And so -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why isn't 

part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that 

the one person who doesn't have to register for 4 years 

is in prison already; so, presumably, he doesn't present 

the same type of threat that led to the enactment of 

these registration laws in the first place?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: That's absolutely right. 

I mean, the release from -- the reason the release from 

prison is the -- is the trigger is because the concern 

and the reason we have registration is for periods of 

time where these offenders are released into the 

community.

 And that's why the timing requirement in (b) 

is there. The notion is that, before offenders are 

released into the community, we want to get them on the 

registry rolls; we want to be able to track them from 

the day that they're released.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. Your view is that 

they have to register initially when?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: If they have not?

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I'm just saying 

take my example. The person is in Michigan. Michigan

a reasonable time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, reasonable time.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: He can only be -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And what is a reasonable 

time?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Given the other timing in 

the rest of the requirements, something probably along 

the lines of, give or take, 3 business days. The 

important point, however -­

JUSTICE BREYER: In 3 business days, he's 

supposed to go out and do that, and if he doesn't do it, 

he has committed a Federal crime which makes no mention 

of it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to 

guess that that's 3 business days because he's a lawyer; 

is that why?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, it's actually -- it's 

not unique with respect to the statute. It's quite 

common for status offenses, and let me try to give one 

example. One of the statutes that this Court looked at 

fairly recently, 922(g)(9), makes it unlawful to possess

a firearm after having a conviction for a misdemeanor 

crime of domestic violence. That statute was passed in 

1996, and it applied to everybody who has been convicted 

of a domestic violence offense.

 And so, if an individual had a domestic 

violence conviction in 1990, for example, and had had a 

firearm in his house, in his possession, for the last 

20 years, when the statute was passed in 1996 he was in 

violation of the statute. Of course, he couldn't be 

criminally prosecuted unless he was given some 

reasonable period of time to get rid of the firearm. 

But there's nothing unique with respect to that.

 And, again, the criminal provision here, 

2250, provides additional protections. It has an 

affirmative defense for impossibility, and it requires 

that there be knowledge. So, for an offender that knows 

he is required to register, he's given a reasonable 

amount of time to come into compliance with that 

registration requirement.

 Reynolds, in particular, is a good example 

here of what Congress was trying to get at. Reynolds 

knew he was required to tell somebody when he moved from 

Missouri to Pennsylvania. He knew that because he 

signed registration forms in Missouri telling him as 

much. And those are in the joint appendix at pages

Missouri law, not under the Federal statute.

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: They were -- they were 

under Missouri law, but the important point for SORNA 

purposes is that he knew he had a registration 

requirement. He doesn't have to know what law it arises 

under. And, again, the sex offender registries that 

pre-existed SORNA are the exact same sex offender 

registries that SORNA is using.

 SORNA was enacted in 2006. It wasn't 

starting over; it wasn't starting from scratch. It 

wanted to build on the previous regime. It wanted to 

fix it and make it better and fill in gaps and fill in 

loopholes and stitch all of the State systems -­

Congress provided additional protections for those

the Attorney General has had authority and exercised 

authority to define certain aspects of criminal law. 

Touby is one example of such a case. And I think -­

different. I mean, if you're talking about defining 

which drugs are qualified, you know, under provisions 

that criminalize possession, things like that. That's

straightforward confirming, which is what you say 

happened here.

circumstances, but it's certainly within the scope of 

the general authority of an agency or the Attorney 

General in this case to reiterate the statute's 

requirement.

 The Attorney General went -- went a step 

further in the interim rule in that what the Attorney 

General said in the preamble is: I read the statute as 

written. I think it applies facially to all sex 

offenders regardless of the date of conviction, but I 

understand the defendants are making an argument to the 

contrary. And in an abundance of caution, to foreclose 

that argument to the extent I need to do something under 

subsection (d), I'm doing it now, and I'm saying that, 

yes, it applies to all pre-enactment and 

pre-implementation offenders. And I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I get back to my 

question, which -- what's your best example of an 

Attorney General doing something like that?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Confirming? I don't know 

if I have one in a criminal context exactly, but I think 

the point maybe that Your Honor is getting at -- you can 

certainly correct me if I'm wrong -- might be a point 

that you made earlier. It certainly is somewhat unusual 

delegation of authority to the Attorney General. If 

Congress had wanted the Attorney General to decide

whether or not the registration requirements at the very 

core of this statute had any operative effect going 

forward, presumably it would have told the Attorney 

General that he needed to do something.

 That's something that Congress did in many 

other provisions of SORNA where Congress said the 

Attorney General shall do something. In fact, more than 

a dozen provisions -- Congress used that language to 

direct the Attorney General to take a certain action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, here it says 

"shall." It says, "The Attorney General shall have the 

authority to specify the applicability of the 

requirements of this subsection."

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: But it says "shall have 

the authority." And I think there's a significant 

difference between "shall specify" and "shall have the 

authority to specify." The latter is a passive 

delegation of authority; it's a permissive delegation. 

It suggests that Congress did not think that the 

Attorney General had to do something for the statute to 

apply as written. It suggests that the statute applied 

on day one to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation 

offenders as all the other subsections that set forth 

the registration requirements suggest, but if the 

Attorney General in the future sees a need to specify

JUSTICE KAGAN: But the question -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're starting from a 

proposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress 

necessarily and under all circumstances thought that it 

had to include pre-SORNA convictions. But I don't 

know -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had 

State systems in place; it had an imperfect Wetterling 

Act in place. It had lots of other mechanisms in place 

to punish non-registrants.

 So, you're starting from the proposition 

that, by necessity, they wanted to include preconviction 

felonies. But I guess for those of us who believe in 

legislative history, and I know many of my colleagues 

don't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were 

two bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it 

very clear, explicitly clear, that it applied to 

pre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which 

under the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now 

has.

 Doesn't that suggest to us that Congress 

itself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the 

pre-SORNA convictions or not?

two reasons. First, to address the bills themselves, I 

don't think the Senate bill, just like I don't think 

subsection (d) means that Congress meant to apply the 

registration requirements to all pre-enactment offenders 

in the registration provisions and then take away that 

application in the specify the applicability provision.

 In the Senate bill that you're talking 

about, it defined a sex offender as anybody who has been 

convicted of a sex offense. And as this Court said in 

Carr, that's the language that Congress quite often uses 

when it intends to include pre-enactment conduct.

 So, I think the verb choice, both in the 

Senate bill, in the House bill, and in the bill that was 

actually enacted, indicates that it did intend to 

include pre-enactment offenders.

 The other point I'd want to make is, again, 

another point that was made in Carr, which is that the 

registration requirements stand at the very center of 

Congress's efforts to find and to register the 100,000 

missing sex offenders that had fallen off the registry 

rolls under the previous regime.

 So, I think it is quite clear with respect 

to SORNA that Congress did want to include pre-enactment 

offenders. It wanted to not only find those missing sex 

offenders; it wanted to make sure that they got back on

the registry rolls. And as far as the hundreds of 

thousand offenders that were already on the registry 

rolls when SORNA was enacted, they wanted to make sure 

that they stayed on the registry rolls, that they kept 

the information current, they continued to update their 

information going forward.

 And, again, with respect to pre-enactment 

offenders that were in prison at the time that SORNA was 

enacted, it wanted to make sure to get them on the 

registry rolls before they left prison, before they 

entered the community.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess my problem is 

that you make an assumption, you continue to make an 

assumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -­

that the Attorney General was incapable of acting 

quickly.

 I mean, if the Attorney General had, within 

a few months, done what he ultimately did a year later 

or whatever time period after, had come out and said it 

applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register 

wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move 

or change your name -- then Congress would have 

accomplished the goal it wanted.

wanted the Attorney General to act and to act quickly,

presumably Congress would have told the Attorney General 

that he had to do something. Again, that's something 

Congress did in many other provisions of SORNA. 

Congress wasn't shy about -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why did -- the 

Attorney General did try to act very swiftly, and if the 

Attorney General thought that SORNA applied from day 

one, why did the Attorney General try to rush through 

regulation that said nothing more than SORNA applies?

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Because when the Attorney 

General issued the interim rule, what he said was that 

reading it on the face, I do think it applies to 

everybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an 

alternative argument. And I think it's incredibly 

important that it apply to everybody, and that it apply 

to everyone quickly, because we're talking about 

protecting our communities; we're talking about 

protecting the public and protecting our children from 

sex offenders. And having this uncertainty out there is 

-- is not only not good for protecting the public, but 

it's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for 

jurisdictions that are trying to work towards 

substantial implementation of SORNA.

 And so, I think you could look at it one of 

two ways. If the idea is, well, Congress left it to the

probably wasn't that much for the Attorney General to do 

in the first place, and there's little reason that 

Congress would not have made that decision on its own.

 To the extent you think there was a whole 

bunch of things for the Attorney General to do, which, 

again, we disagree with, presumably that's something 

that would take some time. And during the interim, 

period those 100,000 sex offenders would remain missing; 

additional sex offenders would be added to that number; 

and the community and the public would continue to be at 

risk going forward.

Congress delegating that authority to the Attorney

point is that Congress decided nothing and left it all 

to the Attorney General.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Ms. Cain, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CAIN: I'd like to address one point the 

Government made, that there's no need to re-register -­

someone in Mr. Reynolds's position -- once they've been 

registered under State law. They acknowledge the 

opposite themselves in footnote 12, where they say 

that -- that a government or a State will have been 

deemed to substantially implement SORNA if it registers 

pre-enactment and pre-implementation sex offenders who 

remain in the system as registrants, as well as other 

people. So, it's clear that the Government 

believes that -- acknowledges that people who are 

already registered must re-register under SORNA.

 The most important thing is that this -- the 

SORNA statute -- the obligation under SORNA begins with 

initial registration and does not begin with a State 

registration. And enactment -- Congress knew that 

certain people would be unable to register under 

subsection (b), and that is why they enacted subsection 

(d).
