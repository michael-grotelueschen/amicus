 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi.

 Mr. Weisman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WEISMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The issue before the Court today is whether 

a State court sentence reduction motion which is a pure 

plea for leniency qualifies as, quote, "an application 

for post-conviction or other collateral review" within 

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2). The State 

respectfully argued there are at least three reasons why 

such a term as "collateral review" refers only to a 

legal challenge, refers to those recognized post-direct 

appeal applications in which constitutional, 

jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be 

raised.

 First, as this Court has said, it is 

presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the 

language that this Court used in its decisions, and the 

term "collateral review" has been used by this Court, 

certainly when referring to Federal 2255 applications,

as those type of independent civil inquiries testing the 

validity of a conviction and/or sentence -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Weisman, the 

phrase is "post-conviction or other" -- "or other 

collateral review." And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35 

motion is postconviction.

 So it's postconviction. It's not direct 

review. Why isn't that responsive?

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I think both parties are 

in agreement, Your Honor, that the postconviction review 

is a part and parcel of the other collateral review. 

That's not -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Or" usually means it's 

something in addition.

 MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but it's -- with respect, 

Your Honor, it is "or other collateral review," and the 

"or other" -- and I think both parties are in agreement 

as to this -- "or other" embraces that State 

postconviction review must also be, quote/unquote, 

"collateral review."

 Also, I think importantly, it would be 

anomalous in a tolling provision, in which we are 

talking about the direct appeal already having been 

concluded, to embrace things that don't -- that don't -­

that come prior to the direct appeal. This is a tolling

-- obviously, 2244(d)(1) speaks about the finality of a 

State court judgment of conviction. At that point, 

obviously -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the -­

you said -- you said "prior to." I thought the Rule 35 

motion is made after the conviction.

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it can be made -- it can 

be made prior to when the conviction becomes final. For 

example, it can be made within 120 days of the 

imposition of sentence. Or it can be made within 

120 days after the affirmance of the conviction on 

direct appeal of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. So it 

can be made prior to when the conviction becomes, 

quote/unquote, "final."

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't that true 

regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal 

relief or discretionary relief alone? That both can be 

made prior to the finality of the judgment?

 MR. WEISMAN: That is true, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and if I understand 

your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions 

that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2) 

language. It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek 

discretionary relief do not.

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I'm not sure we conceded

that point, Your Honor. I think clearly we're all in 

agreement that postconviction vehicles and habeas 

vehicles, which obviously all traditionally occur after 

the direct appeal has been concluded, obviously qualify 

as what this Court -- and everybody, we would suggest -­

recognizes as, quote/unquote, "collateral review."

 In terms of a Rule 35 motion that says, for 

example, the sentence is outside of the -- outside of 

the proper boundaries, it's unlawful as a matter of law, 

I don't think we've actually conceded before this Court 

that that would qualify. But certainly this Court -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would Rule 35 permit a 

challenge for a Federal violation? You've given an 

example of an illegal sentence that you think is 

discretionary; am I correct?

 MR. WEISMAN: Not in -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But does Rule 35(a) 

permit a legal challenge of the kind that Justice Kagan 

was asking?

 MR. WEISMAN: Correct. Our Rule 35 contains 

within the same provision a challenge to the legality of 

the sentence, to the manner in which it was imposed -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's assume 

a pure legal challenge.

 MR. WEISMAN: A pure legal challenge,

Court doesn't have to answer that question here. There 

are good arguments why it would not, again, because in a

and, again, 2255 -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So explain again why you 

don't think this is collateral?

you're doing, as the First Circuit recognized, is making 

a pure plea for leniency, sentence leniency, you're 

not -­

of a judgment that has already survived scrutiny under 

direct review. And a Rule 35 vehicle, even one that 

raises a legal challenge -- and a tolling provision 

simply would not begin to run at that point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand your argument at all. It seems to me the 

phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review" 

means postconviction collateral review or preconviction 

collateral review. Isn't that what is added? 

"Post-conviction or other"; what's "other" from 

"post-conviction"? I guess it would be preconviction, 

wouldn't it?

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we would suggest, Your 

Honor, that the "collateral review," as explained by 

this Court, is referring to the difference between 

collateral review and direct review. And the case in -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. And is this 

direct review?

 MR. WEISMAN: This would not -- this is 

clearly not -- this is not in the direct review process. 

No, it's not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's collateral review? 

So -­

MR. WEISMAN: Well -­

MR. WEISMAN: This -- this Court, though, 

Your Honor, has said that, speaking about when Congress 

enacted 2255, it simplified the procedure for making a 

collateral attack on a final judgment entered in a 

Federal criminal case, but it did not purport to modify 

the distinction, again, between collateral review and 

direct review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that if -- if 

there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it 

hinges not on the "post-conviction or other collateral" 

phrase, but rather on the word "review."

 I suppose it could be argued that you're not 

reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy. 

Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're 

asking for mercy. And I would -- you know, perhaps it's 

not review. Is that your point?

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we go forward and use 

that -- even -- we would suggest, Your Honor, even more 

strongly that the phrase "collateral review," as that 

phrase has been used by this Court consistently, 

recognizes that this is a procedure that occurs after 

the completion of a direct review process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only because 

all the cases we've had involved that. We've never had 

a case like this before. So in all those other cases,

we've used the natural term "collateral review." That 

doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this. It just means 

we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies 

to this.

 MR. WEISMAN: But, Your Honor, respectfully, 

in State v. Addonizio itself, it contrasted the Rule 35 

motion, for example. Many jurisdictions, including 

obviously the Federal courts, had this very -- almost 

exact Rule 35-type proceeding. It has never been 

referred to, it has never been understood in thousands 

of cases, as collateral review. It always had been 

understood as a -- sort of a quasi-civil inquiry, after 

the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I think that 

that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the 

Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the 

Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and 

that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about 

that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review. Am I 

wrong about that?

 MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe so, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: U.S. v. Robinson, 

Bartone v. United States. And I might be wrong about 

it.

MR. WEISMAN: We don't believe it ever 

referred to a sentence -- a plea for sentence leniency, 

Your Honor, no, not -- not as a plea, a pure plea for 

leniency under Rule 35.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the current Federal 

rule -­

MR. WEISMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- provides for -- it's 

Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency? 

That's Rhode Island's?

 MR. WEISMAN: That's correct -- correct, 

Your Honor. We're just speaking about the pre-1987 

guidelines rule, which is the same.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that we adopt 

your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal 

error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and 

we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it 

has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole 

review boards, and so forth.

 I don't see why you don't lose anyway, 

because the allegation here, the complaint, the 

argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion, 

and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal 

ground to set aside the -- the sentence.

to differentiate between a legal ground and the vehicle. 

Again, the vehicle, the reduction, the plea for leniency 

vehicle, is not a legal vehicle. It's simply, I think, 

as the Kholi panel recognized -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a motion made 

in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the 

State.

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, it -- but -- but -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little odd to say 

that that's not legal. If -- an abuse of discretion 

standard is something we're quite familiar with in the 

law. We've never thought of that as being somehow 

extra-legal.

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, to the extent it's abuse 

of discretion, it's really shorthand for the appellate 

court takes a look; if the sentence is within the proper 

bounds and if there was, quote, "some justification" for 

the imposition of the sentence, then it's affirmed. And

the inquiry is. They take a look at the sentence; if 

it's in the legal bounds, the filing of the motion

and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the

Kennedy was raising? If it's the same sort of arguments 

that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the 

imposition of sentencing, why should they not be 

considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule 

35?

 MR. WEISMAN: Because we don't believe they

abuse of discretion that that is talking about is if 

there's no justification. They look -- again, they look 

at the sentence, and if there's no justification for it, 

then it will be an abuse of discretion. If there's some 

justification -- and, again, it hasn't happened. If 

there's some -- if the sentence is within the legal 

limits and there's some justification for it, it will be 

affirmed. That's -­

have given a lesser sentence. How is that leniency? 

It's abuse of discretion.

-- I understand the words "abuse of discretion" are 

used, but the "no justification and manifestly excessive 

standard" simply, as the cases explicate, looks at the 

sentence; if it's legal and if there's some 

justification for it, the appeal is denied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to 

figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by 

jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion 

review or a leniency review or this or that. And 

that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat 

your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so 

we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having 

very much success understanding the distinction that 

you're telling me. I don't want to have to do this for 

50 States.

 MR. WEISMAN: I understand. But certainly, 

Your Honor, just -- just using the formulation that 

everything that's filed in a State court post a judgment 

of conviction qualifies would certainly be an odd way 

for that Congress to have expressed that.

involves only a motion to reduce sentence. And 

certainly the policy considerations for what Congress 

would have intended -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry. 

Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce 

sentence is very short. It just says that the man 

"prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the 

above matter be reduced in accordance with the 

provisions of Rule 35." Would it make a difference to 

you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he 

prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to 

the above matter be reduced in accordance with 

provisions of Rule 35?

MR. WEISMAN: It might be.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: If he had put in that word, 

"illegal," would that have made the difference?

 MR. WEISMAN: It might, Your Honor. And 

under our system, it might -- that might have been 

characterized, not as a sentence reduction provision or 

sentence reduction vehicle, but as a legal motion to 

correct an illegal sentence, or challenging the 

sentence.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- but that does suggest 

the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we're 

going to have to look at the particular rule of the 

State, we're going to have to look at the particular 

motion, we're going to look at any -- we're going to 

have to look at any State law regarding how motions are 

construed.

 MR. WEISMAN: Sure.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And this is going to be a 

very difficult determination.

 MR. WEISMAN: Sure. If I could just address 

that, Your Honor. The problem is -- it's simply because 

a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, 

these are matters that already are going to have been 

concluded in the State court. Before anyone files for 

2254, the State's court's going to have findings.

They're going to -- it's either going to be a motion for 

sentence leniency or it's going to be a motion to 

correct an illegal sentence.

 These matters -- and they have to be pled by 

the State as well. So when an applicant goes to Federal 

court, district court, and files a 2254, if we want to 

raise the affirmative defense of the time bar, which 

will save the Federal court a lot of time, obviously, 

because there is no case at all -- and if we can 

contrast it with exhaustion, for example, which, as this 

Court obviously is familiar with, presents very 

complicated questions of whether, you know, State 

procedures were exhausted and claims were exhausted, 

this is very straightforward. If somebody raises a 

motion which challenges the legality of the sentence, it 

will be characterized in State court in the run of the 

mine -- in the run of the mine cases, as an 

illegal sentence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So a petitioner in the 

future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says: 

I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal 

sentence -- make something up -­

MR. WEISMAN: Right.

whether they would toll or not toll based on that now 

side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just 

a plea for leniency? That's what you are proposing?

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, what we suggest actually 

is very straightforward, Your Honor. If somebody 

captions their document, you know, "Motion for sentence" 

-- "for sentence reduction and motion to correct an 

illegal sentence," that's not this case, obviously, 

because then the court -­

victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have 

truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island. I mean, 

why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way?

 MR. WEISMAN: Because -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's to lose? You say it 

doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is 

frivolous or not. What's to lose?

 MR. WEISMAN: Because, Your Honor, they 

actually want to reduce their sentence. It's not -- we 

don't suggest it's not a matter of playing games. They 

-- you know, they feel they were sentenced for 30 years 

and maybe they want 20 years, and if they want to 

challenge the legality of the sentence, they recognize 

the established collateral attack vehicles.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There is another argument 

that you could make, other than the one you've been 

pressing, which is that collateral review means 

something other than a step in the criminal case. But 

you've chosen not to make that; is that correct?

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, we've spoken about the 

words "collateral review" as embracing a case that's 

already -- upon looking -- a proceeding that occurs 

after the finality of the judgment, which obviously 

includes this Court's denial of cert or the time -­

MR. WEISMAN: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure you said that 

earlier, that this motion can be made before the 

judgment is final. Didn't you say that?

 MR. WEISMAN: It can. It certainly can, 

Your Honor. And we would suggest -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what you 

just said.

 MR. WEISMAN: No -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What you just said is after 

the finality. Which is it?

 MR. WEISMAN: We would suggest, Your Honor, 

that that furthers our argument. A Rule 35 motion is 

not collateral review because it is not a motion -- you 

could say even in a legal sense, motion. It's not a 

motion that occurs after the judgment becomes final. 

And we're looking at a tolling provision, and the 

congressional intent of the tolling provision was 

finality and exhaustion of State remedies.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure 

I understand that. There's nothing in this rule that 

bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is 

final. They have 120 days.

 MR. WEISMAN: They have 120 days. It can be

filed after the sentence is imposed, 120 days of that 

date, or 120 days after the conviction becomes final. 

And we would suggest that the term "collateral review" 

embraces, as Justice Alito indicated, sort of that 

concept that, obviously in a tolling provision, it 

begins to run when the conviction becomes final.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia's 

suggestion -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that it says -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that perhaps the -­

the leniency review is -- is not review of the 

conviction or sentence. But you didn't -- you didn't do 

anything with that. You didn't argue that the kind of 

review that's involved with leniency is really not 

review of the sentence for legal error.

 MR. WEISMAN: It's clearly not, Your Honor, 

correct. I think, as everybody here recognizes, the 

Kholi panel and the Respondents in this case as well 

characterized this Rule 35 proceeding as sort of apart, 

distinct, away from the underlying case. And that's 

undoubtedly true in the sense that it's not -- it's not 

part of the direct review process. It's -- it's clearly 

not. But that doesn't mean it's collateral review. 

It's not either/or. It could be -­

something in between? It's not direct and it's not

 MR. WEISMAN: It's -- it's neither fish nor 

fowl, Your Honor. I mean, simply because it's not part 

of a direct review process doesn't mean that it's, 

quote, our argument would be, "collateral review," 

because, again, "collateral review" has this sort of 

meaning in the law, using this Court's decisions, using 

this Court's cases, referring to a post-judgment vehicle 

in which fundamental jurisdictional and other types of 

errors can be raised.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about a motion -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we need a new 

adjective then, because I'd always thought that there 

are two kinds of review, direct and collateral. You say 

there's a -- a tertium quid. What do you want us to

 MR. WEISMAN: Well, I don't know that it 

needs to be called anything, Your Honor. I think the

isn't either direct or collateral.

 MR. WEISMAN: -- it is certainly -- it is 

certainly an interesting vehicle because, it can be 

filed prior to the finality of the judgment and it can 

be filed -- and it can be filed after the judgment 

becomes final.

 And, again, going -- going back to the 

policies, the 2244(d)(2), very clearly, two big 

policies, again, are finality, which obviously it 

promotes -- these cases would not be in Federal court if 

they were time-barred -- and exhaustion of State 

remedies. To have a motion that seeks leniency only, 

there's no purpose that could be accomplished by 

bringing that motion into Federal court, and therefore 

it doesn't serve that purpose.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Weisman, that's 

true also of State habeas claims that are based only on 

State law. But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2) 

applies to those claims. Are you contesting that?

 MR. WEISMAN: We're not. But the -- but the 

important element there, Your Honor, is that those 

vehicles can be raised to bring -- those are the 

vehicles, the collateral vehicles, through which the 

States have channelled constitutional, jurisdictional, 

and other fundamental claims.

The Rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle 

doesn't -- can't do it, can't do that service. So, 

sure, you could have -- you could have a habeas, and the 

only issue, the only claim raised in habeas could be, 

you know, it's in violation of -- of my State rights, 

which couldn't be heard in 2254, but -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Where the exhaustion policy 

does not come into effect.

 MR. WEISMAN: Exactly. But Congress may 

have well said we're not going to be in the business of 

looking at the individual claims. Look, this is a 

collateral review vehicle. This vehicle is a recognized 

vehicle for bringing, for channeling in these claims. 

So that's going to toll.

 But this other vehicle, this Rule 35 

sentence reduction vehicle -- it can never be used for a 

claim that could go to Federal court. It's pointless. 

I mean, it wouldn't serve the purpose, and of course it 

would undermine the State's interest in getting the 

State prisoners into Federal court within 1 year.

 I'll reserve my time if that's okay, Your 

Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MIZNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The First Circuit here correctly held that 

Khalil Kholi's motion for a reduction of sentence under 

Rhode Island Rule 35 was an application for State 

postconviction or other collateral review with respect 

to the pertinent judgment or claim. As such, it tolled 

AEDPA's 1-year limitation period, and Mr. Kholi's 

petition was timely filed.

 We look to the common usage and ordinary 

understanding of the words of the tolling provision in 

the context of the statute. Collateral review is a 

proceeding occurring after final judgment that could 

affect that judgment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct that you think 

"post-conviction or other collateral review" means 

anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct 

review?

 MS. MIZNER: Yes, for purposes of the 

tolling provision.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Then what does the phrase 

"or other collateral review" add? Why -- why wouldn't 

Congress just say "post-conviction review"?

MS. MIZNER: In Duncan, this Court talked 

about the possibility of civil commitment or contempt in 

custody that could be part of the Rule 2254 proceeding 

and that that would not be postconviction. So that 

postconviction is a form of collateral review but is not 

the only form.

 In Duncan, the Court also discussed the fact 

that many States may call what other States call 

"post-conviction review" something else, and that that 

would also then be collateral. The collateral is just 

a -- an umbrella that encompasses postconviction and 

other forms of review after a judgment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you just 

call your motion a motion to correct an illegal 

sentence? Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I 

gather.

 MS. MIZNER: Under the State's theory, there 

would not be. I did not file this motion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not one of 

the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. MIZNER: I may be in other respects, 

Your Honor, but not this one.

 MS. MIZNER: From the State's perspective. 

I don't think that there's a problem with omitting the 

word "illegal," because -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's because 

you want something other than legal review, right? You 

want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court. 

You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality 

of the sentence, but this is something different, right? 

This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but 

you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of 

reasons.

 MS. MIZNER: Yes. It is a request for the 

court to -- to review, to take a second look, to 

reexamine the sentence to determine whether or not it 

was unduly severe at the time that it was imposed. You 

are asking the court to -- to take a second look, either 

based on factors that were submitted at sentencing or 

additional information that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can raise all of 

those -- all of those claims under the normal State 

collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other 

things, right?

under the postconviction review. You can also raise 

them -- in Rhode Island, there is a provision of the 

postconviction review statute that speaks of the -- any 

facts that would require a new proceeding in the 

interests of justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess I'm 

having trouble. You can -- the various grounds on which 

the sentence should have been lower than it was, 

including the fact that setting the sentence at that 

level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can 

raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on 

direct review, right?

 MS. MIZNER: In Rhode Island, you cannot 

challenge your sentence on direct review.

you could also encompass it in a motion for 

postconviction relief, which is the kind of umbrella 

Rhode Island procedure for raising -- for a legal 

challenge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So after a conviction in 

the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on 

direct review, with a number of issues, improperly 

admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't 

add: And, in addition, he was sentenced under the wrong 

provision; he was given 5 years too many because the 

judge cited the wrong provision. You can't say that on 

direct review?

 MS. MIZNER: Under my understanding of the 

Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions, the answer to that 

is no.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You can challenge only 

the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?

 MS. MIZNER: I believe that that is the 

holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -­

is limited to exhaustion of the claims that are going to 

be presented in the Federal habeas petition. And since 

a -- the denial of a request for a sentence reduction on 

the grounds of abuse of discretion is not going to be a 

claim that is cognizable in Federal habeas corpus 

jurisdiction, then you would not need to exhaust it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is the whole 

purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal 

statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an 

opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?

 MS. MIZNER: Exhaustion is one of the 

purposes of the tolling provision, but this Court has 

recognized that AEDPA's purpose was to further the 

principles of comity and finality and federalism, and 

had a clear purpose of encouraging litigants to pursue 

claims in State court prior to seeking Federal review.

 So, tying the tolling provision to State 

applications shows congressional concern for comity, 

which at its core is a -- is a respect for the State 

processes that are used in reviewing the claims of State 

prisoners.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I may have 

asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want 

to make sure of the answer. Your -- you have a client 

who is convicted of a particular offense that results in

a sentence of, what, zero to 5 years, okay? And the 

judge, in imposing the sentence, engages in racial 

discrimination. It turns out that he sentences 

African-Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to 

2 years. That, you're telling me, is a claim that you 

cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?

 MS. MIZNER: It would be raised in the State 

Rule 35, a motion to correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say it 

"would be raised." Are you saying it can only be raised 

under Rule 35?

State postconviction review proceedings as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I return to the question 

Justice Ginsburg asked a couple of minutes ago? We have 

-- let's say we have a case in which a defendant 

convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal 

claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal 

habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of 

sentence based purely on a request for leniency, a 

sentence within the range prescribed by the statute. 

What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the 

Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for 

leniency in the State court? Now, you say comity, but 

in concrete practical terms, what purpose is served?

MS. MIZNER: A prisoner who receives 

adequate relief in the State court, through whatever 

vehicle, may choose not to pursue a Federal habeas 

corpus claim.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In your experience, does 

that happen a lot? You have somebody who is sentenced 

to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also 

has legal challenges that would result in no conviction, 

no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction -- that 

person decides to give up on the legal challenge because 

the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1?

 MS. MIZNER: I would say that would be 

unlikely, but there are many Federal habeas cases that 

are -- raise questions of, for example, ineffective 

assistance of counsel at sentencing. A State resolution 

that reduces the sentence would obviate the need for a 

Federal habeas petition in that context.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you look at 2255 -­

that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also 

has a 1-year statute of limitations. That limitation 

would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion. So 

why should it be tolled for State?

 MS. MIZNER: 2255, Justice Ginsburg, has no 

tolling provision at all, and the reason for that may

perhaps be the respect for comity that Congress 

recognized when you are addressing a 2254 petition filed 

by a State prisoner.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I think, Ms. Mizner, the 

amicus brief in this case asserted that, in Rhode Island 

or in other States with a rule like this, many judges 

sit on these Rule 35 motions. They just let them stay 

pending for a considerable period of time, in order to 

retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when 

they feel like doing so. Is that your understanding of 

what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that 

they are not denied?

 MS. MIZNER: I don't practice in Rhode 

Island, but in this case the Rule 35 did not sit. It 

was resolved by the trial court within 3 months. The 

issue, the potential for abuse from sitting on motions 

is not limited to a Rhode Island Rule 35. It's not a 

peculiar concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the 

question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not 

that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good 

thing. The idea is you've got a motion for reduction of 

sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say: 

Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of 

the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after

the first several months that you're a model prisoner. 

In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a 

good thing; and if we start saying that the time for 

Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not 

to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct 

after conviction.

 MS. MIZNER: Well, the Rule 35 also provides 

that the decision must be made within a reasonable time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 120 days, right?

 MS. MIZNER: No, 120 days is the time 

frame -­

be filed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. MIZNER: The rule also provides that it 

must be decided, resolved, within a reasonable time. So 

there is a -- a limitation in that respect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any indication 

in the case law what a reasonable time consists of?

 MS. MIZNER: I have not found any Rhode 

Island cases discussing that particular question.

question is: Why -- look, two appeals; one judgment, 

one sentence. Okay? January, June. You're prepared to 

say the 1-year statute does not begin to -- to run until 

June. Fine. The Rule 35 motion, when you took an 

appeal, became final for purposes of the Federal habeas 

statute in June.

 So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become 

final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever 

that's decided finally? Why is it collateral at all? 

Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct?

conviction had been affirmed in the context of looking 

for a discretionary reduction of sentence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if the 

statutory maximum for an offense in Rhode Island is 5 

years and the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of 10 

years, and the defense attorney at that time says, well, 

you can't do that, that's more than a statutory maximum; 

and the judge goes ahead with it, and then an appeal is 

taken?

 You're saying that the appellate court in 

Rhode Island would not entertain that argument? They 

would say you have to go back and make a Rule 35 motion 

in the trial court? Maybe that's the procedure.

MS. MIZNER: Well, this Court has discussed 

the -- has used the term "collateral review" in a -- a 

number of different contexts, in civil cases, in habeas 

cases, in the -- in the manner of distinguishing between 

direct review and something that is outside direct 

review.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't -- if I look up 

"collateral attack" in Black's Law Dictionary, won't I 

find a definition there? And won't it tell me that this 

is something other than the proceeding? This is an 

attack on a judgment outside of the proceeding that led 

to the entry of that judgment. Isn't that what the term 

generally means?

 MS. MIZNER: "Collateral" generally means 

supplementary, as defined in Black's, and "collateral 

attack" in Black's is defined as an attack on a judgment 

in a proceeding other than direct appeal.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Right.

 MS. MIZNER: But the Rule 35 motion in Rhode 

Island is not part of a direct appeal. It is a

collateral, is also part of the original proceeding.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about just a 

regular motion for a new trial, not based on newly -- on 

newly discovered evidence? Is that collateral, or is -­

is that part of the -- the criminal proceeding?

 MS. MIZNER: The motions for new trial -- a 

motion for a new trial that has to be filed within 10 or 

14 days of the conviction would be part of the direct 

appeal and therefore would be -- would not be 

collateral. But a motion for a new trial that is filed 

after the judgment is affirmed by a court of appeals and 

the time for cert has passed would be collateral.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's wrong with the 

argument that nothing that occurs in the criminal case 

itself is collateral? What Congress had in mind when it 

spoke about collateral review was something like habeas.

 Let me give you an alternative 

interpretation of this, and maybe it's completely wrong, 

but you'll tell me why it's wrong.

 "Post-conviction" is a term of art. Many 

States, including Rhode Island, have postconviction 

review statutes. So Congress wanted to have that time, 

the time when those proceedings were tolled -- were 

pending tolled. But not every State uses that phrase. 

Not every State uses that term. They have other names

for the proceeding, and that's what's meant by "other 

collateral review." "Collateral review" is a term of 

art. It's not something that you understand by looking 

up the word "collateral" in a dictionary.

 What's wrong with that?

 MS. MIZNER: There is no indication that 

Congress was limiting the use of the term "collateral 

review" to a postconviction legal challenge. Congress 

could have said that if it had wished.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not saying it has to do 

with whether it's legal or something else. It has to do 

with whether it's in the criminal case or not in the 

criminal case.

 MS. MIZNER: Traditionally, motions that are 

filed -- motions for a new trial are -- may be filed 

after the judgment has been affirmed and have been 

viewed by the courts as collateral, as collateral 

review. So there is -- the tradition doesn't limit the 

use of the term "collateral review" to a proceeding that 

is completely separate and apart.

 Indeed, a 2255, while it may be separately 

filed, is then consolidated with the original 

proceeding, and there's an entry in the docket -- you 

shall not file any more pleadings in that separate case. 

It all goes back to the original case. The 2255, which

is collateral, is heard by the trial court.

 So there is a -- there is no reason to 

assume that Congress was limiting collateral review to 

something outside of the original proceeding.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -­

JUSTICE ALITO: 2255 is -- is in the 

original case, but it's a habeas substitute. It was 

adopted by Congress as a substitute for habeas; isn't 

that right?

 MS. MIZNER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that a petition 

for clemency that's presented to the governor would toll 

the limitations period?

 MS. MIZNER: No, I do not, Justice Kagan.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why -- why is that 

different?

 MS. MIZNER: Because 2244(d)(2) is tolling 

an application for review with respect to the pertinent 

judgment or claim. And a -- an application for clemency 

doesn't produce any change in the judgment that is 

rendered by the court. It's not a request that is 

related to the legal reasoning behind a judgment; it 

doesn't challenge the basis for the judgment. And it's 

an executive branch function, in some cases with advice 

and consent of a legislative body. And there's no

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be right, 

but I don't think that's the reason. I -- I thought we 

had held that the word "filed" in the petition means 

filed in a court, not filed with the governor. It's -­

it's the word "filed" in -- in the tolling provision 

that -- that does the work.

 MS. MIZNER: I would agree.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think it doesn't 

matter that -- I mean, a Rule 35 motion is a motion made 

in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of 

it. So isn't a collateral attack a sort of -- another 

proceeding to the side of the main proceeding, but the 

Rule 35 motion is filed in the criminal proceeding 

itself?

 MS. MIZNER: Yes, it is, Justice Ginsburg, 

as is a Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly 

discovered evidence, which courts have held to be 

collateral. It's a question of -- of when these motions 

are filed that makes them collateral. They are not part 

of the direct review process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if this was -- if this 

motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen, 

before the judgment is final, then there would be no 

tolling?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WEISMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'll begin -- if I could just clarify 

regarding the scope of Rule 35. The reporter's notes to 

Rule 35 do make it very clear that an illegal sentence 

is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction 

but is not authorized under law. It includes, e.g., a 

sentence in excess of that provided by statute, 

imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a 

judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence. 

And our supreme court has gone on to explain this 

provision by saying: We have never -- we have never 

countenanced a challenge to the constitutionality of a 

penal statute in the context of a Rule 35 motion, nor 

have we declared that a sentence imposed pursuant to an 

unconstitutional statute is illegal as contemplated by 

Rule 35.

 MR. WEISMAN: Although there is dicta and 

some language where our supreme court says essentially 

file challenges to your sentences pursuant to Rule 35, 

it is clear that only certain types of challenges can be 

brought in a Rule 35 motion. In the run of the mill 

cases, they have to be brought if there is an appellate 

record in direct appeal, or most commonly they're 

brought pursuant to the State's postconviction relief.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So now we 

get to the point where some can go under 35(a) but some 

can't.

 MR. WEISMAN: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they should go on 

direct appeal, correct?

 MR. WEISMAN: The only ones that are correct 

under 35(a) are, again, where the sentence is not 

authorized by law or has imposed an unauthorized form of 

punishment or a judgment that -­

 MR. WEISMAN: Correct. Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So now it's illegal.

 MR. WEISMAN: Correct, but -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And the odd thing is that 

-- that kind of appeal takes place either days or 

possibly weeks after the defendant may already have 

appealed his conviction to the higher court.

 MR. WEISMAN: Well -- correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?

 MR. WEISMAN: That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That normally happens?

 MR. WEISMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And what I'm curious about 

is what happens if the court affirms that sentence, 

let's say 2 months after it already affirmed the 

conviction?

 MR. WEISMAN: Right. And our -­

pursuant to which -- which is the judgment that became 

final by conclusion of direct review?

that's not part of the direct review appellate process.

JUSTICE BREYER: The person is not being 

held in custody pursuant to a judgment of the State 

court, or at least a relevant judgment, until the 

sentence has been appealed. Then there's the conclusion 

of direct review in respect to the judgment in respect 

to which he is being held in custody. I'm just reading 

the statute -­

MR. WEISMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the Federal statute.

 MR. WEISMAN: But, Your Honor, that could 

occur at any time. That can occur 5 or 10 years or 

20 years later.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly.

 MR. WEISMAN: And we're not -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And that's why I don't -­

that's why I am confused. I look at the language of the 

Federal statute and it seems to me that this individual 

is not being held in custody pursuant to a judgment 

until that sentence is final.

 MR. WEISMAN: But we would suggest -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And the sentence is final 

in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is 

final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to 

that sentence, which hasn't even taken place yet.

Your Honor, that it doesn't move the start of the 1-year 

limitations period. The start of the 1-year limitations 

period, as this Court said in Jiminez v. Quarterman, 

begins when it begins. It begins when that judgment 

becomes final, which is 90 days after our supreme court 

affirms the judgment of conviction. It's final.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you're going to 

say -­

MR. WEISMAN: It doesn't -­

JUSTICE BREYER: -- all appeals in Rhode 

Island from sentences -- all appeals on their lawfulness 

or their mercy take place under Rule 35, and all of them 

are collateral.

 MR. WEISMAN: No. What we -- respectfully, 

what we're going to say is collateral review refers to 

those, as this Court said in Duncan v. Walker, habeas 

postconviction relief vehicles that -- that occur after 

the conviction has become final.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm totally confused. 

If this is part of the criminal proceeding, which is 

your position, that it's not collateral, but it's part 

of the proceedings, when does this proceeding become 

final?

 MR. WEISMAN: It becomes final -­

because -- you're -- you're -­

MR. WEISMAN: Well, under Jiminez v. Walker, 

it becomes final when -- 90 days from when the supreme 

court affirms the conviction.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if the Rhode Island 

court has told litigants that they can't challenge some 

portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule 

35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of 

the conviction a final determination of the legality of 

the sentence? That's contradictory.

 MR. WEISMAN: Because Congress has decided 

to pick the day on which the appeal becomes -- the 

conviction becomes final, which always occurs 90 days 

after the State's high court -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's not -­

that's not what the -- what it says. It talks about a 

judgment. And a judgment in -- in other terms is 

usually the conviction and the sentence. Rhode Island 

for its own reasons has separated the two, but -­

MR. WEISMAN: Yes, but Congress has set four 

dates on which the conviction becomes final.
