 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-295, Travelers 

Indemnity Company v. Bailey, and Common Law Settlement 

Counsel v. Bailey.

 Mr. Ostrager.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OSTRAGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In 1988, the Second Circuit decided in two 

separate decisions that a bankruptcy court exercising 

its core jurisdiction had properly confirmed the plan of 

reorganization that resolved present and future claims 

against Johns-Manville and the insurers who funded 

Manville's reorganization plan. Last year, despite its 

decades-old rulings to the contrary, the Second Circuit 

sustained a collateral attack on the confirmation order 

and held that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter 

jurisdiction back in 1986 to enjoin direct actions 

against Travelers, quote, "based upon, arising out of, 

or related to," close quote --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ostrager, you have 

characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the

Second Circuit did not. The Second Circuit said: The 

confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order 

did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that 

order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the 

insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability. The 

Second Circuit said: Now, this 2004 order, which 

concerns independent actions against insurers for their 

own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they 

affirmed. So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a 

collateral attack on the 1986 order.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Ginsburg, the 

bankruptcy court judge, interpreting his own order, 

explicitly held that the 1986 order was intended and was 

always intended to enjoin direct actions against 

Travelers based upon, arising out of, or relating to the 

insurance policies Manville purchased from Travelers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At the time of the 1986 

order, had these independent actions started? I thought 

at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits 

involving Manville's liability and the insurers' 

derivative obligation to cover.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Ginsburg, at the time 

of the 1986 order there had been various forms of direct 

action filed against Manville, and the bankruptcy court 

concluded, and the Second Circuit recognized, that a

settlement with the insurers was essential for the 

reorganization and rehabilitation of Manville --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The insurers, to the 

extent of the insurance proceeds. That's what created 

the pot that made the settlement fund. But what I'm 

trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only 

information we have is that Manville -- there was the 

conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief. This 

question came up, well, what about actions against the 

insurers for their own wrongs? And the answer was, oh, 

those aren't covered.

 MR. OSTRAGER: The plan of reorganization as 

ultimately confirmed contained the language to which I 

directed the Court. It -- a plan of confirmation 

included all aspects of the resolution of the Manville 

estate. The confirmation order was all about ensuring 

fairness to all claimants. It was all about expanding 

the value of the estate, and it was all about 

rehabilitating the debtor for the benefit of its 

employees, suppliers, and local claimants.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Ostrager, is --

help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I 

don't have the record in front of me now. But didn't 

the 1986 order expressly include permission for certain 

actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those

that had already been filed?

 MR. OSTRAGER: It did. It did, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I drew the implication from 

that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its 

order would be barring such actions if they had not 

already been filed. Am I right on the -- on the -- at 

least on the record point?

 MR. OSTRAGER: You are right on the record 

point. However, Judge Lifland in the hearings that were 

associated with his clarifying order was very explicit 

that he use the words "based upon, arising out of, or 

related to" for the express purpose of granting 

Travelers the broadest relief that could be afforded to 

Travelers post-confirmation. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But he was saying that --

in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than 

he had done the first time around and what he intended 

the first time around.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Well, he certainly intended 

to make the cornerstone of the Manville reorganization 

work. And as the Second Circuit itself held, in a 

subsequent collateral attack, the O'Malley case --

reported at 100 F.3d 944, a 1996 case where there was a 

challenge to the bankruptcy court's reaffirmation and 

continuation of the '86 order, Second Circuit held in

1996 that such an injunction is essential to the success 

of the settlement, and its continuation was well within 

the discretion of the trial court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Was the Second Circuit's 

decision based on an interpretation of the confirmation 

order or was it based on subject matter jurisdiction?

 MR. OSTRAGER: The Second Circuit order was 

explicitly predicated on the theory that the bankruptcy 

court lacked subject matter jurisdiction back in 1986 to 

enjoin these direct actions.

 Now, we submit that the Second Circuit 

clearly erred, because it conflated the entirely 

distinct concept of the court's subject matter 

jurisdiction and the propriety of the court's exercise 

of subject matter jurisdiction. This was a distinction 

that this Court expressly recognized 75 years ago in the 

Continental Illinois v. Rock Island Railroad.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there is a 

distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action 

taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute. 

But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap. 

I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it 

is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy 

clause and there is jurisdiction. But what if the 

bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy

decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a 

certain amount of money and it's conceded that this 

company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court 

says, this is a national problem and this other company 

ought to contribute.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that would be 

within the bankruptcy power?

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Scalia, clearly the 

Congress in fashioning over the years expansive 

safeguards facilitating growth and change in the 

bankruptcy law as our nation's commerce has grown has 

done that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They can do anything under 

the bankruptcy law?

 MR. OSTRAGER: No. Subject to appropriate 

safeguards. Now, in order to confirm a plan of 

reorganization a -- a debtor must meet all 16 

requirements of section 1129.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, that's fine. I'm not 

arguing about that. I'm arguing about the principle 

that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this 

challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction. 

Surely there are some things that simply do not fall 

within the bankruptcy power. Isn't that true?

MR. OSTRAGER: I would agree that that is 

so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And that --

MR. OSTRAGER: This is not our case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what you are saying 

is this does fall within the bankruptcy power. But 

don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the 

jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the 

statute. It could be based upon both.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Scalia, I would say 

that the bankruptcy court in this case unquestionably 

had jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization under 

28 U.S.C. 1334(b) as the Manville reorganization was a 

civil proceeding arising under Title 11 of the 

Bankruptcy Code.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit's view 

was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no 

subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's 

liability is not in question. The Second Circuit 

thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is 

between two- the question is between two nondebtors, 

Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other, 

Manville is not in the picture. That's what the Second 

Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the 

bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be

right. But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy 

court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors' 

liability to the claimants.

 MR. OSTRAGER: There were, Justice Ginsburg, 

60 pages of findings of fact indicating that the direct 

action suits against Manville was an end run around the 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The direct actions 

against Travelers.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Against Travelers, were an 

end run around the discharge of Manville, and that all 

of the claims against Travelers arose out of and flowed 

to the insurance relationship.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Ostrager, may I ask 

this question. I -- I was unable to find the complaints 

in the voluminous filings here. Do any of the 

plaintiffs' cases seek recovery from assets of the 

estate that would reduce the payments to creditors of 

Manville?

 MR. OSTRAGER: Well, the reason that this is 

so critical is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you answer my 

question?

 MR. OSTRAGER: They do not seek assets of 

the estate, although Travelers would potentially have

contribution claims against Manville because all of the 

claims --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why does the 

bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party 

actions against some creditor of the estate?

 MR. OSTRAGER: The Respondents actually 

concede that bankruptcy courts have subject matter 

jurisdiction to enjoin actions against non-debtors in 

appropriate circumstances. That's the Chubb brief at 

pages 22 and 40.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if those actions won't 

affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort 

of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the 

theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either. I don't 

understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to 

collect from Travelers for what they did. The fact that 

they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an 

insurance company. This is mysterious case to me.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Justice Stevens , you are 

absolutely right that these direct action cases have 

never been sustained because they all relate to the 

discharge by Travelers of Travelers' obligations as 

Manville's insurer, and that's one of the reasons why 

the bankruptcy court judge issued the injunction.

 Now, the Second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: These were cases in the 

State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of 

them have succeeded.

 MR. OSTRAGER: That is correct.

 The Second Circuit also completely ignored 

the enactment by Congress of sections 524(g) and (h) of 

the Bankruptcy Code, which are modelled on the Manville 

reorganization, and expressly grandfather the Manville 

injunction as a final order that could not be revoked.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could you say they 

ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524, 

and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called 

direct actions, which really aren't what we generally 

call direct actions. But the Second Circuit did address 

what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville 

device.

 MR. OSTRAGER: I would respectfully 

disagree. 524(g) specifically says that asbestos --

asbestos channeling injunction "shall be valid and 

enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any 

court except through direct appeal." And 524(h)(i) 

specifically says that the pre-1994 asbestos channeling 

injunctions shall be considered to meet all of the 

requirements of 524(g)(2), which is in our appendix at 

page 471, which means that they automatically meet

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How do -- how do these 

pending actions have any impact on fulfilling the 

objections -- objectives of the channeling instruction 

or affect the disposition of the assets in the estate? 

I just don't understand it.

 MR. OSTRAGER: The essential issue here, 

Justice Stevens, is that there would have been no 

Manville reorganization --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there has been 

one and it's been a success.

 MR. OSTRAGER: It's been a remarkable 

success. Asbestos claimants have received -- 660,000 

asbestos claimants have received --

JUSTICE STEVENS: None of whom would be 

affected --

MR. OSTRAGER: -- more than $2.8 billion.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But none of whom would be 

affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it. 

I'm missing something very important, I think.

 MR. OSTRAGER: The point is that there 

couldn't have been have a Manville reorganization 

without the insurance settlements. The Second Circuit 

recognized that. The Second Circuit further recognized

that these direct actions violate the express terms of 

the injunction that Judge Lifland, the bankruptcy judge, 

granted in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it harmless 

error?

 MR. OSTRAGER: The 524(g)(4)(A)(2)(iii) 

specifically authorizes asbestos channeling injunctions 

that bar any claim against the third party to be 

directly or indirectly liable for claims against the 

debtor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if part of the 

settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get 

more out of this before we're going to put in all the 

policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are 

going to be immune from any traffic accident liability; 

and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said: 

Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay. Is 

that all right? It's within the jurisdiction as you 

read it because it involves Travelers it's related to 

the funds they submitted into the trust account. Is 

that --

MR. OSTRAGER: Mr. Chief justice, that would 

not be covered and that is certainly not what the 

bankruptcy court intended or said.

didn't intend anything with respect to traffic 

accidents. But my question is how far does your theory 

reach?

 MR. OSTRAGER: This Court has recognized in 

the Katz case that bankruptcy extends beyond the res.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there would be 

jurisdiction in the hypothetical that I posed?

 MR. OSTRAGER: Not in the hypothetical you 

posed. On direct appeal that would clearly be excluded 

because it wouldn't meet --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, on direct 

appeal. Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that 

Travelers would have protection under a collateral 

attack?

 MR. OSTRAGER: I don't think we need to 

reach that issue in this case. There is no question 

that in connection with exercising its subject matter 

jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization the 

bankruptcy court had the power under section 105 of the 

Bankruptcy Code to issue any order, process or judgment 

necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of 

Title 11.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it seems to me 

you --

that's not true. You acknowledge that they couldn't 

have issued the hypothetical order that the Chief 

Justice proposed, even if that was necessary, even if 

Travelers said, we will not kick in the money up to the 

limits of our liability unless you make us immune from 

all traffic accidents. You acknowledged that that's no 

good, right?

 MR. OSTRAGER: In this order the -- the 

limitation on the injunction was based upon arising out 

of or related to. I would submit that the traffic 

accident falls outside the scope of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? It --

it involves one -- it involves the insurance company, 

its coverage of Johns-Manville. And the Travelers is 

saying: Look, we are not going to do it unless you give 

us this -- this broader immunity, and the bankruptcy 

judge does it. I don't know why it would be outside the 

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. It is clearly 

related to allowing the settlement to go forward.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Well, I -- I think we have an 

act of Congress, 524(g) and (h), which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I interrupt you 

there? Because you told me that the Second Circuit 

ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the

524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages. 

I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.

 MR. OSTRAGER: With -- with respect, I 

believe that there are express findings of fact that the 

bankruptcy court made which were adopted by the district 

court, which were embraced in full by the Second 

Circuit, and we have a -- a pure issue of law here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And may I -- may I have 

an answer to my question about the Second Circuit 

ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages 

to it?

 MR. OSTRAGER: I believe that they clearly 

misinterpreted the intent of 524(g) and (h). They 

clearly misperceived the fact that Congress had 

expressly grandfathered the Manville injunction in 

524(g).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another mystery in this 

most mysterious case: If it was so clear that the 

original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that 

it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period, 

then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it 

had put up originally, in order to settle with people 

who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?

much broader than the injunction that was contained. 

Travelers would in connection with the mediation process 

participate in a settlement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the difference 

between the release that you say flowed from the 1986 

order and the releases that were obtained with the 

$400 million?

 MR. OSTRAGER: One was a general -- one was 

a general release and the other was a release based 

upon, arising out of, or related to the Manville 

insurance policies that Travelers purchased --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, specifically what was 

not included in the 1986 release that was included as a 

result of the settlement negotiations?

 MR. OSTRAGER: It -- an absolute, broad 

general release by 80,000 people. Now, I want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I would like to know 

the difference. What would -- what would Travelers be 

liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that 

they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?

 MR. OSTRAGER: Potentially -- potentially 

the traffic accident that Mr. Chief Justice referenced.

I want to reserve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then -- so that the 

2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic 

accidents?

 MR. OSTRAGER: It's a general release.

 I -- I want to conclude and reserve the 

balance of my time by noting that "Redefining the scope 

of a long-final confirmation order unravels intricate 

transactions so as to knock the props out from under the 

authorization for every transaction that has taken 

place." That's a quote from the Second Circuit's 

decision in Chateaugay Corp., 10 F.3d 944. And that 

creates an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for 

courts and litigants alike.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I have one question 

before you reserve the rest of your time. That is, you 

said this is -- this is a sweeping release that 

Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many 

parties. But some people were not there and those are 

the people who still want to bring their claims.

 MR. OSTRAGER: I would say that the --

question.

-- what notice did the people who were left out of the 

settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who 

say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they 

have and what opportunity to be heard?

 MR. OSTRAGER: There was broad notice to the 

people who would be affected by the issuance of the 

injunction. This Court has recognized --

JUSTICE SOUTER: How did they get the 

notice? You say it's broad notice. What exactly was 

done?

 MR. OSTRAGER: There were newspaper blasts 

repeatedly, all sorts of public notice, radio 

announcements. But we are dealing with a special 

remedial scheme that expressly forecloses successive 

litigation by non-litigants and in the bankruptcy 

context --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can it be successive 

when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these 

people haven't had a day in court. They may have a 

claim that's no good. All State courts so far have said 

their claim is no good. But they have a right --

MR. OSTRAGER: This is what Congress has 

made provision for in 524(g) and (h). This is what I 

believe the Court contemplated in Ortiz at page 846, 

also in Martin v. Wilks, also in Taylor v. Stargell.

And I think this rule was foreshadowed as long ago as 

Mullaney v. Central Hanover Trust Company.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The rule -- the 

particular rule that I am asking you about is that 

people who have not had their day in court can be 

precluded --

MR. OSTRAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the basis of 

newspaper notice and radio announcements?

 MR. OSTRAGER: As the court said in 

Mullaney, beneficiaries whose interests are either 

conjectural or future, although they could be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the best 

possible notice, which included regular mail notice.

 MR. OSTRAGER: Not -- not with respect to 

future claimants who haven't had any disease. There has 

to be finality. That's what 524(g) and (h) says. A 

confirmation order has to be final. As the Court said 

in Stohl, there has to be a beginning of litigation and 

a place to end litigation.

 I would like to reserve, if I may, with 

respect, the balance of my time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 CASCINO ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 As the Court has indicated, this is a 

question of jurisdiction, and the issue is whether a 

bankruptcy court may enter an order that goes to a 

nondebtor, offers a release against independent State 

law claims.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to the 1986 order 

it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner 

might have answered the question posed by the Chief 

Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical: That is 

an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction, 

and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe 

there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is 

final. Now, that brings us to the -- the later order, 

2004, 2006. And then the question is whether or not 

that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a 

further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached.

 Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have 

given that answer?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, the counsel for 

Petitioner can't give that answer for two separate 

reasons. The first has to do with the subject matter

jurisdiction limitation of a bankruptcy court: That as 

soon as the release is outside the debtor's estate and 

impact on the debtor's estate or the debtor/creditor 

relationship, that places it beyond the power of the 

bankruptcy court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, putting aside 

questions of notice, if these parties had been 

represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the 

subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it 

was incorrect; but it's done.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: If -- if these parties had 

been present, if they had been appealed, if this had 

been in effect a settlement orchestrated through the 

bankruptcy court, then there might be the -- the ability 

to liquidate the class action.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then it's just a 

question of personal jurisdiction and notice. It is not 

a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because 

subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an 

earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if 

you've been a party.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Justice Kennedy, it is a 

question of subject matter jurisdiction if it is not to 

be a consensual agreement. If there is not to be -- the 

purpose of notice is to give you the opportunity to opt

out and to object --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think there's a 

notice question. I thought there were 5,538 plaintiffs 

here and -- that you represent, and every one of them 

has already gotten money from the trust except for two 

who have filed claims against it. So I imagine if 

that's so, they certainly know about it.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: They do know about it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so there is no notice 

problem. If there were a notice problem I guess there 

would be a due process problem. So, I don't see what 

notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA 

tournament.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Justice Breyer, I 

misunderstood Justice's Kennedy's question to be about 

1986, not about the present. And in 1980 -- in the 

original confirmation, these people had not filed suit, 

had not made claims at the time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in the original 

confirmation there are problems in asbestos cases, like 

other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice. 

Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't 

there. And I don't know that -- maybe there is a 

constitutional problem with some of them, but I would 

have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.

MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, the question is --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- is this about 

notice?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: No, I don't believe it is 

about notice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think so. I 

thought this was about the case of the meaning of the 

words in the statute that they have authority in the 

bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment 

that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the 

provisions of the title. And we've said that the test 

is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the 

other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any 

effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy. 

So, as I understood it, that's the test.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I agree.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what -- that's what 

this Court said. Now, they may be few and far between, 

an order like this, but where there are special reasons 

for it -- suppose it's a pension fund and you want to 

reorganize the company and this is the employees' --

they're -- the employees' pension fund's worried about 

claims which are related directly. Or suppose it's an 

officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the 

company you must cut the claims off. And otherwise, it

is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the 

fund, no more jobs for the employees.

 Now, what is it here that would say there is 

no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can 

ever do it, no matter what?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: In -- in your example, 

Justice Breyer, you rely upon this Court's decision in 

Celotex, which adopted the Pacor test from the Third 

Circuit. And in each case that has applied that, the 

question is whether there is a potential impact upon the 

estate of the bankrupt. The critical issue in this case 

is that not a single one of the claims that is presented 

ir seeks to be enjoined here has any potential impact on 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is what you are saying also 

true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I 

think, done this?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: There is no asbestos case 

that I am aware of that has released third party claims 

that have no impact on the debtor. I am not aware of a 

single one.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, this has 

enormous practical impact on the debtor. If not him --

not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you 

will never get insurance companies --

MR. ISSACHAROFF: No, I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- to go into this kind of 

thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of 

helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases. And so, I 

can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind 

going into that when in fact all these suits are still 

open. That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut 

it off.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I think that the facts of 

record indicate that Travelers went into this particular 

deal full well knowing that it was not getting this kind 

of release because that kind of release was not 

available. And I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you 

make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect 

that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a 

moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of 

the -- of the insurance company were not cut off? The 

reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any 

future claims based upon insurance company misconduct 

would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order.

 What -- what do you say about that 

implication?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Justice Souter, I would 

say two things. First of all, that the record speaks to

specific negotiations between Travelers and Manville and 

between all the insurers and Manville on prospective 

liabilities of the -- of the insurance companies, so 

that the bankruptcy court can be read to be just 

cleaning up what had happened retrospectively up until 

that point.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it was prospective 

liability based upon misconduct of the insurance 

company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance 

contract in -- in the conventional sense.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I -- I understand that. 

But it's also important -- I think that there was a 

question raised by Justice Alito a minute ago about what 

exactly had happened in 1986 and whether the Second 

Circuit was making findings of fact or findings of law.

 In 1988, in the MacArthur case, the Second 

Circuit relied on section 1334(d) as the jurisdictional 

basis for upholding the district -- the bankruptcy 

order. Section 1334(d), which is now recodified as 

1334(e), has to do only with the disposition of the 

assets of the estate, the property of the estate.

 And so, the Second Circuit order in 19 -- in 

1988, which is the controlling legal authority on what 

the scope of the release was, went only to the property 

of the estate. And so, I don't think that there was any

understanding at the time by anyone that there was a 

release of claims that were independent of the property 

of the estate or made -- or had no hold upon or 

potential impact upon the property of the estate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why does it say -- it 

doesn't say that. What it says in the release is it 

says: We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from 

bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and 

a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising 

out of, or relating to any insurance policy.

 And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands 

of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate 

to the relevant insurance policies. Indeed, the claims 

are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers 

to defend those very policies, given the obligation to 

defend Johns-Manville.

 So the relation is exceedingly close, and 

the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages 

of findings, I guess, that show that.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, Your Honor, some of 

the releases that are in effect in this case go to 

conduct that occurred after 1986. Some of them have to 

do with claims. For example, the Wise claim which is 

referred to in the Second Circuit's opinion has to do 

with claims that have nothing to do with the coverage of

Manville. They have to do with actions taken with 

regard to other insurers. This is an exceedingly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Settlement clauses often 

release future claims; standard stuff in a release 

clause.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

Contract clauses do it and class actions do it, 

consensual agreements, when there is notice, the 

opportunity to opt out, and there is volition; they 

often release much broader. But a bankruptcy court is 

an extraordinary proceeding. A bankruptcy court is an 

obligation that rights are terminated without any 

consensual --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is subject matter 

jurisdiction and that is foreclosed. Now, if you are 

talking about personal jurisdiction that may be 

something else.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: No, I'm not talking --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're talking about 

subject matter jurisdiction and that has been foreclosed 

by the earlier Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion. And 

the court of appeals' opinion that we are reviewing now 

seems to conflate that issue.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. I think that in the 1988 opinion in the

MacArthur case, the Second Circuit was quite clear that 

all that was being released was claims against insurance 

proceeds that had been delivered and had become property 

of the estate, whose depletion could affect the estate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. If that is -- if 

that is the case -- let's assume that that is -- that it 

was that narrow. The fact remains, however, that at 

this point, as Justice Kennedy has suggested several 

times, my understanding is at least that you cannot 

collaterally attack the jurisdiction of the court who 

entered the order it did. And the only claim that you 

can make now is that the order by its terms did not 

cover your cases.

 Do you agree?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I agree that that is the 

general rule, that is correct. I agree further that the 

Second Circuit expressly held at page 31a that the error 

of the bankruptcy court was that it subsequently 

interpreted the order more broadly than the Second 

Circuit had affirmed in 1988. I think that that's the 

heart of the case, because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a question of the 

scope of the order?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Yes, it is.

MR. ISSACHAROFF: Yes, it is. There is a 

question which this Court has actually not addressed, 

which is about the prospective application of an order 

that is entered without subject matter jurisdiction. I 

don't think there is any case squarely on point.

 Certainly there are cases that allow 

prospective collateral challenges to an order entered 

without personal jurisdiction. I don't think the Court 

has addressed the subject matter jurisdiction, but it 

doesn't have to --

JUSTICE ALITO: But didn't this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I didn't mean to cut you 

off. I'm sorry.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I don't think the Court 

has to address this here, Your Honor, because in this 

case, the initial order only went -- as affirmed by the 

Second Circuit, only went to the property of the estate. 

And second --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I then raise a question 

there? I mean, I think there is a legitimate question 

about that, given the -- given the rather general terms 

of the -- of the scope of the order. And I would like 

your response to this. It seems to me as a background 

consideration that we should have in mind in 

interpreting how broad that order was. It's been raised

a couple times; Justice Breyer raised it a moment ago. 

And it's this: It is one argument to say that the 

bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction, and 

derivatively an order that it issued should not be 

interpreted to cover, any claim that does not affect or 

cannot deplete the bankruptcy estate taken as a given 

fact at the time this later case is brought.

 Another view of jurisdiction would be that 

the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order 

might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if 

contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that 

created the bankruptcy estate. If Travelers had thought 

that it was going to be liable for these cases of 

insurer misconduct, it might very well have said: We're 

not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving 

this exposure open. So that the bankruptcy estate would 

never have attained the size that it attained if the --

if the insurer and everybody else had not understood 

that these later claims would be -- were being cut off.

 Is that argument a relevant -- number one, 

is that a legitimate jurisdictional argument? And 

number two, is it a relevant argument that we should 

bear in mind -- in trying to figure out how broad the 

'86 order really was?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Your Honor, you gave two

alternative definitions of jurisdiction. The first one 

we have no problem with. Obviously that's our 

argument --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Everybody accepts at that 

much.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Right. The second one, I 

think that this Court has to go back to the Syngenta 

case, which I think is quite instructive on this point. 

In Syngenta there was a settlement in a Federal court 

action. There is no question that the parties settled, 

that the monies were paid, everything was done pursuant 

to that settlement. Then one of the parties goes into 

State court and files a claim that was clearly subsumed 

within the settlement.

 The district court tried to issue an order, 

saying: I have to have power over this, because 

otherwise there could never have been a settlement. And 

this Court unanimously reversed on the grounds that that 

had to be brought through the State court system, 

because you could not get jurisdiction simply because of 

the expediency, the necessity, any of these terms do not 

afford an affirmative grant of jurisdiction to the 

Court. So I think --

question practically, the insurers would not have

settled, there would have been no 1986 order, if they 

didn't have this broader liability? They say without 

global protections they never would have contributed to 

the trust fund. And I would like you to answer that 

question.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: We don't know that, Your 

Honor. We know that the record indicates that they did 

not believe in 1985, when they signed a letter among all 

the counsel that was submitted to the court, that they 

were getting any such release. So there's nothing in 

the record that indicates that they would not have gone 

into this deal, and in fact, there have been many, many 

asbestos workouts since that time, none of which have 

releases that do not affect the debtor's estate.

 So I don't know that the factual premise is 

there. But let's assume that it was, for the purposes 

of the question. Let's assume that no insurance company 

would go -- go into this, unless they get releases that 

go far beyond normal jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court. 

I think that under Syngenta that has to be given to them 

by Congress. Congress in 1334 gave specific forms of 

jurisdiction. It gave the "arising under" and "arising 

in" which pertained to the activities of the bankrupt, 

of the debtor; and it gave "related to" and "related 

to," as this Court interpreted in Celotex, adopting the

Third Circuit standard, "related to" means that it has 

an impact upon the estate of the debtor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that what the Congress 

gave them in the 1994 Bankruptcy Act?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: No. The Bankruptcy Act 

actually has very interesting language on point. The 

Bankruptcy Act says, in 524(g)(4)(ii), says that the 

relief is for demands on the debtor, that flow from 

demands on the debtor, and by reason of the demands on 

the debtor. That is the trigger language before we get 

to Roman numeral (iii), which has to do with insurance.

 So if one actually looks at the statute, the 

form of the statute is that there is releases to the 

extent that there is a claim of derivative liability.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you dispute the 

proposition that that statute was passed in large part 

for the purpose of codifying what was done in this case?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I do not --

JUSTICE ALITO: The sort of thing that was 

done in this case?

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: I do not dispute that at 

all. But what was done in this case was not simply what 

Judge Lifland did, but what Judge Lifland did as 

affirmed by the Second Circuit. The bankruptcy court 

does not have stand-alone powers to make determinations

as pertain to, particularly, common law actions. That 

goes back to the Marathon Pipeline issue that this Court 

had to -- had to address and that Congress sought to fix 

by maintaining a tight hold on the "relating to" 

jurisdiction of the Court and making sure that that's 

reviewable by the district court and by the court of 

appeals. So the -- yes, Congress codified the -- the 

Manville deal in -- in 1994, but they did so as it was 

interpreted by the controlling courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In your view, if Smith has 

a 2 or $4 billion claim against company X and the 

pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and 

so the judge says: "I want to enjoin this claim, we 

will settle it," you know, but the pension fund --

doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact 

without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize, 

wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off 

the claim against the pension fund?

 It's a question of whether the company goes 

down the drain or whether it doesn't. And --

MR. ISSACHAROFF: The rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the pension fund is all 

mixed up in this together.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: The rule of thumb, Justice 

Breyer, is that if there is an automatic indemnity

JUSTICE BREYER: No, there is nothing here

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Then our position is that 

it does not have authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that would be true of 

all the workforce and they have claims against the 

individual members of the workforce? They have -- it 

seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with 

you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what is 

bothering me.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, I think that it 

comes down to two questions, Justice Breyer. One is 

whether the constitutional authority under Article I 

reaches beyond --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not -- because 

there is a good constitutional protection; it's called 

the due process clause. If the bankruptcy judge goes 

too far, it's a due process violation.

 MR. ISSACHAROFF: No, I don't -- I -- I 

disagree with that, Justice Breyer. I think that the 

bankruptcy court has to point to statutory authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's language, 

broad language.

Yes, there is broad language in the statute. The 

"relating to" language is quite broad. But the 

"relating to" language has been interpreted, and every 

court that has looked at it, this Court and -- this 

Court and every court of appeals, without any dissent in 

any court of appeals that has looked at this issue --

has decided that "relating to" means an impact on the 

estate. Without that, the bankruptcy power has no

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB C. COHN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 CHUBB INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY

 MR. COHN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A discharge in bankruptcy wipes away a 

debtor's liability for its prepetition conduct. Yet 

Travelers' interpretation of the 1986 orders gives 

Travelers broader protection than even Manville could 

obtain because it gives Travelers immunity for its 

knowledge. Bankruptcy discharges do not erase a 

debtor's knowledge.

If Manville started making asbestos products 

again after its discharge, it would not be immune for 

claims that it acted with the knowledge that asbestos is 

dangerous. Yet, that is precisely the protection that 

Travelers argues that it is entitled to here.

 And to take, for example, the Wise 

complaint -- which The Travelers, Petitioners, put forth 

as a typical claim here -- and you look at the class 

they purport to represent, they purport to represent a 

class of disappointed claimants against three companies, 

Combustion Engineering, AC&S, and A&I, none of which are 

Manville. They claim that they are not seeking even to 

recover for asbestos bodily injury claims. Instead, 

they claim that they settled their claims too cheaply 

with Combustion Engineering because, for example, in the 

1990s allegedly, decades, 15 years after the 

confirmation and discharge of Manville, Travelers in 

defending Combustion Engineering, with the knowledge 

that asbestos is dangerous or whatever from working with 

Manville, provided false interrogatory responses on 

behalf of Combustion Engineering. That is how far 

afield the proffered interpretation of the 1986 order 

goes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it not the case that most 

of the claims are claims based on -- based on Manville?

MR. COHN: Are they claims --

JUSTICE ALITO: Relating to what Travelers 

did in relation to Manville, rather than other 

companies.

 MR. COHN: I don't think it's related to 

what they did. I think the distinction here is relating 

to what they know. The point is --

JUSTICE ALITO: You're -- you're making the 

argument that some of these claims concern things that 

Travelers did in relation to the defense of other 

asbestos manufacturers. Now, maybe that means that the 

-- the bankruptcy court interpreted the order too 

broadly or -- in that respect. But what does that have 

to do with the main issue here?

 MR. COHN: If an asbestos claimant, an 

independent action plaintiff, is seeking to recover from 

Travelers for Manville-derived liability, it's barred. 

That was the purpose of the remand by the Second Circuit 

having provided the appropriate measuring stick to the 

bankruptcy court to go look at these complaints and 

figure out whether or not in fact somebody's trying to 

take money out of Travelers' pocket for Manville's 

liabilities.

make sure I understand it, the Wise complaints are the

-- are the exception. They are the only complaints, as 

I understand it in this current round of litigation, 

that claims that the actual harm to them resulted from 

actions other than actions of Manville. Is that 

correct?

 MR. COHN: The statutory -- not exactly. 

The statutory direct actions, which account for 400 

million of the half billion dollars they'd like to pay 

to these alleged contemnors, all have to do with claims-

handling practices of Travelers with respect to other 

insureds besides Manville.

 The Common Law independent actions allege 

that the insurance industry as a whole learned of the 

dangers of asbestos. It has a free-standing duty to the 

world to warn the world of the dangers of asbestos. 

Chubb Indemnity Insurance Company was not a Manville 

insurer, yet Chubb is alleged to have been in cahoots 

with the rest of the industry in failing to warn the 

world, and, therefore, they along with the rest of the 

insurance industry face unlimited liability unrelated to 

insurance policies for this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I understand -- or 

maybe I don't -- maybe I don't understand the -- every 

step in the liability claim. My only question was, 

among the plaintiffs, is it correct that the only

plaintiffs who claim they were hurt physically by 

asbestos as a result of the actions of somebody, the 

only ones who are claiming that the somebody was other 

than Manville are the Wise plaintiffs. Is that correct?

 MR. COHN: I think not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No?

 MR. COHN: I think that every asbestos 

claimant by and large has a claim against Manville, but 

that doesn't mean they are not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Simply because of 

Manville's position in the --

MR. COHN: The ubiquity of Manville asbestos 

and their activities makes practically everybody, if not 

everybody, a Manville claimant, at least --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that you are 

saying in effect everybody ultimately is claiming 

against Manville, the Wise plaintiffs and every other 

set of plaintiffs in this -- in this group of direct 

liability claimants, right?

 MR. COHN: Well, is or can. But that 

doesn't mean that they are attempting to assert 

liability against an insurance company because of 

Manville's own conduct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I understand your 

cause of action. Okay. I don't want to --

MR. COHN: So, getting back to the next 

point I would like to make is, as Mr. Issacharoff has 

stated, the Second Circuit was presented and the 

bankruptcy court was presented in 1986 with a plan and 

with an order that was stated to be premised upon the 

derivative liability of Travelers for Manville.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Who stated it? Who stated 

that? I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at 

the time. I've read language of the order, and I 

haven't found there anything that said that. What it 

talked about was policies that were seriously 

intertwined with the liability of Manville.

 MR. COHN: Well, the insurance settlement 

order, which is what is at issue here -- which is not 

the channeling injunction order, by the way; it was 

entered before that -- was premised upon the policies 

being property of the estate. That was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is this the confirmation 

order?

 MR. COHN: The confirmation order is 

actually not directly at issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's different. Okay. 

So the confirmation order --

MR. COHN: The confirmation order is 

purposely --

JUSTICE BREYER: But there's another piece 

of paper called "the insurance settlement order," which 

says that the confirmation order and all these other 

definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative 

liability?

 MR. COHN: The --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes or no?

 MR. COHN: -- definition of -- yes --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes?

 MR. COHN: No. The definition of --

JUSTICE BREYER: No? Okay. All right.

 MR. COHN: -- of "policy claims" is

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then I don't see what 

has to do with it.

 MR. COHN: Well, the definition of "policy 

claims" is contained in the settlement order, which is 

December 18, 1986. It was a free-standing order that 

was entered --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's a 

different definition than the definition of "policy 

claims" in the injunction, presumably.

confirmation order, an injunction. It defines "policy 

claims" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of 

the insurance policies.

 MR. COHN: That is the injunction in the 

insurance injunction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And your other piece of 

paper says what?

 MR. COHN: The other piece of paper is even 

clearer. That's why they don't rely on it. It says, 

you may not seek to recover asbestos health obligations, 

which are the future Manville-derived asbestos claims 

from Travelers, from a settling insurance company. They 

don't even try to argue that the channeling injunction 

gets them there. They're arguing that the insurance 

policy buy-back order, if you want to call it that, the 

insurance settlement order pursuant to which they 

retired their insurance obligations was -- the 

definition of "policy claims" was --

JUSTICE BREYER: You go on. Don't worry. 

I'll look it up.

 MR. COHN: Thank you.

Process Clause fully protect you? If the bankruptcy

in particular cases if you can establish it, a due

 MR. COHN: Chubb, Mr. Chief justice, in fact 

has an alternative argument that was never reached that, 

as a non-Manville insurer, it was in a position of an 

unrepresented future claimant, and in fact it cannot be 

constitutionally bound by res judicata to the 1986 

order.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I saw in the -- I 

guess it was in the Travelers' reply brief, the 

suggestion that there was a future -- somebody 

representing future claimants.

 MR. COHN: Future tort claimants, not future 

insurance defendants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that?

 MR. COHN: Cause of action claimants.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that 

limitation spelled out?

that -- that appoints the future claims representative, 

it is to represent the interests of people who have been 

exposed to Manville asbestos but have not yet been --

future claimants or else their -- you know, their harm 

would have arisen well before and they wouldn't be in 

these cases in this decade.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, in the -- at the 

time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville, 

of course, for Manville's liability. These later suits 

in State court about the insurance company's independent 

obligation -- I asked this to counsel on the other side 

-- to what extent was there such litigation in 1986?

there may have been some direct actions. I'm just 

simply not familiar -- we didn't come into this case

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. OSTRAGER: Thank you. I have five quick 

points I want to make.

 First, the Second Circuit upheld the core 

factual findings that, quote, "the instant claims 

against Travelers arise out of its provision of 

insurance coverage to Manville," close quote. That's 

from the Second Circuit opinion. It's in the appendix 

at page 33.

 Second, there is no use of the word 

"derivative" in either the confirmation order, the 

settlement order, or 524(g). 524(g), about which we 

haven't spoken enough, clearly and unmistakably reflects 

Congress's intent to allow channeling injunctions that 

bar claims against a debtor and those, like insurers,

who are directly or indirectly liable for claims against 

the debtor. That is 524(g)(4)(A)(ii) and Roman (iii). 

524(g) expressly provides an asbestos channeling 

injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be 

revoked or modified by any court except for an appeal.

 We cite in our reply brief the fact that a 

Senate report accompanying an earlier version of the 

bill clarified that 524(g) is -- quote, "is not meant to 

give the bankruptcy courts authority which they do not 

already possess and simply codifies the court's ability 

to issue supplemental permanent injunctions which are 

irrevocable except on appeal."

 There is a final judgment in this case 

confirming the plan of reorganization. The Second 

Circuit issued that -- confirmed that judgment twice, 

once in the MacArthur case and once in the Cane case. 

And then in the O'Malley case, which is a 1996 case, the 

Second Circuit rejected a collateral attack on the 

confirmation order on two grounds.

 First, they found that the performance of 

the futures representative that Judge Lifland had 

appointed and which was incorporated in 524(g) and 

modelled on the Manville reorganization proceeding --

the Second Circuit found that the legal representative, 

quote, "took an active and aggressive role in protecting

future claimants in this litigation."

 And, secondly, the Second Circuit rejected 

the challenge to the continuation of the 1986 order 

enjoining the suits against insurers as being without 

merit because such an injunction was essential to the 

success of the settlement, and its continuation was well 

within the court's discretion.

 As respects Chubb, Judge Koetle in affirming 

Judge Liflin's 2004 order, specifically found that 

Chubb, a multinational insurer that has paid more than a 

billion dollars to resolve asbestos-related claims, was 

clearly on notice of these proceedings. We cite in our 

reply brief on pages 10 and 11 several 524(g) 

injunctions that have run to the benefit of Chubb which 

contain the exact same "based upon, arising out of, or 

related to" language that appears in the original 

Manville order.

 We didn't cite -- but it's a matter of 

public record -- that Chubb paid $550 million to resolve 

through a bankruptcy proceeding with Fibreboard 

liabilities relating to Fibreboard receiving the same 

"based upon, arising out of, or related to" protection.

 The Manville plan carries out the core 

values of bankruptcy. The Manville trust has made 

payments to 660,000 asbestos claimants -- that's at
