 (10:03 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs. 

Twombly. Mr. Kellogg.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. KELLOGG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 I think the most important point that I 

can make today is that this is a case about the 

substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just 

as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court 

articulated the substantive requirements for pleading 

a claim under the securities law, and just as in 

Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated 

General Contractors, in Trinko. And in the instant 

case, the Court is faced with the question of what a 

plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim 

and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust 

laws.

 In that regard, I'd like to direct the 

Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's 

complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the 

joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for

plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract 

combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. The 

complaint states, and I quote, "in the absence of any 

meaningful competition among the defendants," and, 

quote, in light of the parallel course of conduct 

that each engaged in to prevent competition, the 

plaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but isn't the next 

sentence, the substance of the sentence is 

"plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that 

defendants have entered into a contract combination 

or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their 

respective telephone and/or high speed interstate 

markets, and agreed not to compete with one another 

and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one 

another." Now, does that state a violation of the 

Sherman Act?

 MR. KELLOGG: It does not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It does not?

 MR. KELLOGG: It does not state a claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, you could leave 

out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, 

that's not part of the declaration in the sentence. 

But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of 

the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?

MR. KELLOGG: The sentence recites the 

language of the Sherman Act, that is correct. But 

what this Court's cases indicate and what Rule 8 

requires --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's got the language of 

the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive 

entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed 

markets. That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a 

description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.

 MR. KELLOGG: It is true that they have 

described the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura, 

Associated General Contractors, and other cases of 

this Court require is a statement of facts that 

warrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs 

wish to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kellogg, the 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid 

using the word fact throughout. And from 1938 on, it 

has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead 

facts. The index of forms, the appendix of forms 

shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is, 

and you're not required to plead facts. And yet 

that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust 

of your argument.

 MR. KELLOGG: Your Honor, every case of

this Court dealing with pleading standards has 

indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite 

a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to 

relief therefore. In Dura, for example, the 

plaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss 

causation, and the Court said --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But Mr. Kellogg, that's 

not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact 

that there was an agreement to prevent competitive 

entry into respective markets. There are dozens of 

antitrust complaints that are no more specific than 

that.

 MR. KELLOGG: Your Honor, in the context 

in which this claim is made, the allegation of 

agreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact. 

It is an inference that the plaintiffs seek to draw 

from the facts that they allege in the complaint. 

Context here is everything. In form 9, for example, 

Justice Ginsburg, or in the case of Sherkovitz, you 

had a specific context. You had a time, a place, 

individual participants named, a clear injury in form 

9, a broken leg as a report --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But negligently drove. 

It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light. 

Doesn't say whether it was speeding. It doesn't say

any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.

 MR. KELLOGG: That is correct, Justice 

O'Connor, but you have a direct context -- Justice 

Ginsburg, you had a direct context in which an 

eyewitness participant in the event is claiming 

negligence on behalf of the driver of the car. In 

the instant case, we have no injury that's separate 

from the alleged conspiracy, and we have no time, 

place or participants for the alleged conspirators.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you do have a case --

anywhere, forget antitrust. Suppose it's a tort 

case, and the following complaint is filed. My foot 

hurts. I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years. I claim 

he is negligent. Is that valid?

 MR. KELLOGG: I do not think so, because I 

don't think --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if you 

think that's valid, I understand that you think this 

complaint does just what I said in the field of 

antitrust. But is there any case that you've come 

across which would say a complaint just as I have 

described it --

MR. KELLOGG: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Either is valid or is not 

valid. You'd like to find one that says it's not

valid, so what's your best effort in any field of 

law.

 MR. KELLOGG: I would cite, for example, 

the Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the 

plaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a 

minimally adequate education. That sounds like a 

factual statement. But what the Court expressly said 

in that case is that we do not have to accept legal 

conclusions in the guise of factual allegations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But of course, there the 

legal standard was not clear. And the Dura case, I 

looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you 

-- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a 

lack of proximate cause. They just didn't show any 

relation between the injury they alleged to have 

suffered, and their own.

 MR. KELLOGG: Well, I think Dura is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the way I 

read Dura.

 MR. KELLOGG: I think Dura is an exact 

analogy. In Dura, they allege proximate cause, they 

allege loss causation. And the Court said, well, 

let's look at their statement of facts, which only 

showed that they had bought at an inflated price. 

And the Court said there was a fatal gap between that

factual allegation and the legal conclusion that they 

wished to draw.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You can get into trouble 

by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege 

a lot, you might leave something out.  And you say, 

well, what about that one. But suppose we keep it 

very, very minimal. And a person just says, I'm hurt 

and the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me. 

Period. Period.

 MR. KELLOGG: That would not provide --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not?

 MR. KELLOGG: The grounds upon which the 

claim is based.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So the only thing that's 

missing there are some facts.

 MR. KELLOGG: Some facts indicative that 

the defendant is responsible for the --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now you're 

saying a complaint has to have facts?

 MR. KELLOGG: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought you were 

also making a different argument. I thought you were 

making the argument that they have, by their 

pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that 

they don't have enough facts to support a general

allegation. I thought you were saying that because 

of the preface that you began reading, that in view 

simply of the fact that they are not competing, and 

in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the 

Act.

 So I guess my question is, would your 

position be different if there were no allegation 

simply of an absence of competition and parallel 

action if -- would your position be different if they 

had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized, 

that here were these parties and they had -- they had 

taken some action, not specified, which resulted in 

violation of the Act?

 MR. KELLOGG: Our position would not be 

different. It's the uniform view of the cases that I 

cited, the Courts of Appeals and a requirement of 

Rule -- Rule 8 that you do more than simply parrot 

the words of the cause of action or announce legal 

conclusions. But as you point out, in this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that would not be good 

enough, but are you saying that this is worse 

because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards 

specification. And the specifications that they have 

made affirmatively show that they don't have enough 

for the agreement.

MR. KELLOGG: It is certainly true that 

all they have alleged is conduct from which they seek 

to draw an inference of conspiracy. And they have 

made that quite clear, that they have made no direct 

allegation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you're saying that 

inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts 

that they have alleged.

 MR. KELLOGG: That is correct. Our 

position is that as a matter of substantive antitrust 

law, what this Court said in Matsushita is that 

antitrust law limits the range of permissible 

inferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct. 

And if all you have is parallel conduct that's 

consistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on 

the other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you 

cannot draw an inference of the sort that the 

plaintiffs depend upon in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that may be 

true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on 

the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation 

that the defendants have agreed not to compete with 

one another is not a statement of fact?

 MR. KELLOGG: I am. I would say that 

that's a -- that's a conclusion --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what if they said

another, would that be sufficient? Or if they have 

agreed orally not to compete with one another, would 

that be sufficient?

 MR. KELLOGG: If there were a specific 

context and they said --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If they said they have 

agreed orally not to compete with one another, would 

that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?

 MR. KELLOGG: Yes. Because you require --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then why did you leave 

the words orally out? Why is it not a statement, 

allegation of fact?

 MR. KELLOGG: Because the plaintiffs here 

were very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make 

any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest 

that there was a time and place --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's a direct 

allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.

 MR. KELLOGG: But they make it clear in 

that paragraph that it's an inference.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They make it fairly 

clear that they may only have the evidence of 

parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not

be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a 

summary judgment. But how you can say this is not an 

allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.

 MR. KELLOGG: I'm saying that it's not 

sufficient to state a claim. Just as the allegation 

that there was lost causation in Dura, or that there 

was harm to the union in Associated General 

Contractors or there, that there was harm --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now you're, that's the 

part precisely which you're following that I don't, 

that I actually don't know, is the extent to which 

you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of 

law, you can allege a fact. You say the person ran 

over me --

MR. KELLOGG: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Or you say, they treated 

me negligently. That's a fact. That means something 

happened there. But suppose you write the complaint 

and there is just no notion that you have a what and 

when, how, under what circumstances. It's just 

totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't 

know what, what period of time he is supposed to be 

thinking about, what, what happens to such a 

complaint? There must be some law on it in torts or 

someplace?

MR. KELLOGG: Well, ordinarily in a 

complaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion 

and ask for more specificity. Our problem --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why couldn't you do 

the same?

 MR. KELLOGG: Our problem with the current 

complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite 

specific. It provides color maps and such. The 

problem is that the facts specifically alleged simply 

don't amount to an antitrust violation because they 

don't support the inference that the plaintiffs ask 

the Court to draw.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but they're --

they're using the fact that there was parallel 

behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than 

parallel behavior. They are using it as a basis for 

thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, 

there were people meeting in a room and saying things 

to each other. So they are not just saying that it's 

sufficient. They are saying it's evidence that 

something else occurred.

 MR. KELLOGG: That's correct. That's 

exactly what they are saying and what Matsushita and 

the other courses, cases of this Court dealing with 

parallel conduct indicate, is that that's not a fair

inference from parallel conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't that a summary 

judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before? 

The Matsushita decision?

 MR. KELLOGG: That is correct. But the 

Court announced that as a principle of substantive 

law. They said substantive antitrust law limits the 

range of permissible inferences. We are not 

suggesting that the plaintiffs need the sort of 

specificity or certainly any evidence at the 

pleadings stage. For example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They just have to say 

orally, I wish you would reconsider that? Because if 

that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see 

anything to be gained by -- by such a holding. It 

doesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against 

a number of large corporations, nationwide 

businesses, thousands of employees. And on this 

complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, 

where, when, any of that.

 I can understand that you're saying that 

does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense. 

But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all 

right so long as they said orally. I mean -- forget 

about it.

MR. KELLOGG: I -- I should not agree to 

that. That's simply adding the word orally. It's 

certainly fair when you are talking about a 

nationwide class over a period of 10 years attacking 

an entire industry to suggest that the plaintiffs 

have to give some indication of what it is that the 

defendants have done that is wrong. Some concrete 

basis for the Court to believe there is a reason to 

go forward to the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in the negligently 

drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over --

the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, 

if it's not specific as to time and place it must be 

dismissed? If it's specific as to time and place 

it's, it withstands the motion?

 MR. KELLOGG: Well certainly, Form 9 is 

very specific. It gives a specific corner, it gives 

a time, it gives the names of the participants.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What if it does say 

within the last 10 years.

 MR. KELLOGG: I don't think that's 

sufficient, Your Honor. But with a -- with a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have a case, do 

you have a case I can look to that tells me that?

12(e) motion could then specify the actual time and 

place, but the plaintiffs here have had ample 

opportunity to amend their complaint to supplement. 

If they had any specifics indicating that there was 

such an agreement as opposed to lawyer speculation 

and a desire to engage in expensive discovery they 

would have produced that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you seek a more 

specific statement?

 MR. KELLOGG: We did not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? Why didn't you 

ask when and where was this agreement.

 MR. KELLOGG: Well again the whole way 

this was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that 

they, they acknowledged they had no specifics. They 

simply asked that an inference be drawn from the 

parallel conduct they alleged. And that is our 

central point that you simply cannot infer an 

agreement from this conduct. If the Court has no 

questions, I reserve my time.

MR. BARNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court.

 The fundamental concern of the United 

States is that the decision of the Second Circuit can 

be read to hold that a Section 1 Sherman Act 

complaint will survive a motion to dismiss merely by 

alleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the 

bare assertion of an agreement. Such a result fails 

to appreciate that parallel action or inaction is 

ubiquitous in our economy and often reflects 

beneficial competitive forces.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean can be 

held, can be thought to hold that? Is there any 

interpretation of what they did.

 MR. BARNETT: Well there are certain 

portions of the decision that talk about a 

plausibility requirement but when it turns to the 

specific area of a Section 1 complaint and a 

complaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with 

you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only 

interpretation I can draw from that passage. The 

Court held that if you allege parallel action unless 

there are no set of facts that can be proved, and 

it's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you 

cannot dismiss that complaint.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that really what 

they -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I 

thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of 

facts, only on the assumption that there had been a 

pleading which did raise a plausible, possible 

inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the 

Court was saying if the, if the plausibility 

criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that 

the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that 

there is no set of facts which would actually support 

the action. And I'm not sure that that can be done 

at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a 

dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something 

like that. But I thought the Court did not get to 

its no set of facts point until it had first assumed 

that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of 

which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct 

could be drawn. Am I about that?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, Justice Souter, I read 

that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not 

expressly referencing the plausibility requirement. 

There is language saying that the allegation needs to 

be plausible but when you get to this specific 

passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a 

court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be

no set of facts that could be proved. But 

regardless, even if I am, your interpretation is 

potentially permissible interpretation, the 

fundamental concern of the United States is that this 

Court, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1 

Sherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a 

motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond 

mere generic parallel action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So, so that if 

plausibility is the standard this does not meet the 

standard of plausibility, that's your argument?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, we prefer the 

formulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura 

that says that the facts need to demonstrate some 

reasonably founded expectation that there is an 

unlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of 

the Sherman Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And some parallel action 

would indicate that wouldn't it? I mean, if for 

example they, you have nine companies that change 

their price at the same hour of the same day, 10 

months in a row.

 MR. BARNETT: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

I agree.

saying that parallel action can never create this, 

this kind of --

MR. BARNETT: That is correct. If all you 

know is that there is parallel action or inaction, 

that in and of itself tells you nothing. Once you 

start to add the facts and circumstances surrounding 

it, particular parallel action can be suspicious 

enough, and the example you give is a good one, that 

demonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for 

believing that discovery may yield evidence showing 

that that parallel price increase at the same time by 

nine different companies was the result of an 

unlawful conspiracy.

 If I can turn to, in -- in deciding 

whether or not there is such a reasonably founded 

expectation, you do need to look to the substantive 

law. Here the issue is the law on agreement under 

Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Some of the questions 

I think I've heard go to this issue. Section 1 law 

specifically limits the kinds of facts that can be 

used to establish an agreement that is cognizable 

under the Sherman Act. In particular, the Court's 

rulings made clear that conscious parallelism which 

some economists might argue is a form of an 

agreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of

Section 1.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's clear it's not 

sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible 

evidence?

 MR. BARNETT: It may be admissible 

evidence but depending on the facts and circumstances 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Should a plaintiffs's 

complaint fail because it includes unnecessary, 

verbose, admissible evidence?

 MR. BARNETT: No. It should fail if it 

fail -- if it does not allege facts that indicate 

reasonable found --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is not it an allegation 

that they've agreed not to compete with one another 

an allegation of fact?

 MR. BARNETT: It is a combined question of 

law and fact in our view, because as I said the 

Section 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be 

used to establish an agreement. If all they have 

alleged is parallel action without more --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they have alleged 

more. They have alleged an actual agreement.

 MR. BARNETT: But as paragraph 51 of the 

complaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways

even worse. Because it specifically relies upon 

parallel action and alleged parallel inaction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what if it didn't? I 

mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens 

puts. Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing 

else except that these defendants entered into an 

agreement in -- in restraint of trade.

 MR. BARNETT: And that is not sufficient 

because in our view the complaint needs to allege 

some facts that demonstrate a basis for believing 

there was an unlawful agreement within --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the complaint in 

addition to that alleged that up to a certain date, 

it was unlawful for the companies to compete with one 

another but the law was changed and after that change 

took place they were advised by their lawyers they 

could compete, but they agreed not to. Would that be 

sufficient?

 MR. BARNETT: No. Every business, every 

day fails to enter some new line of business or take 

some potential competitive action. The mere --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Justice 

Stevens's question was that the allegation was that 

after that date they agreed not to compete. That 

states -- that states a cause of action under the

Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree with that. There 

still needs in our view to be some allegation that 

indicates -- a factual allegation that indicates a 

reason for believing there may have been unlawful 

agreement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can they say on the 14th 

of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New 

York, they agreed upon this course of action? That 

would surely be sufficient?

because it is providing enough facts to give you a

I've done is limited it in time and space. Just as

of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently

specifics --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, look, the one I 

just alleged in the tort law is a complaint. I've 

just copied it out of the model complaints.

 MR. BARNETT: I want to be clear --

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right or not?

 MR. BARNETT: The facts allege need to be 

specific enough to suggest --

standard.

 MR. BARNETT: Yes.

apply the standard and now I take my tort case --

I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove 

negligently and injured me. Is that no good?

insufficient --

this case is like that, when because they don't say

Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Barnett I thought you 

had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the 

particular day of the agreement. That it would be 

enough if it was the kind of parallel action that 

suggested an agreement that over nine years they all 

raised the price at the same time. Now that doesn't 

really give the defendant notice of, you know, what 

individuals were responsible for this, when it 

occurred. But you say that would still be adequate?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, it does provide notice 

that -- this is a fairly low threshold. It provides 

some indication. It can be an indication of direct 

evidence. It can be an indication of circumstantial 

evidence. It does focus the litigation, however, by 

providing a, a reason why the court and the defendant 

should be defending themselves against a section 1 

claim.

There are four essential dimensions to the 

problem that's before the Court and on every one of 

those dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor 

General gave in its amicus brief in the Swierkiewicz 

case is 180 degrees opposite the guidance that the 

Solicitor General is providing in its amicus brief in 

this case. The first of those dimensions I'll begin 

with because it's where petitioners began. In their 

brief, the Solicitor General in the Swierkiewicz case 

very clearly said that evidentiary standards cannot 

be made into pleading standards. What they said on 

page 5 was that by requiring pleading of the 

McDonnell Douglas prima facie case from employment 

law the Second Circuit had erroneously conflated the 

fair notice owed the defendant at the outset of the 

litigation with the standards governing the 

plaintiff's present of proof in court. Later at page 

11, they said the court's test confuses pleading ---

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're reading from 

the Swierkiewicz brief?

 MR. RICHARDS: From the Swierkiewicz 

Solicitor General brief.

 They said that the court test in the 

Second Circuit that was reversed --

that's shame on them. But we're trying to get this 

case right and, you know, I don't care what position 

they took before. I care about what the right answer 

is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can 

simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the 

negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, 

period. Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?

 MR. RICHARDS: There's a big difference 

between -- the answer is I don't know, perhaps.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps?

 MR. RICHARDS: Perhaps. But that's very 

different from this case and it's different in that 

an automobile accident is something that happens all 

in one moment in time. An antitrust conspiracy like 

the conspiracy alleged --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The agreement happens at 

one moment in time.

 MR. RICHARDS: Oh, it could happen in many 

moments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Meetings of the minds, 

meeting of the minds. I used to each Contracts. 

Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.

 MR. RICHARDS: But what the Second Circuit 

said on this point, and I submit that the Second 

Circuit was correct, was that the complaint does set

forth the temporal and geographic parameters of the 

alleged illegal activity and the identities of the 

alleged key participants, and I think that's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But where does it 

set forth agreement?

 MR. RICHARDS: It alleges --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Temporal, 

geographic, the identities, but where does it set 

forth anything evincing an agreement other than the 

allegation of parallel conduct?

 MR. RICHARDS: It alleges that there was 

an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an 

agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a 

plaintiff's burden in the complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any, 

is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the 

parallel conduct?

 MR. RICHARDS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what does that 

consist of?

 MR. RICHARDS: The leading plus factor 

that's generally used in, in the Matsushita context, 

in the Monsanto context, is action that would have 

been against the self-interest of the conspirators in 

the absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint

alleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering 

into one another's territories and competing among 

the ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have 

been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it states --

would it state an antitrust violation if had you a 

grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet 

store on the other corner of the block and you say, 

well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies 

and they could make money if they did, therefore 

that's an antitrust violation?

 MR. RICHARDS: If that conspiracy were 

implausible, if it made no sense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's all the 

facts that are alleged.

 MR. RICHARDS: Right, but the Second 

Circuit standard and the standard we defend is that 

if someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no 

sense because it's obvious from the face of the 

complaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the 

same product market, not in the same geographic 

market or something of that kind, there is no 

conceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of 

conspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed.

oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four 

gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, 

and they didn't cut their prices. Complaint?

 MR. RICHARDS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then that's the 

economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this 

economy. Every firm in a concentrated industry 

engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism, 

and I know there are economists who think that that 

should be the case, but I thought the law to date was 

that the Department of Justice is not given by the 

Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire 

American economy. But if we accept your view I guess 

it is.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, in 

the NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which 

is one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon 

for a circuit conflict to get here, what the court 

said is that allegations that defendant's action 

taken independently would be contrary to their 

economic self-interest will ordinarily tend to 

exclude the likelihood --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ordinarily, if you take 

that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a 

consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman

Act section 2, then we have that radical change that 

many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that 

half the economy is in violation, because in any 

concentrated industry, after all, it is in the 

interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large 

market unless he knows his three competitors will 

also keep prices up. Now, you have to know that or 

you'd cut them. And that's called conscious 

parallelism. And I had always thought that this 

Court had not said that that in and of itself is a 

violation of the Sherman Act.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, we 

don't just allege conscious parallelism. We 

allege --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but if in 

fact all you have to do in order to bring a 

price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege 

conscious parallelism and then add without further 

foundation, and we think there was a real agreement 

too, but there's nothing other than the conscious 

parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I 

said, with the exception you might not win at the end 

of the day. What have you is a ticket to conduct 

discovery. Now, that's what's bothering the 

Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the

answer to that problem.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, Justice Breyer, the 

difference between that, a critical difference 

between that scenario and what we have alleged in 

this complaint is that we do allege in great detail 

that not entering into one another's territories 

would have been contrary to the interests of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that does not help 

you with respect to the other claim, the claim that 

there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors 

from coming in. There's no plus factor as I 

understand it alleged there, and I also understand 

that it would have been entirely in the interest of 

each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and 

that there is no need for them to agree to do that. 

It would be the most natural thing in the world to do 

it. What do you say about that part of your case?

 MR. RICHARDS: As to that aspect of the 

case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but 

they are essentially allegations of common motive, 

which is a less strong, I'll grant you --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but a common, isn't 

the common motive consistent, just as consistent with 

no agreement as with agreement? In other words, they 

didn't have to agree; their common motive was

operative agreement or not?

 MR. RICHARDS: The important thing as to 

that aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case 

in this Court, which said that you're not supposed to 

dismember -- it's an inappropriate way to approach a 

conspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it 

in isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself 

and then wipe the slate clean at the end of that 

analysis, and that's essentially what the other side 

is trying to do repeatedly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, what the other side 

is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when 

it would be in the interest of each of the alleged 

conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing 

in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged 

something that gets to the threshold of plausibility. 

That's their argument and I, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think, by the way, that 

that argument applies not just to the keeping out the 

upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other 

alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you 

want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter 

your field I know that you're going to enter mine. 

It just doesn't pay for me to do it. Yeah, I can 

make money, but I'll lose money. It seems to me

perfectly natural for companies that have a certain 

geographic area in which they are the, the principal, 

the selected instrument and although they technically 

can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know 

that if they do it they will be subjected to the same 

thing. That is nothing more than conscious 

parallelism.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You may reply to us 

jointly or severally, however you may want.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. RICHARDS: If I may, I'll try to pose 

a hypothetical that I think addresses Justice 

Souter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try 

to address your question. Justice Souter, a good 

example would be suppose one alleges a conspiracy to 

rob a bank and to steal a number of getaway cars at 

the same time and one comes -- in order to get away, 

so that the conspirators couldn't be found at the 

site of robbing the bank. One could say, well, 

there's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally 

independent of the bank and without a conspiracy. 

Why do they need a conspiracy to steal a car? Why 

isn't that something that they wouldn't individually 

do?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the difference

between that case and this is that the allegation 

with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway 

cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not 

present here. Here the allegation simply is parallel 

conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in. 

And at that general level the answer is, of course 

anyone in his right mind would want to make it 

difficult to let the upstarts in. There's no need to 

assume that they might have agreed on some matter of 

detail which is not essential to the scheme. This is 

a general characteristic of competition and 

resistance of competition.

 MR. RICHARDS: I understand, but the point 

I'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what 

one does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to 

keep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary 

aspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and 

analyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway 

car theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well, 

they have a reason individually to steal the cars, so 

I guess that couldn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Richards, can I ask 

you this question. Supposing that you were allowed 

to have discovery and each chief executive of the 

defendant companies got on the stand and said: I

never talked to my, my competitors at all, I never 

seriously considered competing in the other, other 

company's territory for the reasons set forth in the, 

in your opponent's brief on the merits here. We 

never did agree. And you're able to prove the things 

you've alleged in the agreement. Would the, would it 

be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you 

on that testimony if you had no evidence of a 

specific agreement?

 MR. RICHARDS: In the context of summary 

judgment or at trial, we would be required to prove 

what we have now alleged.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is you 

can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they 

deny the existence of any agreement and they 

explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers 

did in this brief. Would you not lose on summary 

judgment?

 MR. RICHARDS: If we don't have proof at 

that point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: After several years --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Prove what you have 

alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of 

agreement among the competitors. If you had no other 

evidence of that agreement, would you win.

MR. RICHARDS: If we had proof that they 

actually acted against what would have been their 

self-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we 

would satisfy then the Matsushita standard for 

summary judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand 

acting in self interest. I mean, they might just 

decide apart from, you know, if they go into their 

territory they'll come into mine, that investing in 

this wired business isn't the best, the best bet for 

them. Maybe they want to get into the wireless 

business and think that's a better way to spend their 

money.

 MR. BARNETT: Surely it is possible to 

conceive of facts under which they would not have not 

conspired and they would have had a different motive, 

but that's not the legal standard under Conley versus 

Gibson.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm questioning 

you. You say you meet the plus factor because they 

were acting against their self- interest, that a 

self-interested player in this league would have gone 

into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that 

by saying that they might have seen this whole area 

as not the best place to invest their money.

MR. RICHARDS: I understand that. But we 

have alleged that as fact, Justice Ginsburg, and that 

fact and that allegation has to be treated as true 

under conventional pleading standards for purposes of 

a motion to dismiss.  If we are unable to prove that 

fact when we get to summary judgment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You mean the mere fact 

that you have alleged something is against their 

self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on 

whether it's against their self-interest?

 MR. RICHARDS: Yes, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They could have gone on 

the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red 

briefs -- or the blue briefs in this case, that say 

it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that 

would be a jury question?

 MR. RICHARDS: No, not at summary 

judgment. What I'm saying is that at the pleading 

stage to allege that, which is an allegation of fact, 

satisfies pleading standards. Just to allege it with 

testimony on the other side and no evidence to prove 

that allegation on summary judgment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you suggesting that 

you don't have to prove an actual agreement? You can 

merely prove conduct contrary to self-interest is

sufficient?

 MR. RICHARDS: Conduct contrary to 

self-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement 

in the absence of direct evidence.

 JUDGE STEVENS: Do you agree you must --

do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement 

among the defendants?

 MR. RICHARDS: There must be an inference 

of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn 

from circumstantial evidence, and that's what 

Matsushita is all about.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then when we 

get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your 

statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that 

plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that 

they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion 

based upon your prior allegations, it's not an 

independent allegation of an agreement. It's saying 

because of this parallel conduct, because we think 

it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they 

have agreed.

 MR. RICHARDS: Counsel presented it as 

though it's a complete summary of everything, but 

what it says is, and the other facts and market 

circumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by --

this, there's an agreement.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, it's also an 

independent statement and allegation on information 

and belief, which is permitted under Rule 8, that 

there is agreement.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I guess if you had just 

alleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs 

have alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and 

belief, et cetera, without the detail that you 

provided, would that have been sufficient?

 MR. RICHARDS: If you gave no context of 

what kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what 

kind of scope it had, so that a court could balance 

JUSTICE ALITO: But you omit all the 

allegations about parallel conduct and the other 

allegations that you think provide a basis for 

inferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if 

you omit all that but you just include the last part

of 51, would that be enough?

 MR. RICHARDS: If there isn't enough in 

the way of facts alleged to permit a court to 

understand what it is you're claiming in general 

terms happening, then you haven't satisfied Rule 8. 

I mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to 

Justice Alito's question in this case?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, in this case we have 

provided, as the Second Circuit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. His hypothetical is 

all you've done is to allege the final sentence 

without the preceding clause, the five or six lines 

before there's a comma. That's out. All there is is 

the allegation of the conspiracy. Is that enough in 

this case?

 MR. RICHARDS: In this case with the 

allegations of the nature of the conspiracy that 

precede that sentence, it's enough.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The hypothetical is 

without the preceding clause. Is that enough --

MR. RICHARDS: That sentence by itself --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that enough in this 

case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are

complaint in this case that we are faced with.

 MR. RICHARDS: I think that that would 

satisfy conventional pleading standards under Rule 

8(a). On the other hand, I don't think it would 

satisfy the Second Circuit's standard below, because 

the Second Circuit required enough facts to enable a 

court to wrap its mind around a complainant, 

understanding what it is you claimed happened. You 

don't have to prove your case as a complainant, you 

just have to --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'd also like a clear 

answer, and I would like to go back to Justice 

Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're 

thinking there. We have three steel sheet companies 

in the United States, no more. They sell at $10 a 

sheet. One day we have action in the case, a memo to 

the president of the company. He says Mr. President, 

if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more 

money unless the others go along. And if they get 

there first, you will lose money. So whether they 

cut or not, you'd better cut your prices. Reply from 

the president: But if I don't cut my prices, they 

won't cut theirs, and we are all better off. That's 

your evidence. Do you win?

 MR. RICHARDS: That would depend on the

JUSTICE BREYER: There is no depend. 

That's the evidence. Do you win?

 MR. RICHARDS: If that's the evidence, I 

think I win.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you cite 

Matsushita for that?

 MR. RICHARDS: No. For that I would cite 

Judge Posner's decision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you're right, then I 

guess we could engage in this major restructuring of 

the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised 

they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been 

recalcitrant.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, there's no major 

restructuring of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, because we have 

concentrated industries throughout the economy, I 

guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that 

that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an 

executive in such a company, at least they teach that 

at the schools of government, and people who aren't 

really experienced in these things, but --

MR. RICHARDS: Well, the way Judge Posner 

explains it in High Fructose is to say that it is

possible to have an agreement without a moment where 

there's a statement of agreement. The participants 

in a conspiracy can possibly treat what one of them 

does as an offer, which another one can accept by 

following it, to satisfy that way of showing a 

conspiracy.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine. Now, let's 

forget my immediate disagreement or not. Let's say I 

agree with you on this. Now we have our example 

right in mind. What other than the parallel to my 

example could one reading this complaint think you 

intend to prove?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, Your Honor, the 

strongest -- plus factors that, in the absence of 

direct evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a 

case, which private plaintiffs will almost never have 

because people don't conspire in public parks. All a 

plaintiff can have is what are called plus factors 

under Matsushita, and the strongest of those plus 

factors is what has been alleged in great detail in 

this complaint of action against self interest. The 

case law recognizes that --

tell? I mean, companies get proposals all the time.

all enter the market in some foreign country. The 

people decide, I mean, life is short and they've got 

certain objectives, and they don't have to do 

everything that an economist might think is in their 

economic self interest. I mean, what is the limiting 

self interest to that?

 MR. RICHARDS: This is different from that 

because this is a situation where when the 

Telecommunications Act was passed in 1996, Congress 

expected that the ILECs would compete in one 

another's territories as CLECs. The defendants 

pledged that they would compete in one another's 

territories at ILECs. They then for years in 

Congress complained that the CLECs who were trying to 

compete with them were given an unfair advantage in 

the terms and conditions on which they were permitted 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it an adequate 

response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk 

averse, I want to see how things work out over the 

next five years. They keep changing the laws, the 

regulatory environment. That's why I didn't jump in 

and compete?

 MR. RICHARDS: If they can prove that 

that's the reason why they didn't jump in and

compete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason 

for what they did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they don't do 

that, is it your argument that simply by behaving 

differently from the way Congress assumed when it 

passed the statute, that raises the plausible 

inference of violation?

 MR. RICHARDS: Within the other facts that 

I was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here 

that competition as a CLEC would have been, in the 

absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege 

here, would have been a profitable endeavor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But is part of the 

plausibility of that inference the fact, in your 

argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would 

happen?

 MR. RICHARDS: That's one factor that I 

point to among several to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, the 

congressional assumption is part of your case, in 

other words?

 MR. RICHARDS: It is.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

other factors such as the constant complaints to

Congress about how CLECs had the better side of the 

deal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the 

defendants that they would do, and that they didn't 

do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I used to work in the 

field of telecommunications and if the criterion is 

that happens which Congress expected to happen when 

it passed its law, your case is very weak.

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, Your Honor, that -- I 

certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that 

we would be relying on at trial or at summary 

judgment to support our case, but in our motion to 

dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support 

our case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you need what is 

called the plus factor, and I gather that you 

acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, 

this parallel action seemed to be against the self 

interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus 

factor and you would lose.

 MR. RICHARDS: I don't think that the 

Court, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own 

that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it 

would have been in their interest to do this in the 

absence of conspiracy, is wrong, then the Court is

not following conventional pleading standards.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So all you have to do to 

prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your 

pleading, and there is a plus factor?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, you have to say what 

it is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to say what it 

is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, if it's implausible, 

that might be a different consideration.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richards, didn't 

the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor? 

They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs 

could show it, but the second sentence is you don't 

need a plus factor.

 MR. RICHARDS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that can be wrong 

or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that 

Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no 

plus factor.

 MR. RICHARDS: I agree with that, Your 

Honor, and my contention as to what the law is is 

that we are not required to plead plus factors. But 

the fact remains that we have, and that our factual 

pleading of plus factors has to be treated as true

JUSTICE ALITO: What if you pled more than 

you had to, and it's clear from what you pled that 

you were drawing an implausible inference? Can't the 

complaint then be dismissed for failure to state a 

claim?

 MR. RICHARDS: No, I don't believe that it 

can be if -- because the Court is not, the correct 

function of the Court under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is 

not to be decided by whether it believes or is 

persuaded by the allegations in the complaint.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's take the Form 

9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile 

accident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured 

in an automobile accident at a particular place in 

time. I was hit by a compact car with Massachusetts 

plates. The defendant owns the compact car with 

Massachusetts plates. That's the complaint. The 

Court can't dismiss that for failure to state a claim 

when it's apparent from the face of the claim that 

you're, that the basis for suing the defendant is a 

totally implausible inference?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, if the allegation is 

also made that the defendant was negligent, then I 

think it clearly satisfies the pleading standard

under Form 9. I think it would be a more detailed 

complaint than the sample that comprises Form 9 of 

the rules.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even if it reveals that 

the only basis for identifying this person as the 

defendant is the fact that the person has a 

Massachusetts license plate and a compact car?

 MR. RICHARDS: Yes, because that's more 

than nothing, and the rule in Form 9 contains 

nothing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it contains a 

time and a place. It's quite specific that there was 

an accident and that defendant, defendant of a 

certain name at a certain time and place negligently 

drove. What it doesn't tell you is the details of 

the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is 

specific in time and place and person, which is one 

of the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip 

away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion 

that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to 

use a discovery process to find out whether or not 

that's true. Isn't that essentially what this 

complaint is?

 MR. RICHARDS: That is the situation that 

any plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal

conspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for 

certain that there was a conspiracy. We have 

observed market facts which are suggestive of a 

conspiracy and we allege that there was a conspiracy. 

Now under conventional standards, all we would have 

to do is allege that there was a conspiracy and say 

what it was. We wouldn't have to plead a basis to 

infer that we are correct or incorrect because that's 

not the analysis that Rule 12(b)(6) --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't 

think you have to prove that either? I mean, you 

don't think you have to prove anything more than what 

you've alleged in the complaint about the background 

context, the parallel conduct?

 MR. RICHARDS: If the Court -- if we were 

to prove to the satisfaction of the finder of fact 

that the conduct we have pointed to here was or would 

have been contrary to the interests of the defendants 

in the absence of a conspiracy, we were to prove that 

as distinguished from pleading, we would satisfy 

Matsushita. Now at that stage in the case, it's 

inconceivable that there won't be all kinds of other 

memos and, you know, real world things that will shed 

light on why the defendants internally think they did 

this.

JUSTICE SCALIA: How much money do you 

think it would have cost the defendants by then to 

assemble all of the documents that you're going to be 

interested in looking at? How many buildings will 

have to be rented to store those documents and how 

many years will be expended in, in gathering all the 

materials?

 MR. RICHARDS: Well, to address that 

concern, which we share, because we don't gain 

anything with Matsushita. At the end of the road in 

the case, we don't gain anything by pursuing a case 

for years in an unnecessarily burdensome way if we 

are not sure that it's going to prevail. So we 

proposed in this case a phased discovery process, 

pursuant to which you would first have discovery into 

conspiracy, and then the Court would have an early 

opportunity for a Matsushita motion and we either 

carry the day at that point or we don't. That's 

discovery.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point does it 

get characterized as a class action, before this 

discovery or after?

 MR. RICHARDS: It's at the Court's 

discretion when to entertain the motion for class 

certification. In this particular case the

defendants, a couple of the defendants proposed that 

we include in that phased discovery proposal class 

certification as an additional subject of that first 

phase of discovery, and we would be amenable to that 

as a compromise. But the point, getting back to 

Justice Scalia's point, that discovery as to whether 

there was a conspiracy in this case in order to 

satisfy that first phased analysis, would not need to 

be terribly burdensome and wouldn't necessarily be 

more burdensome than all kinds of other cases. It's 

really a very targeted issue. I think it's actually 

an appropriate way to deal with cases of this kind 

and it's actually a way that the Court has proposed 

dealing with similar issues in the past in the 

Anderson versus Creighton case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how would it 

be focused if you're talking about whether it's in 

their economic interest? You would have to say why, 

why didn't you enter into this particular realm of 

competition and they would say, well because we were 

doing other things. We had other areas that we were 

focusing on. And they would have to document all 

that to your satisfaction.

 MR. RICHARDS: We'd -- we would ask for 

production of documents reflecting their thinking

process about entering into one another's 

territories. And that would be very enlightening. 

And after we get those documents we would have a much 

clearer idea and be able to share with the Court a 

much clearer idea of the entire picture of a kind 

that we can't have at the 12(b)(6) stage.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you 

Mr. Richard, Mr. Kellogg, you have four minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL KELLOGG, 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. KELLOGG: Thank you. Your Honor.

 I have three quick points that I would 

like to make. First following up on Justice 

Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have 

an authority to issue purely investigative 

complaints. The Department of Justice of course can 

issue civil investigative demands, but for private 

plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery, 

particularly to the sort of massive discovery at 

issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking 

the plaintiff -- the defendants have done something 

wrong. In that regard, in the Trinko case, the 

plaintiffs there specifically alleged that the

defendants were engaged in actions against self 

interest by not cooperating with new entrants. And 

what the Court did is it went behind that mere 

allegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts 

concerning the industry, looked at the statute, 

regulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous. Of 

course it is in the self interest of the incumbents 

to not go out of their way to cooperate with new 

entrants to allow them to take business away.

 Now the flip side, the second half of the 

conspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our 

failure to enter new markets. And it's important to 

recognize that they are suggesting we should have 

relied upon a regulatory regime that we were 

successfully challenging in the courts. We got it 

struck down three separate times, and it was simply 

not a viable business opportunity in light of those 

facts and there is no reason to suggest that it was 

anything but in the self interest of the defendants 

to decline to enter these markets. Even conscious 

parallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under 

the antitrust laws. And at best, that is what we 

have here, and as a consequence they failed to state 

a claim.

 If the Court has further questions? I
