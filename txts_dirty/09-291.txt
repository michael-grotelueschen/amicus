 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 09-291, Thompson v. North American 

Stainless.

 Mr. Schnapper.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Section 704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use 

of third-party reprisals as a method of retaliating 

against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise 

opposed discrimination. The text of section 704(a) 

doesn't limit the types of retaliation which are 

forbidden. The elements of the statute are unrelated to 

that.

 The first requirement is that the plaintiff 

show that discrimination occurred with regard to the 

individual who engaged in a protected activity. In a 

case like that, like this, that's shown by -- would be 

shown by evidence that they singled out Ms. Regalado and 

Ms. Regalado's fiancé. They didn't go fire anybody 

else's fiancé. That was the basis on which this 

particular action was taken.

Secondly, the plaintiff must show that the 

conduct was discrimination against the person who 

engaged in protected activity. That language is easily 

applicable to a situation where you single out, say, a 

family member or a fiancé. The purpose of that, the 

complaint can fairly be read to allege, was to punish 

the person who had engaged in protected activity.

 There are a number of Federal statutes that 

use the word "against" in precisely this way. They say 

that actions cannot be taken to -- say, against a family 

member of a sitting judge or other Federal official 

where the purpose is to act against the official.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is Ms. Regalado still 

engaged to this fellow?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: She's married to him.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I'm sorry. Is she still 

engaged to him?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: They're married.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, they're married.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: And they have a lovely 

2-year-old daughter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, good. Well, why didn't 

she bring this suit?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I think, Your Honor,

that your -- this Court's Article III jurisprudence 

would have precluded her from getting any remedy. The 

-- certainly most of the remedies that are needed here. 

She wouldn't have had Article III standing to win an 

award of back pay to -- to her now husband. She 

couldn't have gotten an award of damages to him. I 

think, if I'm right -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could she have gotten 

reinstatement on the grounds that his continuing 

inability to be employed by the company is an ongoing 

hurt to her?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Perhaps. It would depend on 

the circumstances. In this particular case, almost 

certainly not, because of just the -- the course of 

subsequent events. But it's -- she subsequently left 

the company. At this point, they live nowhere near that 

town. It simply wouldn't work.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an employer -­

suppose an employer dismisses an employee on an 

impermissible ground, impermissible under Title VII, and 

it's a very valuable employee. Can the shareholders sue 

on the ground that the shareholders are now injured 

because the company is worth less, having lost this 

employee, under Title VII?

so, Your Honor. I don't believe so. But the situation 

here is different than that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you start with 

somebody who is -- who is unlike the shareholders. 

There's no Title VII violation as to them. Regalado is 

complaining of sex discrimination, and then she said, 

because I made a complaint, they retaliated against me. 

Shareholders are not in that position, because there was 

no initial charge there.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it's the same 

hypothetical. We'll just say Regalado, all the same 

facts, except she is very valuable to the company. The 

company is now worth less; shareholder sues.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think the thrust of your 

question was -- is: Are the shareholders like Thompson? 

And I think -- I think that Thompson's situation is 

quite different. He was the very target of the illegal 

act. The illegality occurs only by means of dismissing 

him.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The question is whether he's 

aggrieved within the meaning of Title VII, right?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That is the other question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that if 

there's injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III 

of the Constitution, then the person is aggrieved.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think -- I think the 

Government has -- I -- I think as far as you need to go, 

which is not the same as saying that's as far as the law 

goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as 

in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the 

very method by which the law was violated, that that 

would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where does that come from? 

Where does that test come from?

think that's as far as you need to go in this case. 

think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that, 

but the -- in -- as this has played out in the lower 

courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of 

different kinds of circumstances under which the 

Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases. 

We're not asking you to address all of those.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I understand the argument. 

I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me, 

to say as far as we need to go in order to reverse. 

That's really not how a statute ought to be interpreted, 

I would say. What does it mean? What -- now, I 

understand the argument that "aggrieved" means all the 

way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is 

necessary to satisfy the Constitution. And I understand 

that argument. It's a very broad argument with a lot of 

implications.

 But if -- if that's not correct, then what 

is the correct test and where does it come from?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that there are two other limitations that would be 

applicable here, as indeed they would have been under 

Title VIII.

 First one is proximate cause, which will cut 

off a lot of injuries down the road. And Title VII is

adopted against a background of proximate cause rules, 

and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in 

using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress 

meant to set those aside.

 Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of 

the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is 

both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower 

than "injured." It is broader -- and that's, of course, 

not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people 

who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the 

future.

 But it also has a second element which is 

that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong. 

If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm 

probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football 

in the middle of a football game. That's a legitimate 

thing to do.

 So I think that there has to be a wrong, and 

the wrong has to be the -- the basis of the -- of the 

plaintiff's objection. You could have a situation where 

the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why 

-- why that harm had happened. It was -- but in this 

case, that's precisely why Thompson complains. He's not 

suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever 

fired at all. He is aggrieved because he was fired for

a reason that was an improper reason. And -- and we 

think those are -- those are limiting principles.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what do you do 

with the argument that says there's a middle step? You 

can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and 

then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense 

that he was hurt, he was injured. But they say there's 

no cause of action, there's no statutory cause of 

action, for Thompson.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- we think that's 

just clearly wrong. The statute provides a cause of 

action.

 If I might go back to how that came up in 

the court of appeals, the court of appeals appears to 

have assumed that third-party reprisals are unlawful. 

It's not entirely clear. And then, in footnote 1, the 

court of appeals said that -- that Thompson was 

aggrieved.

 Notwithstanding that, they then went on to 

say that there's no cause of action in the statute -­

they said in section 704(a). That really doesn't make 

any sense. The -- the statute provides an express cause 

of action. It says that individuals -- certain 

individuals, if the requirements are met, can bring 

lawsuits.

So the question is, as -- as Justice Alito 

put it and -- and it was put before, which is whether 

the plaintiff is aggrieved. But if he's aggrieved, he's 

clearly got a cause of action -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Thompson were not 

Regalado's fiancé at the time. Suppose they were 

just -- they were just good friends. Would -- and 

everything else happened, and he alleged that he was 

fired in retaliation for her engaging in protected 

conduct. The way the company wanted to get at her was 

by firing her friend. Would that be enough?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the -- the plaintiff 

would have to prove two things. First of all, the 

plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the 

company's motive for picking him to fire him.

 Secondly, under this Court's decision in 

Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show 

that this was a retaliatory action sufficiently serious 

that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable 

employee in Regalado's position -- dissuade her 

complaint. And -- and that's why we've agreed with the 

Respondent's contention that -- that they're entitled to 

an evidentiary determination about whether that standard 

was met here.

 So that's an important limiting principle,

JUSTICE ALITO: How does that translate? 

How does that Burlington Northern standard translate 

into the situation in which there is some sort of 

relationship between the -- the person who engaged in 

the protected conduct and the person who suffers the 

adverse employment action?

 That's what's troubling to me about -- about 

the theory. Where it's a fiancé, it's -- that's a 

relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole 

spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser 

relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -­

unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory 

is rather troubling.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Can you help -- can you help 

provide where the clear line is? Does it go to -- does 

it include simply a good friend? Does it include 

somebody who just has lunch in the cafeteria every day 

with the person who engaged in the protected conduct? 

Somebody who once dated the person who engaged in the 

protected conduct? Are these all questions that have to 

go to a jury?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: They wouldn't all have to go 

to a jury. I mean, the -- the problem, as you cast it,

is that's the standard in Burlington Northern -- no 

offense -- isn't a bright line. It is the standard, 

which it is. And the same question could arise about 

other methods of retaliation.

 What about -- you know, what about cutting 

someone out of 5 meetings or 10 meetings? But that same 

problem exists under Burlington Northern no matter what.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But why can't -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't they get -- the 

first question, to go back, is just a confusion in my 

mind: Why couldn't she bring this suit? And she says: 

I was discriminated against because they did A, B, C, D 

to him, and the remedy is cure the way in which I was 

discriminated against. And to cure that way, you would 

have to make the man whole in respect to those elements 

that we're discriminating against her.

 Do you give him back pay? Do you restore 

him? You do everything you would normally have to do, 

because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury, 

though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for 

opposing a practice. What's wrong with that theory?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think that that kind of 

remedy would pose very serious problems under Article 

III.

wife in order to get him to do something? And -- and 

that's a crime, and suppose there was a civil statute. 

The judge says: The way you cure what you did to get me 

to do something is you make me whole. And in that 

instance, it requires making her whole. What's the

it -- the -- ordinarily, Article III would bar me from 

suing for an award of money to be paid to somebody else.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's because the 

award of money to be paid for somebody else, their 

absence of money didn't hurt you, but where there -- for 

example, if you're a trustee, you certainly can sue to 

get the beneficiary put back. There are dozens of cases

there.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your 

brief, and certainly the Government's brief, to take a 

very expansive view of what type of retaliation would 

give rise to a cause of action by the -- the directly 

harmed employee.

 Now you seem to be suggesting that that 

employee would not have Article III standing to bring an 

action.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think we've got a 

situation here in which this violates the rights of 

Regalado, but Regalado's ability to herself bring a 

lawsuit and get a remedy is limited, and that -- that -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me -- because your 

time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act 

has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely 

affected close relatives. You are essentially asking us 

to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the 

ADA -­

MR. SCHNAPPER: If I might respond to that 

briefly, you're referring to section 12112(b)(4) of the 

ADA. That is a provision directed at a very different 

problem, which is not associations between employees. 

It's -- it's directed at employers who might refuse to 

hire a worker because, for example, he had or she had a 

child with a disability.

 The EEOC's commentaries on the regs about 

this explain it. It is -- it is not concerned with 

employee relations. It's concerned with a 

discrimination against a worker, prospective worker, 

typically because they have a family member who has a 

disability, and the employer has preconceptions about 

whether they'll be good workers based on that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the Fair Housing Act 

has a definition of injury that would include 

Mr. Thompson, and that's not in this Act, that express 

language.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

That -- that statute was adopted somewhat later.

 There are large numbers of statutes that 

have rather general language like "person aggrieved." 

But I think that, in the case of the Housing Act, that 

language fairly describes the ordinary English meaning 

of "aggrieved." Sometimes Congress does that.

 There are other definitions in the Fair 

Housing Act like that, like the definition of 

"dwelling." It doesn't mean "dwelling"; it means 

something else everywhere else in the U.S. Code. Just, 

Congress, in that instance, decided to spell out what 

everyone, I think, would have understood the word to 

have meant.

When an employer fires an employee as a 

means of retaliating against a relative or close 

associate who has filed an EEOC charge, the employee who 

has been fired is entitled under Title VII to go to 

court and seek appropriate remedies, even if he hasn't 

himself engaged in protected activity.

that, but you want -- before you do it, you want to know 

whether you're potentially opening yourself up to a 

retaliation claim.

 Now, what is the employer supposed to do 

then? They say, well, let's -- we need to survey 

everybody who is engaged in protected conduct, and now 

we need to see whether this person who we're thinking of 

taking the adverse employment action against has a, 

quote, unquote, "close relationship" with any of those 

people.

from the company and you say, now, is -- you know, 

was -- are these people dating? Did they once date? 

Are they good friends?

 What are you supposed to do?

 MS. KRUGER: Justice Alito, we're not 

arguing for a test that would create a kind of 

protection for a so-called right of association under 

Title VII. It's not the case that so long as somebody 

is associated with somebody who has complained about 

discrimination, they would be automatically protected 

under the test that we're advocating.

 The reason the relationship is important in 

this case is because it tends to render plausible the 

argument that there's a causal connection between the 

adverse action visited on Thompson in this case -­

JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that. I do 

understand that, but I wish you'd -- I'd like you to 

answer my question.

 Does the employer have to keep a -- a 

journal on the intimate or casual relationships between 

all of its employees so that it knows what it's -- it's 

opening itself up to when it wants to take an action 

against somebody?

 MS. KRUGER: No, I think it's actually quite 

the contrary. I think if the employer doesn't know

about the relationship, any allegation like the 

allegation that we have in this case simply isn't going 

to be plausible. It isn't going to be a plausible 

contention that there is a relationship between one 

employee's protected activity and an adverse action 

visited on the plaintiff.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you say -­

but it won't be because of the degree of connection 

between the -- the retaliated-against employee and the 

means of retaliating.

 I understood your brief. I'm just looking 

at page 6. The limitation you propose is someone -­

someone close to him. The anti-retaliation prohibition 

"prohibits an employer from firing an employee because 

someone close to him filed an EEOC complaint."

 And I guess I have the same concern that 

we've been discussing for a little while. How are we 

supposed to tell, or how is an employer supposed to 

tell, whether somebody is close enough or not?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, if there's -- I don't 

think that there's any reason for the Court to try to 

fashion a hard-and-fast rule that identifies some 

relationships that are close enough and others that 

aren't.

 The question in every case is the question

that's posed by this Court's standard in Burlington 

Northern: Was this an action that a reasonable employee 

would have considered materially adverse? Would it have 

been deterred -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Burlington 

Northern, of course, is quite different, because you're 

just -- you're dealing with the obvious plaintiff in 

that case. You -- your -- your concern is confined to a 

particular person.

 In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited 

universe that you don't have any reason to know where it 

ends.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly going to 

be important, whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like 

this, both to establish that the employer knew of the 

relationship and the relationship was one that is of 

sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be 

deterred from making or supporting a charge of 

discrimination -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why does that matter 

under your theory? Let's assume the different -­

slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a 

coworker who has expressed sympathy for the 

discriminated person, has spoken about them in a 

favorable light or has tried to defend them. Would that

MS. KRUGER: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if the intent was to 

retaliate against the person complaining of 

discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's 

supporting them?

 MS. KRUGER: In that scenario, I think that 

that person would have a cause of action but for a 

different reason.

 Under this Court's decision in Crawford, 

that person would probably be considered to be a person 

who had opposed the discrimination and, for that reason, 

would themselves have engaged in a protected activity.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So an opposer is anyone 

who -- who assists?

 MS. KRUGER: That's our understanding of 

what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's assume they 

did it just in private, but the employer knew it. They 

overheard a conversation between the close friend and 

the employee saying: I really am in support of you; I 

know you've been treated unfairly. I like you; I like 

you working here.

 Would that person be close enough?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that -- again, I think

that's a question that sort of turns on whether a jury 

would find the reasonable employee in the position of 

the person who had engaged in protected activity would 

be deterred from making or supporting a charge of 

discrimination if they knew the consequence was that 

their best friend would be fired.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to have to go 

before a jury as an employer all the time. I want -- I 

want a safe harbor. I don't even want to mess with 

people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit. 

And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you. 

You have to go before a jury and say if this person is 

close enough.

 Why can't we say members of family and 

fiancés? Would -- would that be a nice rule?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that it would be 

an essentially arbitrary rule.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I know.

 MS. KRUGER: At end of the day, when the 

question is just the question that the Court assigned 

under Burlington Northern, it's a question that turns on 

the specific facts and context of the -- a specific

you're proposing -- my goodness, I don't know who it is

 MS. KRUGER: Well, an employer always is 

going to have to be careful to some degree not to visit 

harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But you're -- you're a 

reasonable person. What would you say is the degree of 

closeness that's required?

 MS. KRUGER: I don't think that there's any 

way to fashion a hard-and-fast rule. The fact of the 

matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that 

have raised third-party retaliation arguments and which 

are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment 

statutes -- and I don't think Respondent disputes that 

they are rightly so -- have largely concerned 

relationships like the relationship between parent and 

child, between husband and wife.

In one case under the Occupational Safety 

and Health Act, it's -- it's involved a relationship 

between very good friends in the workplace, whereas 

there is a D.C. Court of Appeals decision that holds 

that a merely professional relationship that doesn't 

exhibit that degree of personal affection isn't 

sufficiently close.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Very good friends is enough?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that a reasonable 

employee who knows that the consequence of making or 

supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be 

that their best friend at work is going to be fired may 

be deterred from engaging in protected activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in -- in your view, 

could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?

 MS. KRUGER: Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do 

think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own 

right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within 

the meaning of the statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that is so, why 

doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, for two reasons, Justice 

Kennedy. First of all, Regalado here didn't sue, just 

like most people in her position didn't sue, because 

mostly people who are charged with the enforcement of

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- I assume 

that part of the thrust of your argument is that this 

was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was 

hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well, 

it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody 

that's more remote can sue. That's an odd rule.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think in that 

situation, she certainly -- she might sue, but she also 

might assume that it ought to be her fiancé whose job 

was actually lost who ought to carry the mantle -­

time that they need to decide whether or not to press 

charges.

the -- the point that you were first making, I thought,

be the one to sue.

Ginsburg. And I think the other -­

Ms. Regalado in this case. Eric Thompson is here to use 

her rights to recover for her alleged discrimination 

based upon her conduct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if -- you know, if

big deal? Then we still have the same problem, that the 

employer doesn't know whom -- whom he has to treat with 

kid gloves.

comes down on him, it's -- it's she who brings the suit

bring the cause of action based upon Burlington and the 

way that the language is written in Burlington. I think 

it's very, very broad.

retaliation without injury is not actionable. So she -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So that's your only 

point, not that -- not that it's going to be very 

difficult for employers to figure out who can be 

protected and who can't? You abandon that -- that 

issue?

 MS. LATHEROW: No. I think if Regalado has 

the right to bring a cause of action, it is going to be 

very difficult.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MS. LATHEROW: But I think that the way that 

Burlington reads now, and that is whether someone would 

be dissuaded, if that is harm to her, then she could 

bring the cause of action. What's difficult about 

applying the Burlington standard is you could have 

someone who is dissuaded from filing a claim but may not 

be harmed.

 For example, if an employer announced a 

proposition that it was going to fire an employee at 

random whenever someone filed an EEOC charge, I might 

not file a charge because I wouldn't want someone, even 

someone who I didn't know, to be terminated, but I 

wouldn't be injured in that scenario.

employer could adopt that policy?

 MS. LATHEROW: -- so she would have no 

claim. And if you think about it, if she was not 

discriminated against, then the other people could not 

bring a claim for discrimination based upon her.

 What makes this case a little cloudy is that 

Eric Thompson is an employee as well, but he doesn't 

bring this case as an employee. You could very well 

have Eric Thompson as a spouse who is not employed. So, 

for example, if Mr. Thompson had been just -- let's make 

him a spouse, an even closer relationship than a fiancé, 

and suppose that he -- his job -- he ran an animal 

shelter in Carrollton, Kentucky, and it was a benevolent 

organization, but his only source of revenue was a 

generous gift from North American Stainless at 

Christmastime.

 And in 2003, after Regalado filed her claim 

with the EEOC, filed her charge, North American 

Stainless said: I'm not going to -- I'm not going to 

give money this year to the animal shelter, to Mr. 

Thompson, and I'm not going to do it because of 

Regalado, who is our employee, because she filed a 

charge of discrimination. I'm not going to do anything 

to help her. I'm not going to do anything to help him.

In that case, under Mr. Schnapper's 

standard, that any person aggrieved can bring a claim, 

that person, who is not even an employee, because they 

have some kind of injury could bring a claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but his point 

was that "aggrieved" includes not only injury but 

wrongfulness. It may not be very -- I don't know, but 

-- nice, but there's nothing wrongful about North 

American Stainless deciding it's not going to fund an 

animal shelter because of some other reason.

 MS. LATHEROW: But it's -- but it's treating 

Regalado with discrimination. It is treating her 

differently than it might treat another employee because 

she brought the cause of action. That would be 

discrimination against Regalado because it's treating 

her differently, but under their analysis -­

JUSTICE BREYER: But you couldn't win on 

that under Burlington. I mean, I think that there are 

three separate issues here that have to be kept 

straight.

 No one can win in court unless they show 

there was a human being -- in this case, the woman -­

who suffered material -- who suffered serious harm, 

serious harm. And serious harm is defined as materially 

adverse action which might well have dissuaded a

reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of 

discrimination. So unless she suffered that kind of 

serious harm, nobody wins.

 Then the next question is suppose, in the 

course of that, somebody else was hurt. And the person 

aggrieved provision suggests, because of the history of 

the word "aggrieved," that more than just she can bring 

the lawsuit. That's our first question.

 And then our third question is, if the 

second question is yes, why can't the whole world do it? 

At least the barber who doesn't get the haircut anymore 

because the person fired doesn't have any money or the 

landlord who can't get his rent or the -- you know, we 

can go on indefinitely. Okay?

second question?

 The second question is -- the word 

"aggrieved" has a history. I think it comes out of -­

what's the case? It's -- I think it comes out of FCC v. 

Sanders Brothers, which is a 1940 case, which said that 

sometimes where there's a statute using the word "person 

aggrieved," that that means that a person can bring a 

lawsuit even though that person does not suffer injury 

of the type that the statute was meant to prevent

in the Sanders case, the Court said that this term 

"aggrieved" means something broad, and it is intended to 

bring a lot of people in.

 But that case was interpreting the APA, 

which has specific language. Just like in Trafficante, 

the Court was considering the Fair Housing Act, both of 

which have very different -- than the statute in 

question. The APA says a person suffering a legal wrong 

because of an agency action or adversely affected or 

aggrieved by agency action within a meaning of a 

relevant statute is entitled to judicial review. And 

that's much broader than what we have in this case.

 So we have to be looking at whether 

prudential standing rules apply, and we know that 

Congress legislates against that prudential standing 

doctrine.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's broader. 

Why do you say it's broader? It says "adversely 

affected" -- "adversely affected" -- or "aggrieved 

within the meaning of the relevant statute." And it's 

that language that says, well, the statute was only 

meant to protect this group of people, and the fact that 

somebody else was incidentally harmed would -- would not 

be covered.

 I don't know why you say that's broader. If

anything, it's narrower than what we have here. We just 

say "aggrieved." It doesn't say within the meaning of a 

relevant statute. You want us to read that into it?

 MS. LATHEROW: Yes, I -- I believe it should 

be read into Title VII, because that's the term 

"aggrieved."

 If someone -- if my husband calls and says, 

oh, my gosh, we've been involved in a car accident, I 

don't say: Honey, are you aggrieved? I say: Honey, 

are you injured? And that's exactly -- exactly the 

definition of "aggrieved" in the Fair Housing Act.

 So Congress recognized, just 4 years later 

after Title VII was adopted, when it enacted the Fair 

Housing Act, and it defined "aggrieved" and said 

aggrieved means or includes any person who claims to 

have been injured. I mean, that's really -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not -- this is 

not an altogether novel question, because it has come up 

under some other statutes. You are suggesting that this 

is carrying "a person aggrieved" to new heights, but we 

have both the NLRB and we have OSHA, and both of those 

agencies have said that to take adverse action against a 

close relative is an unfair employment practice, and 

they've done that for some time; have they not?

this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the 

interest to be protected against had nothing to do with 

protecting competitors from competition. The Court says 

that. And it says: But here is a competitor trying to 

protect himself from competition; can he bring a suit? 

Well, normally not. But Congress used the word "person 

aggrieved" or "adversely affected," and, therefore, they 

can. Now, that's the precedent that -- that -- that's 

harmful to you. I'm not certain.

What about the third part? I have a 

suggestion, and I'd like your response, because I'm just 

playing with the thought: That the way to limit this is 

to say that where a person is being used, person B is 

hurt because -- in order to retaliate against person A, 

okay? That that is a person aggrieved where person B is 

being -- is hurt. The injury, the injury to B, not to 

A, is the means of hurting A. But where it is a 

consequence of hurting A, that doesn't fall within the 

statute.

 That gets rid of the bowling alley, it gets 

rid of the landlord, it gets rid of the shareholder, it 

gets rid of all the people who -- who are not the person 

retaliated against, but they suffer injury because he 

was retaliated against. It keeps the people who are 

being used as a means. They can bring the lawsuit.

 MS. LATHEROW: And, I'm sorry -- and your 

question is?

 JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, you set in 

motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the 

coworker, though that would be hard to get past 

Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to 

retaliate against A, B can bring the suit. But if B is 

a person who is injured only because you retaliated A, 

that really wasn't the means, B can't bring a suit.

JUSTICE BREYER: But there are -- I do -- I 

think that it isn't so hard to find, in some of the

instances where the only kinds of suits that have been 

allowed are where it was like a family member or was 

being used as a means, and there never have been cases

consequent injury. So it's quite possible I can be 

borne out, though I think your criticism is a pretty 

good one.

cases, for example, the Trafficante case, and the other 

cases under the APA where Congress has used this broad

for Thompson to come and say let's do what the EEOC says 

when he disagrees with it himself.

they can have -- bring a claim, at least engaged in some 

conduct, but Thompson has no protection under this 

statute. He could have very easily gotten the 

protection.

 In our joint appendix, we -- we've submitted

this memo, Congress says you would have gotten

discriminatory, he would have gotten protection.

 The -- the means by which employees get 

protection under the statute are not very difficult. 

All they have to do is to come forward and oppose. 

Thompson clearly had an avenue and a means to do that 

because he was taking -- he was taking action on his own 

behalf to complain. So Thompson wants to bring a claim 

under -- for Regalado, but he couldn't at that time come 

forward and step up to the plate and say to the 

employer, hey, I have a problem with this. But yet, he 

wants to come into court and to claim his rights -- or 

to claim her rights as a basis to bring this suit.

 According to the EEOC statistics, in 1992, 

when data first began being collected, 14.5 percent of 

charges filed with the EEOC were retaliation claims. By 

2009, that had risen by 31 percent.

 In the Chamber's brief on page 2, they 

submit -- or recite to a study that was published in 

1994 saying that the average cost to defend an 

employment litigation in 1994, when the study was 

published, was $120,000. In this case, what Thompson 

would propose is to give protected party to a wide range 

of people.

that is a lot of protection for people. And I can tell 

you that employers who are faced with someone in a 

protected party, they are -- employers are reluctant to 

take adverse decisions against them; they're reluctant 

to implement discipline; they will postpone implementing 

that decision because they know that at some point 

they're going to have to establish a legitimate 

nondiscriminatory reason.

 When we -- when we point out -- when we 

point this out in our arguments, the response by Eric 

Thompson as -- as to who gets the protection -- it's in 

his footnote on page 4 at his reply. He says that "the 

identity of individuals who might have a claim is a 

function of the employer's own intent."

 So, in other words, in order to determine 

whether someone has protection, you have to look at the 

employer's intent. So there are no protected parties 

anymore until the employer can establish that they had 

no intent -- or the other way. Everyone is a protected 

party until the employer can show that he had no intent.

think that the action that the employer took was 

retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words 

were -- was -- might well have dissuaded a reasonable 

worker from making or supporting a charge of 

discrimination.

 MS. LATHEROW: But the position that's set 

forward by Thompson is you determine whether someone is 

a protected party by looking at the intent of the 

employer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you'd have to show he 

had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true 

however he retaliates.

 MS. LATHEROW: That's true at trial, though, 

after a plaintiff gets past his initial burden of proof. 

And in this case the plaintiff is going to be able to 

establish their burden of proof solely by saying that 

they were a protected party and there was intent on the 

other side. That is going to shift the burden to the 

employer at the outset of the case to prove that there 

was no retaliation, that there was no intent.

Court of Appeals was correct. The Sixth Circuit 

determined that Eric Thompson, who was not discriminated 

against, had no protection under the statute. This 

Court clearly held in Burlington that the 

anti-retaliation provision of Title VII is designed to 

protect employees based upon what they do, based upon 

their conduct. In this case, Eric Thompson engaged in 

none of that behavior, he had no conduct, he did not 

come forward on behalf of anyone; yet, he is here asking 

for remedies, remedies that really should belong to 

Regalado.

 There's no reason that Regalado could not 

have brought this case. There -- if the concern is that 

employers are going to discriminate against employees, 

the response to that is employers will still be held 

liable and can still be held liable, and that is by the 

person who is discriminated against from bringing the 

suit.

 We ask that the Sixth Circuit Court of 

Appeals' decision be affirmed.

I was retaliated against, I can't just come in and say I 

engaged in protected activity and was fired. I would 

need more than that.

 So you would need that additional amount 

here, plus you'd also have to have some evidence to give 

rise to an inference that this third party was selected 

as a victim. So it wouldn't -- you could -- you could 

adapt it.

 But getting back to what was asked earlier, 

there's no question the burden of proof is on the 

plaintiff at all times to establish motive; and as we 

get particularly far afield from family members, someone

MR. SCHNAPPER: I don't -- I don't -- I 

think this Court's decision in Burlington Northern makes 

it clear that the plaintiff wouldn't have to be an 

employee. In that case, one of the questions was, could 

you retaliate against an FBI agent by not protecting his 

wife from being murdered? I think that would be a 

pretty good way to -- to keep people from complaining.

 But I think the Burlington Northern 

limitation would -- you know, would have some traction 

in these cases. The animal shelter seems unlikely.

 But the burden of proof is there. As the -­
