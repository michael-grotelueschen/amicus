 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-6911, Logan v. United States.

 Mr. Coad.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. COAD

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. COAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The provision at issue determines which 

convictions constitute a prior felony for imposition of 

the Federal firearms ban and its increased penalties. 

Its exemption clause prescribes certain ways in which a 

conviction that otherwise meets that definition is 

nevertheless exempt. Specifically, it looks to a 

State's indication that an offense is deprived of any 

continuing effect, such as whether the status of an 

offender's civil rights are the same after a conviction 

as they were before conviction.

 The issue before the Court is whether the 

statute should be read to exempt convictions for which 

civil rights were lost and later regained while at the 

same time not exempting a conviction for which civil 

rights were never lost, even though both -- in the end, 

both offenders have their civil rights following their

conviction.

 Congress's underlying objective in drafting 

the exemption clause was to ensure that Federal law 

respected a State's considered judgment that a 

particular offense should not subject a person to the 

Federal firearms law. The Seventh Circuit's 

interpretation, which counted convictions for which 

rights were never lost, fails to respect that judgment. 

It disregards the State's unequivocal indication to the 

Federal statute that an offender is worthy of fully 

participating in civic life.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you had a 

statute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't 

take away any one's civil rights, not even a first 

degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would 

be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away 

and then restored.

 MR. COAD: That's correct. And I think that 

the Government points to Maine as an example where no 

offenders lose their civil rights, but felons lose their 

gun rights and certain misdemeanants also lose their gun 

rights, but get that gun right back. And in States like 

Maine and in Vermont, the "unless" clause still applies 

and still precludes those types of convictions. So I 

think when the Government alleges that there are certain

anomalies that arise from our interpretation, it is 

simply not the case, and if they are anomalies that 

arise from our interpretation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not anomalies 

because the gun prohibition would cover them, even 

though they never had their civil rights taken away? Is 

that -- is that what you're saying?

 MR. COAD: Correct. We have to read the --

both clauses, the exemption clause and the unless cause. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coad, how are -- how 

are civil rights which have been taken away typically 

restored? What is -- what is the process for restoring 

them? Just if you don't commit another offense within a 

certain number of years?

 MR. COAD: It depends on the State. In the 

NACDL lodging that the Court has -- I believe 29 States 

were identified as having some type of restoration 

procedures. The majority of those, it is by automatic 

operation of law. So there's no subsequent conditions 

met by the offender.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but even -- even 

there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of 

time, and I would assume that there can be no felony 

committed during that interim period or the person's

sentence has to be served or something? It's ongoing, 

it's prospective. And so restoration has a real 

component, in that -- that is not present in the statute 

that we're faced with here.

 MR. COAD: Well, I think that there really 

isn't a difference between -- by operation of law, a 

State taking away someone's rights and giving it back or 

allowing a offender to retain civil rights --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it is of -- maybe no 

difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later.

 MR. COAD: It could be a matter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume that's not 

the case. I assume that there's in every case, as 

Justice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage 

of time that takes place.

 MR. COAD: It could be as short as 24 hours. 

In certain States if a probationer is convicted, rights 

aren't taken away. But if a felony offender is 

sentenced to even one day in jail those rights are in 

theory taken away for that one day and restored to that 

offender the minute he walks out of jail.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you can say, 

however, that -- that in the restoring situation, there 

is at least a greater individuation of the -- of the 

State's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of

the individual to be -- to be trusted with arms.

 That is to say well, this person has not 

committed an offense within so many years. Or maybe in 

some States, it may be an individual determination. 

That's why I asked you the question. Is it ever one by 

one, you apply to have them restored?

 MR. COAD: In a minority of States, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's --

that's a totally different thing from just a gross 

determination by a State that everybody who commits this 

crime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights.

 I think it's -- it's -- there's a greater 

degree of assurance when you're dealing with those 

States that -- that have some degree of individuation. 

At least this is an individual who hasn't committed an 

offense for so many years. Or in those States where you 

have to apply personally, I think they're different 

situations.

 MR. COAD: I -- I don't think they are, Your 

Honor. As I just mentioned there are States in which a 

day in jail, your rights are lost and restored. And 

there really isn't any difference between a broad 

legislative determination by a State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm 

suggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that

that's atypical.

 MR. COAD: No, it's not atypical. In 18 out 

of the 29 States identified in the NACDL lodging, rights 

are automatically restored. There's no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it's atypical to 

give a felon one day in jail.

 MR. COAD: Well, it could be a misdemeanor. 

There are certainly misdemeanors punishable by more than 

two years. In fact two of the misdemeanors at question 

here that were punishable by more than two years, my 

client did not serve a day in jail.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But a misdemeanor? I see.

 MR. COAD: So there are misdemeanors --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that --

I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose 

their civil rights.

 MR. COAD: It -- that's the assumption. But 

here we've identified in at least 12 States -- excuse 

me, 16 States misdemeanors punishable by more than two 

years or felonies, rights are retained.

 So there are States, for example, Maryland, 

where rights are lost for a misdemeanor punishable by 

more than two years.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But certainly the 

minority approach. In most States if you are convicted

of a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?

 MR. COAD: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument, if 

accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a 

majority of the States, weed out subdivision 

(a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)? In other words, there's 

coverage under the statute if you are convicted under a 

misdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil 

rights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered. 

Well, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to 

be covered.

 MR. COAD: Well, in, for example, Maryland, 

that's not the case. In many -- in 12 States, it is the 

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if I say most 

misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an 

answer to say, well, here's one State where they are 

covered. It's maybe 49 are not.

 MR. COAD: There really are only 16 States 

in total that have misdemeanors punishable by more than 

two years where rights are retained. We're not talking 

about a very big group to begin with. This certainly is 

an issue on the margins.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Coad, may I ask you a 

question that involves the comparison of what, for

shorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and 

Subsection (33). I take it, it is your position that --

and (20) applies here. But I take it that it's your 

position that under (33), your argument could not 

prevail because the language of (33) makes it clear that 

there's got to be a -- in effect, a revocation of the 

right first, before there can be a restoration within 

the meaning of that statute?

 You accept that?

 MR. COAD: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now that applies as I 

recall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there 

has been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence, 

is that correct?

 MR. COAD: It only applies in that instance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. If your position 

prevails, then Subsection (20), which applies to more 

serious offenses, would in effect be held to provide for 

a restoration when, in fact, nothing had been taken 

away.

 Whereas under (33), which applies simply to 

a relatively minor set of crimes in relation to (20), 

would not provide this relief. So you would have the 

anomaly that in the more serious cases, you would win. 

In the less serious cases, you would lose, because the

statute was more onerous. That's anomalous.

 And my point is, and this is what I want you 

to comment on, I'll assume for the sake of argument that 

you're pointing out an anomaly here if you just look at 

(20) alone. But if you look at (20) and (33), by going 

your way, we're going to create another anomaly, the 

other anomaly being that the more serious offense or the 

more serious offender gets better treatment than the 

less serious offender.

 So either way we go, there's going to be 

some anomaly. Am I right in reading it that way?

 MR. COAD: Well, in part. Congress was 

specific in 1996 when it enacted the Lautenberg 

Amendment, which was the genesis for the (a)(33) and the 

prohibition on firearms for misdemeanor crimes of 

domestic violence, it was very -- Congress was very 

specific that it thought those types of offenders were 

particularly dangerous. Whereas when you look at 

(a)(20), yes, it generally applies to felons and to 

misdemeanors punishable by more than two years.

 But in that group of people, you had varying 

degrees of seriousness. You could have embezzlement 

convictions --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But none of them is less 

serious in the classification of the crime than those

covered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of 

domestic violence.

 MR. COAD: I think what we have to look to 

here is Congress's clear choice in both. In The 

Firearms Owners' Protection Act for (a)(20), Congress 

wanted to provide a broad exemption for individual 

States deemed to be trustworthy. Whereas in (a)(33), 

Congress was legislating under a very different purpose, 

which was to target misdemeanor crimes of domestic 

violence as particularly dangerous offenders in relation 

to gun possession.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the State's 

judgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same 

in each case. So the trustworthiness criterion, it 

seems to me, is being -- would be applied differently in 

the two cases if we take your position.

 MR. COAD: It is. And I think that it is 

okay for the Court to decide that because of the very 

specific nature of only one type of offender in (a)(33), 

which Congress decided they didn't want them to possess 

guns. Whereas in (a)(20), The Firearms Owners' 

Protection Act had a very different purpose. It was to 

expand gun ownership to even felons who States determine 

to be otherwise trustworthy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there another

difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that 

Justice Souter has noted? You're argument under (a)(20) 

is that it would be absurd for Congress to take people, 

exempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not 

people whose rights were never taken away. That is 

exactly what Congress did in (a)(33).

 So if Congress thought it was all right even 

in albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be 

very difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to 

do it somewhere else.

 MR. COAD: Our absurdity argument you've 

identified for (a)(20) is more particular than that. It 

is when you look to a particular State, because again 

we're in the realm here of delegation or at least 

deferring to States this trustworthy judgment. It is 

within a particular State that a less serious offender 

as determined by that State ends up being punished more 

harshly than its more serious offenders.

 Whereas in (a)(33) you don't run into that 

problem. You accept the anomalies amongst the States. 

There are varying States -- ways to -- States handle 

these types of issues. But with (a)(33) you have one 

type of offender, and a State treats that offender in 

one particular way.

 You aren't comparing State by State. We

don't look to Wisconsin versus Louisiana to see an 

absurdity. We look within a particular State, for 

example, in Wisconsin to identify an absurdity. There 

certainly is an acceptance when Congress decided --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure about that? 

(33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems 

to me, within every State. Are you sure that in none of 

those crimes the civil rights are not taken away for 

some of them, but are taken away for others?

 MR. COAD: The difference here, I think, 

between (a)(20) and (a)(33) is that Congress was 

legislating under the assumption for a felony you're 

going to lose your civil rights. Whereas in (a)(33) 

Your Honor is correct. Typically misdemeanors 

punishable by nine months or up to a year, rights are 

not lost.

 And so I think that's the difference Your 

Honor is getting to. I'm not sure if I answered the 

question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to the 

in-State anomaly that you were talking about, the 

government argues on page 30 -- 29 and 30 of its brief 

that there really are only a few States where this 

exists, and even in those -- even in the States where it 

exists, there are very significant restrictions on the

ability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil 

rights.

 Is that incorrect?

 MR. COAD: I think it is incorrect in the 

sense that when the government sort of narrowed the 

number of States that we identified as being problem 

States, what it ignores is that the Armed Career 

Criminal Act and the prohibition against firearms goes 

back forever really. You have to look at all of State 

law for 1980s, '70s '60s.

 Now, the government argued, well, right now 

there are only a handful of States. That might be 

correct for now. But State laws have changed over the 

years. And so, we have to look back farther. So, it is 

a deeper problem than the government identified.

 And I think what's key is that we're talking 

about Congress separating dangerous offenders from those 

who are otherwise considered trustworthy by a particular 

State. And this Court has recognized this principal in 

both Caron and in Small. And when you are excluding 

from the protections of the exemption clause offenders 

for which a State has clearly identified as its most --

if you want to consider them its most trustworthy 

offenders, that is absurd.

 And it certainly offends the societal norm

that, all things being equal, we don't punish less 

serious offenders more harshly than we do more serious 

offenders.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then, maybe the 

problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who 

were subject to over a two- year sentence.

 The point has been made that, on your 

reading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one 

thing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another 

provision. And then they put in this group of 

misdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year 

sentence; but most of that group -- and in many states 

all of them -- would not have their civil rights taken 

away.

 So what is left of the group that was put 

in, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?

 MR. COAD: I'm not sure I understand Your 

Honor's question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the point of 

putting that group in the statute as covered by the 

Career Criminal Act?

 MR. COAD: Well, I -- I think the point is 

that -- that we can't ignore Congress's clear intent to 

exempt the -- the most trustworthy offenders in a -- in 

a given State. And that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how many would be --

take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun 

rights from misdemeanants.

 What effect in that State would this 

legislation have -- what effect would the provision of 

this legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are 

subject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered? 

It wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're 

not having their civil rights taken away.

 MR. COAD: Well, certainly, the Federal 

statute set a two-year floor, if you will. But I don't 

think that we should read the civil-rights-restored 

exception in isolation. I mean we have to make sense of 

Congress's choice to look to civil rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But does it make much 

sense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read 

(a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing?

 I mean, you know, why go to the trouble of 

putting in that provision if it's only going to make a 

difference in those -- in those very few States where --

well --

MR. COAD: Well, we're talking about very 

few States overall. I mean even the problem we've 

identified is certainly a limited one. We're talking 

about a dozen States, at most.

And so we can say, well, you know, it 

vitiates (B) because only two States are left that fall 

into (B). But when we're talking about the civil rights 

restoration provision as applying to rights retained, 

we're still only talking about a dozen States. So I 

don't think that that necessarily vitiates (B).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrased 

Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people 

the State has found trustworthy. But I don't think 

that's how this legislative process works.

 You have additional punishment, and then 

somebody says: Oh, let's not apply it to people who are 

convicted of antitrust violations. And you say: Yeah, 

yeah.

 And then somebody says: Let's not apply it 

to people whose civil rights have been restored. And 

they say: Fine.

 And then nobody pipes up and says: Well, 

let's not apply it to people whose civil rights were 

never taken away.

 In other words, it's not an intent that is 

not effectuated. It is just you want the intent to 

reach more broadly.

that rights would generally be lost for those serious 

types of offenses that it thought it was covering in 

(a)(20). And I think there is no evidence in the 

Congressional Record --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's based on a 

congressional mistake, in other words, about the 

breadth, but it still doesn't --

MR. COAD: It is an unthought-of application 

of the statute that -- that leads to absurd results, 

which, if we go with the government's interpretation, we 

frustrate Congress's intent with passing legislation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we rewrite statutes 

like that? Because, gee, look at this statute. 

Congress didn't think about this, and it makes a really 

bad result here. So we're going to add this -- this 

new -- I don't think that that's how we operate.

 MR. COAD: In the context of identifying an 

absurdity, it certainly strengthens the absurdity 

argument where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not that absurd if 

Congress did the same thing in (a)(33).

 MR. COAD: It's -- it's -- it might not be 

absurd in (a) (33). But Congress, when it showed that 

-- when it chose to limit the concept of restoration, it 

knew how to do so.

It was aware of three circuit courts 

evaluating (a)(20) to include rights retained, and so it 

did it there. But it didn't do it in (a)(20).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

securities law violations? (A)(20)(A)says this doesn't 

apply if it's an antitrust violation. Now, did 

Congress -- you could say: Well, they would have 

applied it to securities law violations, too. It's a 

business offense. They're not interested in that. So 

we should read this as applying to securities law 

violations.

 MR. COAD: I think that's different, because 

that's a separate type of violation; whereas, here we're 

talking about an area that Congress clearly identified, 

which is how a State treats the civil rights of its 

offenders.

 And you're also talking about, in most 

instances, a broad, legislative determination that a 

State decides: Well, we're not going to take them away, 

or we're going to take them away and give them back; but 

it has nothing to do with the offender. There is no act 

of forgiveness on the part of the State. It is just a 

broad, legislative rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That kind of begs 

the question for you to say Congress is worried about

offenders States think are trustworthy. What they 

actually said are, of course, offenders who have had 

their civil rights restored.

 Maybe if they focused on the question of 

whether or not civil rights were taken away in the first 

place, they would have made a different judgment, as 

they did, of course, in (a)(33).

 MR. COAD: Well -- and, again, in (a)(33) 

they did it for a very particular type of offender and a 

different type of offender.

 And I think, if you even just look at the 

NACDL lodging, the expansiveness of it and the amount of 

detail, none of that is in the Congressional Record. 

It's clear that Congress didn't consider exactly what 

was going to happen with the civil rights restored 

provision. They just assumed rights would generally be 

lost for those types of convictions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't -- under 

our precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your 

case: In other words, Congress didn't think about this, 

or they made a mistake in thinking about it?

 In either case it's clear that they didn't 

legislate with respect to it.

legislate with respect to civil rights. They just

didn't consider that this certain circumstance would 

exist. And it's -- and it's absurd to conclude that a 

less serious offender should be included within the 

Federal ban; whereas, a more serious offender should not 

as the State has determined.

 And I think if you look at it this way, too, 

the -- a State, in order to -- if the Court decides: 

Well, sorry, you're out of luck to civil rights 

retained, if a State wishes to have its less serious 

offenders avoid the Federal ban, it would have to treat 

them more harshly than it currently does in order for 

those offenders to be treated better under Federal law. 

And I think that that's an absurd notion.

 And I also -- I think -- I just want to give 

one what I think is the most clear example, which is the 

State of North Dakota. We're not talking about 

misdemeanors here. We're talking about felony 

convictions.

 In North Dakota the State has decided that 

if a felon is not sentenced to imprisonment, then the 

felon retains his civil rights, and his right to possess 

a firearm is restored after a short waiting period.

 Whereas, a felon who is convicted to -- and 

sent to prison, his rights are taken away and later 

restored. So we have the result here of the complete

opposite of what North Dakota intended, which is to 

treat the less serious offender accordingly and treat 

the more serious offender accordingly.

 And that's directly contrary to Congress's 

purpose in passing a firearm owner's protection act, 

which was in direct response to this Court's holding in 

Dickerson, which ignored a State's expungement of -- of 

a conviction, which, again, is another way of a State 

identifying an individual as trustworthy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, since you 

seem to have looked at it: In North Carolina, for the 

person whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is 

there any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by 

applying for clemency or a pardon or --

MR. COAD: In North Dakota -- in North 

Dakota you can apply for a pardon, I believe. I'd have 

to check, but I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be about the 

only way?

 MR. COAD: Yes. And so you're talking about 

requiring less serious offenders to seek, in some 

instances, extraordinary relief in order to get on the 

same footing as more serious offenders.

 And I -- and I would look to point to the 

example of Wisconsin and the offenses, in particular,

that we're talking about here.

 For a misdemeanor crime as a repeat 

offender, before 2003, it was punishable by up to three 

years. Now Wisconsin has changed that law, and it is 

only punishable by two years. So it would be exempt 

under (b).

 But Wisconsin allows that type of offender 

to retain civil rights and to retain the rights to 

possess a firearm. And, yet, under the government's 

reading and the Seventh Circuit's reading the Federal 

statute would ignore that determination by the State and 

would impose the ban on that individual and require that 

individual to get on the same footing as a felon to 

receive a pardon, which are generally not available to 

misdemeanants but are readily available to -- to felons.

 And so you are talking about a less serious 

offender having to seek extraordinary remedies under 

State laws -- and this, I think, is not just unique to 

the State of Wisconsin -- in order to put themselves on 

the same footing as a more serious offender as 

identified by that State.

 And if I can reserve the rest of my time? 

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We just have a two points. The first is 

that restoring a right does not mean leaving it alone, 

and the second is that the statute is not absurd. And 

for those reasons, Petitioner's prior offenses are 

violent felonies under the meaning of the act.

 The statute is clear on point. It says 

"restored," and restoring a right means giving back a 

right that has been taken away. It does not mean 

leaving a right alone. And though words can sometimes 

have different meanings in contexts, we are aware of no 

context in which "restore" was "leave alone."

 And this is certainly not such a context 

because the statute refers to a pardon, a set-aside, an 

expungement, or a restoration of rights. And the one 

thing that those four items all have in common is that 

there are ways which a State essentially undoes its 

conviction by relieving a defendant of some or all of 

the consequences of that conviction.

 Giving back rights that have been taken away 

as part of the conviction has that effect. Simply 

leaving the rights alone does not. And for that reason,

because the statute is so clear, the only question in 

this case is whether the scope of the statutory 

exemption is so absurd that this Court should take the 

liberty to amend it in order to add an additional 

exemption for defendants who never lost their civil 

rights in the first place. And the Court should not 

do so for numerous reasons. The first is that the 

absurd results canon applies only if it is clear that 

Congress could not possibly have intended the result of 

the plain statutory text.

 And as the Chief Justice pointed out, and 

Justice Souter did as well, we know from the subsequent 

enactment of the domestic violence misdemeanor provision 

that this result is not something that's beyond 

Congress's comprehension. Everyone agrees that Congress 

did in fact mandate the supposedly alleged absurd 

results in a closely analogous statute. And that's just 

fatal to the absurdity argument.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Everyone in this case. 

The point might be arguable in a case that involved that 

domestic violence statute.

 Everyone in this case. This case doesn't 

involve that other provision.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, that's true, but my 

point is just that on the face of the domestic violence

statute, and what it says is that the restoration of 

rights exception is limited to circumstances where the 

law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss 

of civil rights. So on the face of that provision --

the provision says restoration occurs only if civil 

rights have been lost. So it's clear as day that what 

Congress was saying there was it was mandating the 

allegedly absurd result here in situations where rights 

were not lost.

 And what that means is that you can't say 

that it's impossible that Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are cases in the 

pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.

 MR. JOSEFFER: There is -- in the context of 

subsection (33) -- in the context of the domestic 

violence misdemeanor provision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- there is one circuit that 

has applied -- that has basically overlooked the plain 

language there, not even attempted to deal with the 

plain language there. And it's true, and it's found 

that that exemption was somehow satisfied in a situation 

where civil rights were never taken away or restored. 

But the fact that, you know, a court of appeals reached 

that conclusion without even attempting to take a look

at the statutory language doesn't diminish the very 

plain meaning --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What court --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- of the statutory language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What court of appeals was 

that? I didn't get that.

 MR. JOSEFFER: It was the Sixth Circuit in 

the Burgin case, I believe it's called. And the Sixth 

Circuit there, similar to the First Circuit in 

construing this statute, was very clear that it was just 

skipping the language and doing what it thought Congress 

would have wanted to do if it had thought about it.

 But the plain language in the domestic 

violence provision is unmistakable because it expressly 

refers to civil rights --

JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress thought about 

the problem, what reason could they have for saying that 

the firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost 

his or her civil rights, but not -- but would not apply 

to someone who had civil rights restored? 

Automatically, let's say. Automatically and within a 

short period of time. What rationale reason could there 

be for doing that?

 MR. JOSEFFER: The reason is that Congress 

was balancing two policies. On the one hand, what it

was looking to do in this provision was to defer to a 

State's decision to essentially undo its conviction. 

And that applies where rights have been taken away and 

restored, but does not have anything to do with rights 

being left alone.

 On the other hand, and a couple of Justices 

already made this point as well, Congress wanted to 

apply the Federal firearms disability to serious 

felonies, to felonies punishable by more than two years 

of imprisonment, but if Congress had included a 

retention of rights exemption, that would have all but 

gutted the statutory prohibition on serious 

misdemeanants possessing firearms. And that's why, 

consistent with Congress's desire to get tough on 

firearms and impose the firearms disability on serious 

felons, it couldn't include a retention of rights 

exemption.

 So it's a situation where Congress had a 

couple of different policies. It clearly pursued both 

of them, and as a result, there is a seam, there is this 

anomaly that Petitioners have pointed to, but that's an 

inevitable consequence of Congress's desire to balance 

these two policies. And because that's an inevitable 

and probably foreseen result of Congress's intent, it 

doesn't call Congress's intent into question.

In addition, the scope of the anomalies here 

is really quite minor. There are -- if you -- read 

according to its plain language, there are a few States 

in which the Petitioner -- the anomaly the Petitioner 

points to occurs. It's currently about three States. 

It used to be about six States.

 On the other hand, if you take Petitioner's 

view, you create anomaly in a couple other States, which 

Justice Ginsburg referred to, whereby the most serious 

offenders, first-degree murderers, would not be treated 

as having their civil rights restored.

 But in all of these States, the effect of 

the anomaly is greatly reduced by the firearms exception 

to the restoration of rights exemption because in --

Petitioner's example was North Carolina, where he said 

that a more serious offender would be able to get 

firearms rights back promptly. I guess what he meant by 

"shortly" was that the offender could get them back 10 

years after completing the sentence if he had not 

committed further crimes.

 So the incidence of this issue is really not 

very significant. Instead, the real significance to 

departing from the plain statutory language would be to 

gut the statute as applied to misdemeanors punishable by 

tiers of imprisonment, which is contrary to Congress's

clearly expressed intent by including such misdemeanors 

within the scope of the statute.

 Petitioner has also argued at length that 

what Congress was looking at here was trustworthiness. 

Did the State find the defendant trustworthy to possess 

firearms? But we know, and this Court explained in 

Caron, that that's not what this provision goes to 

because the whole point of the Federal firearms laws is 

to prohibit firearms possession in some circumstances 

where at least some States were permitting it.

 So the fact that a State would let a person 

possess firearms is not relevant here. Instead, 

Congress was not deferring generally to the States' 

trustworthiness views but instead was looking to defer 

to their specific determination to essentially undo 

their own conviction. If a State wanted to undo its own 

conviction, Congress was willing to give effect to that, 

but that's the only thing it was deferring to.

 And it also bears emphasis that Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO: I can understand that 

argument where there's an individualized determination 

about each -- each defendant, but I don't quite 

understand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. That's --

matter. There's no substance to it, is there?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, there's still substance 

to the fact that rights were, in fact, taken away and 

were, in fact, restored, as opposed to someone having 

his rights all the time. There's certainly a 

substantive legal difference there, but as a practical 

matter, I mean one reason that Congress may have decided 

not to distinguish between automatic and individualized 

restorations of rights is simply that it didn't want to 

attempt to micromanage the States in how they would go 

about choosing to do a pardon or a restoration of 

rights. I mean -- and -- with respect to restoration or 

rights. Louisiana automatically pardons most first-time 

offenders. As this Court explained in Dickerson, of the 

States that expunge convictions, many of them do it 

automatically as well. And so Congress from -- because 

of what it was doing here was advocating Dickerson, was 

presumably aware of these points this Court had made in 

Dickerson regarding the great variance in the laws and 

the fact some of it was automatic.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Louisiana 

automatically pardons all first-time offenders?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Most.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not murderers, I assume?

 MR. JOSEFFER: I don't -- I think that they 

are not automatically pardoned.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, that's --

MR. JOSEFFER: In fact, this practice is 

enshrined in the Louisiana Constitution.

 But in any event, I think the point is just 

that Congress was going to defer to the States' decision 

to effectively undo their convictions, but was not going 

to micromanage how the States did it. But the most that 

one might determine from that point of view is that if 

you think that Congress was really thinking about an 

individualized determination, then what that would mean 

is that some offenders who get automatic restorations 

are currently essentially catching a break from the fact 

that they got an automatic one. But the fact that the 

plain language of the statute may give someone of the 

offenders a break is no reason to depart from the plain 

language of the statute, to give other offenders a break 

that Congress clearly did not intend.

 And, Justice Scalia, you asked about what's 

a typical restoration process. At the time the statute 

was enacted in 1986, of the States that did 

restorations, about half of them did it automatically 

and about half of them required individualized

consideration before returning at least one of the 

rights.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in the automatic 

category, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has 

been served?

 MR. JOSEFFER: There's some variance. In 

fact, the 50 States follow 49 different approaches to 

revoking and restoring civil rights. So there's an 

exception to just about anything in this area, which 

again underscores why anomalies are inevitable, and 

therefore don't really call Congress's intention into 

question.

 But the standard practice is that after a 

defendant has finished serving his sentence, and that 

would include not just maybe one day in jail but also 

the probationary period following that -- but after the 

defendant has finished serving his sentence, if 

restoration is automatic, it will either be at the 

conclusion of the sentence or at some time period 

thereafter, which in some instances can be significantly 

thereafter.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: At any time in 

consideration of these statutes did Congress consider, 

to your knowledge, perhaps making the test be the length 

of the actual sentence served rather than eligibility

for -- it seems to me one normal way of differentiating 

between those who are most trustworthy and those less 

trustworthy would be by looking at the actual sentence 

served.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think that's true. I guess 

there are two parts to that. One is that, I mean, the 

provisions at issue here about the length of sentence 

served, were in the statute before this amendment was 

made. They were in the statute before 1986. So they're 

not directly relevant to the intent of the '86 Congress. 

But I'm not aware of -- I mean, of legislative history 

predating 1986 in which Congress looked at the length as 

opposed to the maximum term. And also, one thing that 

reflects is that what Congress was not doing here was 

just looking to defer to the States' trustworthiness 

determinations as this Court explained in Caron. The 

whole point of this law was to get tougher on gun crime 

than many of the States were at the time.

 If the Court has no further questions?

First I would like to respond to my 

colleague's last point. He speculates that -- about 

legislate history and I think actually it is the exact 

-- exact opposite. Congress enacted a Firearm Owners 

Protection Act to broaden exemptions to the gun control 

act. There's no question about that, and it did so in a 

way that would respect State law decisions about who 

should be eligible for exemptions.

 And secondly, I was asked about -- by the 

Court about substantive difference between automatic 

restoration of rights versus a State automatically 

allowing an individual to retain rights. In many 

instances there's no passage of time. There are no 

additional conditions that an offender must meet in 

order to get that restoration. It is just as automatic 

as not having them taken away in the first instance.

 And I think my last point to the Court: If 

the meaning of restored in (a)(20) is so clear, as the 

Government says it is, then I don't know why Congress 

would need to have added language to (a)(33) to clarify
