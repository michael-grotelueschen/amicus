 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-1114, Cone v. Bell.

 Mr. Goldstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 As this case comes to the Court, two things 

I think are uncontested. The first is that at this 

trial, the prosecution suppressed all of the evidence in 

its files that went to the single most important 

contested issue of the case, and that's whether the 

defendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in 

an amphetamine psychosis.

 And the second is that as soon as the 

Petitioner found out about the suppression, he presented 

his Brady claim to the State courts. In this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is also a 

third thing that's uncontested, which is there is no 

Brady claim on the merits. That's not at all included 

in your question presented. The district court and the 

court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady 

violation on the merits. I don't know what would happen

if we sent this case back. They would conclude it 

again.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

there are a couple issues that you've raised. Can I 

first address the question of whether it's encompassed 

within the question presented on the merits, because the 

question is, well, is this all just an academic exercise 

because the procedural default holding wouldn't change 

the ultimate outcome in the case?

 The answer is that it is, we think, fairly 

encompassed within the question presented, and I can 

explain why, including with respect to the text of the 

question presented.

 The court of appeals in this case disavowed 

deciding the merits of the Brady claim. And let me take 

you to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a 

and again at 24a. So I'm just trying to walk you 

through what the court of appeals said at the very top 

of 22a: "We, therefore, will not disturb our decision 

that Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and 

not before this court."

 And then on 24a, at the bottom of the first 

full paragraph, the last sentence: "We again find that 

Cone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject 

Cone's request to reconsider his Brady claims."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't stop 

there. On page 25a, they've been talking about those 

federalism issues. They say: "We need not be delayed 

by these interesting questions of federalism, however, 

because in all events the documents discussed in the 

dissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not 

Brady material."

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I 

was not going to stop, and I was going to just point out 

the dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition.

 So, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding 

it, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a 

couple paragraphs there, you've start -- you've stated 

one, the next paragraph says the same thing -- talking 

about the merits of the Brady claim. So here's the 

dilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition. They 

say they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they 

talk quite clearly about it. So I expressed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't --

you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at 

all about the merits in the question presented?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I 

disagree, and let me explain why. If you go to the cert 

petition, of course, which you have in front of you, 

starting on page 26 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's start on 

page Roman xi, where the questions presented are. 

There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady 

claim. It's all about the procedural objections that 

you have.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and I --

the document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the 

text of the question presented, and then I'll give my 

explanation. So, the question presented it says is 

"Whether Petitioner is entitled to Federal habeas review 

of his claim that the State suppressed material evidence 

in violation of Brady v. Maryland?" We thought --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess what I 

would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim 

because the district court decided it on the merits and 

the court of appeals decided it on the merits.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

have explained why it is, and if I can then take you to 

the rest of the body of the cert petition. The doctrine 

that I'm going to rely on is the question -- the issue 

is, is it fairly encompassed within the question 

presented? So the dilemma I have described to you is 

the one I faced. The court of appeals said it wasn't 

deciding the Brady claim, then it talked about it.

 Then -- so, in the body of the cert

petition, which you all looked to in my experience in 

determining what's fairly encompassed, there are two 

headings for the reasons for granting the writ. The one 

is the procedural one. Then starting on page 26, we 

present the merits question of the merits of the Brady 

claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It seems to 

me you either did not raise the question or you did.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you did not, then 

we don't address the procedural issues that you raised. 

If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on 

the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we 

would not normally take without reaching those 

procedural issues. So, I don't see why the procedural 

issues are before us.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can 

I -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question 

about the body of the cert petition and then come to 

this? I'm glad to do it in whichever order. I do have 

a couple of important points to make on your very 

understandable question about what's fairly encompassed 

within the question presented.

 The particular place that I want to point 

the Court to, so starting on 26, we lay out our argument

about the merits, and then footnote 6 explains quite 

clearly to the Court -- the Court sometimes has a 

concern that parties are smuggling questions into the 

case in front of it, and that's clearly what did not 

happen here. We explain our dilemma about the Sixth 

Circuit saying it wasn't deciding the merits, and then 

footnote 6, because the panel -- this is on page --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where am I going to find 

footnote 6?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Footnote 6 at page 30 of the 

cert petition, sir.

 "Because the panel disavowed deciding the 

merits of Petitioner's Brady claim in the language that 

I quoted you to, and discussed the question only in 

dictum, Petitioner's counsel have concluded that it 

would not be permissible to state that issue as a 

distinct question presented."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our -- our cases 

clearly hold that when you have alternate holdings, 

neither one is dicta.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sir, the -- but it was 

disavowing it, I think, as an alternate holding. The 

court of appeals opinion is not clear. It disclaims the 

power even to decide the Brady claim.

 And if I can just finish the footnote, it

really is only two sentences long: "This Court could, 

of course, reach the issue either by directing the 

parties to brief it or by recognizing that it is fairly 

encompassed within the question as described in the 

petition."

 Then the brief in opposition to cert is only 

about the merits of the claim, and our reply brief on 

cert, if you go to page 4 of the cert reply brief, then 

clearly identifies this question for the Court again.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's fair 

for the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to 

take this procedural -- complicated procedural issue, 

because we win on the merits. And the court, as their 

view articulates, the court decided that question.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I agree it was 

perfectly fair for them. But the question that I'm 

trying to address, and I apologize if I've misunderstood 

the question, is did we sufficiently identify for you 

all in the question that we presented the Court what the 

issues were, and so that you were agreeing to decide the 

procedural question, the merits question, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how long has this 

case been going on? When -- when was -- when was the 

crime?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1980, August of 1980.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And when was the -- when 

was the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Very soon thereafter, within 

a couple of years.  This -- let me answer that and make 

sure that I've resolved --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you want to go back 

down again, for another --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How old is this -- is this 

defendant?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: He's around 50 years old 

now.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when -- when did the 

court indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to 

the file?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. In the Woodall case, 

12 years after the crime, Justice Scalia, so all the 

evidence was suppressed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I thought that was 

2000 -- when was that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 1992.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992 he was granted 

access to the files. He immediately stated, right away 

- it's uncontested -- his Brady claim. And then Justice 

Scalia, the case went on --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Brady claim has 

been pending in the Federal courts but just not decided 

since about 2001?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir. So there's no 

question about timeliness. Justice Scalia, your 

frustration about how long in this case is perfectly 

understandable, how long they take. But let me just be 

clear that this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was -- it was 

decided. It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first 

time around? I mean, the Chief Justice calls your 

attention to page 25a. The reason the court said 

they're not Brady material -- we said it before, we said 

it the last time the case was before the court.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I took Justice 

Kennedy's question to be that this has been in the case 

all along and hasn't been finally resolved, there isn't 

a final judgment. You're quite right that, as the Chief 

Justice pointed out, there is language in the court of 

appeals' very first opinion in the case. There is 

unfortunately only one sentence, but to be fair there is

a sentence in the first opinion saying that it's not --

that Brady evidence is not material.

 But I -- I did want to come back to why this 

has been in the courts for so long. When he presented 

it immediately, Justice Kennedy, to the State courts, 

the State told the State courts that it had been 

previously determined. It -- it no longer defends that. 

It just wasn't true. And that caused the whole thing to 

go off the rails, because we have been trying ever since 

the day that we got access to the materials to get one 

full adjudication of the claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it's -- my 

questions and the questions and the points --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that was raised 

about the time are related, because one reason these 

things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly 

why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural 

nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time 

ago in the State courts. But since then the Federal 

courts, both the district court and the court of appeals 

have addressed it, and -- and that that's a good 

jurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a 

complicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's 

our answer on this, but so that we don't have to go

through this again, if we're reversed on that, here's 

our -- our alternative holding; and they said right 

after the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we 

now say it again: This is not Brady material.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. So, Mr. Chief 

Justice, it seems to me, though you and I might disagree 

on what's fairly encompassed, we might have one piece of 

common ground, and that is it's time to bring this all 

to a close; that there really isn't a big benefit to 

having Cone 4 and 5, and that's actually what we have 

asked the Court to do. Now we are not --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought what you asked us 

to do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and 

remand the case.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- we do do that. We 

also say, however, that if the Court believes that the 

Sixth Circuit has reached the merits, then this Court 

should address what are the undefended -- the -- what 

the Sixth -- the State does not contest are legal errors 

in its assessment of the merits. The Kyles --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would -- that 

would then depend on us agreeing to review a very 

fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when 

the questions presented focused on a procedural issue.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first of all, Mr.

Chief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of 

errors that we think exist with respect to the Brady 

claim. I'm not avoiding the question of whether it's 

encompassed, and I'll come back to it. But to your 

first point, we do identify what we think are clear 

legal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a 

holding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that 

debate, we explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split 

the evidence into sort of four different silos or 

categories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v 

Whitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to 

hold an evidentiary hearing.

 Now, those aren't fact-bound points; those 

are questions of law, so we believe that it would be 

perfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the 

procedural question. The procedural holding of the 

Sixth Circuit is not defended here, the idea that 

previous determination amounts to a procedural default. 

And then on the question of the merits, the Court could 

decide those two limited legal questions and leave it to 

the lower courts to decide the more fact-bound 

questions.

 But we do think that the Court -- it is 

actually quite sensible for this Court to not justify 

the procedural question, given that it's a very weak --

call it holding, call it dictum -- the Sixth Circuit has 

sent strong signals about what it views regarding the 

merits of the Brady claim.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That seems to me to be 

directly contrary to what you say in your brief. The 

last sentence of your brief: "This case can accordingly 

be properly resolved more narrowly by remanding the case 

to the district court for consideration of the merits of 

the Brady claim in the first instance."

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir, that -- that is 

something that the Court can do. We explained in the 

preceding pages what would happen in the district court, 

and that is we think that there needs to be an 

evidentiary hearing and that the -- the Court should 

point out the Kyles error. But in all events, that 

would still be a sufficient ground for reversal. But I 

think we could all agree --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question 

about -- on the procedural default issue?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you -- could you put 

yourself in the position of the Tennessee Court of 

Criminal Appeals? In light of the briefing that they 

received, if you had been on that court, would you have 

understood that Petitioner was asserting that he had a

valid reason for not raising the Brady claim earlier, 

because he had not -- at the time when he could have, at 

the time of the prior proceedings, he had not had access 

to the State records? Would you have understood that 

from the briefing that they got?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would have, although I 

would have -- I understand your concern about whether it 

was fully elaborated and sufficiently so. This of 

course was not the procedural default theory that has 

been argued in this case before now.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Was that mentioned in -- in 

either the principal brief or the -- or the reply brief, 

the reason why it wasn't raised earlier?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Insofar as the defendant, 

Mr. Cone, told the court of appeals as to paragraph 35 

and 41, the court of appeals should look at the 

affidavit. It did not say what the contents of the 

affidavit was as to the Brady claim.

 Now, I will point you to one particular 

point, Justice Alito, on the question of whether we 

fairly preserved this in the State Court of Criminal 

Appeals -- I guess two points that hopefully will give 

you some comfort there.

 The first is that in the entire long course 

of this litigation, the State has never before made this

argument; and the second is in the Tennessee Supreme 

Court -- the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decides 

the case. We take the Brady claim up to the Tennessee 

Supreme Court. And even there the State doesn't say 

that it was insufficiently preserved. They file a 

response to our application and they address it as to 

its substance.

 They never made this argument even in the 

State courts. So I think it -- it could have been 

better briefed. The reason -- by the way, let me just 

explain to you why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many claims were -- was 

this a case where there, what, 81 separate claim counts?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- it -- I don't think 

there were --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I can understand 

giving a lick and a promise to -- to each one if you 

come up with 81.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 52.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 52. Close enough. I'll 

say the same for 52.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- but when we got to my 

point in the Tennessee Supreme Court, there was much 

less action in the case. The Brady claim was point 

three, there was a lot less that was presented in the

case.

 Look, I don't think -- my point is not to 

say that the State, you know, inexplicably behaved 

horribly here. There could have been better briefing on 

both sides of this thing. What I'm saying here, though, 

is that the Petitioner right away presented what is a 

very serious Brady claim to the State courts. He didn't 

abandon it; he fully presented it; and what he wants is 

one shot.

 There is a footnote in the district court's 

opinion. There are two, three sentences in the second 

opinion and one sentence in the first opinion of the 

Sixth Circuit. But nobody has sat down and done this 

and disposed of the merits of this claim as anything 

other than a -- an aside, and it is a very serious 

claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --

can you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that --

that you have -- had an initial Brady claim that there 

was one part of the file that you were entitled to see 

that said that there is some evidence that he's a drug 

addict -- user. And you take that Brady claim up.

information that he was dazed or something, which may 

not be very -- what's our test to determine whether the 

Brady claim has been exhausted?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Uh --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or have we talked about 

that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, this is, I think, 

similar to the Bell v. Kelly question, the case that the 

Court did on when you present a Brady claim and the 

State courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim, 

and then you find out other material later, and the 

question becomes, how much deference you owe to the 

State courts the first go-around.

 This is a very different case. The -- all 

of this evidence in the file appeared at one time. 

There weren't -- it wasn't split, and the only time a 

Brady claim was disposed of was at the time this Brady 

claim was disposed of. After the Woodall files that you 

mentioned became available to the Petitioner, right then 

and there, he added -- there was paragraph 35 and 

paragraph 41 of his post-conviction application that 

were added within a couple months of each other. The 

State court right away, at the urging of the State, 

said, oh, that's been previously determined, and I won't 

consider the merits.

So this is not a case in which the State 

court has assessed a Brady claim and said we don't think 

there's any Brady issue here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your proposal would 

be that they would never do it because you want to send 

it back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and 

if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it 

thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he 

had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that 

didn't make sense.

 But now you're proposing that the State 

court will not be the one to look at these materials; 

instead it will be the Federal court. I think there was 

something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that 

indicated he thought that the State court ought to be 

the one to do this close examination. Didn't -- didn't 

he propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal 

court pending exhaustion of that claim in the State 

court?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know that he made a 

concrete proposal. I think he would prefer -- I think 

the court system would prefer it, and I think everyone 

would prefer it. The dilemma is that it can't happen. 

As we explain in footnote 3 at page 26 of our reply 

brief, there is no window of opportunity to send the

State -- the case back to the State. It's been 

dismissed there. The statute of limitations has run. 

And in a case called Harris v. State, the Tennessee 

Supreme Court said that you couldn't reopen it.

 And so we -- we're not saying we want a 

Federal judge rather than a State judge. We're just 

saying we want a judge, and our problem is that, 

understanding that there has been some discussion of the 

merits, it has been very thin --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't look, 

counsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your 

predecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the 

district court here to the court of appeals. Did that 

raise a discussion of the Brady claim on the merits, 

saying that the district court was wrong?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did. And so we have 

-- we did try to present it to the Sixth Circuit. The 

Sixth Circuit accepted a finding of procedural default 

that is undefended in this court, and I did want to -- I 

had just started to get to this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was 

not a friendly question. My point is that you argued 

the merits of the Brady claim not only in the district 

court but specifically on appeal as well.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly

question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this wasn't sort 

of sua sponte addressing --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the Brady claim 

as kind of a safety net on the procedural --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly 

question, but it was an honest answer.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And we did present the 

question to the court of appeals. We think when it said 

we don't have the power, it was disavowing it. But even 

-- Mr. Chief Justice, even assuming that the court of 

appeals had a whole section in its opinion saying, we're 

deciding the merits of the Brady claim, my constraint 

was, in framing the question presented, as I explained 

in that footnote in the cert petition -- and I would 

also encourage you to read, I didn't get to the language 

in it, in our reply brief. We have a whole paragraph 

that explains -- this is at page 4 -- "First, even if 

this Court were to conclude that the court of appeals 

had reached the merits of Petitioner's Brady claim, 

notwithstanding the Sixth Circuit's own repeated 

disavowals of doing so, then the merits of that Brady 

claim ruling would be properly before this Court, not

immunized from review. Indeed, the Brady issue, as 

encompassed within the questions presented, would be 

properly briefed by the parties if certiorari were 

granted."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. No, my -- my 

concern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it 

is that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for 

"smuggled" it in -- is you smuggled it in on a case that 

purportedly presented a procedural objection and a 

conflict on a procedural issue.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's -- I don't think, 

pejorative or not, that it's fair to accuse us of 

smuggling it. There's a big section in the cert 

petition about it. It's not -- it was not hidden from 

-- I don't -- I don't purport to tell the Court what it 

was thinking when it granted cert in this case, but I 

tried to be as clear as absolutely possible.

 I was turning to the question of whether we 

have a serious Brady claim and so the Court should have 

some concerns here, and I really do think that we do and 

that the passing observations about the lower courts 

don't fulfill the duty to assess the merits of the Brady 

claim fairly. There was one -- the action in this case, 

the whole reason that there was effectively a trial, was 

the question of whether the defendant committed these

acts in an amphetamine psychosis. He had two experts 

that explained, because of his post-traumatic stress 

disorder and his very heavy drug issue, that he did not 

understand the consequences of his action. He was 

completely paranoid.

 And the State went after those experts by 

saying he is not a drug user at all; he's a drug dealer; 

when all the while in their files, there were -- Justice 

Kennedy, to distinguish the hypothetical you gave -- FBI 

teletypes, police reports, witness statements from 

before the day of the robbery, soon thereafter in 

Florida, explaining that he was not just a heavy drug 

user, but was acting -- the witness was asked, Did he 

act like he was on drugs? And the witness said, yes, he 

did. That that really would have made a difference in 

at the very least the sentencing phase in this case to 

at least --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that colloquy? 

I remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked 

wild-eyed. Where was the answer that he looked --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, this is in 

the yellow brief, our merits reply brief. It starts at 

the very bottom of 21, but you can just start at the top 

of 22.

here about the evidence, not just that he was a drug 

user, which, I think, would have been relevant to the 

jury, but that he actually was on drugs in August of 

1980 at the time all this was happening. There's a 

robbery -- there are two robberies here that precede 

these killings, and there's a -- the first one, there's 

a statement about the robbery right before the murders 

confirming that the Petitioner -- he was asked, Did he 

appear to be drunk or high? And the witness said, yes, 

he did because "he acted real weird."

 The next one is that the day of the -- at 

the jewelry store robbery that immediately preceded the 

killings, that the Petitioner looked wild-eyed, and then 

soon thereafter a police officer reports in Florida that 

he looks "agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied 

manner."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, I'll give 

you the first, that he appeared drunk or high. That's 

pretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed 

after you're running out after a jewelry store robbery, 

and I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look 

"agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied manner" when 

you've just committed two brutal murders. I don't think 

that's evidence of drug addiction at all, of being under 

the influence of drugs.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't doubt for a 

second that that's exactly the argument that the 

prosecution would have made. The question is whether a 

juror, in the context of the expert testimony and the 

evidence about drug addiction, could have also found 

that it was consistent with the idea that he was high on 

drugs, whether you can have confidence in saying now --

particularly if you'll give me the first statement. And 

all the FBI teletypes and the police reports that said 

-- remember this is not just a case about suppression of 

evidence. This is a case where the prosecution, with 

all this stuff in its files, goes after the experts and 

argues to the jury that he's a drug dealer, not a drug 

user.

 JUSTICE ALITO: This is a very complicated 

factual question, isn't it? We're dealing with numerous 

documents, isn't that right, that you claim are --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are key witness 

statements, and there are a series of police reports and 

FBI --

JUSTICE ALITO: And so you would have to 

evaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against 

what was in the record, and you're suggesting now that 

this is something we should decide?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two points, Justice Alito.

The first is that we say at the very least the Court 

should make the Kyles point and the evidentiary hearing 

point. And the second is, I think to be fair to us, 

given your point about this is so complicated, there is 

a lot of evidence here, one ought to compare that in 

fairness to what the Sixth Circuit did, and the one 

footnote that the Chief Justice has talked about with 

the district court and whether they really did take a 

hard look at the claim. I think it would be fair to us 

to say, look, there are some legal errors here that this 

Court can correct, and then the district court would be 

the proper place, if it decides to have an evidentiary 

hearing, to resolve the remainder of the claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask just one quick 

question: Is it your view that the evidence was 

deliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Deliberately suppressed, 

although it doesn't matter under Brady. There was --

they turned over almost nothing, and this was the heart 

of our case. They knew that we were conceding that the 

acts had been committed, and our defense was one of 

insanity, and it was our only argument in mitigation of 

the death penalty.

 If I could --

defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs, 

that isn't ambivalent? I mean, a jury, just like it 

might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was 

drunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person 

who put himself in this condition where his will could 

be overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we 

consider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we --

we could just as well consider it aggravating?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it could, and that's 

why I think it's very important that our defense was 

amphetamine psychosis brought on by post traumatic 

stress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not 

just that he was a target.

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 Ms. Smith.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As the Court has alluded in a number of 

questions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit 

now twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady 

claim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in 

light of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the

murder, his statements about what he did and why he did 

it, and more importantly the lower court's recognition 

that additional evidence --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- let me get 

something on the table. Do you agree that the evidence 

shows that this evidence was deliberately suppressed?

 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think 

there's been any -- any finding about the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any 

explanation for -- was there any explanation for it 

other than the tactical explanation?

 MS. SMITH: There's no explanation in the 

record, there has been no finding about whether the 

evidence has been suppressed at all in this case because 

both the district court and the Sixth Circuit decided as 

a matter of law that the materials --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be relevant 

because if it was suppressed for tactical reasons, it 

seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it 

didn't make any difference.

 MS. SMITH: Well, again, there has --

there's been no finding on that, because each court, and 

I think more than just in a passing statement, each 

court that looked at it, both the district court and the 

Sixth Circuit, have looked point by point, especially in

the district court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What they -- one of the 

first questions always troubles me in a Brady case is 

the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the 

profession, the whole -- whole importance of the rule is 

to be sure prosecutors perform their public function. 

And I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a 

case of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing, 

but if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a 

tactical program, it seems to me very difficult to 

assume that the prosecutor thought it was really not 

important evidence.

 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I certainly 

understand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and 

again reiterate, there has not been any finding on that, 

but there is at least a suggestion in the record that 

some of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying 

at this point actually wasn't suppressed. And we noted 

this in our brief, specifically as to the witness Ilene 

Blankman.

 All of the individual items on which the 

Petitioner is traveling now were the subject of 

cross-examination, so that at least raises the question 

about whether --

concern. The concern is simply this: If they're 

correct, that this whole trial revolves around whether 

this individual is suffering post traumatic stress 

disorder with these amphetamines.

 They have two expert witnesses who say that 

he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted 

them to say; that's it. That's their evidence.

 On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them 

to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the 

defendant told them about his drug use. At which point 

the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the 

arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you 

arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on 

drugs? No.

 Let's talk to Mr. Flynn. When you processed 

him, did he look like he was on drugs? No. And then 

let's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay?

 So, now the case is submitted, and at that 

point the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he 

was on drugs. He said that. Two, those two expert 

witnesses, and it's baloney. There's your case.

 Now, in fact in the files is evidence that 

Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day, 

sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous 

drug user. There is evidence in the files that Mr. --

that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins. 

There are three witnesses who have described the 

behavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the 

descriptions.

 And you're saying that the lawyer, the 

trained lawyer for the government, who knew this 

information and knew the defense just what? Just 

overlooked it by accident? Just what?

 MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I can't speak 

for the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I 

will -- will state that the central question in the case 

was not whether the Petitioner used drugs. There was 

evidence in the record from his mother, there was 

evidence in the record from his own mouth --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He was conceded that he was 

a drug user.

 MS. SMITH: That's exactly right. It came 

through the State's own --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that he was dangerous 

because he admitted the murders.

 MS. SMITH: It came -- some of that came 

through the State's own witnesses. And -- and the 

argument the State made about him being a drug user 

versus a drug seller was not the only argument the State 

made. The State specifically said look at -- to the

jury, look at what he did on the day of the murders, 

look at what he did on Saturday and Sunday to go to his 

state of mind. And the State focused on the -- the goal 

oriented, the purposeful behavior and the very direct 

behavior --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the 

material described by Justice Breyer would have been 

excluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been 

introduced, or cumulative as --

MS. SMITH: I don't think it would have been 

excluded. I think it could have been used to attempt to 

cross-examine certainly Agent Roby. But Agent Roby's 

testimony didn't -- didn't state that Mr. Cone was not a 

drug user. Mr. Roby -- Agent Roby's testimony was that 

at the time that he observed him, four days after the 

murders, he didn't appear to be on -- under the 

influence of drugs, and when he saw him eight days after 

the murder, he examined his body and there were no 

needle marks.

 The testimony was very specific as to his 

observations on the four-day point and the eight-day 

point as to the murders.

 Same with Agent Flynn --

the material -- if the subject was immaterial --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's a simple question, 

yes or no?

 MS. SMITH: I think that as a legal matter 

there was no -- no need to turn it over because it was 

immaterial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question. 

Can you answer my question? Did he have an ethical duty 

to turn this material over?

 MS. SMITH: I'm unaware of any ethical 

requirement that he turn it over, and I don't think 

that -- and certainly under Brady if it's not material, 

we don't think it was material, then it's certainly not 

required as a constitutional matter. And the reason is 

not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You believe that the 

materiality judgment is yours to make, the State's to 

make as sort of a gate keeping measure? Isn't the 

materiality an issue for the fact finder?

believe that you can, in effect, suppress any piece of

 MS. SMITH: I think prosecutors make those 

kind of judgment calls all the time.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think that's a 

proper judgment for the prosecution to make?

 MS. SMITH: Well, I think that probably a 

prudent prosecutor would err on the side of turning over 

matters that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And --

MS. SMITH: -- have some relevance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't -- wouldn't he err 

on the side of turning over the matters because Brady 

leaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality 

judgments, ultimately, to the fact finder?

 MS. SMITH: Certainly ultimately it's left 

to the fact finder, but the prosecutor is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, initially Brady 

leaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's 

point, to the attorney for the defense. You're saying 

that the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney 

for the defense in deciding what to offer to the court 

as material? And if -- and if -- and if -- even if the 

evidence is in a gray area, that's for the defense 

attorney to decide under -- under our Brady

the defense ultimately would make the decision how to 

use the evidence that comes into his possession. But 

obviously, the prosecutor has to make an initial 

judgment call about whether or not the evidence is going 

to be material, given what he knows about -- about the 

defense.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the prosecutor's 

obligation to make an initial assessment as to whether 

the evidence tends to be mitigating evidence or 

favorable to the defendant? Isn't that the prosecutor's 

judgment?

 MS. SMITH: I think that -- that falls 

within that -- the prosecutor's judgment. But I think 

if we look -- look at the evidence in --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't this evidence clearly 

of a mitigating character?

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't think -- you 

don't think it would be favorable to the defendant 

getting the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized a 

moment ago?

 MS. SMITH: No, sir, I do not. There was

already evidence before the jury that the defendant was 

a drug addict, that he was a drug user, that he was 

changed after Vietnam. This Court's own opinion in 2002 

noted that he was a drug addict.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I'm being -- but 

Justice Breyer made the point, and made it, I think very 

clearly, that although that evidence was in, the 

argument here -- the argument that was made before the 

jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the 

defense was specifically relying, were witnesses whose 

account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the 

defendant himself.

 Given that fact, wouldn't it have been 

mitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times 

relatively close to the events in question, without 

being coached by the defendant, had concluded that he 

was a drug user? Wouldn't that have been mitigating 

evidence?

 MS. SMITH: I don't think that it would have 

been material to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We are not asking about 

materiality at this point. We are asking about the 

mitigating character of the evidence. Would it have 

been favorable to the defendant? Would that have been 

its tendency?

MS. SMITH: I think it added no more than --

than what was already before the jury.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That was not my question. 

Was it favorable evidence? Did it have a tendency to 

favor the defendant?

 MS. SMITH: No, not under his theory, and 

the reason is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I will be candid with 

you that I simply cannot follow your argument because I 

believe you have just made a statement to me that is 

utterly irrational.

 MS. SMITH: Well, let me explain if I -- if 

I may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is 

because the -- the entire question in the defense and 

for mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind 

at the time of the murder.

 There was already evidence that there was --

that he was a drug user. The fact that he was a drug 

user doesn't say anything more -- or additional evidence 

of drug use says nothing more about his state of mind at 

the time of the crime than what was already presented. 

The question is not whether he was a drug user. The 

record showed it. It came out of the mouths of the 

State's own witness.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the

prosecutor who said "baloney." He said the prosecutor 

-- the prosecutor says: The defendant tells you he was 

a drug user.  Baloney, he was a drug dealer.

 The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint 

this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs, 

which he did, and he was dealing in them. I mean the --

the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold-

blooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision.

 And that line to the jury, "baloney" -- he 

says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is 

exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to 

tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug 

abuser.

 MS. SMITH: I think that the prosecutor 

overstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You also had cross-examined 

the two expert witnesses in order to show that they 

didn't really know that this man was a drug user, 

because their only basis for that was he told them. So 

as I've read these briefs, I've come away concluding 

yours with a strong impression that this was a relevant 

issue. That the prosecution did not concede that he was 

on drugs at the time of the murder. Indeed, that that 

was all that was at issue.

 And so I just don't see, like Justice

Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be 

useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and 

I think more than that since you have three direct 

witnesses.

 But leaving that aside, there's another part 

of this case that equally bothers me. It seems to me 

there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told 

the courts that this matter had never been raised. Is 

that so? Or maybe he said that the courts had decided 

it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent 

positions, first saying that the trial courts decided 

it, and they did decide it, but by accident. They 

thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it 

referred to an earlier claim.

 So first they tell the courts -- and you 

wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar 

because there were a lot of words written. They tell 

the courts: It's been decided, judge. Don't worry. 

They decided it: Adequate State ground. And next they 

wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then 

they announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that 

there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says 

that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for 

not knowing of it in the first place. And he didn't 

know of it until 1993.

So I see the State taking opposite 

positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs 

inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused. What 

is it that happened in this case?

 MS. SMITH: Well, I -- I want to answer your 

question, and I will answer your question, Your Honor, 

if I could just say one thing about the Brady. We don't 

dispute that the material in question is relevant to the 

defense and is relevant to the sentence.

 We dispute that it's material. We don't 

think it's material in every court where the district 

court and the sixth circuit have found it immaterial. 

But on the -- on the -- the -- what has happened in 

terms of the procedural defense, we have confessed that 

there was an error by the State in the -- in the post-

conviction court.

 We agree that Tennessee law does allow -- it 

certainly at -- at this time did allow a petitioner to 

raise -- to -- to file successive petitions if that 

petitioner could establish cause. Now, the prosecutor 

in the course of responding to some 80 claims, both 

parts and subparts, made a mistake and read paragraph 35 

as being similar to -- to a claim that had been raised 

on direct appeal and argued that it appeared to be the 

same. That was an error.

Likewise, the trial court erroneously ruled 

that both paragraph 35 and paragraph 41, both Brady 

claims, had been previously determined on direct appeal 

or post-conviction. That was an error. We have 

confessed that in our brief and -- and do at this point.

 Now, in the appeal the petitioner doesn't 

again raise the Brady claim. In his principal brief he 

never mentions the Brady claim. He never even reaches 

JUSTICE ALITO: If we read the -- can I ask 

you this: If we read the decision of the Court of 

Criminal Appeals as having ratified the -- the district 

court's -- the -- the lower court's treatment of the 

procedural default issues, having rejected it on the 

ground that it was previously decided, that would be an 

instance in which a State court applied a procedural 

default rule based on an undisputed error of fact.

 In that situation, would it not -- wouldn't 

it be clear that there was not an adequate, independent 

State ground for the decision; and, therefore, no 

procedural default? And if we were to find that, 

wouldn't the appropriate step be on this very factual 

Brady issue to send it back to the lower federal courts?

 MS. SMITH: In answer to your first 

question, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition

that if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to 

consider a claim on the basis that that claim has been 

determined previously, that that would not be an 

adequate basis for a procedural default in Federal 

Court.

 But we don't -- I don't think that this case 

presents that scenario, and every court that has looked 

at the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision has read 

that decision as applying a waiver. The District Court 

read that decision as applying a waiver. If you look at 

-- at page 112-A of the petition appendix, not only does 

the District Court read it as a waiver, but the 

Petitioner read it as a applying a waiver. Because as 

you note in that first sentence, as to the Brady claim 

to the district court, Cone also attempts to argue that 

those claims were improperly held waived by the court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, "waiver," my 

goodness. First, I don't think it's impossible to say 

"waiver" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that 

make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it. He 

is raising it.

 Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the 

district -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they 

were already decided or waived. So it's ambiguous, at 

best, for you.

So let's go back and see what the State 

district court held, and I think that the State district 

court held that it had been decided, not that it had 

been waived. Am I right?

 MS. SMITH: The trial court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MS. SMITH: -- held that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So there the cases 

in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes 

a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so 

you don't know whether it was decided: For example, 

they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided, 

then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is 

look to the lower court to see what they actually did.

 So we follow that rule, and we get to 

exactly what justice Alito said: That what they did was 

they were holding that this has already been decided.

 MS. SMITH: I think that rule holds if the 

petitioner has made the argument to the appellate court. 

Here the Petitioner didn't make the argument to the 

appellate court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you think at this 

point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs: 

I've been getting the runaround. First, they tell me 

it's one thing; then they tell me another. All I can

tell you is this: No one has ever passed on the merits 

of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.

 MS. SMITH: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you choose the 

procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.

 MS. SMITH: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

I don't think the Petitioner has been getting the 

runaround. The Petitioner has always throughout this 

litigation proceeded on the premise that the CCA -- the 

Court of Criminal Appeals's decision in Tennessee was 

based on a waiver. All of his briefs in the lower court 

and in the -- the sixth circuit reflect that.

 The District Court proceeded as if that 

ruling was a waiver. The sixth circuit in its 2001 

decision, if you look at page 62-A and 62 -- 63-A at the 

bottom, the -- the sixth circuit specifically said the 

Tennessee waiver rule is plainly applicable to the Brady 

claim. And the Tennessee courts explicitly relied on 

the waiver rule.

 It wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the --

the sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous 

determination, and only then in response to what I think 

was a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion 

that somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's 

decision stood for something different than what the

parties and the courts had been reading it all along. 

The Court of Criminal Appeals --

JUSTICE BREYER: Could the explanation of 

this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the 

State first argued that it had already been decided; 

then in later courts the State changed its theory and 

announced that it had been waived?

 MS. SMITH: The State --

JUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that why they're 

writing about waiver?

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The State has 

consistently maintained throughout the habeas that the 

-- that the Brady claim was either defaulted or waived. 

In the answer to the petition, the State presented the 

very argument that they're presenting today, that the 

Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver. In the --

in the brief to the Sixth Circuit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Spell out the waiver in 

light of what he said. The first time he learns that 

these -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to 

the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas, 

State habeas petition in which he said that the facts on 

which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through 

disclosure of the State's files which occurred after the 

first conviction proceeding. Those words are in the

affidavit -- right -- that came with the second 

petition. So how could he possibly have waived this 

when he has explained it wasn't available to him?

 MS. SMITH: Well, I think to understand how 

this -- how this could happen, the bottom line is that 

he failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he 

should -- he was properly before the court to begin 

with; and when you -- when you raise a claim -- he 

buried his claim among a hundred other parts and 

subparts. If --if he had a legitimate claim, he 

certainly didn't highlight it as such, and then he -- he 

buried even further his explanation for a waiver in a 

41-page affidavit filed six days before the State 

court's ruling in this case.

 It was the first time in the entire case 

that he mentioned anything at all about access to the 

prosecutor's files. Then when he got an adverse 

judgment in the trial court he never even made the 

argument in the Court of Criminal Appeals. He took a 

completely different theory about waiver, said that 

waiver was personal, and should be -- should be judged 

on a subjective standard rather than objective -- never 

mentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument 

whatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files.

 It was on the basis of that argument that

the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner 

had failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a 

matter of law as to all claims that had not been 

previously determined.

 So that holding is an overarching holding, 

it applies to every claim that was raised in the first 

term and in the successive habeas position, and we think 

justified the district -- it certainly was the basis of 

the district court's default and as well, in 2001 was 

the basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision.

 Now, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede 

that that decision could be read as presenting the 

question 1, where this Court relies on a finding of 

previous determination, but we don't think that's what 

the court did in 2007. In 2007 the court specifically 

ruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim. That 

was a decision based on law of the case principles, and 

to the extent that it discussed previous determination, 

we don't think it in any way intended to modify its 

earlier holding.

 In 2001 the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on 

the waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and 

63a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of 

the waiver. So we don't even think that the -- that the 

situation in question 1 is even presented, although

if -- to answer a question, in response to Justice 

Alito's question, I think it would be -- would be an 

absurd result that something that has been previously 

determined is defaulted, but that's not the situation 

here. The record shows it's not previously determined. 

The Petitioner has never argued that it's previously 

determined, and no court until this point has ever even 

read the Court of Criminal Appeals decision as making a 

previous determination finding. Everyone has accepted 

the fact that that holding was a waiver holding.

 So on that -- that's the basis of the 

default, and the reason that he has defaulted is that he 

failed to make that argument when he had -- when he the 

opportunity to make it. He could have made it, and he 

didn't make it. He buried all his good arguments, even 

on his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent 

arguments. On the one hand, he was saying the claim was 

novel, the claim that my post-conviction counsel didn't 

discuss it with me. On the other hand, he says that I'm 

just now finding out about it. Those are completely 

inconsistent theories, and the theory that he actually 

presented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no 

resemblance to the argument that he is making now or 

that he made in the district court.

 But all of this aside, it really is -- is

beside the point because at the end of the day, the 

district court very clearly addressed -- and 

specifically, not just in passing, but specifically at 

various points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality 

of each and every item of evidence.

 He went through in detail a discussion of 

the police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury 

already was aware that he was a drug user. It really 

wasn't any question whether he was a drug user; the 

evidence clearly showed that he was. The question was 

what was his State of mind at the time evidence was what 

was his state of mind at the time of the murders.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to 

the argument on the other side, that these various items 

of -- of Brady material were averted to and were 

discussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not 

discussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which 

Kyles v Whitley says is the standard. What's your 

response to that?

 MS. SMITH: Well, I think if you look at the 

-- at the district court's opinion, I could that 

argument could be made based upon the way the district 

court treated the items. The district court certainly 

did look at them in categories and separated them; but I 

think if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion,

certainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at 

it in more detail, I think that it is clear that the 

court cumulated the items and said as a whole that the 

Brady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine 

confidence in the verdict. So I disagree that -- that 

the Sixth Circuit treated them incorrectly, and -- and I 

would note --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you agree the 

prosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug 

dealer, that he was not a drug user? Was it -- was it 

conceded that he was a drug user? I suspect it was not.

 I said earlier it was, and it seems that it 

was not, because he introduced one witness to say that 

there were no -- no needle marks on his body, which 

would suggest that he's trying to make the point to the 

jury that this person doesn't even use drugs.

 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think I've 

noted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated 

his case on that point, no question about it; but I 

think there was ample evidence in the record indicating 

that he was a drug user. This Court even noted that, 

even noted there was proof of the fact that he was a 

drug addict, that he was a drug user, that the evidence 

was strong that he was -- that he was under the 

influence of an amphetamine psychosis. There were two

experts that testified to that. On the other hand, 

there were two experts for the State that said that that 

-- that defense couldn't be supported.

 So the question of whether he was a drug 

user or not a drug user was really beside the point. I 

think the prosecutor eventually got around to that in 

his argument. When you look at the argument of the 

whole, the bottom line of the argument was, and we 

quoted it in our brief, "look at what he did, look at 

his actions around this murder, and let that go to his 

state of mind," because that was the best evidence. Not 

only is that -- he said, he specifically said he went 

into this individual's home with the purpose of getting 

fed, getting cleaned up and getting out of town, and 

when the Todds ceased to cooperate with him, he had to 

control them physically. That's code I suppose for 

beating them to death because that's exactly what he 

did.

 He explained what he did and why he did it. 

His actions are very calculated from -- from beginning 

to end. So whether he used drugs or didn't use drugs, 

the question is what was going on at the time of this 

murder, and by his own admission the reason that the 

Todds are -- are not with us today is because they 

ceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had

to control them physically. I think that's the best 

evidence of his state of mind at the time. Those are 

words out of his own mouth, and I think that that 

certainly supports the finding of both the district 

court and the Sixth Circuit on materiality.

 I agree with the Chief Justice's assessment; 

we do not think that the Brady claim is fairly included 

within the question. The merits issue is not a 

predicate to the default question. I certainly 

understand Petitioner's dilemma in this case, but I 

think faced with that dilemma, he should have squarely 

presented that question among the questions presented 

and not dropped it in a footnote in argument 2. We 

don't think it's fairly presented; but -- but in any 

event, it certainly justifies affirmance of the judgment 

or at a minimum the dismissal of the appeal.

 And for all these reasons, if there are no 

further questions, we ask this Court to affirm the 

judgment of the district court -- of the Sixth Circuit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's outside the record 

and not really relevant to the case. Has he been on 

death row since 1984 or so? And if so, is that solitary 

confinement? Is he not allowed -- if you know?

 MS. SMITH: I don't know. I'm not aware 

that he's in any sort of heightened level of security.

I would assume he's just at a standard level.  I don't 

know his security level, but he has been on death row 

for the entire period, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Goldstein, you have three minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 Justice Kennedy, he has been on death row; 

he is not in solitary confinement.

 Here's the dilemma I think about how the 

Court needs to dispose of the case. On the one hand, we 

have the State, which is unapologetic about having 

suppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having 

misstated the procedural history to the State court and 

then to the Sixth Circuit. On the other hand, the 

Court's business is usually not to get into the weeds, 

things like fact-bound Brady claims, and I think that 

the Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal 

that it would send in affirming the judgment in this 

case and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by 

getting into the Johnson pitfalls of this witness 

statement and that witness statement, by resolving the 

case as follows:

On page 22 and 24a of the petition appendix, 

the court of appeals says the claim was procedurally 

defaulted because it was previously determined. That's 

wrong. That is the argument that was passed upon by the 

court of appeals, and that should be reversed on 

procedural grounds.

 On the Brady claim, it seems to me that the 

court of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a 

couple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send 

the case back. The first is, when it talked about the 

merits, it said we don't think this evidence would have 

mattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial 

that he was a drug user. But as has been discussed, I 

think in detail, the court of appeals, because its 

assessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that 

when the experts said that, when the prosecutor turned 

around and completely discredited that. And so I think 

that colors the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly.

 The second is the Kyles point, and the third 

is the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary 

hearing.

 And so I think an opinion of this Court that 

simply dealt with the undefended procedural default 

ruling and then went to the merits and only made those 

three points and then left it to the lower courts to

resolve the Brady claim ultimately would balance the 

concern about the Court's institutional interests in not 

sending a signal of affirming this judgment in light of 

what the State has done here and not getting into the 

weeds of the claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there anything in 

the court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on 

the merits that suggests it also treated them separately 

in the different silos, as you put it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. We 

point out that the court of appeals twice said, "We 

consider the four different categories of Brady evidence 

separately." And then when it did discuss them -- it's 

very hard to tell, its discussion is so passing here --

but it does go through this kind of evidence, say, the 

FBI files or the police teletypes from Agent Roby, and 

it says that wouldn't have been persuasive, and then it 

turns to the witness statements. But I would also say 

that its overarching point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do they say 

that they're only considering the categories separately?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: On page 57a. "We take" --

"We will take up each category of documents separately 

and discuss whether they are" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the 2001

opinion. Do they do that in the 2007 opinion?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. The -- in the 2007 

opinion, that discussion happens at 25a, and here is 

their explanation. It goes to my first point. And they 

do sort of then turn around and treat them more 

generally. "It would not have been news to the jurors 

that Cone was a drug user. They had already heard 

substantial direct evidence that he was a drug user, 

including the opinion of the two expert witnesses, 

Cone's mother, the drugs found in Cone's car, and 

photographic evidence." And that's our point, that that 

was discredited because it came out of his mouth.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the photographic 

evidence?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: There was one photo. It 

actually points in the opposite direction. The State 

cites it in its merit brief. They have a picture of 

Cone as not having any needle marks, to your point, 

Justice Scalia, that they tried to prove he wasn't a 

drug user at all.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

I'm sorry, Mr. Goldstein, one moment.
