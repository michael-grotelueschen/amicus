 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States.

 Mr. Dwyer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. DWYER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The district court's 15-month sentence 

combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned 

on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a 

reasonable sentence. In the uniform and constant 

tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district 

judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an 

individual. She considered the guidelines and after 

doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in 

every case. She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted 

disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that 

deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances 

to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his 

family, and to his community.

 The court of appeals, in contrast to the 

district court's careful attention to the 3553(a) 

factors, focused solely on the guidelines. The court of

appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule. 

That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be your test 

of reasonableness for appellate review?

 MR. DWYER: I think a sentence would be 

reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and 

circumstances of that case would find that the sentence 

imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to 

satisfy 3553(a) standards.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that gives 

very little weight to the goal, which I think is a 

congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in 

eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system 

which cause great disrespect to the justice system.

 MR. DWYER: I think that the statute speaks 

of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of 

uniformity. And there is necessarily a tension between 

the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and 

concerns about nationwide uniformity.

 But I think that what distinguishes 

sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the 

Presentencing Reform Act system are several. One is now 

we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors 

the judge must consider. 3553 didn't exist before that 

time.

Secondly, in every case, as a practical 

matter, the guidelines are going to exert a 

gravitational weight because they are there. They must 

be considered as part of the statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I substitute 

"substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your 

position or affecting your position?

 MR. DWYER: I don't -- my position would be 

that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration 

of the guidelines. It's just one of seven factors. As 

a practical matter, I think it's going to get --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Kind of a weak law of 

gravity like the Moon. It's only at one-seventh.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DWYER: As a legal matter weak. As a 

practical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be 

very strong. And I think one of the real dangers of an 

advisory guideline --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess the question 

is how strong should we say or can we say, or can 

Congress say it is?

 MR. DWYER: I think that the strength should 

be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I 

think the danger, particularly after 20 years of 

guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and

mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of 

exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full 

limit of 3553(a).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it seems to me that 

to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in 

this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from 

the process.

 MR. DWYER: I think the appellate courts 

are -- I think Booker considered a very deferential 

standard of review. The cases that the Booker Court 

cited to illustrate the standard of review of 

reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions 

regarding revocations following supervised release, 

affirming sentences that were many times what the 

chapter 7 policy guidelines would require. The court of 

appeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it 

pushes the system back into a mandatory --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the court of 

appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but 

it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever 

to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own 

evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in 

the Sentencing Reform Act. Would there be a problem 

there?

 MR. DWYER: I think there would,

Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of 

the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for 

the application and weight applied to the 3553(a) 

factors for the district court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's a principle that you 

derive from what? From the Sixth Amendment? From the 

Sentencing Reform Act? From where?

 MR. DWYER: Well, I think it derives in part 

from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated 

individualized sentencing.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The Sentencing Reform Act 

required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges 

to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines. And 

you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now 

precludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial 

judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad 

discretion?

 MR. DWYER: Certainly extremely broad 

discretion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you get that out of 

the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?

 MR. DWYER: Even under a mandatory 

guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it 

recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an 

important goal of individualized sentencing. And the

Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their 

institutional position have a special competence to 

determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a 

case. The court of appeals lacks that special 

competence. It sees only a tiny fraction of the number 

of guideline cases. It doesn't have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So one of the guides 

for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a 

particular type of case?

 MR. DWYER: I think that what guides the 

court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to 

the particular case and determine if the reasons on the 

record in that case, the district court's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's impossible to 

do in the abstract. If you're just looking at a 

particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is 

reasonable or not. There has to be a background to it 

so that you know that in this type of case, people 

usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a 

sentence of 10 years. And it seems to me that what's 

ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in 

determining what's reasonable.

 MR. DWYER: I think the court of appeals' 

job is to ensure that the district judge provides 

reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of

that case that establish that the district court had 

complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case, 

selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater 

than necessary.

 I don't believe that it is the court of 

appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a 

sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh 

district courts' decisions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you're 

looking at not just the number, but the reasons. In 

other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got 

nine district judges, they all say we do not depart 

downward for military service, and you've got one 

district judge that says we do. It seems to me that if 

the court of appeals can't review that to bring about 

some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to 

consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.

 MR. DWYER: I think it is not lawless in the 

sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether 

in a particular case, the differences it finds are 

warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case, 

whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines, 

has looked at the history and characteristics of that 

defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of 

the crime. And if those reasons satisfy the court that

a reasonable judge looking at those facts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On my particular 

case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals? 

They've got two cases before them. One, the judge 

departs three years because of military service. The 

prosecutor appeals. The other, the judge refuses to 

depart because of military service and the defendant 

appeals.

 Should those -- what should happen with 

those two cases?

 MR. DWYER: I think the same process of 

review applies to each. And it may result -- and that 

process of review is on the record in that case, would a 

reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence?

 And that review may result in both cases 

being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being 

reversed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does that come from 

as a matter of law? That is, suppose -- now you can say 

I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I 

start with an assumption that Congress did want the 

court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in 

sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts 

of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the 

sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a

system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals 

create a degree of uniformity.

 Suppose I start with that assumption and say 

that's what the guidelines were about and the reason 

that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among 

many. After all, it was attached to a bill that was the 

guideline bill.

 And indeed, the part we excised was a floor 

amendment that came along later to make it even tougher. 

So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress 

wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is 

there something in the Constitution that forbids it?

 That's where I start -- I am starting 

personally with that question in mind, always, if this 

is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless 

there's something in the Constitution that forbids it. 

And is there something in the Constitution that would 

forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they 

did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it?

 Now, just going through the different 

elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that 

what the district judge did was unreasonable?

 MR. DWYER: I think there is a 

constitutional problem with that. And it is that if --

it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system. And I

think if there is to be an effectively advisory system, 

sentencing cannot center on the guidelines. The 

district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that 

advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes 

the focal point for sentencing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not mandatory. It 

says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now, 

let's think here. We have 8 -- 7 people on the 

sentencing commission that have really looked into that. 

And they think that in an ordinary course with this 

small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many 

months. That reflects a lot of thought. Seems 

reasonable to us. And here the district judge is giving 

him half that or 40 percent of that without a good 

reason that we can find.

 The judge said he did it because it was just 

one little episode and we think there were many 

episodes. And that's basically their reason.

 Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment 

forbids that?

 MR. DWYER: Of course, the court of appeals 

did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case. In --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah --

MR. DWYER: The Eighth Circuit in this case 

simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an

extraordinary variance and we are reversing. The 

district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines 

and generally that must be part of the reason --

elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be 

considered on appeal.

 But the notion somehow that simply because a 

sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems 

have been resolved, is clearly not true. As the amici 

briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a 

mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased, 

regional disparity increased. It's disparity that 

individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion 

necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing, 

can counteract. And that is genuine uniformity.

 As -- as you pointed out in the Koon 

decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your 

language from Rivera, the district court's special 

competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is 

exactly the kind of information the sentencing 

commission needs to determine whether a guideline works 

or doesn't work.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really saying 

that the most weight that the guidelines can be given, 

or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my 

voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is,

is the weight of necessary advertence? The guidelines, 

in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a). The 

rest of them say individualized sentencing. The 

guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the 

guidelines.

 Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in 

effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I 

think the most that you can concede is that before a 

district judge sentences finally, he must show that he 

has considered the value of uniformity as something 

different from individualized sentencing, but that's as 

much as he can be required to do.

 Is that a fair statement of your position?

 MR. DWYER: Yeah. And I think 3553(a), in 

fact -- I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this -- talks about 

uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4), 

which requires consideration of the guidelines, and 

3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I stand 

corrected here. I'm sorry.

 MR. DWYER: But I agree with you that it is 

a consideration -- and I'm not talking about a check 

list. I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's 

enough. There has to -- I think sentencing under an 

advisory system requires reason and judgment. We tried

to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow 

different. It may involve fact-finding but is not the 

determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the 

guidelines require.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as one of the themes 

that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is 

followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over 

time.

 I assume they would be adjusted to be more 

precise, but then we are right back where we started 

because you want to give the guidelines very little 

effect. It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing 

against yourself.

 If your view is accepted and the result is 

considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can 

do is have mandatory minimums.

 MR. DWYER: I don't believe that, that the 

results are going to be considerable disparity. 

Certainly no more disparity than existed under the 

mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed 

particularly.

 I think indeed there may be more 

non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity, 

because it really is kind of idle to talk about 

disparity unless you are measuring it against something.

And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity 

is measured --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it is idle to 

talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act 

was adopted? You remember those days.

 MR. DWYER: I do remember those days. And I 

think there are two significant points about that. One, 

judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act, 

knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served. 

So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the 

defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was 

going to get out soon.

 The real number was parole eligibility 

sentencing. So that looking at just the actual sentence 

imposed did not tell you very much about disparity. And 

none -- in the study that the sentencing commission in 

its amicus cited -- that study explicitly said that none 

of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act 

interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served 

as opposed to actual sentences imposed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, yeah. But there --

you know, we can go back into that, but there was a 

whole history that people testified, tremendously, no 

opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge 

wheel. Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in

fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of 

the judge? And why did you get different sentences 

across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a 

possibility of explaining that the judges didn't 

understand what the parole commission was like. That's 

a different issue.

 So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we 

followed your position literally, what we're saying is 

that the Constitution of the United States prevents any 

effort to create uniform sentences throughout the 

country for people who different judges -- God doesn't 

tell us what the right sentence is. We don't know. 

There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range 

of possible sentences.

 And you're saying we have to go back to 

that. And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words, 

for you to tell me something that says we don't have to 

be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid 

either. And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest 

with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.

 MR. DWYER: I don't believe that sentencing 

under an effectively advisory system under the standards 

of appellate review that I've described, which I think 

is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty 

exercise on appeal, and leading simply --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you describe it 

again? Because I'm not clear what your answer was to 

what the appellate court stance is. I take it the 

appellate court would owe deference to the district 

court's determination?

 MR. DWYER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And no particular 

deference to the guidelines?

 MR. DWYER: That would -- yes, I would agree 

with that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is it other 

than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?

 MR. DWYER: I think that the court of 

appeals will first look to ensure that there was 

reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with 

3553(a), that the district court considered all of the 

factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was 

sufficient but not greater than necessary.

 Secondly, I think that the court of appeals 

under that deferential standard of review that Booker 

described would look to see if this is a sentence that a 

reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater 

than necessary on those facts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- one problem is 

that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the

this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence 

him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. 

Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he 

just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had 

been out on that same street every night for two and a 

half weeks. So the quantity is much larger. And he was 

in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him 

to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less.

 Those could be reasonable determinations, 

two different reactions that judges would have to the 

same set of facts.

 MR. DWYER: Yes. That is correct. And I 

think that is what will result under an effectively 

advisory system. But here we're talking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, you -- you, 

you are not driven to the alternative that 

Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve 

absolute uniformity. It's very easy. It was what the 

dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is 

use facts found by the jury and you can have the 

sentences as rigid as you like.

 It is really only, only when you want to let 

the facts be found by the judge that you come into the 

difficulty that, that we're arguing about. But it's

certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there 

is no way to achieve determinate sentencing. There 

certainly is.

 MR. DWYER: I agree, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you agree? Because I 

think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing 

power to the prosecutor, who would determine the 

sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he 

introduced and what he charged. So I agree that that 

might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only 

because the prosecutor would have total power to decide 

what the sentence will be.

 MR. DWYER: Well, I -- I also appreciate the 

dialogue. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't have 

to engage in our dispute here.

are problems to every solution. And that's why I'm 

still looking for the --

MR. DWYER: And -- and one of the serious 

problems in the solution that Booker chose is that while 

judicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and 

mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too, 

doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of

prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on 

the scale, and which the district court, in the day to 

day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the 

district courts, has a far greater appreciation for, 

than a court of appeals would.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dwyer, before we get 

to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district 

court -- different district judges could act reasonably, 

one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the 

other giving 15 months, both of those would be 

reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal.

 But one of, one of the arguments that was 

made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there 

is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack 

and the penalty for powdered cocaine.

 Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, 

he thought it was unconstitutional. I think at the very 

least you ought to take into account that if this man 

were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered 

cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the 

guideline sentence range would have been six months to a 

year. Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that 

disparity. Is a district judge free to say under 

advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the 

difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though

he possessed powdered cocaine?

 MR. DWYER: I think that the judge in the 

obligation of imposing an individual sentence must 

consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be 

free to shape and tailor that advice as the 

circumstances of that case require.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, specifically, can 

you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him 

as though he possessed powdered cocaine? Can he do 

that? Yes or no?

 MR. DWYER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though we know that 

Congress didn't want that to happen?

 MR. DWYER: Yes, because I think if the 

judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in 

that case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's got nothing 

to do with that case. That's got something to do with a 

judgment apart from the particulars of the case about 

whether crack should be treated the same as powdered 

crack cocaine. It's got nothing to do with the 

individual case.

 MR. DWYER: Well, I beg to differ, Chief 

Justice Roberts, because the differences were predicated 

on assumptions about the type of individuals who would

engage in that. And the court in her experience could 

look at it and say you aren't the typical crack 

defendant, you are more like the people who come before 

me who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't 

possess the violence, the weaponry and the other things 

that justified Congress's decision to create disparate 

sentences for these two kinds of cocaine.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you ran away 

from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit. 

Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this 

distinction and let's assume that there's no 

constitutional problem with the distinction. There 

might be, but let's assume.

 Can the judge simply say, I ignore that 

congressional -- congressional judgment is wrong. I'm 

not going to do that.

 MR. DWYER: I don't think that the district 

judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the judge permitted --

JUSTICE STEVENS: To what extent is the 

Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted 

the statute we're construing? The statute we're 

construing was enacted by one Congress and these 

expressions came later.

problem by saying that the district judge must consider 

the guidelines. The district judge doesn't sit in 

review of the policy. It has to apply it to a specific 

person. In a particular case, as in Mario Claiborne's, 

that policy produced a sentence that would have been too 

great.

 And the application had some numbers to it, 

so she said it was more serious because it was a crack 

cocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who 

was involved with powder would get, but you don't need 

to get as much as the guidelines call for, for the 

reasons that she expressed on the record at the 

sentencing.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time, 

unless there are other questions?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This Court in Booker concluded that the 

remedial severing of the statute's provision for 

mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision 

governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the

statute constitutional. It further implied a standard 

of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on 

appeal, and it did not elaborate what that 

reasonableness requirement means.

 The Government submits that the best 

interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would 

be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's 

original intent of minimizing and eliminating 

unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly 

situated defendants.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As closely as it can, and 

the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth 

Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences 

determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.

 Suppose in this case the court of appeals 

instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? 

And then in the next case that comes up involving what 

was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of 

cocaine powder rather than crack, okay? Suppose in the 

next case it would have been 30 grams of powder. And 

the district court judge once again departs just the way 

the departure was here, and the court of appeals says 

no, that departure is unreasonable.

 You now have circuit law which says 30 

grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams,

you're entitled to a lesser sentence. Okay?

 Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into 

the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan? You have 

fact findings being made by the judge. It's a judge who 

decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams. What 

difference does it make whether that factual difference 

produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of 

the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a 

series of opinion by a court of appeals? Isn't the 

Sixth Amendment equally violated?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I think we 

talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be 

if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on 

appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a 

commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals 

does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, 

literally prescribing particular levels of punishment 

for recurring sets of facts.

 The Government's submission here is not that 

the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a 

proportionality principle. A proportionality principle 

will look to all of the facts of the case and will try 

to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in 

response to all of the facts and circumstances that the 

judge articulated within --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But if you have two cases 

that are in other respects similar, and the court of 

appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the 

guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this 

judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes 

up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower 

sentence.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, he doesn't, Justice 

Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a 

judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same 

level of leniency or any leniency at all. That judge 

will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at 

the totality of the facts and conclude whether a 

sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable 

sentence. And unlike a situation that some of us might 

prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that 

like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the 

system of reasonableness review on top of advisory 

guidelines will not produce perfect levels of 

consistency.

 And what the defendant is entitled to under 

the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing 

that if the law says if I commit this crime and these 

are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is 

this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's

produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial 

entitlement. That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles 

you.

 But no defendant who commits a crack offense 

can say that even after a series of court of appeals 

rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness. 

That defendant will not know whether the judge that he 

or she appears in front of will give the same kind of 

weight to those facts as some other judge did who was 

affirmed or reversed. Nor will that judge be able to 

say what is the constellation of policy and factual 

reasons that this particular judge will find in 

announcing the judge's sentence.

 So I don't think that a proportionality 

principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment. And I 

don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or 

any other part of the statute. What the Court is left 

with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I 

submit it should ask the same question that it asked in 

Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's 

alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms 

more closely to Congress's original claim in the 

Sentencing Reform Act?

 The Petitioner's version of appellate review 

as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of

the substance of what the district judge does. It may 

reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a 

second degree murderer, I think probation is the 

appropriate sentence. Perhaps the Petitioner would 

concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but 

beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to 

arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away, 

Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts 

of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine 

whether a particular sentence is reasonable. And that 

is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when 

eight of them have adopted this proportionality 

principle.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 

It seems to me that in sentencing there are two 

different broad categories of decision that the judge 

has to make, one involving the severity of the crime, 

and the other the characteristics of the particular 

offender.

 And might it not be the case that you give a 

greater presumption of following the guidelines when 

you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a 

greater deference to the trial judge when you're 

evaluating the factors of the individual that might 

affect the sentence? There might be a difference in the

MR. DREEBEN: I think at a high level of 

generality, that is true. Because what the sentencing 

commission is good at is taking paradigmatic 

circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that 

will transfer into a sentence. And what the strength of 

the district judge is is looking at the defendant in 

front of that particular judge and seeing how that 

person's characteristics may map onto the policies of 

sentencing.

 But I don't agree that that distinction 

would support a two-track form of appellate review that 

would give the district judge greater deference to take 

personal characteristics into account and to impose 

widely varying sentences. That is exactly the situation 

that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when 

any district judge could choose whatever policies of 

sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and 

impose a widely disparate sentence. And as the Court 

well knows, there was no appellate review of that 

exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the 

judge didn't exercise discretion at all.

 Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a 

judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same 

sentence. That would not take into account the full

range of facts and factors that are present in the 

sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an 

exercise of discretion.

 But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era, 

the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what 

facts mattered. If we continue with that same sort of 

deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then 

it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve 

any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some 

consistency and uniformity in the way district judges 

impose sentencing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about 

taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly 

hypothesizing this -- and following up with what 

Justice Stevens said. You'd say look, one thing a 

district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe 

the guideline is right for a typical case. And I think 

this is a typical case. And I won't follow the 

guideline. You couldn't think those three things?

 MR. DREEBEN: I agree.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So one big power a judge 

has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to 

say the guideline itself is unreasonable. So we're --

let's just say -- and there if they say that, the 

district judge could decide whether or not, the court of

appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not 

reasonable. But leave those cases aside. I imagine 

they'll be few and far between.

 Now we take one they assume is reasonable. 

And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three 

things. One, to give the kind of thing that -- the 

reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits 

is reasonable for a typical case. So what's the kind of 

thing that leads you to think yours is not typical? And 

he says it. And then he has the evidence as to the 

related facts. And then he has the degree of departure.

 As to the first thing, the court of appeals 

could review it and decide whether it is or is not the 

kind of thing. As to the second and third, they also 

could review it but only after giving considerable 

weight to what the district judge thinks about the case 

in front of him.

 Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not 

have a reaction to that. I'd have to sort of think 

about it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, if the 

system that you're describing is a replica of the system 

that existed under Koon versus United States --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not quite --

problem that led to the constitutional problem in 

Booker. Where I think I would amend Your Honor's 

proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a 

typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe 

what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the 

reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker 

system, that could have been problematic legally. 

Today, it is not forbidden. But what it should be 

subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal 

that take a look at what are the reasons that the 

district judge articulated for that sentence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why do we assume that 

the district judge cannot depart from the guideline 

recommendation unless he thinks the guideline 

recommendation is unreasonable? He doesn't -- does he 

have to find it's unreasonable? There can certainly be 

two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation 

to select the guidelines sentence, is he?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So he doesn't have to 

determine that it's unreasonable. I don't think we 

should approach the discussion as though that's, that's 

the situation.

 MR. DREEBEN: I do think, though, that the 

Court should be concerned about each district judge

formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing 

guidelines and then applying them in the court to the 

cases that appear on that judge's docket without any 

check on appellate review to ensure that, although the 

sentence might be in some possible world reasonable, 

it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission 

has prescribed and what other district judges are doing. 

If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the 

clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the 

Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a 

reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial 

opinion thought it was accomplishing. What the Booker 

remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was 

providing an important mechanism that Congress itself 

had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron 

out sentencing differences.

 And our submission is that inherently means 

some form of substantive proportionality review.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the other thing I'm 

not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason 

I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. 

That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, 

but proportional to what? I mean, I can think of two 

problems. One problem, of course, is that the chart in 

the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and

that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 

10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 

30, it's 2 years.

 Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether 

you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just 

have nothing to do with your reason for departure. You 

might have added on something for having a gun and your 

reason for being lenient might have to do with the 

person's having a gun. So you're going to say it make a 

difference whether you were high up or whether you were 

low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to 

do with whether you're high up or whether you were low 

down? You see? It doesn't actually work, I don't 

think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to 

say what's proportional.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think what is proportional 

is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that 

have been using this rule have not had a great deal of 

difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to 

which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you 

look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and 

have a sense of is this a significant deviation away 

from what the guidelines would actually describe.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why use the word 

"proportional," because the other thing is what the

Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a 

person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason 

justify a little departure rather than a lot? And if he 

has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot 

just as much as it might justify a little?

 MR. DREEBEN: If the sentencing court 

articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's 

irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the 

case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at 

all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate 

it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the 

district court to articulate the reasons why the 

sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an 

appropriate sentence under 3553(a).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, if we could 

focus on the facts of this case and what the district 

court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality 

judgment, too. She said this is a young man. It's his 

first offense. He has a good family relationship, a 

good work record. I am making a determination that will 

put him away for a significant amount of time. But I'm 

trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch 

with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away.

 That was the judgment that she made. She 

tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15

months, but that would not be so long that it would put 

him out of touch with his children and his wife and his 

work.

 Now, in -- by some measures that would be 

entirely reasonable. But on your measure, it isn't 

reasonable.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I think, 

Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of 

articulating a justification for the sentence than the 

judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family 

separation and employment to the degree that you have 

now articulated it. What the judge did was focus on the 

quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't 

have any criminal history and that he qualified for the 

safety valve.

 She also said, without specifying any other 

cases, that other cases that have come before my court 

have had -- you know -- perhaps larger quantity of drugs 

and very different sentences. When a court of appeals 

is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to 

decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is 

reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we 

know anything, for example, about what this judge is 

saying about other cases with other drug quantities? 

There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court

of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of 

that observation. It's also relevant for the court of 

appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken 

into account all of the factors that this judge has 

previously noted and what has happened in the sentence 

is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence 

for reasons that the commission already took into 

account. Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from 

relying on those facts, but it does mean that the 

farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the 

more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did leave out 

what -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I 

would be throwing him away. And I take it what she was 

saying by that is it would be -- he would be 

incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate 

into the community.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, this brings me to my 

last point about this particular sentencing, which is 

that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the 

defendant. She said, candidly I don't know really very 

much about you other than what I've learned about in the 

presentence report and I can't tell whether you're 

unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him 

a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous

indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a 

wakeup call and nothing more. What she ignored is his 

own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a 

street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine, 

that he was arrested and placed into the State system, 

put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug 

court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you 

know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you, 

we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate 

with your family, and what did the defendant do but get 

caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.

 And on that record -- and this is what the 

court of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between 

the judge's conclusion that, with little information 

more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved 

leniency versus the fact that he had already had that 

chance and he had not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but didn't the court 

of appeals draw the inference that he had been 

distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that 

was not supported by the record? Am I wrong on that?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, we're 

not relying on the inference of the --

for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that

was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in 

this case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, supported by the record 

is something of a judgment call. You'd have to assume 

that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months 

after he had previously been arrested for crack 

offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the 

very first time after his arrest that he had been in 

possession of drugs, that just he got extremely 

unlikely, the police caught him.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the court of appeals 

is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in 

fact distributed during that 6-month period?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's right. And I would say 

that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that 

conclusion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But should the court of 

appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the 

case?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not in my view. And I think 

on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on. 

It's not a fact that the Government --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not possibly a fact 

that would justify the conclusion that they committed 

error?

MR. DREEBEN: This aspect of the court of 

appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the 

judgment that it reached, which is correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It may not have been 

essential, but it may have contributed to their 

judgment.

 MR. DREEBEN: It may have, but what they did 

not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding 

that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist 

even though he had no criminal history. He had been 

previously arrested for crack distribution crimes. He 

had admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his 

arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal 

crack. He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months. And the 

judge essentially turned all of those facts off. She 

did not really factor that into her sentence at all.

 And the court of appeals, although it may 

have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that 

this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the 

sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had 

treated him as, the record does indeed support the court 

of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant, 

despite his criminal history, really looks more like a 

recidivist. And when you're talking about a defendant 

whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5

years, but who gets out of that sentence because he 

satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is 

a first-time offender and meets certain other 

requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory 

minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been 

substantially reduced under the guidelines because of 

the safety valve and because of his criminal history. 

And the judge basically said: I'm going to take a 

chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than 

what the guidelines described.

 Our view is the judge can look at the facts 

she looked at, but she went down to a level that is 

productive of unwarranted disparity.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one other 

question? I do not understand you to argue that the 

court of appeals can apply a presumption of 

unreasonableness just because there's a departure.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct. We're not 

arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal. 

We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a 

guidelines sentence. For an out of guidelines sentence 

there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the 

court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would 

look and require increasingly strong reasons with the 

increasing degree of variance from --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part, they said 

that. An extraordinary reduction must be supported by 

extraordinary circumstances. What worries me about that 

it sounds like a slogan. I would think an extraordinary 

reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that 

justify the extraordinary reduction, period.

 And it also sounds like you're going to 

start getting a mechanical set of charts and things, 

which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really 

were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force 

of generative law which would worry me quite a lot 

because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a 

formula. What you want is a reason that supports the 

sentence.

 It is --

MR. DREEBEN: I think you want a better 

reason for a sentence that is farther away from some 

mean.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Better than what? Better 

than justifies it?

 MR. DWYER: Perhaps the best way to do this 

is to give a example. Suppose that the shoe were on the 

other foot. Suppose that Judge Jackson had looked at 

this defendant and said, you know, this defendant did 

not learn from his experience. He was given leniency in

the State court. He didn't take advantage of that 

opportunity. His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm 

going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm 

going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she 

said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence.

 I submit that in that circumstances the 

Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines 

recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and 

this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is 

not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very 

usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this 

deviation is unreasonable.

 And I have no problem with a Petitioner 

making that argument if that's what happens to his or 

her client. My problem is that without that kind of 

anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality 

review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work 

with.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what happens when that 

case -- it goes back down to the district court. The 

district court says well, okay, not 10 years. Nine 

years. Okay? It goes back up. I mean, you know, when 

do we end this game? Or does the court of appeals take 

over the sentencing function and specify -- you know, 

five years?

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, I don't think 

that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very 

unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a 

sentence. There have been a couple of instances where 

courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom 

sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on 

this particular constellation of facts. I think that 

reflect as sense of potential impatience with a 

ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals 

says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge, 

and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day 

lower.

 Another solution to that problem would be 

reassignment to a different judge who would start with a 

clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion 

and apply the section 3553 factors.

 We are not suggesting that the court of 

appeals should assume the sentencing role here. All 

we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to 

have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to 

identify and select unreasonable sentences versus 

reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory 

ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't 

have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, 

it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have

a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their 

tasks. And if the courts of appeals can do that, can 

look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the 

farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, 

without violating the statute and without violating the 

Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the 

Court to ask at that point is which approach, that 

approach of proportionality, or and approach that 

basically says appellate review is procedural only, 

absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms 

to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of 

uniformity and consistency.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wouldn't be, just 

be procedural only. You -- you could say procedural 

plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on 

which the district court was -- was proceeding. So you, 

if you could find that the determination that this was 

just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an 

unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.

 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is true. But I 

submit that -- I would like to hear what Petitioner has 

to say. If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years 

in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be 

arguing that's an unreasonable sentence. But I don't 

see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. DWYER: I believe that Justice Breyer 

put his finger on one of the central problems with the 

Government's proposed rule. And that is what does it 

mean? The Government talks about substantial variances 

in Petitioner's case. The court of appeals spoke of it 

as extraordinary variances. And the Government doesn't 

suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or 

means something different from extraordinary. And we've 

already demonstrated in our brief why relying on 

percentages as the court of appeals also did, is 

pointless, because, one, if -- the arithmetic gets very 

complicated at the low end and the percentages just 

don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule 

of law.

no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just 

not susceptible of any kind of application because 

nobody really knows what it means.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about Mr. 

Dreeben's parting challenge? What are you going to do 

if your client gets 10 years? You're going to argue 

that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines, 

right?

 MR. DWYER: I'm certainly going to argue 

that under the facts and the record before the Court, 

that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not 

greater than necessary. And I think the absence of a 

prior record, the young man's work history, all of those 

factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his 

age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed 

out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision, 

could not possibly support a 10-year sentence.

 And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in 

a hypothetical sort of way. But the district judge --

and this was a very experienced district judge --

looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on 

judgment. And that call was not treated with any 

respect in the court of appeals. It was sloganeered 

away as an extraordinary variance. And -- because the 

court of appeals focused only on the guidelines.

standard can't just look to determine what Congress 

might have intended because of the constitutional 

problem that lurks behind it. And that constitutional 

problem is a resumption of mandatory guidelines.
