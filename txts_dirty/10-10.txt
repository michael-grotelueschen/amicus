 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 10-10, Turner v. Rogers.

 Mr. Waxman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Due process requires the assistance of 

counsel before an alleged civil contemner can be 

incarcerated. That categorical rule flows from the 

imposition by a court in a formal adversary proceeding 

of what this Court has termed, quote, "the awesome 

prospect of incarceration." Certainly -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's a formal 

adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in 

the sense that caused us to require counsel to be 

provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is 

armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant 

does not have. Many of these proceedings do not involve 

counsel on the other side, do they?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Scalia, the 

answer is yes and no. I don't think that you can call 

this nonadversarial because the -- because South

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking of counsel. Is 

it not true that many, perhaps most, of these 

proceedings do not have counsel on the other side? It 

is the wife who is trying to get payment of -- of the -­

of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel -­

MR. WAXMAN: I think it is -- the contrary 

is true. According to the government statistics, 70 

percent of noncustodial parents either have no income or 

have income less than $10,000, and, therefore, in a 

State -- in every State that accepts TANF funds, which 

is every State, they are represented by the State 

agency, and South Carolina in this case has made a rule 

that in-State cases -- and that also includes nonwelfare 

cases where the -- a custodial parent has chosen to be 

represented by the State -- the State entirely carries 

its prosecutorial burden by filing a rule to show cause 

and an affidavit showing the arrearages, and that places 

the burden, which South Carolina says is a heavy burden, 

on the defendant to prove inability to comply as a 

condition of maintaining his liberty. In this -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we agree with you, 

isn't this going to create an imbalance? Now, in this 

case, Ms. Rogers was not represented by counsel at this 

proceeding, was she?

MR. WAXMAN: Ms. Rogers -- in most of the 

proceedings, and it does vary from one to the other. In 

all -- let's put it this way: In all of the 

proceedings, the charges and the State's prima facie 

case of willful contempt was established by a State 

employee.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. The State employee 

sends out the -- the rule to show cause and proof that, 

evidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in 

arrears on the child payments. So, let's see what would 

happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these 

cases, where both the custodial parent and the 

noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very 

well educated.

 Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial 

parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income 

of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all 

his -- his income is Social Security disability 

benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child 

support. Now, the custodial -- the non -- the custodial 

parent who has no attorney says: He's not really hurt, 

I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting, 

he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car. 

It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name, 

he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying

drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer, 

and I can't prove any of this.

 So you've created a great imbalance there, 

haven't you?

 MR. WAXMAN: Not at all, Justice Alito. 

First of all, in all -- in the -- in the majority of 

cases the department of social services is in fact the 

real party in interest and the moving party, and in any 

private case, for a nominal fee the custodial mother can 

have the department of social services act in that role 

as Federal law requires the State to do. Second of 

all -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, why don't you argue for 

a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for 

the defendant in these cases where it has provided 

counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side? 

Wouldn't that be fair?

 MR. WAXMAN: That would certainly be more 

than fair, and the number of instances -- let -- let's 

be clear about this. The number of instances in which 

the State will be required to appoint counsel for the 

alleged civil contemner will be in cases where -- I 

mean, there's no reason why the State of South Carolina, 

when it issues the summons and the affidavit, says fill 

out this form and let us know whether you have assets or

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you -­

MR. WAXMAN: In all of those cases where 

they believe that this is a turnip, not a deadbeat dad, 

they will proceed with remedies other -- other than 

incarceration. It's only when they want to proceed in 

the face of a form that shows indigence and inability to 

have counsel, that the State has to provide a lawyer 

before it -- before it puts this man in jail.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you asked -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, in your 

opening statement, you said whenever, in civil contempt, 

a person is subject to incarceration he or she is 

entitled to counsel. In your opening statement, you 

didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before 

us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay. 

Therefore, I can't get out of jail.

 Are you limiting -- are you limiting your 

argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a 

former husband who says I just haven't got the 

wherewithal to pay? Or are you making a broader claim 

that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they 

must have counsel?

 MR. WAXMAN: It is definitely the broader 

claim; that is, this -- this decision about counsel has

to be determined ex ante, because the State -- and this 

is our -- I suppose our more limited request for a 

categorical rule. Where you have a State that has 

placed the burden on the noncustodial parent -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my -- my question 

just follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must 

have in mind. My understanding is that it's a 

commonplace if the witness declines to testify even 

though the witness has immunity, or the attorney or the 

witness declines to produce a document, the judge says 

you will remain in jail until you comply. In most of 

the States, I think he's allowed counsel, but does the 

broad statement that you -- or the broad argument that 

you responded, that you're making when you answered 

Justice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in 

effect saying in all these cases you must have appointed 

counsel?

 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our submission is 

any case in which the State proposes to deprive somebody 

with an unqualified right to liberty of that liberty by 

actual incarceration, there is a right to counsel. Now, 

there is a right to appointed -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're committed to 

custody until you testify.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: "Mr. Bailiff, take him 

out."

 MR. WAXMAN: There -- the cases have 

recognized a distinction, Justice Kennedy, between 

direct contempt and indirect contempt. And direct 

contempt, which is a witness in the courtroom refuses to 

testify, the cases have -- both civil and criminal -­

have not required the appointment of counsel or a jury 

trial or anything like that. In -- in a case where the 

grand jury witness refuses to testify, the cases all, to 

my knowledge, do require the appointment of counsel 

because there may be a defense, and someone is being 

deprived of their liberty.

 Now, I think it's important -- Justice 

Ginsburg, you asked me if I have a more limited rule, 

and in this instance, the limited rule is that certainly 

counsel requires -- certainly the due process clause 

requires the appointment of counsel where the State 

places the affirmative burden on the contemner to 

demonstrate as a matter of law and fact that he was 

unable to comply, and, thus, that incarceration would 

not be unlawful punishment, but lawful coercion. And 

that is, I think, an important distinction. The -­

Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case

or the failure to appoint counsel arises from a due 

process complaint that the -- that the -- that the 

Petitioner here didn't know that he had indigency as a 

defense or what he needed to prove or to bring to court 

to prove that. Why wouldn't the Solicitor General's 

solution of saying, as long as a State tells a defendant 

that they have a burden of proof and some contours of 

what proof they need to supply or -- on that issue, that 

that would satisfy due process? What can a lawyer do 

when someone comes in and says, I'm not earning any 

money, I can't earn it, blah, blah, blah, end of story?

 MR. WAXMAN: The reason -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you need? Why 

do you need -­

MR. WAXMAN: The reason it doesn't satisfy 

-- even if the -- even if the defendant is advised that 

there is an inability-to-comply defense and that a 

sentence imposed where there is an inability to comply 

is unlawful under Gompers and Bagwell, and for that 

matter under South Carolina law, is that the showing 

that the -- the burden that the defendant has to 

shoulder, the shoulder -- the showing that the defendant 

has to make is both legal and factual, and neither one 

of them is straightforward. It's legal, for example, 

because there are lots of legal questions built into the

unable-to-comply defense, including what it means to be 

unable to comply. Intentional underemployment, the 

allegation made in this court that he's using up all his 

income on drug use, the ability to -­

to incarcerate somebody so that they can reduce their 

arrearage on a work release program, perhaps the 

requirement that he sell his $1,500 car -- those are all 

legal questions as to whether the defendant -- they 

constitute an inability to comply.

but I need it to be able to do something else?

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Sotomayor, even leaving 

aside all of those undecided questions under South 

Carolina -- legal questions under South Carolina law, 

even as to the facts that you've addressed, the burden 

is not insignificant. Recall that a mere assertion -- I 

mean, in this case this man filled out a form saying 

that -- certifying that he had no income and one asset, 

a car worth $1,500. In order -- the -- the courts have 

said that assertions don't satisfy it. He has to -­

record; we did not include it in the -- in the Joint 

Appendix. We can make it available to the Court. It -­

it is in the trial record, and we didn't understand at 

the time we were filing that the United States would be 

making an argument that the submission of a, quote, 

"simple form" would satisfy due process.

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have stressed 

that the burden in this case is on the defendant. Would 

your position be different if the burden were on the 

complainant?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think the case would -- our 

case would not be as strong. To be sure, in the 

criminal -- in the criminal contempt context, the 

burden, of course, is on the State and to prove beyond a 

reasonable doubt, but there is an acknowledged right to 

counsel, and there was for decades before this Court 

considered criminal contempt to be a crime within the 

meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

 So, I think we would still -- even if the 

burden had shifted, the broader rule we're asking for 

is, look, the -- here the State is sending a man to jail 

repeatedly on the premise of exacting compliance with 

court orders and on the theory that he holds the keys to 

his own pocket because he can always choose to comply. 

And our submission is that when the State uses that 

sanction on the basis of that theory, due process 

demands that it guarantee the assistance of counsel to

sentence imposed is lawfully coercive and not 

unconstitutionally punitive.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman -­

MR. WAXMAN: That's our -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- suppose the Court thinks 

that -- suppose the Court looks at this record and 

thinks this is a broken system and a violation of due 

process, but requiring a counsel in every case may go 

too far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures 

that a State could adopt that would comply with due 

process. And I know that this is not your submission; 

it's, instead, the solicitor general's submission. But 

if pressed on that point, what procedures do you think 

would be capable of giving a person in this situation a 

fair shake at this?

 MR. WAXMAN: Certainly -- I mean, we think 

that, given the way the adversary system works and given 

the legal nature of the determination that a judge makes 

depriving somebody of liberty, and given the significant 

burdens that are faced in carrying the burden to 

establish that, there are none. Due process requires 

the application of what this Court in Lassiter called 

the general rule or the presumption that civil or 

criminal, when the State chooses to absolutely deprive

 I mean, I suppose the closest second would 

be what Justice Powell, providing the fifth vote in 

Vitek, provided, which is even in that case where the 

decision was being made by a mental health professional 

and the issue involved the transfer from somebody in 

State prison to a State mental unit, a much diminished 

liberty interest -- even Justice Powell, providing the

whenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an 

indigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a 

matter of due process?

case, it would have appeared quite prominently in my 

brief. There is no such case, but let me make two 

points about history and what the Due Process Clause 

means, notwithstanding what some of us might like it to 

mean.

 First of all, history -- the history is 

very, very complicated, and it doesn't dictate the 

answer. The traditional distinction along the lines was 

not between civil or criminal contempt, but direct or 

indirect contempt, and as I know Your Honor knows 

because you've written it, traditionally at common law, 

I mean, counsel was provided for civil cases and in 

misdemeanor cases, but not felony cases.

 The criminal/civil distinction in contempt 

arose in this Court around the turn of the 20th century, 

and it arose so that the courts could exercise more 

supervisory review over the imposition of criminal 

contempt by courts.

 Now, in Cooke and Oliver, this Court, as I 

said, long, long before it recognized that criminal 

contempt was a Sixth -- a crime entitled to all Sixth 

Amendment protections, held that because of the nature 

of the deprivation of liberty, the appointment of 

counsel was required. And our submission here is, as 

this Court has recognized, the distinction between civil

and criminal contempt is the question of whether you 

have coercive imprisonment or imprisonment as 

punishment.

 And in almost every case, the sentence 

involves some aspect of both, and where the only thing, 

the only thing, that keeps the coercive imprisonment 

from being unconstitutionally punitive absent a jury 

trial right and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and 

counsel, is the ability to comply with the court's 

order. And that burden is put on the defendant, even

This case is focused on a right to counsel, but what 

about burden of proof, what about a jury trial?

 MR. WAXMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg, this 

Court has made -- we're talking about a determination 

ex ante, before the man is sent to jail, in this case 

for repeated long periods, should he be appointed 

counsel. This Court has already said that, in civil 

contempt proceedings, there is no requirement of proof 

beyond a reasonable doubt and there is no requirement of 

proof of a jury trial, just as following Gault, this

juvenile commitment case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness, if -- if 

you're relying for that proposition only on the fact 

that we've already said it, why don't you also say we've 

never said what you want us to say now? I mean, if 

that's the only argument, we've already said it. If it 

was wrong, we should unsay it.

 MR. WAXMAN: It wasn't wrong, Justice 

Scalia, and as we've pointed out, the majority of States 

and all seven circuits that have spoken to this question 

have all held that there is, in fact, a right to 

appointed counsel before the State in an -- in an 

assertedly civil contempt proceeding can deprive a human 

being of his liberty.

you're making to us are correct, why shouldn't the other 

accompaniments of a full-dress criminal trial apply -­

parent to fill out, and then in court the judge goes 

through it step by step: Are you working? How much are 

you making? Any -- do you have any other money? What 

expenses do you need for living?

problems that you referred to, maybe in particular cases 

there would be need for the appointment of counsel. But 

why isn't that adequate to deal with this situation 

rather than a categorical rule that you have to have 

counsel appointed in every case where there's an issue 

about ability to pay?

 MR. WAXMAN: It's -- that submission is

nature of the burden. Unlike in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 

where the mine-run of cases only involved the parole

factor, counsel probably is going to be required. And 

our submission is the mine-run of these cases involve 

the marshaling of evidence and testimony that 

uncounseled, uneducated defendants -­

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you mentioned 

Lassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said 

in passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation 

of parental status. And the Court said sometimes, in 

some cases, yes; but we're not going to make an 

across-the-board rule.

 Now, that deprivation, some people think, is 

the worst possible, for a custodial parent to be told 

you're no longer a parent, you no longer have a child. 

And yet, the Court said we're not going to provide 

counsel in every case, because in some cases the person 

can get a fair hearing without counsel.

that exists in our case law, which is that there is a 

presumption that an indigent defendant has a right to 

appointed counsel only when he loses or may be deprived 

of his liberties. Since that doesn't apply here, we 

have to do the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing against the 

presumption that cuts the other way.

Justice Ginsburg asked earlier. I just have the sense

country, and they're -- and they're very important in

going to ask for counsel and that we're going to change

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING REVERSAL

 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In civil contempt proceedings to enforce 

orders for child support, due process requires a 

meaningful opportunity to be heard on the simple and 

straightforward, but critical, question that 

characterizes remedial sanctions in this area: whether 

the nonpaying parent has the ability to pay. Such -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, you say that the 

procedures here were inadequate but that counsel in 

every case is not necessarily required. You say 

alternate procedures can provide people in this 

situation with a fair shake.

 But then, when you look at the procedures 

that you actually say would comply with due process, 

they are remarkably anemic. Basically, you say that a 

form has to be provided. You don't require that there 

be anybody attached to the court, the kind of person

that Justice Powell might have been talking about in 

Vitek, some kind of caseworker to assist the person with 

whatever questions he might have about the form or about 

how to fill it out. You don't require that the court 

make any findings. You don't require that the court 

even ask any questions.

 Apparently, your idea of the procedure is 

just to give a person a form. Am I reading you right?

 MS. KRUGER: No, I don't think you are, 

Justice Kagan. I think that we would say that there are 

three fundamental requirements for due process in this 

area. The first is both information regarding the 

nature of the inquiry that's going to be made at the 

hearing -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not 

hearing you. Could you speak more loudly?

 MS. KRUGER: I'm sorry. Certainly.

 The first is -- as, Justice Sotomayor, you 

referenced earlier, the first is information in advance 

of the hearing that a critical question to be answered 

at the hearing is going to concern ability to pay and a 

form or other type of procedure that would elicit 

information that's relevant to the alleged contemner's 

financial condition.

 The second would be a hearing at which the

alleged contemner has the opportunity to respond to any 

further inquiries that may be triggered by information 

that's already been provided. This is, I think, a 

common feature of many systems outside of South Carolina 

which, by case law, have recognized that when a court 

has concerns that information on a financial affidavit 

might be misleading or inaccurate, they have a duty to 

inquire further and to require supporting documentation 

as necessary to confirm or dispel concerns about the 

accuracy of the information.

 And then, finally, I think we would require 

an express finding that the -- the alleged contemner has 

the ability to satisfy the purge conditions such that 

the person can be said, not only theoretically, but also 

realistically, to have the keys to the jail cell in 

their pocket.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, as I -- and 

then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your 

argument is that I don't really know what the State's 

procedures are. Your -- your co-counsel, or Mr. Waxman, 

has said that there was actually a form. I don't know 

what that form looks like.

 The only thing that does seem missing that 

the State clearly provides is a requirement that the 

judge explain what the basis of his contempt finding is.

I'm looking at 60a and 61a, and this judge left it 

completely blank. So, is this a due process violation 

facially, or is this a due process violation as applied, 

meaning it's just not clear to me whether South -- the 

State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that 

you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and 

whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of 

whether, as applied, there was a failure or not.

 I mean, one of the difficulties in this case 

is that there was really very -- no findings by the 

judge whatsoever.

 MS. KRUGER: I think that's right, and I 

think it's also right that South Carolina, at least 

insofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding 

that the alleged contemner has the ability to comply 

with a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a 

finding of willful violation of the court's order.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the -- the form, 

the order for contempt of court itself, 61a, does 

require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he 

thinks the defendant is gainfully employed or has the 

ability to make the payments. So, it was just absent 

here.

 MS. KRUGER: The -- the question on the form 

relates to a past condition, as opposed to present

ability to comply with a purge condition. So, the two 

inquiries are distinct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't the 

requirement that the judge satisfy himself that there's 

a willful failure to comply with the order? Why doesn't 

that amount to saying the judge has to satisfy himself 

that this individual cannot pay, or can pay?

 MS. KRUGER: Justice -­

pay.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. KRUGER: I understand you, Justice 

Scalia. I think there are two separate questions, both 

of which concern ability to pay, but one of which is 

retrospective and the other is prospective.

 The question whether the alleged contemner 

has willfully violated a child support order is a 

retrospective question. During -- that the -- the 

alleged contemner missed child support payments because

court to say there's no constitutional right in this

one place you can look in order to see what features 

States are employing. We know anecdotally from talking 

to individuals who are responsible for running programs 

in individual States that they do ordinarily, even in 

States that don't categorically require the appointment 

of counsel, satisfy each of the three procedural 

protections that I outlined earlier in response to 

Justice Kagan.

 So, for example, in New Mexico, which hasn't 

recognized a categorical right to appointed counsel, 

there is a solicitation of financial information in 

advance of the hearing. That information is reviewed by 

a caseworker, who will make the decision whether or not 

to refer the case to civil contempt proceedings. There 

is a hearing at which further information is explored or 

elicited, and ultimately there's a determination made 

whether the alleged contemner has the ability to comply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about an aid who is 

not counsel? I mean, the family court has a lot of 

auxiliary people like child advocates who are there to 

assist people who need some kind of representation, but 

not necessarily a lawyer. Is that any part of yours -­

of what you would propose?

 MS. KRUGER: I think it would certainly be

assistance of a layperson who may not necessarily be a 

lawyer would be a requirement of due process, but I 

think given the nature of the inquiry which goes to 

financial condition, it's the kind of information that 

individuals provide on a regular basis without the 

assistance of either competent lay people or lawyers 

with legal expertise. It seems unnecessary to satisfy 

the commands of fundamental fairness in order to create 

that requirement across the board; in much the same way, 

I think it's unnecessary to appoint counsel in every 

case, as opposed to taking the modest and relatively 

inexpensive steps that we've outlined in order to ensure 

a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the form you have in 

mind something different than the form, the IFP form, 

that would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?

 MS. KRUGER: I don't think it would, Justice 

Ginsburg, but precisely what the form would contain 

would have to be tailored to the law in the relevant 

jurisdiction. So, where the determination is made on 

the basis of assets and income, it would be appropriate 

for the form to elicit that information. Where in other 

jurisdictions the law is clear that the other 

information may be relevant to that inquiry, it would be 

appropriate for the form to elicit that information as

well. But I think in substance the form would look very 

much like the form that this Court sees on a regular 

basis attached to its petitions for writs of certiorari 

and would also look very much like forms that are 

commonly applied in jurisdictions across the country in 

child support programs in order to establish the amount 

of child support obligation in the first place. South 

Carolina employs such a form for that purpose, and I 

think it would be a relatively trivial matter for South 

Carolina to use a similar form for the purpose of 

enforcement.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, could you say a 

bit more about the question that Mr. Waxman and Justice 

Scalia were talking about: how often these proceedings 

have the State on one side, how often they have the 

custodial parent on one side, you know, whether there is 

counsel for the opposite side in many of these cases?

 MS. KRUGER: There is in some, but not all, 

Justice Kagan. It's true that the State is often, 

though not always, represented in these proceedings, not 

always by lawyers as opposed to caseworkers or other 

nonlawyer personnel who work for the departments of 

social services.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BIBAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Mrs. Rogers and custodial mothers and 

parents like her need simple, fast, civil procedures to 

probe fathers' chronic failures to support their 

children. Today I'll make two points. First, this case 

is moot. Second, a per se right to appointed counsel is 

not essential to prevent fundamental unfairness.

 First, this case is moot. On remand, there 

is no possible redress for Petitioner. He seeks an 

advisory opinion but fails to bear his burden of proving 

that his case will evade review because he could get a 

stay. Litigants must preserve questions by seeking 

stays or supersedeas where available. Only where there 

is no procedure of which Petitioner could have availed 

himself to stay confinement, because a State statute had 

a blanket denial of bail pending appeal, did this Court 

in Sibron find that a dispute could not be stayed and so 

would evade review.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The South Carolina 

Supreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he 

was released, so they didn't consider it moot.

concepts of mootness than the Federal one?

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, that's right. 

And South Carolina deals with this issue -- obviously, 

in this Court the question is an Article III question. 

And because the evading review doctrine is an exception 

to Article III's normal requirements that Federal courts 

have jurisdiction only over live cases or controversies, 

it should be construed narrowly, only where essential to 

preserve review. Here Petitioner didn't ask for a stay;

why would the State here have granted a stay, if it

 MR. BIBAS: Your Honor is correct that the 

relief would be coming from the South Carolina State 

courts, and South Carolina ruled 241(c) appears to be 

tailor-made for this situation. And it instructs courts 

to consider whether a stay is necessary to preserve 

jurisdiction of the appeal or to prevent a contested 

issue from becoming moot. Our position is -­

case involving support payments in which the South

involving parental termination -- termination of 

parental rights from a family court, where the South

Carolina Supreme Court stayed the matter. And so, if 

Petitioner had asked, there's a substantial likelihood 

the court would have granted a stay through the South 

Carolina Supreme Court. At this point, under Rule 23, 

this Court could affirm a stay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the Petitioner know 

about Rule 23? Where had he learned about that? He 

didn't have counsel, right?

 MR. BIBAS: He had counsel as of no later 

than 3 weeks after the trial court hearing. He had 

counsel for 11 months of his sentence.

MR. BIBAS: That's right, 11 months before 

the case became moot.

 On the merits, a civil contempt case does 

not, as my adversary suggests, quote, "sound in criminal 

contempt" and require counsel, quote, "precisely to 

ensure that the proceeding remain civil."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it correct for me to 

think of both the Petitioner's argument and your 

response as a Mathews v. Eldridge problem?

 MR. BIBAS: No -- Your Honor, I believe the 

main argument here, and the only one the Petitioner 

argued in the courts below, is an absolute categorical

right that any loss of liberty equals an absolute right 

to counsel.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it does seem 

that absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite 

a -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr. 

Waxman's argument can be subsumed within the Mathews v. 

Eldridge framework.

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, that is his fallback 

argument, though it wasn't developed in the courts 

below, but I think it's important to note that because 

his argument approaches and, in fact, leads with an 

absolute claim -- to note the breadth of the rule. So, 

picking up on your question to Mr. Waxman, Justice 

Kennedy, it's important to note not only that 

Petitioner's rule would reach other civil contempts 

beyond child support, but because any loss of liberty is 

the overwhelming factor in his calculus, it would apply 

to tens of thousands of immigration and extradition 

cases each year.

 Petitioner's reply brief does not deny this, 

saying only that they might or might not be 

distinguishable. And immigration, we would submit, is 

an a fortiori from this case. The legal issues there 

are more complex, the deprivation is more severe, the 

confinement not purgeable. Any ruling --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just -- just assume 

that we could somehow block out that category. If you 

could focus just on the domestic relations support 

proceedings, would there be a basic change in the way 

those proceedings are being conducted in other States, 

if we ruled in favor of Petitioner and said there's an 

absolute right?

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Justice Kennedy, there'd be 

a massive change. Trial judges need to know ahead of 

time which sets of procedures to apply, civil or 

criminal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it true 

that most States in child support cases, when the 

defendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?

 MR. BIBAS: That is not true of most States, 

Justice Ginsburg. My understanding is 15 States 

recognize it as a constitutional matter, 11 additional 

States by statute, rule, or practice appear to recognize 

a statewide right to counsel. So, there's a bear 

majority. At least 17 States do not have a statewide 

right, and the remaining 7 are unclear.

 So, we're talking about reformulating rules 

in a huge number of States that probably affect hundreds 

of thousands of cases. I'd ask the Court to consider

the appendix to the Senators' brief. It's the best 

empirical evidence we have of how these proceedings 

work.

 And the evidence is relevant both to the 

need for these procedures in the balancing test Justice 

Kennedy refers to, but also the apparent relatively low 

reason to believe there's a large error rate here. 

According to that study, many parents -- non-supporting 

parents are cited for contempt and purged of their 

contempt; many fewer are, in fact, confined. It is -­

appears to be the threat that coerces enforcement and 

deters violation. Many parents do not pay up until 

after the contempt hearing and confinement is imminent. 

So, States would have to appoint counsel in a large 

number of cases, most of which wind up purging. So, the 

first point to note is that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the point was 

it's -- it's only if the defendant -- the claim is only 

if the defendant does not have the keys in his pocket 

because he has no money. So, in cases where typical a 

recalcitrant spouse won't pay until he's threatened with 

jail, that wouldn't come in this category. I thought 

Mr. Waxman was speaking about people who do not have the 

keys in their pockets because they simply cannot -- they 

do not have the wherewithal to pay.

MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, but very, very 

many non-supporting parents protest the same. And so, 

it is true that the slice of those brought to civil 

contempt hearings is only a small fraction of the 

overall caseload.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, and I -- and I 

suppose you could say that in -- in advance that the 

judge and the appointing authority simply wouldn't know.

 MR. BIBAS: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. Trial 

judges need to be able to protect themselves. They need 

to be able to know when they go into a hearing whether 

to apply civil or criminal procedures, and that's this 

Court's lesson in Hicks v. Feiock.

 Hicks said a judge needs to know ex ante 

based on a couple of simple rules, quote, "If the relief 

imposed here is in fact a determinate sentence with a 

purge clause, then it is civil," then civil procedures 

apply. And if the remedy runs to the injured party, 

then it is civil.

 But to -- even cases that have overturned 

erroneous civil contempts, do not, as my brother 

Mr. Waxman suggests, become punitive and criminal. 

Maggio and Shillitani recognize that they remain civil. 

Shillitani declined to find a right to indictment or 

jury trial because it was a civil case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I took the 

Solicitor General's position to be -- they may accuse me 

of not being accurate in what I took their position to 

be, which is the rule would be simple. You, a State, 

are free to run these procedures as you choose, but not 

to provide counsel, you have to meet some minimum 

Mathews v. Eldridge requirements. And so, the rule is 

simple. The State can do what it wants, but it has to 

provide minimum due process, and they've previously set 

forth the three. All right?

 So really the answer is, no, you're not 

automatically entitled to a lawyer if you're providing 

minimum due process. If you're not, then you have to 

provide a lawyer.

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? What's wrong 

with that rule? That, I think, is what the Solicitor 

General is suggesting. So, first, what's wrong with the 

rule? And then, second, in a case in which I did not 

see and haven't yet a form that really talks about or 

tells the contemptor about his defense and what he needs 

to prove, yes, he did get a hearing but not a hearing 

that explored his statement that he'd been looking for 

work and couldn't find it, and a form, a judgment that

doesn't address his current ability to pay. How does 

the South Carolina system comply with those minimums of 

due process?

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. First, I'll 

talk about the Solicitor General's suggestions that you 

raise and then talk about the specific procedures here. 

We think the Solicitor General's suggestions are 

interesting, they're worth exploring. They were raised 

for the very first time at the merits stage here; so, 

there's been no development. We don't know what other 

States are doing, the range of options out there, the 

nonconstitutional measures which in the criminal context 

for guilty pleas were developed through rulemaking, Rule 

11, lots of testimony and inquiry. That's appropriate 

for development when presented and allowing those other 

bodies the first crack at them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bibas, I have a 

question about -- about the position of the Government 

in this case. The Government agrees with you that you 

don't need counsel, but says that we ought to reverse 

the judgment anyway because there were -- because the 

other aspects of due process which the Government 

asserts would make it unnecessary to provide counsel did 

not exist in this case.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's fully within the power 

of the Government to say why, you know, in general 

counsel is not necessary because these other procedures 

are good enough. But then to come forward and say, 

moreover, those procedures were not applied in this case 

and, therefore, you should reverse, that's -- that's a 

new point, it seems to me, isn't it?

Sotomayor pointed out, that's not what this Court 

granted certiorari on. And this is a case -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about you -- you

which they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for 

that relief, even if they've asked for something that 

they can't get?

normally the one who doesn't pay.

 Is it true, for example, that in most such 

situations across the country, the woman has a lawyer, 

but the man doesn't? Is that true or isn't it true? 

There must be some organization that's studied that.

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. That's -- we 

don't have good nationwide statistics. What I can say 

is our understanding is that, first of all, Petitioner 

is incorrect in saying that the government has a lawyer 

here who is prosecuting. He is conflating the clerk of 

the court issuing a ministerial rule to show cause with 

the presence of a law-trained prosecutor. That is not 

the case in South Carolina. That is not the case in 

very many of the States.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, the answer to 

what I think of, in my own mind only, as very relevant, 

whether the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't, is:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that can't 

possibly be true, because we have cases applying the 

rule that this is capable of repetition, yet evading 

review. If the rule were you have to get a stay, we 

wouldn't have any of those cases.

 MR. BIBAS: They -- no, Your Honor. In 

abortion cases, election cases, stays are practically 

impossible. This is a different category of case, where 

stays are available, and those cases also seek 

prospective relief.

 If I might go back to the financial interest 

that you pointed out earlier, the reason the State would 

care here -- it's not that -- there's a State fisc 

interest that's substantial, but the reason that matters 

to my clients is because the huge fiscal burden here 

could deter many States from this enforcement. In fact, 

it has.

 In New Jersey, after the State supreme court

computation about what it would be -- what the counsel 

fee would be, as opposed to keeping someone in prison 

for a year?

 MR. BIBAS: We don't have those numbers, but 

I also believe that's not the correct inquiry, Your 

Honor, because it's not just the few people who are 

confined.

 As I was saying earlier, if the percentage 

of those going to these hearings were actually confined 

is in the single digit percentages, as some of the 

numbers in the States' appendix suggest, then you're 

getting a huge leveraging effect of many people being 

coerced into paying before going into confinement or 

immediately after going into confinement. So, the State 

can permissibly weigh those costs and benefits, and 

that's for the State legislature.

 To go back to Justice Breyer's question 

earlier about what due process might require, I think 

it's important to focus on that these procedures are 

straightforward, informal procedures, navigable by 

laymen. The most natural thing in the world when being 

accused of not paying is to say: But I can't pay. And 

to follow it up with an explanation. I applied for this 

job; I'm out of work; I got sick. There are things 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Did anybody look at housing 

courts?

 MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, housing courts -- I 

would think it's fairly common somebody owes somebody 

$25, or whatever it is, the judge says pay it into 

court, and what happens if they don't pay it into court?

 MR. BIBAS: We haven't looked at that, Your 

Honor, and I'm sure the same arises in administrative 

appeals and small claims court, any number of places. 

Here it's a simple intuitive issue, and South Carolina, 

like other States, uses relaxed, informal rules of 

evidence and procedure. There are effectively no rules 

of hearsay or authentication.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There are things the judge 

could have asked, though, that -- and put on the record, 

and it might have cleared this up. He could have -- the 

Petitioner here said he wasn't working and he couldn't 

work because he had been hurt, so the judge could have 

asked for medical records to substantiate that.

 And then the Petitioner admitted that until 

recently, apparently, he had been taking meth, he had 

been snorting coke. The judge could have said, all 

right, you had the money then to buy those drugs; now, 

where did you get that and why do you no longer have

that source of money? He could have gone through a few 

simple steps, couldn't he, to make this -- to eliminate 

the problems?

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and whether 

that's salutary or ought to be considered in a future 

case, it's not the question here. But that could be 

worth exploring. It is much lower cost than appointing 

counsel across the board.

 It's important to note that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little difficult to 

write the opinion, if you are to prevail, saying there's 

no absolute right, but there might be in some other 

case, depending. We don't give much help to the system 

that way, because it might be that ultimately we would 

find that the balancing test is more complex than simply 

appointing the counsel.

 MR. BIBAS: I don't believe this Court has 

to do that, Your Honor. In -- in cases such as Gagnon 

and Lassiter, this Court laid out factors, said there's 

no categorical right to counsel, and the lower courts -­

our examination of the post-Gagnon cases suggests most 

of them have said, well, this is a pretty routine case, 

85, 90 percent of the time -­

factors?

 MR. BIBAS: I -- I don't believe that it's 

necessary because we can't conceive of a legal issue 

here so complex that categorically a lawyer is 

necessary.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I don't understand 

how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due 

process procedures, you must meet more than minimum due 

process procedures. I mean, once we say that it's 

enough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not 

done A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must 

appoint counsel? All we can say is you must do A, B, 

and C. I don't know of any instance where we impose 

more than the due process minimum because you have 

failed to comply with the minimum.

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. Perhaps to go 

back to Justice Kennedy's point, if -- if the Court were 

concerned about more specific guidance, it could point 

to at least in situations that involve relaxed informal 

rules of procedure, where no rules of hearsay 

authentication, no jury trials, informal discovery, 

judges handle questioning, no State prosecutor, at least 

there, there might be no right to counsel.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I just don't 

know that all those things are properly before us.

MR. BIBAS: Well, then, the appropriate 

thing is to answer the question that was raised by 

Petitioner in this case and not to go -- no need to go 

beyond that, I would suggest.

 Finally, let me point out that the closest 

analogue in the legal system to the question here about 

inability to pay child support is inability to afford 

counsel. Our criminal justice legal system has 

extensive experience with that under the CJA, the 

Criminal Justice Act. In the Federal system and in most 

States, the burden is on the defendant to show his 

inability to pay counsel. He doesn't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Bibas, practically 

when those forms are used, the person fills out a form, 

and mostly they're just accepted, aren't they?

 MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I don't believe 

they're rubber-stamped. The statistics that I have seen 

show denial rates of 10 to 20 percent, in some counties 

as high as 35 percent. So, there is a meaningful 

inquiry and meaningful denials, and all of those cases 

would violate due process on Petitioner's logic. That 

cannot be the tidal wave to hit the criminal justice 

system. That is not an appropriate extension of due 

process because the issues here and there are simpler, 

far simpler than in Lassiter, a formal trial-type

adversarial procedure where nevertheless no categorical 

right to counsel was required.

 It's important to go back, if one looks at 

the roots of the right to counsel in Powell and Gideon 

and Zerbst, Powell talked about the need for the guiding 

hand of counsel who are skilled in the science of law in 

order to deal with technical defects in the charging 

instrument, to deal with incompetent, irrelevant, or 

evidence. In proceedings such as this, where there are 

no formal rules of pleading or evidence, there is not a 

need -- certainly not a need for a categorical right to 

counsel.

 If there are no further questions, may I 

conclude?

 Litigants can themselves argue the 

commonsense issue of ability to pay, just as they can 

address their ability to afford counsel without first 

having counsel, and the cost of appointing counsel 

across the board would deter States from enforcing 

custodial parents' and their children's rights, as it 

has in New Jersey. Thus, this Court should dismiss for 

want of jurisdiction or else affirm.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: I have three points. Thank 

you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First of all, I mean this -- the crux of 

this dispute comes down to whether this is some -- akin 

to some sort of simple form that can be filled out that 

any layperson, no matter how uneducated, can deal with.

 Second, the question is how much of a burden 

is this going to be on the States?

 And, third, the question of whether or not 

what counsel suggests as the Utah model or what he 

denigrates as the New Jersey model would be a way to 

square this circle.

 First of all, counsel says he can't conceive 

of a legal issue that can arise in this case. Let's 

just look at this case as an example. There was 

allegations of -- an admission of drug use. Does or 

does that not constitute an inability to pay? That is a 

legal question. It is not a factual question. 

Inability to comply is a legal defense, not a factual 

excuse.

 The allegation was he's not employed, but 

maybe he's not looking for work or he's underemployed. 

Is that inability to comply for purposes of a coercive 

contempt sanction? That is a legal question.

Our suggestion is he could be incarcerated 

so that he could be placed on work release in a county 

jail program and reduce his arrearage. Is that or is 

that not a permissible application of a coercive 

sanction of incarceration? The cases that we've seen 

have said no, but it is an open legal question.

 Even as to the marshaling of evidence, it is 

his burden not to just say, oh, I can't pay. He 

submitted a form that he filed for his disability 

payments that said I have no income and I have a car 

that's worth $1,500. Did he have to pay that car -­

sell the car to pay or not? That is a legal question.

 In terms of burden, the State is paying -­

there are approximately 15 percent of the State's jail 

population in any given year that are noncustodial 

parents that are serving terms, in this case two 6-month 

terms and a year term, at the cost -- according to the 

statistics, at the cost of between 13- and 17,000 

dollars a year. South Carolina, because it refuses to 

comply with the requirements of the Federal program, has 

already paid $72 million to the government in fines and 

owes another 10. And if you want to really reduce the 

cost, Justice Kennedy, and make this manageable, take 

the system that they are applauding in Utah or 

denigrating in New Jersey. When the court sends out its

showing whether you have income, whether you have 

assets, and whether you are unable to hire counsel. If

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, we don't have the 

Social Security disability form, but if the judge 

credited that and accepted that your client is -- was 

unable to work and had only the assets listed on that 

form, would he not then automatically be -- have shown 

that he had an inability to pay?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think the answer is yes, but 

we don't know whether the judge even looked at the form, 

and we know from South Carolina law that a mere 

assertion is not the marshaling of evidentiary support 

that's required to carry the burden.

 Thank you.
