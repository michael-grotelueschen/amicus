3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument next this morning in Case 11-1447, 


Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District. 

6  Mr. Beard? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II, 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  This case is about the extent to which 

12 Nollan and Dolan review should be made available to 

13 individuals to challenge excessive exactions imposed as 

14 conditions to land use approval. 

Here, before he could make small use of his 

16 property, Coy Koontz was told by the district that he 

17 had to finance enhancements to 50 acres of publicly 

18 held --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's back up. When he 

asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as 

21 mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to 

22 voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest 

23 of my property. So he recognized, from day one, that 

24 there had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking 

to do in the permit. Is that right?

1  MR. BEARD: That is correct. With his 

2 application, Justice Ginsburg, he did offer a mitigation 

3 in the form of a conservation easement on most of his 

4 property. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he had offered 

6 nothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop 

7 my land, and the agency said, you have offered no 

8 mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim? 

9  MR. BEARD: If there was no condition 

attached to the permit denial, then there would be no 

11 claim; although it would be up to the district, under 

12 Nollan and Dolan, to make the individualized 

13 determination, both of the amount of impact to wetlands 

14 and the amount necessary to offset. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he just put in 

16 the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any 

17 kind, and the agency says no. You recognize that he 

18 would have no claim, right? That he had an obligation 

19 to mitigate. 

MR. BEARD: It depends, Your Honor. If the 

21 denial was based on the idea that he was obligated to 

22 offer mitigation and that was the extent of the 

23 district's communication with him -- in other words, 

24 that the district told him, you must offer us something, 

we won't tell you what, and we'll let you decide what

1 you want to offer in mitigation -- if that was in the 

2 record and that was the -- and the result of that was a 

3 permit denial because Mr. Koontz said, for example, 

4 well, gee whiz, I don't know how much I need to mitigate 

for, you haven't told me, I still believe there would be 

6 a Dolan violation because, in Dolan, the Court made 

7 clear, there has to be an individualized 

8 determination --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: For what? For what? You 

wouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken. 

11  MR. BEARD: He wouldn't know where --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: You are -- you are posing a 

13 situation in which he never came forward with any 

14 suggestion. They never came forward with any 

suggestion. You say he still has a cause of action for 

16 a taking? 

17  MR. BEARD: Not for --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: A taking of what? 

19  MR. BEARD: Not for a taking, Your Honor, 

but he -- he may have a cause of action, under Nollan 

21 and Dolan, for the imposition of an unconstitutional 

22 condition that may not -- the contours of which may not 

23 be known. But the fact that the district told him, you 

24 need to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the other side says 

5

1 that you may have such a cause of action here. 

2  MR. BEARD: Excuse me. I didn't understand? 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't -- wouldn't the 

4 other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a 

cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here? 

6  MR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

7 they -- well, their argument --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are just saying 

9 you don't have a cause of action for a taking. 

MR. BEARD: That is correct. They -- they 

11 are saying that we don't have a cause of action for a 

12 taking. Of course, in Nollan and Dolan, there was no 

13 transfer of property from the applicant to the relevant 

14 agencies. 

As this Court will recall, in both Nollan 

16 and Dolan, there was an imposition of an exaction, and 

17 immediately, the applicant in both cases sued to prevent 

18 the unlawful exaction from being consummated. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I've had a 

problem with your argument, okay? From the record, it's 

21 very clear that a conservation offer is not considered 

22 mitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands. 

23 The policy is abundantly clear, stated, and undisputed. 

24 Okay? 

So, given that policy, why are we even in 

6

Official 

1 this case? Meaning whether there was an exaction or no 

2 exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial, 

3 you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the 

4 State was clear and, in my mind, unassailable: We have 

to preserve wetlands. Conservation of other wetlands is 

6 not enough. Mitigation means make sure that we get a 

7 net gain of wetlands. 

8  So why are we here? 

9  MR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor, we don't 

contest the legitimacy of the policy, of course, in 

11 preserving wetlands; nor do we contest, for that matter, 

12 the ratios that the district has imposed via its 

13 regulations. 

14  It is undisputed -- the trial court found 

below, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the finding 

16 was undisturbed in the Florida Supreme Court, that, in 

17 fact, the offsite mitigation -- that part of the 

18 mitigation that went beyond the conservation easement 

19 was in excess, it violated Nollan and Dolan. 

So the underlying factual findings are not 

21 in dispute. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you -- I think 

23 you have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look 

24 at the record, the record is very clear that it was 

not -- that the district didn't come back and say, take

1 it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands, or you 

2 get no permit. 

3  There was -- and if you -- they are set out 

4 in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at 

least half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district 

6 said, here are several ways -- several ways that you 

7 could sufficiently offset the adverse impact. And some 

8 of them had nothing to do with improving the 

9 government's own land. 

So if we can't -- we really can't say this 

11 was a take it or leave it, either you do the 

12 improvement that we are asking you to do, or you get no 

13 permit, what do you do with the fact that, as the 

14 appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered 

a range, it offered many, many ways that this permit 

16 might be granted. And then it says, then you are free 

17 to come up with some other -- something else. 

18  MR. BEARD: Justice Ginsburg, it's true that 

19 there were negotiations and that a range of offers were 

made. On Mr. Koontz's application to use 3.7 acres of 

21 his property in conjunction with the conservation 

22 easement, the district made a final decision denying him 

23 his permit because he would not go beyond the easement 

24 and offer offsite mitigation. 

And that is --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not -- because he 

2 wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's --

3 some of these options -- one was that he -- that he 

4 adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller. 

The -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that --

6 that's a different one. 

7  But there was one that suggested that he --

8 he reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of 

9 his project to one acre and preserve the rest for the 

conservation easement. Now, if that -- if he took that, 

11 would you have any -- any case here? 

12  MR. BEARD: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? If 

13 we took --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If they said, we will 

give you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the 

16 scale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the 

17 rest by a conservation easement? 

18  MR. BEARD: Unlikely not, Your Honor, 

19 because the trial court did conclude, based on the 

evidence, that he was having minimal impact on any 

21 viable wetlands. And so even a reduction in the size of 

22 the project, with an increase in the amount of 

23 mitigation, would have a fortiori gone beyond even what 

24 we have in this case. 

The court of appeals made clear, as a matter

1 of law, that Mr. Koontz did -- was entitled to a 

2 determination on the application he submitted. He 

3 submitted that application. And, as the district 

4 admitted in a pretrial statement right before trial, the 

denials were based exclusively -- and this is a quote --

6 "The denials were based exclusively on the fact that the 

7 plaintiff would not provide additional mitigation to 

8 offset impacts from the proposed project." 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beard, can I go back to 

Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I 

11 understand your answer to it? 

12  Suppose that the State just had a policy 

13 that said, We're concerned about wetlands; in order to 

14 develop your piece of property, you have to come forward 

with a proposal -- a mitigation proposal and an adequate 

16 mitigation proposal. And then it gives some guidance 

17 about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean, 

18 but it really leaves it up to the landowner. 

19  And the landowner says, sorry, I'm not 

giving you anything, I think I should be able to develop 

21 this on my own without providing any mitigation. Is 

22 that -- and -- and the State says, well, then, sorry, 

23 you don't get a permit. 

24  Is that a taking? Does the man have a 

takings claim? I heard you answer the question yes.

MR. BEARD: My answer was that he may have a 
Nollan/Dolan claim. I don't want to get confused about 
the term "taking" because "taking" could imply many 
kinds of regulatory takings claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I -- that's the next 
question I was going to ask you because my understanding 
of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the condition, 
if taken alone, would constitute a taking. 

Do you disagree with that? 
MR. BEARD: I do not disagree with that, 

Your Honor. 
JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So then you need a 

taking someplace in the picture; isn't that right? 
Nollan/Dolan says this is how we analyze takings in the 
context of a permit scheme. So we have to look for a 
taking. So, in my example, where is the taking? 

This was Justice Ginsburg's example. Where 
is the taking? 

MR. BEARD: Right. And I think that's 
correct, that, under Nollan and Dolan, you would have to 
have a condition that was imposed on you. 

My only point was would it be lawful --
or there be a problem in the district shifting its 
burden on to the applicant and saying, we're not going 
to establish what mitigation is required, and we're not 
going to establish what the impacts are, we'll leave

1 that up to you, you give us what you think is -- is 

2 necessary. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district 

4 did -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform 

policy that, for every acre you develop, you have to 

6 preserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands. 

7  And then two cases, both hypothetical, one 

8 is somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to 

9 develop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they 

mitigate for wetlands. The other person has only one 

11 acre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole 

12 acre. 

13  Can the district then say, we'll give you 

14 the one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands 

on 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for 

16 you elsewhere? The hypothetical being designed to point 

17 out whether or not the crux of your argument is that he 

18 had to go off -- offsite. 

19  MR. BEARD: The crux is not that he had to 

go offsite, but that -- that did play into the trial 

21 court's analysis as to the connection between his impact 

22 and what was being required, and there was testimony 

23 below that there was no connection there. And the fact 

24 that the mitigation was four to seven miles away played 

into the analysis as to whether there was a connection.

1  It's not --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, in my hypothetical, 

3 you would -- would there be a violation in my 

4 hypothetical, as you understood it? 

MR. BEARD: It depends, Your Honor, because 

6 you have to determine what -- in each respective 

7 hypothetical, what the impact was actually to the 

8 wetlands and then determine what the appropriate 

9 mitigation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you normally 

11 decide whether the agency has done that right or not? 

12  MR. BEARD: Excuse me? 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you normally 

14 decide? Let's assume Justice Kagan's question -- or 

Justice Ginsburg's question. No -- it just says, come 

16 to us with a mitigation plan. And you say, this is what 

17 I offer, and it's enough. And they say, no, it's not 

18 enough; denied. 

19  Would you go through the State 

administrative process, to figure out whether that was 

21 arbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central 

22 violation? What would you do with that claim in the 

23 normal circumstance? Justice Kennedy's question. 

24  MR. BEARD: In the normal circumstance, if 

there was no condition imposed, there would not be a

1 Nollan and Dolan claim. There may be another kind of 

2 claim, say, under Penn Central, and that could be 

3 brought. That wouldn't have to be brought via 

4 administrative remedies, if there was a final agency 

action --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would be an inverse 

7 condemnation. 

8  MR. BEARD: Correct. It could be an inverse 

9 condemnation type of a claim. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what I think might 

11 be driving some of these questions is the district court 

12 says -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional 

13 mitigation -- the additional that would have cost 

14 $10,000, he would have gotten the permit. That's what 

he said. 

16  So then you look back to see what additional 

17 mitigation. And, here, we have in the record, at least 

18 that my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they 

19 went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices: 

Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the 

21 development -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce 

22 the size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the 

23 slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate 

24 a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres 

somewhere else.

1  Now, at that point, when -- and then they 

2 said, won't you negotiate for 30 more days, maybe we can 

3 find some other things? He says, no, I'll bring a 

4 lawsuit. Okay. 

Now, I absolutely can see a Penn Central 

6 claim there. But the land -- what you're talking about 

7 is not some land somewhere off the site. We're talking 

8 about his land. If, after all, they said you have to 

9 leave all the coal in the mine to hold up the ceiling --

you know what I'm referring to -- then they go too far. 

11  And, here, if we look at all these 

12 conditions proposed and said -- you know, this is just 

13 terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your 

14 client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just 

goes too far, you win under Penn Central. 

16  So I can see the framework here. I'm not 

17 saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the 

18 framework is. But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan 

19 business into it, and I get confused. And the reason is 

because there was a different piece of land in Nollan 

21 and Dolan. 

22  The piece of land that was different was an 

23 easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of 

24 property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan, 

right across his property.

1  So -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan 

2 have to do with this. I see everything that Penn 

3 Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the 

4 nature of what was being offered. You are saying what 

they are offering you is simply going too far. Okay. 

6 I've got that conceptually. 

7  I ask this question because all these briefs 

8 are about Nollan and Dolan, and I don't understand what 

9 they have to do with it. I must be missing something, 

and that's why I am asking you. 

11  MR. BEARD: Justice Breyer --

12 Justice Breyer, Nollan and Dolan, fundamentally, are 

13 about whether a property owner has been singled out to 

14 bear public burdens that, in fairness and --

JUSTICE BREYER: But, of course, they are 

16 land claims because they took a piece of land, which 

17 everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and 

18 said, you've got to let everybody from the beaches walk 

19 back and forth from one beach in the north to another 

one in the south, and they are going to walk over your 

21 land. 

22  And the Court said, you can't take his land 

23 unless you have a nexus to some public purpose that is 

24 related to his building the house. I got it. I just 

don't see what it has to do with this case.

1  MR. BEARD: Because you -- you can have an 

2 unconstitutional condition imposed on your right to do 

3 something, in this case, make use of your property. And 

4 the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can. In 

6 fact, there is too much coal. That's an 

7 unconstitutional condition. It goes too far, and there 

8 is a framework called Penn Central, which deals with it. 

9  MR. BEARD: Penn Central is a special 

takings case that goes to the question of whether a 

11 regulation of the use of property that is sought to be 

12 developed has gone too far so as to affect the taking. 

13  Penn Central is not --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which -- how does that 

not address going too far? You just said it. If -- if 

16 this is unrelated to the -- the denial of your permit of 

17 all uses of your land, and you're saying that's the 

18 problem, which is I still have a use, I just want more, 

19 why does that entitle you to your lost profits? 

When were you ever entitled to start with 

21 the claim that, somehow, you're entitled to a permit, as 

22 a matter of law? 

23  MR. BEARD: We're entitled, under the 

24 Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, to not have to 

bear a public burden that has no bearing on the impact

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's fine. That --

3 that would enable you to challenge the denial of the 

4 permit, saying it's based upon an unconstitutional 

condition. But how does it -- how does it enable you to 

6 say there's been a taking? What has been taken? 

7  MR. BEARD: What has been -- what has been 

8 taken, in effect, is his funds that have to be put now 

9 to a public use, the enhancement of 50 acres of public 

wetlands. And there is nothing in the Takings Clause --

11 nothing --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: It hasn't -- it hasn't been 

13 taken. I mean, he turned it down. 

14  MR. BEARD: Nothing was taken in Nollan and 

Dolan, either. What was proposed there, though, was a 

16 threat of a taking. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the permit was 

18 granted in Nollan and Dolan. And -- and the condition 

19 attached to the permit, therefore, took effect; namely, 

that you had to dedicate this easement over your -- over 

21 your beach, whereas, as my colleague pointed out, 

22 anybody could walk back and forth, barefooted. 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  MR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, in Nollan and

as soon as you comply; which is substantively the same 

6 as saying, we won't give you your permits until you say 

7 yes to our conditions. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Look, we have 

9 the same question. I just want an answer to my 

question. And, for the purposes of this question, I am 

11 assuming enormously in your favor. I am assuming that 

12 this set of conditions is the worst thing since sliced

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's been proved 

(Laughter.) 


JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- but -- but in 


24 any case, the -- the point is, you see, I assume that in 

your favor. I'm trying to figure out the conceptual 

19

1 framework. I assume that in your favor. I assume 

2 whether they didn't issue the permit and would have, but 

3 they haven't quite, or maybe they have -- it means 

4 nothing. 

Now, having assumed that, it seems to me 


6 what your argument is, is that this is a form of 


7 regulatory taking of the kind that Holmes was talking 


8 about. And that -- that's what was going on in -- in 


9 Penn Central, and so we simply look to see if it went 


too far or whatever. The lower courts could do that. I 

11 got that part. 

12  Now, I want you to answer the question, 

13 which is, am I right? Is there another part -- a 

14 different part to this case, called the Nollan/Dolan 

part and explain that to me. That's why I asked the 

16 question. I want to hear what you're going to say. 

17  MR. BEARD: Justice Breyer, there is another 

18 part, a very distinct part, and that part goes to the 

19 question of the condition that produced the denial. So 

there are -- there are actually two parts here. There's 

21 the -- the conditioning of your permit; in other words, 

22 we will not issue you permits unless you agree to 

23 perform offsite mitigation. 

24  Now, the question, under Nollan and Dolan, 

is was that condition constitutional? Was he asked to

Official 

1 give up something that the State -- or the district, in 

2 this case, should not have asked him to give up in 

3 exchange for his right to use his property? 

4  Now, it's true as -- as, Justice Breyer, you 

mentioned, that the permit denial and whether that 

6 affects a regulatory taking of his land, of the thing he 

7 wants to use, that's an entirely different question. 

8 And it may raise another kind of claim -- another kind 

9 of taking claim. 

But the crux of the claim that was litigated 

11 in this case, from the trial court all the way up to the 

12 Florida Supreme Court, is was the condition to perform 

13 offsite mitigation -- and that was accepted as true by 

14 the courts below, that this was a condition that had 

been --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the record just 

17 doesn't bear that out; the record shows that it wasn't 

18 one option. They gave him a laundry list of things he 

19 could do, some -- some of them having nothing whatever 

to do -- anything off his own property. 

21  Suppose the -- whatever the district court 

22 might have said, the record shows that the agency said, 

23 you're right, seven things you could do, come up with 

24 here are six, if you have something else. And some of 

them have absolutely nothing to do with other 

21

25

Official 

1 properties. 

2  MR. BEARD: We agree that there were 

3 negotiations and that, even in the order, it's alleged 

4 that various options were provided to Mr. Koontz, but, 

ultimately, the decision -- as the district admits, the 

6 decision -- the final decision to deny the permit 

7 application for 3.7 acres of use was Mr. Koontz's 

8 refusal to acquiesce in the condition that he perform 

9 50 acres of offsite improvements. 

And, by the way, the reference --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is that? 

12  MR. BEARD: It's in the Joint Appendix, 

13 pages 70 to 71, which is the pretrial statement where 

14 each party sets forth his and her position. There, the 

court -- I'm sorry -- the district made clear that the 

16 condition that had been refused and was the cause of the 

17 permit denial was the one to perform offsite mitigation 

18 at a cost of a range between $10,000 on the low end. 

19 Our experts said in the range of 100 to 150,000 -- 90 to 

150,000. 

21  So the district, later on -- even in the 

22 Florida Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg, said, in its 

23 Petitioner's brief on jurisdiction, at page 1, that it 

24 required additional mitigation before it would authorize 

the permits and that, quote, "Additional mitigation

1 would be offsite because the available conservation land 

2 onsite was, in the district's view, insufficient 

3 mitigation." 

4  So there's no question that an actual 

condition was imposed, whose rejection produced a permit 

6 denial. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't 

8 think anybody is contesting that there was a condition 

9 imposed or maybe there are. But -- you know, there's 

another question whether that condition is a taking. And 

11 we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here. 

12 In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a 

13 piece of land, so that's the taking. Now, you said the 

14 funds are the taking; is that correct? 

Any time that somebody comes up with a 

16 proposal for -- for a developer to pay money, in order 

17 to compensate the State for the costs that are 

18 associated with his development, that that is, itself, a 

19 taking? 

MR. BEARD: I want to be clear that we're 

21 not saying that all monetary fees or exactions would be 

22 subject to Nollan and Dolan, only within the permit 

23 context -- the special context of land use permitting is 

24 it --

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I understand. But, in

1 the permit context, a State can't say to somebody, you 

2 have to pay to perform some service or to compensate 

3 without it being a taking and without it being subject 

4 to Nollan and Dolan analysis. 

MR. BEARD: Correct. If the State or if the 

6 government or the permitting authority asks for the --

7 for the property owner to give up property, even money 

8 to be put to a public use, and it's not an application 

9 for your user fee or something like that, it's for 

mitigation, that should be subject --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so, for example -- and 

12 I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State 

13 just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill 

14 in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's 

subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too. 

16  MR. BEARD: Correct. It would be subject to 

17 Nollan and Dolan analysis, to determine if there really, 

18 on the ground, there's a connection between the 

19 impact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it -- it would be 

21 subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the 

22 $10,000. If they issued the permit, the developer went 

23 ahead with the development, and the State then attached 

24 the -- the bank account in the amount of $10,000 or 

whatever, that would be Nollan -- in Nollan and Dolan --

1 in Nollan, there was a taking. 

2  He had gone ahead with the -- with the 

3 development of his house under the permit, which said, 

4 if he did that, he gave away the easement. So there --

there was a -- a taking there. The -- the easement 

6 would have been taken automatically. 

7  In -- in -- in Dolan, there was -- the 

8 individual had not gone ahead with the development, but 

9 it was clear that any development the person undertook 

would be subject to the -- the exaction that the 

11 municipality required. So there was a -- a taking 

12 there, we said. 

13  Here, there's nothing that happens. The 

14 permit was denied, unlike in -- unlike in -- in Dolan, 

where the permit was granted, and it was understood 

16 that, if she went ahead with it, she was going to 

17 lose -- lose some land rights. Here, the permit's been 

18 denied. I can't see where there's a taking here. 

19 Nothing's been taken. 

MR. BEARD: In Nollan and Dolan, Your Honor, 

21 nothing was taken, either. In Nollan, you had a permit 

22 approval with conditions. It's true that development 

23 had not gone forward, but, here, as well, development 

24 had not gone forward. 

Presumably -- theoretically, if the

3 would submit to the Court --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: The permit had issued. The 

permit had issued in both of those cases, and, 

6 therefore, the person was saying, to go ahead with this 

7 permit, I give up -- I give up this land. 

8  MR. BEARD: The permits in Nollan and Dolan 

9 actually did not issue. There was only approval, with 

conditions, and there is a difference. And that is no 

11 different from what happened here. The threat is the 

12 same. You don't get a permit issued to you until you --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: There was no approval with 

14 conditions. There's one thing for -- for a municipality 

to issue an -- an approval with conditions, and a 

16 municipality saying, we can't approval it unless you 

17 agree to these conditions. And the person doesn't 

18 agree, and the municipality says, we don't approve it. 

19  MR. BEARD: But, in either case, he -- he 

faces the threat, the unconstitutional condition on his 

21 use of his property, you don't get your use until you 

22 comply with our conditions.

17  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

18  MR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

19 please the Court: 

The parties agree that Florida may require a 

21 landowner to perform mitigation as a condition for a 

22 permit that would allow the destruction of a wetlands. 

23 The parties disagreed as to how much mitigation was 

24 appropriate in this case. 

The district thought that Mr. Koontz's

25

Official 

1 proposal was insufficient to mitigate the -- the damage 

2 to wetlands. Mr. Koontz rejected the district's 

3 counterproposals, and he refused to do anything more. 

4 And the district denied his permit application because 

he refused to do anything more. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make any 

7 difference, in his refusing to do anything more, whether 

8 the condition is onsite or offsite? 

9  MR. WOLFSON: I don't think it makes any 

difference, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, the -- under the 

11 Florida regulatory regime, we cannot demand certain 

12 conditions from the landowner. 

13  The -- we are obligated -- if the -- if the 

14 permit -- the landowner has to establish, under his 

permit application -- and it's his burden -- that he 

16 meets the various standards -- the public interest 

17 standard, which includes no adverse impact --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all 

19 State -- State law provisions you are talking about. 

MR. WOLFSON: Correct. Correct. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about is 

22 there -- is there anything in the Federal Constitution 

23 that limits the conditions that you can demand?

2  I think that the question is -- when you are 

3 talking about what analytical rubric you should apply, 

4 whether it be Nollan or Dolan or Penn Central, I think 

you can always argue that the impact of any of the 

6 conditions that we would demand -- and I will assume 

7 here that they are true demands -- you can always argue 

8 that the impact of the conditions, be they onsite, 

9 offsite, or monetary, would be so burdensome that it 

would call into play Penn Central or --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- but 

12 there is no -- there is no restraint on the agency. It 

13 can ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit? 

14  MR. WOLFSON: Well, I don't -- I think that 

Penn -- first of all, I think there are many restraints 

16 on the agency. First of all, I think Penn Central 

17 imposes a restraint on the agency. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know of any 

19 case where the government has lost a Penn Central case? 

MR. WOLFSON: In -- yes. There are several 

21 in this case, Mr. Chief Justice. I mean, Hodel v. 

22 Irving is a Penn Central case, I believe, and I think 

23 Kaiser-Aetna was also a Penn Central case.

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't happen 


very often. 

6  MR. WOLFSON: Well, it is -- certainly, the 

7 burden is on the landowner, but -- but I think that Penn 

8 Central -- I think that, in Lingle, when this Court tried to 

9 sort of restore -- you know, some -- some coherence to 

the -- to the takings jurisprudence and repudiated the 

11 Agins point, the Court pointed out that -- that the --

12 what -- that the normal -- sort of the normal 

13 jurisprudence is that the government is not required to 

14 establish, by a heightened scrutiny, sort of that there 

is a connection between means-ends analysis, when it 

16 engages in economic -- economic regulation. 

17  And that --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just -- just to nail 

19 it down, your -- your position is that there is no limit 

in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can 

21 demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit? 

22  MR. WOLFSON: No, no, no. I don't think 

23 that is our position. First of all, the Due Process 

24 Clause may certainly impose conditions. The Equal 

Protection Clause may certainly impose conditions.

4  MR. WOLFSON: If -- if the conditions are so 

onerous that it would make it essentially impossible to 

6 derive any value from the land, that may very well call 

7 into question Penn Central or Lucas. I mean, in many 

8 ways, this case could have been litigated as a very 

9 straightforward Penn Central case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the 

11 agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let 

12 you develop your land, if you contribute a million 

13 dollars to our new football stadium? 

14  MR. WOLFSON: Justice Kennedy, I think that 

that might very well raise a Penn Central or Lucas claim. 

16 It also sounds like --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't raise Penn 

18 Central. You keep on running away from it by saying 

19 Penn Central or Lucas. 

MR. WOLFSON: Well, it's not --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: It does not deprive the 

22 land of all value. The land still has some value. Penn 

23 Central is totally out of the case.

2  And it's not a Nollan or Dolan claim because 

3 it's not a -- the -- the -- as -- as my friend 

4 acknowledged, the question in Nollan and Dolan -- or the 

rationale of Nollan and Dolan is would the condition, by 

6 itself, if demanded unilaterally and outside the 

7 permitting context, would -- would that have been a 

8 taking of property for which just compensation would 

9 have been required? 

So the --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure it would have 

12 been -- sure it would have been, if they just went 

13 along -- to a landowner, and the landowner is there, 

14 minding his own business, and they say, well, you own 

some property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a 

16 football stadium. 

17  That would be -- that would be 

18 unconstitutional, right? 

19  MR. WOLFSON: I think -- I think that 

would -- I mean, I think that would violate -- could 

21 well violate the Due Process Clause. It's hard to 

22 see what the -- you know, what the rationality of it is. 

23  But I don't think that this Court has 

24 ever -- has ever extended the concept of a taking to 

requirements that a landowner -- that anybody -- or a

6  And that --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: I'm trying to understand 

8 what would be -- what would be left of Nollan and Dolan, 

9 if we agree with you. 

Let me give you three situations. First, 

11 the petition -- the district says, we are granting your 

12 permit on the condition that you give us one-third of 

13 your land. That's Nollan and Dolan, right? 

14  MR. WOLFSON: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Situation number 2, 

16 permit is denied, but it will be granted, if you give us 

17 one-third of your land. What about that? 

18  MR. WOLFSON: I think, in that situation --

19 in other words, if the situation is really exactly the 

same like Nollan and Dolan, but the permit is denied, 

21 but it's clear that it is a concrete -- concrete 

22 condition, the landowner can go up through the judicial 

23 review process and say, this is -- you know, the denial 

24 of the permit application is predicated on an 

unconstitutional condition, and you should set that

3 first example, for purposes of Nollan and Dolan? 


4  MR. WOLFSON: Almost. Almost, 


Justice Alito. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now let me to get to 

7 my third. The permit is denied, but it will be granted, 

8 if you give us the fair market value of the third of the 

9 land, and, once you have done that, then we're going to 

condemn your land and pay you the fair market value for 

11 it. 

12  MR. WOLFSON: Justice Alito, I think that 

13 this Court's decision -- there are -- this Court's 

14 decision in Village of Norwood, essentially says, if 

what is going on is just a pure contrivance to avoid the 

16 requirement of compensation in the Just Compensation 

17 Clause, that the Court has said, no, it will look 

18 through and -- to the substance of the demand and 

19 determine that there was -- you know, essentially, an 

evasion of the just compensation requirement. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: As I understand your 

22 position, cash is magical, right? The -- the government 

23 can come in and -- come into my house, take all of the 

24 cash that's there, and that is not the basis for a takings 

claim, right? Because cash is not -- is not a taking.

2  MR. WOLFSON: Well, first of all, 

3 Justice Scalia, of course, this case, we don't believe 

4 involves cash. It involves a requirement to do 

something that costs money, which is -- is different 

6 from cash. 

7  I mean, cash is -- the problem with 

8 extending -- the problem with extending the takings 

9 concept to a monetary obligation, which can be paid for 

out of sort of undifferentiated funds --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

12  MR. WOLFSON: -- is that it has -- it has no 

13 logical stopping point. I mean, the court --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: The stopping point is don't 

take my cash. 

16  MR. WOLFSON: Well, but the --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your answer to my 

18 question is, that's okay, it's not a taking, right?

6 the -- the identifiable dollar bills that are in your --

13 have to turn over to us whatever money you have in your 

14 house, or you have to turn over to us whatever's in your 

bank account, that's not a taking. 

16  MR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia, I think there 

17 are many -- there are many constitutional claims that 

18 could be made. And I also want to add, there is an 

19 extensive overlay of State law in this area that 

protects landowners from arbitrary, irrational, 

21 intrusive, excessive demands by government agencies. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the 

23 things the -- the Federal provision, the Takings Clause, 

24 is designed to prevent property owners from having to 

bear the costs that should be borne by the people as a

1 whole. 


2  The football stadium example, there is no 


3 reason that a particular landowner should have to pay 


4 for the football stadium, simply because he owns 


property. 

6  The Takings Clause is designed to make sure 

7 that those exactions are not imposed on property owners, 

8 but spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit 

9 from it. And I guess I don't understand why you say 

that the Takings Clause is the one provision that 

11 doesn't apply in that type of situation. 

12  MR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the 

13 Armstrong policy of the -- that the government -- that 

14 an individual person should not be forced to bear what 

society should -- what should be spread to society as a 

16 whole -- is not violated when the government insists 

17 that a landowner comply with a generally applicable 

18 regulation. 

19  Now, of course -- of course --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The generally 

21 applicable regulation in the football stadium 

22 hypothetical is not generally applicable. It says, you 

23 are the owner of this property, and if you want to 

24 develop it, you've got to build a football stadium.

3 regulation or requirement would ever be imposed on any 

4 other landowner sounds -- you know, like -- you know, 

sounds like an equal protection claim, if the government 

6 just picks out one landowner. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they do it to five 

8 or six other landowners, okay? 

9  MR. WOLFSON: Well, then I think you have to 

ask -- but, then, Justice Scalia, I think you have to 

11 ask what -- what regulatory scheme is the government --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's -- let's 

13 put -- let's put it this way: I take it, it's -- it's a 

14 given that the government cannot take an easement on 

your property. It cannot use your property for its own 

16 purposes. It cannot park its trucks there. It cannot 

17 cut the grass. 

18  Why is it that, if it can't do those, it can

to its highest and best use, to pay them money?

24 the government?

1 several reasons, Justice Kennedy. First of all, I think 

2 that this nation has a long legal tradition of giving 

3 unique legal protection to property, as opposed to 

4 money. 

I mean, there are many circumstances -- many 

6 circumstances, where the government can say to an 

7 individual, you must give me $1,000, but cannot say --

8 or a group of individuals or -- but cannot say to the 

9 same group or individual, you must give me land worth 

$1,000. 

11  I mean, there -- that -- that is what the 

12 Just Compensation Clause --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Really? Gee, that doesn't 

14 strike me as -- as entirely true. 

MR. WOLFSON: Well, Justice --

16 Justice Scalia, the government obviously --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean a tax that is 

18 imposed only on landowners, and it's -- you know, it's a 

19 tax -- $5,000 per landowner, if that were replaced by a 

provision that said, every -- every landowner shall 

21 contribute to the State a portion of his property worth 

22 $5,000, that --

23  MR. WOLFSON: I think that would --

former's okay?

1  MR. WOLFSON: I think that would raise very 

2 serious questions. I mean, I don't know that this Court 

3 has ever -- has ever been faced with exactly such a 

4 case, but I think that would raise very serious 

questions. 


6  JUSTICE BREYER: So that -- am I 


7 wrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the 


8 framework, roughly, is the following: it is not the 


9 case that Penn Central applies only where there is a 


physical invasion of property, or there is total 

11 destruction of the value of the property. 

12  In those two situations, what we said in 

13 Lucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but 

14 there are another set of cases where Penn Central and 

McMahon apply with case-specific inquiry. 

16  And those, to discover whether you have one, 

17 you look into such things as whether the regulation 

18 destroys investment-backed expectations. And then you 

19 look to the nature of the government interest and the 

relationships, et cetera. That's what I thought the 

21 framework was. 

22  Now, if that's the framework, then, when the 

23 government says, I will let you develop your land if and 

24 only if you give $50,000 to the Shriners Hospital, you 

would say, I can't develop my land. And, besides, that

1 significantly interferes with my investment-backed 

2 expectations. And, besides, there is no relation 

3 whatsoever. Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause. 

4  Now, I spell all that out because I -- if 

I'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about 

6 the framework, that can apply to this case. If I am 

7 wrong about the framework, I want to know where in the 

8 cases I'm wrong. 

9  MR. WOLFSON: Justice Breyer, we think that 

you are right about that framework. That -- and -- and 

11 just six weeks ago in the --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That surprises me. 

13  MR. WOLFSON: In the -- well, just six weeks 

14 ago, in the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission case, this 

Court reiterated that Penn Central is presumed to be the 

16 test. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, if I'm right 

18 about the framework, that takes care of all the 

19 hypotheticals you were asked. In those cases, there is 

a significant interference with investment-backed 

21 expectation. And there's no justification whatsoever, 

22 so the Takings Clause applies. 

23  MR. WOLFSON: We agree, Justice Scalia, and 

24 we don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Justification is the

1 protection of wetlands. That's a justification, the 

2 protection of wetlands. 

3  There's no necessary comparison, as Nollan 

4 and Dolan requires, between the harm that would be 

occasioned if the permit were granted and what the State 

6 is exacting in order to mitigate. 

7  That -- that doesn't exist anywhere in -- in 

8 the analysis that you are talking about. 

9  MR. WOLFSON: Well, Justice Scalia, there 

are -- there is another problem with the Nollan and 

11 Dolan claim in this case, which is it's hard to see how 

12 you can have an exactions takings claim when nothing has 

13 ever actually been exacted --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that is a problem. 

(Laughter.) 

16  MR. WOLFSON: And -- right. 

17  And so -- and, in this case, if the -- if 

18 the claim for the taking is -- for the compensation is 

19 based on Nollan and Dolan, it seems that there is a 

mismatch and that what the Petitioner is trying to do is 

21 sort of take the Nollan/Dolan heightened scrutiny 

22 government -- government bears the burden of proof 

23 analysis and sort of convert that into what is the 

24 regulatory takings analysis for the entire parcel of his 

land, which is -- which is the measure of damages that

3 now, this is --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that your 

point goes to the question that has been raised about --

6 there's no permit issued. He didn't accept the -- the 

7 permit. And I don't understand that proposition. 

8  Are you saying that, if you are confronted 

9 with an unconstitutional condition, you have to accept 

it, and then you can challenge it? You can't simply say 

11 you denied that on the basis of an unconstitutional 

12 condition, and that's wrong? 

13  MR. WOLFSON: No, that's not our argument, 

14 Mr. Chief Justice. Florida has opened an avenue for 

judicial relief for you to go up through the Florida EPA 

16 process, just like the Federal EPA, where you can say, 

17 stop -- stop the district from doing this to me; they 

18 are predicating their -- either their grant or their --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm trying to 

get to the Federal. You often fall back to the State 

21 provisions. I'm looking at the Federal Constitution. 

22  And, assuming the State provisions give you 

23 no relief, is it your position that he has no claim, 

24 unless he accepts a permit with unconstitutional 

conditions?

1  MR. WOLFSON: If there is no -- if there's 

2 no kind of avenue, as I was saying, then I would think 

3 we would then -- you would have to obtain -- you have to 

4 seek compensation, but your compensation is for the 

value of your land that was taken. 

6  And, in Lingle, this Court reiterated that 

7 the Takings Clause is not a substantive limitation on 

8 the government's power to regulate. The -- the Takings 

9 Clause -- or as I should call it, the Just Compensation 

Clause -- is a requirement that if -- that the 

11 government will pay you just compensation for any 

12 property or property interest it has seized from you. 

13  It does not -- it does not, itself, impose 

14 a -- a requirement that the government substantively 

justify its regulation. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wolfson, why isn't it 

17 entirely reasonable to say, if you are going to put a 

18 condition on a permit, that condition has to have some 

19 rough proportionate relationship to the harm that is 

being done to the permit -- what -- that seems to me 

21 perfectly sensible, that if they are going -- if they 

22 are going to exact a condition, the condition has to 

23 have some discrete proportional relationship to the 

24 harm? 

MR. WOLFSON: Justice Ginsburg, I think that

1 the district thought that they were acting roughly 


2 proportional. In other words, we are -- we are not 


3 saying that the government shouldn't act -- that 


4 government should not act reasonably. 


But I think that, when you force these cases 

6 into court under the Nollan/Dolan framework, you have 

7 a -- you have basically a mismatched and extraordinarily 

8 complex situation. And you have -- you run right into 

9 what this Court said in Lingle, which is that it is not 

ordinarily the Court's -- the appropriate approach to 

11 require the government to bear the burden of proof. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in Penn Coal v. 

13 Mahon, the government didn't enter the property. It 

14 didn't take the property in the physical sense of moving 

in inappropriate. It just says, congratulations, 

16 you have some coal under your land, and we hope you 

17 enjoy it because you can't move it. 

18  And we said that is a taking, that is a 

19 regulation that goes too far. And it deprived, as 

Justice Breyer indicated, the owner of investment-backed 

21 expectations, although that word wasn't in Penn-Mahon. 

22  MR. WOLFSON: Correct. And, 

23 Justice Kennedy, nobody is disputing that Mr. Koontz 

24 could have made the argument that the regulation goes 

too far in the sense of the burden on his proposed

14  SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

16 please the Court: 

17  I would like to emphasize, at the outset, 

18 that Petitioner's argument that Nollan and Dolan should 

19 apply in this context would -- would constitute a 

radical change in the -- in the way standard generally 

21 applicable regulatory programs are operated. 

22  It is standard procedure, when someone 

23 applies for a permit from the government, it is the 

24 permit applicant's burden to establish that he complies 

with the regulatory program.

1  Nollan and Dolan shift that burden to the 

2 government. That has never been the case under 

3 regulation, including land use regulation. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: What was taken in Nollan 

and Dolan? 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: If -- if --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: In Nollan, was it the 

8 easement that was taken? 

9  MR. KNEEDLER: That is what -- if -- if the 

permit had issued and the -- and an easement was 

11 granted, yes, it was the easement. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it -- wasn't what 

13 was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to 

14 make the alterations to his house that he wanted to 

make? He wanted to add another story and the court --

16 and the State said, you can't do it. 

17  And its only basis for saying, you can't do 

18 it was because you wouldn't give us the easement. 

19  MR. KNEEDLER: The -- the basis of the --

the theory of Nollan and Dolan -- and the Court made 

21 this clear in -- in Lingle -- and in Del Monte Dunes, 

22 for that matter -- is those two cases apply in a 

23 specific situation where there is an exaction of a right 

24 of access, an easement for the public to enter the land 

as a condition. 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1  And the -- the reason for that, the Court 

2 explained in Lingle -- there are really two reinforcing 

3 points. The first was that there would be public 

4 access, which is a permanent physical occupation, which 

is one of -- one of the exceptions to the general Penn 

6 Central test for regulatory takings. 

7  The other is that it was a per se taking. 

8 The -- it -- it was per se that the government could not 

9 have acquired that easement for paying -- without paying 

compensation; therefore, the government could not attach 

11 as a condition to the granting of a permit that the 

12 person convey something, unless it was proportional. 

13  So the -- the theory began with the idea 

14 that the easement itself would have been -- the taking 

of that would have been a per se taking. This is a very 

16 different situation because the other way in which 

17 Petitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure 

18 is that compliance with regulatory programs frequently, 

19 maybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money. 

If someone wants to build a power plant -- a 

21 coal-fired power plant, he's going to have to install a 

22 scrubber to protect the air, to prevent no -- diminution 

23 of air quality. Constructing that costs money. It 

24 can't be that the requirement to spend money to comply 

with a regulatory program is itself a taking.

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about --


3 what about the football stadium? Do they -- can you 


4 pick a particular landowner? I mean, you took a case in 


which there is no question, under Nollan and Dolan, 


6 about the relationship, proportionality, and nexus. 


7  Let's put those to one side because the 


8 issue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply. Can the 


9 government say, okay, you want a permit, we will give 


you the permit, if you fund the new football stadium? 

11  MR. KNEEDLER: I think, in that situation, 

12 there would be a very substantial equal protection challenge 

13 because one landowner is being singled out with no 

14 rational basis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the one 

16 constitutional provision that is concerned with 

17 protecting property owners from having to bear burdens 

18 that should be borne by the public at large is not 

19 applicable? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- that -- it 

21 applies when there is an identifiable property taken. 

22 If the --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Why isn't the 

24 answer, yes, it is applicable? Of course, it's 

applicable. I own a piece of land, and they have

4  JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and to say that I 


can't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay 

6 for a football field, which has nothing to do with it, 

7 is as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000 

8 columns of coal in your mine, so that you can never use 

9 it, as I can think of. It's Holmes brought up-to-date. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, certainly --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, at least that 

12 argument would be made --

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Certainly --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And why wouldn't it be a 

winning argument? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: Certainly, a Penn Central 

17 argument could be made there, but I think that's very 

18 different from a Nollan argument --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I agree with you --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- which -- which imposes 

21 the -- the burden on the government and, basically, 

22 treats the -- the payment of money as, itself, a taking. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, can I go 

24 back to the questions presented for a moment? The court 

below did two separate rulings, I think. 

50

10

15

20

25

Official 

1  One is there can't be a taking if the -- if 

2 the claim is that it's of an undifferentiated money, not 

3 a res.  And I think you would agree with that. 

4  If the only issue is an obligation to pay 

money, that that's not a takings claim, correct? 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And this is not even an 

7 obligation to pay money. It's an obligation to spend 

8 money to come into compliance. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. There was a 

second holding, however, which really gets ellipsed by 

11 the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit 

12 you to raise the Nollan/Dolan case. And it appears, to 

13 me, even if there is an easement situation -- so, even 

14 if there is an actual takings claim at issue, do you 

agree with that first holding by the court below? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we think --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming we narrow it 

18 not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference 

19 between a denial or a grant? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. If the -- if the agency 

21 decision is written where there is an express condition, 

22 we don't think that it matters -- an express condition 

23 satisfying Nollan and Dolan; in other words, an 

24 exaction, a per se taking, we don't think it matters 

whether the -- whether it's a permit grant or permit

1 denial. 

2  There was no actual taking in the sense that 

3 compensation would be owed, but it could be challenged 

4 as an unconstitutional condition under the Nollan and 

Dolan analysis. 

6  But we think it's critical, when thinking 

7 about that, that the -- that the permit denial -- that 

8 only applies if the permit denial expressly is based on 

9 the condition because, otherwise, you would get into a 

situation of negotiations and what was discussed and --

11 and liability could turn on an exchange of ideas; 

12 whereas it should turn on the formality of the agency's 

13 final decision. 

14  It's akin to the Williamson County final 

decision requirements. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree -- your 

17 friend on the other side cited a number of places in the 

18 record, where he thought your condition was satisfied, 

19 that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the 

failure to comply with the offered conditions. 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if you look at the --

22 the orders denying the permit applications in the record 

23 at -- I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61. In those 

24 situations, it says the permits were denied because the 

plaintiff did not give the reasonable assurances that

1 the statute requires in order to get the permit -- the 

2 reasonable assurances of -- of no loss of wetlands 

3 functions. 

4  One of the ways --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't this unreal? I mean, 

6 you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the 

7 agency says, if you do X, you get the permit. And X 

8 is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition. 

9  Okay. He refuses to do X. The permit is 

denied with a general statement like this: The permit 

11 is denied because he has refused to do the -- the 

12 necessary mitigation. 

13  Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused 

14 to do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the 

last demand of the agency? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: But the ultimate standard 

17 under the statute is whether he has provided reasonable 

18 assurances. What assurances -- the way in which he goes 

19 about it, whether offsite or onsite -- the offsite part 

just arises because this is a wetlands case. 

21  Normal regulation wouldn't raise the 

22 offsite -- onsite problem. But the ultimate question is 

23 he didn't carry his burden of establishing no net loss 

24 of wetlands.

1 say, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from 

2 your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 

3 4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them 

4 are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland 

and 11 million that aren't. That's crude. 

6  So they're saying why in heaven's name are 

7 we supposed to -- everybody wants to build. And why 

8 should the people that happen to live in wetland have to 

9 pay for all the other wetland? That's just coincidence. 

So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners 

11 Hospital. You are going to say, no, it isn't like the 

12 Shriners Hospital. 

13  Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an 

14 issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I think it's clearly not like 

16 the Shriners -- the Shriners Hospital --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: I know you'll say that. He 

18 will say that it is. 

19  MR. KNEEDLER: But I did want to come back 

to Justice Scalia's question. The permit -- permit 

21 denials -- just general permit denials, the Court made 

22 clear, in Del Monte Dunes, are not covered by Nollan and 

23 Dolan. They are covered by Penn Central. 

24  And the Court made clear, in Nollan, that 

the Court could have denied the permit without attaching

you are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really 

6 stupid districts -- you know, if they -- they say the 
7 right words and then they are out from under it; isn't 
8 that right? 
9  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think so 

because -- because there are situations in which an 

11 agency actually wants to get the easement. But this 
12 Court, in Lingle, made clear that -- that the general 
13 rule is Penn Central, with only the two exceptions for 
14 regulatory takings --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why should it matter whether 

16 the -- whether the permitting authority says expressly 
17 in the denial, "It's denied because you didn't do this," 
18 or it just says, "It's denied," but it's perfectly well 
19 understood what was needed -- what they were going to 

demand in order to get it. 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: Because -- if may I answer, 
22 because the agency has to reserve -- has to have the 
23 ability to -- to deny the permit because the conditions 
24 required by the statute were not met. 

And Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and

MR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

11  I would just like to point the Court -- and 

12 particularly Justice Scalia, to pages 30 and 31 of our 

13 brief on the merits where we describe, with citations to 

14 the Nollan and Dolan, what precisely happened there. 

I want to make sure that it's clear that 

16 what they did there was not issue permits. They 

17 approved with conditions, but the property owner still 

18 had to satisfy the conditions in order to receive the 

19 permit. 

As to the question about --

an unconstitutional taking. 


6  They should just plain say no and not 


7 explain why, not engage in any work with you to 


8 mitigate. 


9  MR. BEARD: Justice Sotomayor, I don't 


believe that negotiations will suddenly break down, and 

11 we will see a flurry of permit denials, if the Court 

12 rules in our favor. What will happen, instead -- it's 

13 true, I should say, they will lose flexibility in 

14 demanding whatever it is that they want under the 

Takings Clause. 

16  They won't have any review. But the benefit 

17 of applying our rule that says monetary exaction should 

18 be treated like other exactions and be reviewed under 

19 Nollan and Dolan --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're not. People 

21 are asked to pay taxes. Homeowners are asked to pay 

22 taxes all the time; development fees, if they want to 

23 develop something. People are subject to money 

24 exactions all of the time in this society. 

MR. BEARD: No question that we all are

1 subject, on a daily basis, to government demands that we 

2 pay or that we have a financial obligation. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what happens in 

4 just -- when the legislature passes a development fee? 

Are you, now, saying that's subject to Nollan and Dolan, 

6 too? 

7  MR. BEARD: If the legislation requires an 

8 agency who processes the permit to impose a fee in 

9 exchange for a permit -- again, within the land-use 

context, we are not talking about taxes, homeowners' 

11 fees, we are talking within the discretionary land-use 

12 process -- that is imposed there, then the risk of 

13 coercion, undue influence, and the like arise, and 

14 Nollan and Dolan should apply. 

But I wanted to respond specifically to 

16 Justice Breyer's questions about Penn Central. I think, 

17 conceptually, there is an important difference between 

18 the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, which is what 

19 we seek to apply here, and what would be a permit -- or 

what would be a Penn Central claim. 

21  The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, 

22 the offense there is the -- may I --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your thought. 

24  MR. BEARD: The offense there is the 

conditioning -- the improper conditioning of a permit.

1 It's not did the condition force me to lose the value in 

2 my land. That's a very different question that a case 

3 like Penn Central might answer, subsequent to a permit 

4 denial. 

The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine 

6 focuses exclusively on the permit exaction and on the 

7 conditioning, not on subsequent decisions by the 

8 government, for example, to deny the permit. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. BEARD: Thank you. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel. 

12  The case is now submitted.

14 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
