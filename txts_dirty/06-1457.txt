 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,

 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 

this case reasonably denied Respondent's request to 

modify the wholesale contracts that the purchasing power 

companies had entered into in 2000 and 2001. The 

Commission reasonably concluded that Respondents had not 

made the requisite showing under the Federal Power Act 

and under this Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra 

that modification of the contracts was necessary in the 

public interest.

 In reaching that conclusion, FERC first drew 

on three factors that this Court had identified in 

Sierra and found that they were not satisfied. Thus, it

found that Respondents had failed to show that the 

contracts would impose financial strain on the 

purchasing companies; that it would impose excessive 

burdens on the customers; or that they were unduly 

discriminatory. But FERC also looked --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But FERC thought it could 

live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the 

government recommended that we deny cert in this case; 

isn't that so?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct, 

and FERC thought that perhaps the decision could be 

limited to the circumstances arising out of the 

California energy crisis in the years 2000- 2001, and 

that it could channel its concerns about contract 

stability through those other factors.

 But, nonetheless, FERC believes, as its 

decisions make clear and as our position in this Court 

makes clear, that the Ninth Circuit's reformulation of 

the Mobile-Sierra doctrine or interpretation of the act 

was incorrect. And, now that the Court has granted 

review, we urge affirmance of FERC's decision in this 

case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it clear to the 

government that the Ninth Circuit, which is what, about 

10 percent of the country, was going to continue this

interpretation of the act, and that was not a matter of 

any consequence to FERC or to the government?

 MR. GARRE: It was of consequence, but FERC 

still believed it had some interpretive authority after 

the decision. Maybe this was a wrong judgment at the 

time, but FERC thought that it still had some 

interpretive authority under the decision, and that it 

could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Kneedler, this 

is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers 

FERC. FERC says: Oh, we don't have that authority. 

And the Ninth Circuit said: Yes, you do. So this is an 

agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit 

says it can. And why can it not? Because of two 

decisions of this Court. Is that right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, two decisions of this 

Court and 50 years of intervening FERC, before that 

Federal Power Commission, practice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait, wait, wait. It 

didn't just say the agency may do it. It said the 

agency must do it. I don't -- I don't consider "must" 

to be an empowerment. I consider that to be a 

direction.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. That -- that is 

correct. I mean it, I think -- I took the question to

be that it might give FERC broader flexibility, but at a 

very substantial cost to the stability of contracts, 

which was the underlying point that this Court stressed 

in its decision in Sierra: That the Federal Power Act, 

unlike -- and the Natural Gas Act, unlike the Interstate 

Commerce Act, contemplates that rates will be set by 

contract, or at least can be set by contract; and that 

therefore, like in most situations, a party to a 

contract cannot unilaterally walk away from that 

contract or insist upon its modification because it may 

become disadvantageous over time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- let's go 

back a step. I thought FERC's position was: We could 

not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because 

we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.

 MR. GARRE: Well, FERC --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's not what FERC --

FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the 

conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the 

Ninth Circuit did. It's FERC saying: We can't do that 

because we have our marching orders from the Supreme 

Court.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I think -- I mean there 

are -- there are two interpretive questions here: When 

does the public interest standard identified in this

Court's decisions in Mobile and Sierra apply? And then 

there is the further question of what is necessary to 

satisfy the public interest standard for modifying a 

contract.

 We think on both points the Commission's 

decision in this case reflects an interpretive judgment 

that the Court's decision, or the interpretation 

reflected in the Court's decision, in Sierra applies 

equally in the market-based rate system without any of 

the -- either of the two prerequisites that the Ninth 

Circuit formulated as a precondition to applying the 

public interest standard.

 And I would point the Court's attention, in 

the joint appendix in the Commission's decision, to 

joint appendix 1244 and 1245, repeated again at 1572 and 

1573; and also the passage quoted in the Morgan Stanley 

brief at page 17, reflects a determination of what the 

Commission's longstanding policy has been that, 

contracts once entered into, their integrity must be 

protected and should not be lightly set aside.

 And also, the Commission specifically 

rejected at pages 1564 and 1565 of the joint appendix 

the prerequisites that the Ninth Circuit came up with in 

this case, that there must be an opportunity to 

determine whether the rates were within a zone of just

and reasonableness at the time the contracts were 

entered into in order for Mobile and Sierra to apply.

 Under a market-based rate system, what FERC 

does is determine at the outset when an applicant 

applies for a market-based tariff whether that company 

has market power and if so, whether it's mitigated. 

Only in those circumstances is the company granted the 

authority to market -- to set prices by the market.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What happens if that 

approval is given and then a seller enters into 

contracts and then it's later discovered that, contrary 

to what FERC thought when it granted the approval, the 

seller has exercised market power or has otherwise 

manipulated the market? Is there any remedy in that 

situation?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, what the Commission 

determined in this case is that there was -- there was 

no manipulation or exercise of market power identified 

with respect to these specific contracts. And what the 

Commission decided was that the importance of the 

integrity of contracts in that circumstance required 

that the contract be maintained. If the Respondents had 

shown bad faith or something like that in the 

connection -- or fraud in connection with the formation 

of these particular contracts, that would have been

quite a different matter.

 It's also important to note that the 

Commission found in this case that there was no 

dysfunction in the forward market, which is what we have 

here. What was going on is that there was dysfunction 

in the spot market in 2000, 2001 for a variety of 

reasons, some of them going to market fundamentals such 

as a shortage of generation capacity, a shortage of 

hydropower.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just so I understand your 

answer to Justice Alito's question, the Commission has 

retroactive authority to alter the permission to engage 

in these contracts only if there is fraud --

MR. KNEEDLER: No it can -- I'm sorry --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or something similar?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Once it has granted 

market-based rate authority, FERC can revoke that. And 

in fact, companies -- there is a triennial review of 

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactive?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Retroactively?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. It would be revoked --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's

question in my mind that followed upon it, was whether 

or not -- what's the basis for any retroactive 

revocation of that or --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, it wouldn't be 

retroactive. It would be from the date of the complaint 

that was filed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be a public 

interest finding, a finding that because of the market 

manipulation by the seller that affected this very 

contract, the public interest demands that we not hold 

the --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In that situation there 

is an important public interest in eliminating fraud.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't say fraud. I said 

market manipulation.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Or market manipulation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the remedy for the 

finding of market manipulation the abrogation of the 

contract, which is a separate process from, from the 

revocation of market-based tariff?

 MR. KNEEDLER: There are. And this is the 

point I was going to make --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The same reason may support 

each, but --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I was going to make

that point in response to Justice Kennedy's question. 

If it turns out that subsequent evidence shows that a 

particular company has acquired market-based power, then 

FERC can revoke that authority on a going-forward basis 

to continue to sell on that basis. And in fact, 

companies are required to report any changes in their 

circumstances that might affect their market power, and 

there is a triennial review of that. But as long ago 

the market --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the companies who 

were involved in this case make those reports? I mean, 

there was something about during this energy crisis 

there was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with 

the quarterly report filing.

 MR. KNEEDLER: There was, and the Ninth 

Circuit found that in the Lockyer decision. But that is 

the sort of flaw and market oversight that should be 

addressed directly by FERC. It shouldn't be -- it 

shouldn't be addressed by collateral attacks on 

contracts that were entered into under the regulatory 

regime as it existed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I'm not 

entirely understanding you. Why should the fact that 

the seller later acquired market power have anything to 

do with whether the initial contract, when he did not

have market power, was a fair one? The contracts are 

already down in black and white, his later acquisition 

of market power cannot affect --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, that is certainly 

correct. I think the question, what concerned the Ninth 

Circuit -- actually, the Ninth Circuit wasn't addressing 

market power. It was addressing the possibility of 

market dysfunction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But later 

acquisition of market power would result in a 

cancellation of the permission for this particular firm 

to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see 

why it would affect the past contracts.

 MR. KNEEDLER: And we don't think it should, 

except to the extent the public interest standard is 

met.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I think I led us into 

this, Mr. Kneedler. The situation that I was positing 

was a situation in which the power marketer had engaged 

in market manipulation in the context of which, at the 

time of which, it made this contract. And my suggestion 

to you, which I think you took, was that in a situation 

like that there would be a basis for public interest 

review and abrogation of this contract because of the 

market manipulation in fact.

And the market manipulation would also be a 

reason to say market power had been acquired. It had 

not been mitigated, and hence, the market-based tariff 

authority would also be revoked. And that was the, that 

was the limit of my question. And I take it your answer 

there is it could do each of those things?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It could revoke the 

market-based power going forward. And with respect to 

manipulation, especially if there was manipulation 

affecting the particular contract, that would be a basis 

for finding that the public interest required the 

contract to be modified.

 If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of 

my time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I do have 

one question. It was the position that FERC took in 

December of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance 

into the long-term contracts rather than using the spot 

market, and in that order FERC said that it would 

monitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate 

reasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates 

through 206 proceedings. What happened to that 

position?

 MR. KNEEDLER: This is such a challenge, but 

what FERC has concluded is that the public interest

standard has to be satisfied in that situation. FERC 

encouraged parties to go into the long-term market in 

order to diminish the market volatility and it would 

frustrate that encouragement of policy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how did FERC monitor 

the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?

 MR. KNEEDLER: There was extensive staff 

studies and monitoring in subsequent decisions that are, 

that are shown and that are in the joint appendix, in 

April -- in January and April and June when FERC came up 

with its final program to mitigate the problems in the 

spot market.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Stevens, good 

morning, and may it please the Court:

 Justice Ginsburg began by asking whether the 

Ninth Circuit decision did not in fact empower rather 

than restrict the authority of the Commission. The 

answer is that the Ninth Circuit decision fundamentally 

precludes the Commission from carrying out what the 

Commission believes is essential to its mandate to 

assure an abundancy of electrical energy at the lowest 

possible cost. And that is to encourage a market-based

approach to recognize that if you're going to have, as 

the Commission has said, the kind of investment in the 

building of infrastructure to produce energy, people are 

going to have to be able to rely upon long-term 

contracts.

 In this case, what the Ninth Circuit's 

decision did is to take away a very important option 

that the Commission believes is essential in times of 

market volatility and dysfunction. And that is the 

option for parties to get out of the spot market and to 

enter into a long-term contract of a secure supply.

 If the Ninth Circuit's decision stood, 

literally parties, buyers and sellers, would both be 

precluded from entering into that, because you would 

know if there were dysfunction that nothing you could 

say in the contract could mean that you could buy power 

for the next eight years at $105 at a time, as was the 

case here, when the spot market was $300. It would take 

away the option. And sellers would know they couldn't 

enter into a contract they could rely upon subject only 

to being overridden in the public interest, which FERC 

does. And that would be very damaging to the very 

processes which the Commission has used consistent with 

this Court's decision of 50 years ago to encourage 

development in this industry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, those decisions are 

puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those 

decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain; 

the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out, 

right?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And now we are 

transposing that. And one of the main themes I think of 

Justice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to 

protect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer 

wasn't going to be overcharged. And that runs through 

those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no 

market-based authority, or any such, right?

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, yes. Justice 

Ginsburg, that is correct. That was a case where a 

seller was seeking to get out of a contract that was 

paying too low.

 But the fundamental purpose -- the Court 

recognized even in Justice Harlan's opinion that 

maintaining the stability and expectation of contracts 

was going to be important to consumers, to buyers as 

well as to sellers. In this -- and FERC has adopted 

that position.

 In this case you have a situation where the 

Commission decided that instability in the spot markets

was being partly caused by the fact that the State 

regulatory process had discouraged people from entering 

into longer term contracts; and FERC said in its 2000 

San Diego order, we strongly urge utilities to move 

their load to long-term contracts of two years or more.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the same order 

where they said we are going to monitor the rates for 

reasonableness.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is true. And when they 

did indeed undertake a review of this, they decided that 

with respect to these contracts there was no evidence of 

bad faith. There was no evidence of unfairness. There 

was no evidence of duress. There was no evidence of any 

market manipulation that affected the contracts 

specifically in these long-term cases.

 The long-term contracts were part of the 

solution or the mitigation of the problem. It was a 

long-term contract that allowed the utilities in this 

case to get out from under $300 a megawatt prices and to 

enter into a contract at $105, in one of the cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask this question? 

Assuming there is absolutely no bad faith or fraud or 

anything like that, but there is just a general 

conclusion that the market was such -- in such turmoil 

that there could not be made reasonable or long-term

negotiation just didn't exist. Would that be a basis 

for setting aside the contract?

 MR. DELLINGER: No; and it's very important 

that not be a basis, because if that were the case, 

parties would know and parties -- both -- all parties 

were aware that there was volatility, and the Commission 

had announced that the conditions were conducive to 

manipulation of the spot markets. That would mean that 

a seller would say to a buyer, we know you would like to 

get out of this volatility and get a regular supply 

guaranteed at a -- at a much lower price for long term. 

We can't enter into that contract, because the fact that 

we know there has been this problem in the market means 

that our contract won't be upheld.

 Now, the Ninth Circuit decision says that 

contract terms are not binding if they were influenced 

by a dysfunctional market; and that is the very most 

important circumstance in which having long-term 

contracting is most valuable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is volatile the same as 

dysfunctional?

 MR. DELLINGER: Justice Kennedy, I don't 

know precisely what the Ninth Circuit means by 

dysfunctional. There is volatility. I think the

difference would be is there manipulation, is one 

factor; there were a number of factors that caused the 

volatility here --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dellinger, does that 

mean that it is your position that no matter how 

dysfunctional the market was, just complete turmoil, as 

long as the contract was made in good faith without any 

fraud or abuse of power, it's a binding contract?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct, unless --

and this is an important unless -- the Commission 

reviews those contract terms and finds that the public 

interest necessitates a revision of the contract. They 

have that discretion. They have that authority. They 

are prepared to and have exercised it, but in -- in this 

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For example --

MR. DELLINGER: For example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For example, if the prices 

down the road turn out to be so high for the utility, 

that the utility would go out of business?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is an example that the 

Court gave in Mobile and -- and Sierra. But the 

Court -- but what the Commission would know is that the 

circumstances would have to be rather extraordinary. 

Because whenever you were to modify the terms of a

contract that the sellers have been relying upon, the 

sellers became buyers. They also went out on the 

market. They are buying and selling.

 So unraveling all of these buying and 

selling would itself be -- would be dysfunctional; but 

what sellers would know thereafter is that they couldn't 

rely upon the contracts. They would either have to stay 

out of that market or they would have to charge a risk 

premium, which would raise prices to buyers and 

consumers.

 So that long run harm of making it less 

reliable to engage in contracting would have to be 

overcome by a fairly severe showing of what the 

short-term harms would be to one particular set of 

buyers.

 The Commission has made those findings. 

They found circumstances where the contracts gave first 

priority to commercial uses of power, and at a time of 

shortage that meant that residential customers would be 

cut off. The Commission ordered that done.

 The Commission has been on the job here. 

They have -- the process by which they grant 

market-based rate authority is an elaborate one. They 

get assurances that the sellers lack transmission market 

power, generation market power, that there are no

barriers to entry, that if they have transmission 

facilities there is open access. They -- any party can 

challenge that. And any party in this case, any party 

in this case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said the Commission 

is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here 

is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction 

in the spot market carried over into the forward market, 

such that prices in the forward market were inflated.

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. But what 

the Commission realized is that the parties were aware 

of what was going on in the spot market. They were able 

to contract on that basis. They could have asked for 

what's called a Memphis clause, giving either party the 

right to seek modification based on some administrative 

determination of what a right price would be at some 

later point. They did not. They kept in the clauses 

that allowed only joint approaches to the Commission, 

and indeed in one contract said that the rates are fixed 

and shall remain in effect for the terms of this 

agreement. That language is illustrative of how you 

could not enter into a long-term contract and assure 

that the terms were binding. The fact that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what 

that statement means, anyway. The current dysfunction

carries over into -- into the future market? What does 

that mean?

 MR. DELLINGER: Right. Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it mean that because 

of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure 

what the rates are going to be down the road? Of course 

it means that. But doesn't a dysfunction always mean 

that?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Dysfunction --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And isn't that why you 

enter into long-term contracts?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because given the current 

dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to 

be down the road.

 MR. DELLINGER: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the 

staff saying something more than that in that -- in that 

report?

 MR. DELLINGER: I don't -- I don't know what 

you're intimating, but what the conclusion was of the 

Commission was, for example, that there was no basis to 

support a finding that the Respondents exercised market

say anything one way or another about it.

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, the Commission 

expressly said with respect to the -- to the staff 

report that there was no evidence of any manipulation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they say it with 

respect to the staff report? Or -- I thought they 

thought the staff report was irrelevant?

 MR. DELLINGER: Yes. The aspect of the 

staff report that said that forward prices were 

influenced by prices in the spot market and that there 

had been dysfunction was irrelevant precisely because it 

would have been relevant were the Commission making its 

own bureaucratic determination of a right price. But 

the parties made the determination of the prices that 

they wanted to agree to, the terms they wanted to agree 

to, and they did so with full knowledge both that they 

knew there had been some manipulation, that there was 

volatility and that they knew they didn't know, as 

Justice Scalia, said the extent of it; and, therefore, 

that's precisely why you want to be involved in a 

contract that guarantees you today that, no matter what 

happens to prices in the next year or next summer, one 

of these -- one of these utilities has a guarantee of 

power at $105.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and 

may it please the Court:

 I'd like to start off by picking up on 

Justice Ginsburg's observation that FERC understood 

itself to be without discretion here, and add the point 

that this is an extremely unusual case where FERC 

thought it lacked discretion to apply the statute. In 

the briefs, there is now agreement that the just and 

reasonable standard applies to all rates under the Act 

and couldn't be more clear that the just and reasonable 

standard applies. FERC --

JUSTICE ALITO: Among your arguments, and 

the arguments of the Respondent, seems to be in some 

tension -- seems to me in some tension to FERC's

market-based rate program. Do you -- do you acknowledge 

that that is permissible interpretation of the Federal 

Power Act or not?

 MR. WRIGHT: I -- there is much that we 

don't disagree with about the market-based rate program. 

I suppose we do think that there are two things that 

FERC has to make sure that it does as part of that 

program.

 First, in -- in approving the market-based 

rate program, Judge Douglas Ginsburg said when there is 

a competitive market, FERC may rely upon market-based 

rates in lieu of cost-of-service regulations. That 

makes perfect sense to us, but when there is a 

competitive market. So we think a critical part of a 

market-based rate program is that there must be an 

inquiry into whether or not the market was competitive 

when the contract was entered into. Of course, we have 

the unusual circumstance here where Professor Kahn and 

nine other deregulatory economists wrote a letter in May 

2001 saying markets are out of control, this is the 

unusual circumstance where FERC should enter a price 

cap.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it -- isn't it a 

central requirement of a market-based rate program that 

FERC cannot, except perhaps in very limited

circumstances, go back and undo contracts that had been 

entered into under that program, based on a 

retrospective determination that the rates are not just 

and reasonable, in the same sense that FERC would have 

applied that term if the utility had simply filed a 

tariff?

 MR. WRIGHT: Justice Alito, all rates must 

be just and reasonable. We are not arguing that FERC 

needs to go back to a cost-of-service ratemaking 

approach; but an agency that sees just and reasonable 

and thinks it's applying a just and reasonable standard, 

for 70 years has thought it's either going to do a 

cost-of-service approach, or more recently it's going to 

rely on the market to make rates just and reasonable, 

our modest point is that it can't ignore the market. It 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I guess this is 

what's bothering us. Your point does not seem, at least 

to me, to be a modest point, because if I understand 

where you're going, you're saying that in a market with 

the degree of volatility of this one at the time these 

contracts were made, no contract is enforceable. It 

will last only so long as -- as one party does not 

complain about a disadvantage, and the minute it does, 

it's back in front of FERC. And the argument is being

made that in fact a market-based rate cannot be enforced 

through contract because the very premise -- i.e., what 

you call and what was called a competitive -- Judge 

Ginsburg called a competitive market -- was absent. 

Isn't that the consequence of what you're arguing?

 MR. WRIGHT: Yes. Let me make four points 

here, though, that I think make absolutely clear that it 

would not set a broad precedent to revisit the contracts 

here.

 And the four points are first, the 

Government acknowledges in its brief at page 16, this 

was the worst electricity market crisis in history.

 Second --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how do we know when 

we're only in the second worst?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. WRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but I mean the 

problem is --

MR. WRIGHT: No, no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't see any -- and 

I realize that you're giving me limiting principles to 

what seems to me in effect a general rule that says no 

contracts are enforceable, if they are made during 

periods of market volatility, however sensible they may

be given the premise of that volatility.

 And your first proposal for a limiting 

principle is this is the worst of times, and I don't see 

how that's going to help because somebody is always 

going to claim, well, these times are -- are almost as 

bad.

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, of course the 

Federal Power Act instructs a Federal agency to ensure 

that rates are just and reasonable. A -- the Federal 

Power Act --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Look --

MR. WRIGHT: The FERC, FERC needs to grapple 

with this.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's a good -- I mean 

that's a fine general phrase, but the question is, is it 

possible to make an enforceable contract under these 

circumstances?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I haven't heard a limiting 

principle yet. You have three others.

 MR. WRIGHT: I have three others. There was 

rampant noncompliance with the reporting requirements. 

The Government concedes that, too: FERC's market-based 

rate program, however well it might work today after 

it's been improved, as the Government said in its

opposition to cert, however well it's been improved on 

account of the 2005 amendments --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Did these -- did -- did the 

Petitioners here -- do you claim that the Petitioners 

here were guilty of failure to report?

 MR. WRIGHT: Yes. They -- they were not --

they were not complying with the -- we contend that the 

reporting requirements that were in effect in 2001 were 

inconsistent with the statute and not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's a 

different issue. That -- that may be that the 

Commission was derelict in -- in having a nonstatutory 

condition. But did these -- did these Petitioners -- do 

you claim, is it a basis for your claim before FERC, 

that these Petitioners failed to follow the reporting 

requirements that were in effect?

 MR. WRIGHT: Our -- our basic argument is 

the rates weren't just and reasonable --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought.

 MR. WRIGHT: And the rates weren't just and 

reasonable on the day the contracts were signed. And 

let me make clear --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but here I just want 

to make sure I understand. You're saying one -- one 

limiting principle is the re-examination of contract

might be limited or at least only prompted by a -- a 

failure to follow reporting requirements. I can 

understand that and that offhand seems to me perfectly 

fair. It may not cover this case, but I can understand 

that. What are your other two reasons?

 MR. WRIGHT: My third is, as Commissioner 

Massey stated in his dissent, without contradiction by 

the majority, that if the just and reasonable standard 

were -- would be applied, these rates would be declared 

unlawful, because they were multiples of traditional 

prices.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that seems to me 

consistent with the problem that I have with your 

argument. And that is, if you make a contract in a 

period of high volatility, and it seems reasonable to 

the two parties to come up with a rate that is certainly 

a higher rate than anybody would come up with if they 

were going through cost-plus-return ratemaking, the 

contract is vulnerable. And it seems to me that 

Commissioner Massey's argument is consistent with the 

conclusion that all those contracts are vulnerable. So 

I don't see that as any limiting principle. What's your 

fourth one?

 MR. WRIGHT: The fourth one is, as Justice 

Ginsburg has noted, that FERC said in December 2000,

before all of the contracts at issue were negotiated, 

that it would monitor and -- and would -- deems rates 

above $74 suspect. All the contracts in here have rates 

above that benchmark. So it's the worst crisis in 

history; there's rampant noncompliance; rates were 

multiples of traditional pricings, and FERC had said it 

was going to study these rates closely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I can understand --

under your fourth point, I could understand the position 

if the argument were this is above $74, and therefore it 

is suspect; but the claim you're making, as I understand 

it, is a much broader claim. You're saying the entire 

contract ought to be abrogated in the public interest, 

not merely above 74 but below 74. Isn't that correct?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

We want this case to be sent back to FERC.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And when you get there, 

you're saying abrogate this contract.

 MR. WRIGHT: We are saying reduce the rates, 

and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying -- have you 

at any point said reduce the rates to $74?

points.

 MR. WRIGHT: I appreciate the 

cross-examination. It's helped me get out what I think 

our four points --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if your theory 

prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the 

Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller 

was, does that get reevaluated, too? You reevaluate all 

the contracts back down the line?

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, I -- does Morgan 

Stanley's -- well, Morgan Stanley actually -- a number 

of parties in Morgan Stanley's situation chose to file 

protective actions, and Morgan Stanley didn't. So I 

don't know whether it has waived its rights or not. But 

I think FERC ought to grapple with that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me say that, 

consistent with your theory, that everybody -- that this 

whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the 

original seller?

 MR. WRIGHT: Right.

 Well, Your Honor, the way these markets 

work, there is every reason to think that Morgan Stanley

doesn't have the sort of claim that they have suggested 

without telling us they have. And, of course, they know 

what their portfolio is.

 There is every reason to think they bought 

power before the big spike came, and that they bought 

power since then, and that they're not -- they're not 

buying power at 104 and selling it to Snohomish at 105, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, good for them.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean you're suggesting 

they should be punished for that? I don't understand 

what -- what follows? I mean --

MR. WRIGHT: We're not, Your Honor, but I 

would remind you this is a plain-language case. The 

statute requires rates to be just and reasonable. That 

-- for 70 years, that's meant something to 

administrative agencies. The reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would you -- how 

would you go about determining in this case? You said 

it's not the traditional cost of service, return on 

investment. So how -- if you prevail, what should FERC 

do to determine whether this rate was fair and 

reasonable?

We expect that, ultimately, it will do, or 

should do, what it's done with respect to the spot 

market. With respect to the spot market, it has 

provided relief to parties who bought at the same time. 

And what it has done is it has -- it has determined what 

it calls a mitigated market clearing price.

 It has done this with great elaborate --

elaboration for periods as low as 10 minutes for the 

period in 2000 - 2001, when it is now conceded 

manipulation raised rates on the spot market. And it 

has taken the prices that were paid, and it has -- it 

has reduced them to what it calls the "mitigated market 

clearing price."

 This is -- this is described in painful 

detail in the -- in the Ninth Circuit's 2006 CPUC versus 

FERC opinion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't your clients know 

that the market was chaotic at the time they entered 

into this long-term contract? I mean does this come as 

a surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying 

more than the market price is, you want to kick over a 

long-term contract you entered into?

 What has changed? Did you not know that the 

market was chaotic? Wasn't that the very reason you 

entered into the long-term contract.

MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we had a sort of a 

Henry Ford choice. Any -- we had a choice of a variety 

of rates as long as they were unjust and unreasonable. 

We didn't have any alternative, because of the market 

manipulation, that allowed us to get a just and 

reasonable rate on the spot market, on long-term markets 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You were saying that the 

most -- the most reasonable thing for us to do was to 

enter into a long-term contract in order to mitigate the 

effects of the chaotic spot market. You understood 

that.

 MR. WRIGHT: In large part, because FERC had 

told us they were going to monitor these contracts and 

use the $74 benchmark.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, you did very well 

under these contracts. Initially, you were even 

reselling some of the energy that you got. You got it 

at a price so much below what was then the market that 

you made a profit by reselling it.

 But now that things have changed, you don't 

like the long-term contract.

that we have to prove these were just and reasonable on 

the day they were entered. And the way these markets

work, local utilities like Snohomish buy energy, and 

they always sell a little bit. They're going to lose 

153 million over the life of this contract. And it's 

always been the life of the contract that FERC has 

thought was the -- the real benchmark.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Wright, may I go back 

to your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question? She 

asked you: What do you want FERC to do if it does what 

you want them to do?

 And you said: We want them to make the same 

kind of adjustments ex post that they made to the spot 

prices.

 Isn't there one big difference here to --

between readjusting spot prices and rewriting or 

abrogating a contract like this?

 In the case of adjusting the spot prices, in 

effect. What they are saying is: Somebody isn't going 

to make the killing that he thought he was making. It 

was -- a spot price indicates it was a snap decision. 

People were reacting to -- to changes in the market from 

hour to hour. And the Commission is going to go back 

and say, you know, you're out of luck on the killing you 

thought you made.

 When, on the other hand, the Commission, in 

effect, rewrites or abrogates a contract, it is saying

something very different. It is saying: You may not 

engage in long-term reliance on the agreements that you 

make. And isn't that a huge difference?

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we think that FERC 

could, and it seems clear that it will, distinguish 

between the spot market and long-term contracts on these 

bases. Our point there is that we probably, if it does, 

then have to overcome a hurdle and show that there 

wasn't effective competition at the time the long-term 

contracts were entered into.

 FERC might rationally, once it grapples with 

this, decide that that's the way the just and reasonable 

standard applies.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but with respect, 

doesn't that, in effect, mean -- going back to your 

answer to Justice Ginsburg -- that what you really want 

is to say there wasn't effective competition.

 There wasn't effective competition because 

the market was chaotic.

 And, therefore, in a chaotic market, 

including this one, a long-term contract which later 

turns out to be disadvantageous to one side is 

unenforceable.

 Isn't that what you -- your real answer to 

Justice Ginsburg is.

MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, again, I 

don't think we should prevail, and it's not our position 

that we prevail, unless we show that we didn't have just 

and reasonable alternatives at the time we entered into 

the contract. We don't think we can --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean -- that's 

where I don't think that, at least with me, helps your 

argument. We all know that there is a broad umbrella 

standard of justness and reasonableness. One index of 

justness is the set of conditions under which the 

parties operate. The conditions in this case were 

conditions of chaos.

 And what the other side is saying, I think, 

is: We each tried to make the most reasonable deal we 

could, the most advantageous for us that we could, under 

these conditions of chaos.

 They certainly produced a rate that wouldn't 

have been produced in a calm time either by market-based 

tariffs or by cost-plus-return ratemaking. But under 

the circumstances that we did operate in, this is what 

it produced. And we were dealing at arm's length. 

Nobody was engaging in fraud, et cetera. So that's 

just.

 And I think when you say, as you did a 

minute ago, there is an overarching obligation or

standard of justness and reasonableness, I think you're 

saying that that reasoning that I just tried to outline 

is not sufficient reasoning for sustaining the contract.

 Now, if I'm wrong, tell me.

 If I'm right, it seems to me you're really 

saying ditch the contracts if they were entered into in 

a period of high volatility.

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, Your Honor, let me make 

clear what -- what we mean by "chaos" or "high 

volatility." We think we have to show that manipulation 

was affecting the market. We don't -- we don't think we 

are entitled to relief if it was the weather that was 

affecting the market. FERC's 2003 staff --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you entitled to relief 

if there was manipulation, but these people were not 

engaging in the manipulation? In other words, they are, 

in effect, innocent of the manipulation; but they, as 

sellers, are in a chaotic market. Are you entitled to 

relief against them under those circumstances?

 MR. WRIGHT: We -- we don't think that a 

statute that protects consumers and says that consumers 

get just and reasonable rates was enacted to prevent --

to overcome contracts only when there is fraud in the 

contract.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is that

justness is a relational category, and you are -- I 

think you are saying we don't have to consider justness 

to the parties who were doing -- we will assume for the 

sake of the question -- the best that they could under 

bad circumstances. You are saying justness only goes to 

the ultimate retail ratepayer.

 MR. WRIGHT: Again, Your Honor, we don't 

need the statute. The statute is superfluous insofar as 

it affects contracts, and that is its main effect, if it 

requires fraud in the negotiation of the contract.

 And, again, if Morgan Stanley can show that 

it was a victim of manipulation, too, then it is 

entitled to relief. There has certainly been some of 

that with respect to some of these spot market deals 

where there are occasionally intervening parties.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Wright, I really don't 

understand why you would -- why you say, you know, if --

if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, 

an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly 

okay. But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad. I can 

understand if you added manipulation by one of the 

parties, by the sellers, that I could understand.

 But so long as it's a factor extrinsic to 

the parties to the contract, what difference does it 

make to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market

is caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody 

other than the seller?

 In other words, I think it's not enough to 

show manipulation. That's what's going on in the 

market. And you're trying to save yourself from it. So 

long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see 

how you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case.

 MR. WRIGHT: It -- on the equities, if the 

local utilities end up bearing the brunt of making bad 

judgments about the weather, that's one thing. It's 

quite another thing if there is rampant non-compliance, 

hiding the fact that there's been massive withholding of 

energy, and driving -- and these spikes were not 

accidental, by any means. That seems to us to be, you 

know, a -- a sort of distinction that the -- that the 

law draws all the time.

 And let me say the example came --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled by your 

answer to Justice Scalia. If, say, it is something like 

an atom bomb or terrorism or something totally innocent, 

where the parties are -- but it causes the same economic 

consequence, namely: That the rates are a lot higher 

than they otherwise would be, why do you draw the 

distinction that he says doesn't make sense?

distinction is that there isn't somebody making a whole 

lot of money on account of market manipulation 

somewhere.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in each case the 

rates would be higher than they otherwise would, and 

you'd have to say they're high enough to be no longer 

just and reasonable.

 MR. WRIGHT: Well, "just and reasonable," 

again, has always -- has traditionally first meant a 

sort of cost-of-service inquiry and more recently means 

a market inquiry. But, again, a market inquiry doesn't 

-- means a competitive market, an effective market, as 

Professor Kahn said, not a market totally infected by 

manipulation. And then, in any case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if infected by an act 

of God, it seems to me the same consequence.

 MR. WRIGHT: I guess consumers bear the 

brunt of acts of God, but don't -- shouldn't bear the 

brunt of market manipulation that was unlawful and now 

is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you could argue 

that it should be just the obverse.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you really arguing 

-- no, but aren't you really making the argument that 

the notion of justness does have an equitable component

that looks to the source of the trouble; and if the 

source of the chaos in the market are the very people 

who are trying to make a profit on your contract, that 

is a reason to say that that market-based rate is not a 

just one, because they created the conditions that gave 

them the leverage to get you to make the deal that you 

made?

 But if they are not guilty of improper 

conduct in making it, then, you know, everybody has to 

take his lumps. Aren't you saying something like that?

 MR. WRIGHT: We don't know because FERC 

hasn't looked at it, what -- who Morgan Stanley paid and 

what they paid and who made the money here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but just as a general 

premise, in your answer to Justice Scalia weren't you 

assuming something like that?

 MR. WRIGHT: We certainly think that the 

best result would be that whoever was manipulating the 

market ought to be the one who ends up getting their 

return cut; and that the local utilities and any 

innocent middlemen should be made whole, too. That's 

fine.

 It was brought up earlier in discussing the 

market-based rate program sort of what sorts of remedies 

were allowed. And let me say that -- well, I think this

came out, but the Enron example shows very well. Enron 

got market-based rate authority in 1993. Enron was not 

the only player, but was a leading player in the market 

manipulation in 2000-2001. FERC didn't get around to 

lifting their market-based rate authority until 2003, 

and they did it strictly prospectively.

 It is a core point of our argument today 

that that shouldn't be allowed. And I think the answer 

was: Well, market-based rate authority only results in 

lifting the market-based rate authority; a 206 action 

under the Federal Power Act is where consumers get 

relief.

 That's right, and we're here to get relief, 

and we think that ultimately the parties that 

manipulated the market and made too much money on 

account of the manipulation ought to -- ought to lose 

what they paid; and, certainly, the ratepayers shouldn't 

bear the costs; and if there are innocent middlemen they 

shouldn't bear the cost, either.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And, to the extent that you 

make that argument, that's an answer, sort of, to the 

question that I put to you a couple of times: Why, why 

isn't your argument anything less broad than the fact 

that you can't make a contract in a chaotic market?

 And you are, at least as a subset of what

you are saying, telling us that if the contract -- if 

the chaos in the market was caused by the impropriety of 

one contracting party, that party should not profit from 

it. And I understand that answer. That if -- to the 

extent that that is your position, it is an answer to my 

question.

 MR. WRIGHT: Thank you, Your Honor.

 And let me remind the Court that one case 

that the other side I don't think has acknowledged 

sufficiently is this Court's 1974 Texaco decision. That 

was a situation where FERC -- well, the Federal Power 

Commission attempted -- attempted to do what the other 

side is asking this Court to rule today, to essentially 

make contracts sacrosanct and not subject to any 

challenge.

 FERC had told small producers that it 

wouldn't -- that they could enter into contracts and 

they didn't have to file the contracts, and the 

Commission wouldn't review the contracts to see if they 

were just and reasonable. This Court very clearly held, 

quote, "The Commission lacks authority to place 

exclusive reliance on market prices," unquote.

 Under this statute, which requires just and 

reasonable rates, there must be coexistence between 

contracts and a regulatory backstop. And, again, in the

situation here that you helped me review -- the worst 

electricity market crisis in history, rampant 

non-compliance, rates that were multiples of traditional 

levels, and couldn't be justified under anything FERC 

has ever called a just and reasonable standard, and FERC 

had said it was going to examine a benchmark -- this is 

a case that FERC has to go back and explain why, at 

least explain why it thinks these rates are just and 

reasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just and reasonable when?

 MR. WRIGHT: On the day they were made.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the day they were 

agreed to.

 MR. WRIGHT: And we think they weren't, 

because they were the product of market manipulation 

that made all of the rates available --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They were just and 

reasonable --

MR. WRIGHT: -- that made all rates unjust 

and unreasonable on that date, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- and here I 

want to be clear on this -- you're saying they were not 

just and reasonable on the date they were made, number 

one, if the market manipulation that caused the chaos 

was manipulation by these Petitioners. That at least is

part of your argument.

 But I think you're also saying that the 

rates were not just and reasonable if they were the 

result of market manipulation by others, not these 

Petitioners. Am I correct that your argument is broad 

enough to encompass the second alternative?

 MR. WRIGHT: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And even that argument is 

much narrower than what the Ninth Circuit held, isn't 

it? The Ninth Circuit just referred to "dysfunction in 

the market." They didn't say: And dysfunction means 

manipulation by anybody. They seemed to have included 

all sorts of other things: The California regulatory 

program, the weather, and a number of other factors.

 MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, we certainly agree 

that the test can't be dysfunction; that FERC has to 

grapple with this issue and give it a concrete meaning.

 I'm sure there would be disagreement on 

remand as to exactly what it means, and there are lines 

to be drawn. But FERC needs to do that. FERC hasn't 

done that.

 FERC honestly thought -- again, this is an 

unusual case. FERC honestly thinks that the public 

interest standard, or thought that the public interest

standard, is a completely different animal than the just 

and reasonable standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are relying on the 

narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely, 

manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you 

to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the 

seller? Has that been -- has that been established?

 MR. WRIGHT: We are relying on both, Your 

Honor. We are -- our -- our main argument is that all 

rates in the West at this period of time --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of manipulation by 

somebody.

 MR. WRIGHT: -- were the result of 

manipulation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, didn't the ALJ find 

there wasn't manipulation in this market, the forward 

market?

 MR. WRIGHT: And the ALJ found that the spot 

market -- the ALJ found that the spot market 

manipulation didn't affect the forward markets. No one 

agrees to that today. FERC has disowned it. Morgan 

Stanley has disowned it. I'm told that the ALJ has 

disowned it.

reject the finding of the ALJ as to manipulation of this 

MR. WRIGHT: FERC said it was irrelevant. 

That was the part of FERC's first order, where it said 

it is irrelevant whether the manipulation of the spot 

markets affected manipulation in the long-term markets. 

That would be relevant only if the just and reasonable 

standard applies. Of course, the just and reasonable 

standard applies.

 One final point. One remarkable aspect of 

this case is after FERC said that in its initial order, 

Morgan Stanley asked them to reconsider it, and they 

said we won't do that. Thank you.

rebuttal, will you address the state of the record with 

respect to evidence or findings about possible 

manipulation by these Petitioners?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FERC,

 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. On page 1589 of the

staff reports findings in the 100-day discovery, which 

were discovery occurring in other proceedings, and found 

no evidence to support a finding of market manipulation

that specifically affected the contracts at issue.

 It's important to recognize that there were 

two separate markets here. There was the spot market, 

which had struck in addition to all the weather and all 

those things, it had structural problems requiring the 

California investor-owned utilities to trade on the spot 

market, which contributed to the opportunities for the 

manipulation. The dysfunction and manipulation were 

tied together in that market, but there was -- the ALJ 

found that the long-term market was not dysfunctional. 

It was functioning, it operated as it should. Both 

parties --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- know that's a premise 

in the debate. I find it hard to accept. How could the 

two be totally separate? It was the crisis that made it 

necessary to engage in the long-term account.

 MR. KNEEDLER: FERC has great discretion in 

deciding how to apply the public interest standard. 

It's not necessary to find that they were absolutely 

separate. It's sufficient, though, to say that the 

problems in the two separate markets -- the situations 

in the two separate markets were very different. And in 

the long-term market, FERC concluded it was important to 

maintain the integrity of the contracts, indeed, under a 

market-based system, as Justice Alito said, more

important now even than at the time of Mobile, because 

you can't have a functioning market based-rate system 

without confidence that contracts would be upheld.

 In that situation, as this Court suggested 

in Verizon, you had sophisticated buyers and 

sophisticated sellers dealing in a situation in which 

both knew that there was chaos in the spot market, that 

there was -- there were structural problems there, and 

that there were allegations of manipulation. But those 

allegations did not carry over to the, to the long-term 

market.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask, I am sure you 

understand that a finding that there was no 

manipulations that affected these contracts is not the 

same as a finding that there was no manipulation by 

these sellers in the market.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no such 

finding that there was no manipulation?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. But what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no finding 

that there was by these sellers.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. And what the 

Commission was basically saying is we are treating the 

long-term market situation differently. Some of these

sellers may have been engaged in manipulation in the 

short-term market, but FERC was trying to draw a 

distinction between the spot market and moving forward 

and maintaining the integrity of markets in the 

long-term where both the buyers and the sellers were 

both buyers and sellers typically.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, in fact, it didn't get 

that articulate. The closest it came to answering my 

question, I take it, is at the point to which you 

referred me in the joint appendix, no effect on these 

contracts?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. We don't 

think FERC should have to engage in a market-based 

evaluation of possible manipulation in order to hold two 

parties, two sophisticated parties to their bargain.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then what do you say 

about the standard of justness? In effect, I think 

you're saying it doesn't matter whether these particular 

Petitioners manipulated the market creating the 

conditions under which these contracts were made at a 

price which turned out to be much higher than the spot 

price would be later, it's irrelevant. That's your 

position, isn't it?

market, we think FERC properly concluded, did not have

to be taken into account --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not talking about what 

FERC said. I'm talking about your position. I think 

your position is that even if these people -- even if 

these people -- Petitioners manipulated and that created 

the -- or contributing to creating the market under 

which these contracts were made, that is irrelevant in 

looking at the contracts --

MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's something that 

FERC would have to decide in this case. But I don't 

believe a claim of that sort has been made here. I 

believe the claim has --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking what claim 

has been made. I want to know -- I want to know what 

the government's position is. And as I understand the 

government's position is that manipulation by these 

Petitioners would be irrelevant to a review under the 

public interest standard, is that right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's the best way 

to read FERC's decision in this case. And I think 

that's --

 MR. KNEEDLER: That FERC -- our position is 

that FERC was not required in the public interest, which 

looks at the market as a whole not just the two parties 

to the contract, it looks to the consequences for the 

market as a whole in unraveling particular contracts 

because there might have been manipulation somewhere 

else. We think FERC, recognizing the importance of 

integrity of contracts, could decide that it was going 

to look no further than the particular contracts at 

issue in deciding whether there was market manipulation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is undertaken.

 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
