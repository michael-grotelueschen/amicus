CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 12-135, Oxford Health 

Plans v. Florida. 

Mr. Waxman? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In Stolt-Nielsen, this Court held first that 

a party may not be compelled to submit to arbitration 

unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that 

the party agreed to do so. And second, that because 

class arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to 

such a degree that it cannot be presumed that parties 

consented to class arbitration simply by agreeing to 

submit their disputes to an arbitrator. That precisely 

describes this case. 

The agreement commits the parties to submit 

their disputes to arbitration and says nothing about 

class arbitration. There is no extrinsic evidence 

suggesting that the parties ever considered such a 

prospect, and there is no background principle of State 

law that favors it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- about the parties 

never considering it, when this case was in the New 

Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red 

brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then, 

that "the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether 

the parties contemplated class arbitration in their 

agreements." A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does 

not contest. Does it -- that seems to be a recognition 

by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was 

contemplated. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, two 

things. First of all, if you look at page 10 -- or page 

14, footnote 7 of our yellow brief, you'll see all of 

the references made in the advocacy before the State 

court judge by my -- my brother here, not recognizing 

repeatedly that what Oxford was asking for was a 

dismissal and a transfer to individual arbitration --

bilateral arbitration. 

There was no mistake, whatsoever, in the New 

Jersey State courts that Oxford's position was that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your answer. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes -- that bilateral 

arbitration was what was requested, and -- but there was 

similarly no dispute that both parties -- certainly

Oxford took the position based on an understanding of 

New Jersey law at the time because this Court hadn't 

decided class action question, that the decision would 

be submitted in the first instance to the arbitrator as 

it was in Stolt-Nielsen. 

Yes, Justice Sotomayor. I apologize. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question. Did 

you never -- you never argued that it was beyond the 

power of the arbitrator to decide this question, did 

you? 

MR. WAXMAN: In the first instance, no. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And do you take the 

position that this is a -- always an arbitrator's 

question when all disputes are supposed to be submitted, 

or was just -- was there just a mistake here? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think there was a 

mistake here. I think it was -- it was understandable, 

in light of the state of the law in 2002. But we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why should we rewrite 

our standard of review to accommodate your client's 

error? Because that's really what you're asking us to 

do.

an arbitrator exceeded his or her powers. 

MR. WAXMAN: Oh, Justice Sotomayor, we are 

not asking the Court to vary in any material respect the 

highly deferential standard that's reflected in Section 

10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act. 

But we are asking that that generally 

applicable standard of review be applied to a question 

with a very strong empirical presumption that the FAA 

has attached to it and this Court has announced, which 

is, that absent an actual agreement by the contracting 

parties that they will permit their disputes to be 

arbitrated on a class basis, an inference that may not, 

as a matter of Federal law, be derived from an agreement 

to submit all disputes to arbitration --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So your rule is that 

although we must defer to an arbitrator's interpretation 

of the contract, in this case, there is an exception 

because? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, in this case, you defer, 

as you always do, but you -- you have to provide --

there is some level of review. It's not just because 

the arbitrator says I've looked at the contract and I 

think this. 

As this Court has said over and over again, 

including in Stolt, just saying something is so doesn't

make it so. There is deferential review, but there is 

review. And the review is of a proposition that this 

Court has now said twice strongly presumes that there 

is -- there is no agreement to arbitrate as a class 

unless it is clearly shown to be so and that that 

showing is not satisfied by an all-disputes clause. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so we make that rule 

just with reference to the word "arbitration" when it's 

in the class action context, or does this apply to other 

words as well? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm just not sure 

what the --

MR. WAXMAN: So I -- I think -- I mean, this 

Court has recognized repeatedly that class -- that the 

question of class versus bilateral arbitration is a 

special kind of question under the FAA as to which the 

Federal Arbitration Act itself applies a rule of 

decision. 

And therefore, the question I suppose is, 

when a court looks at a -- an assertion by an arbitrator 

that the language of the contract permits -- and in this 

case, the arbitrator found that it required class 

arbitration, a court has to ascertain whether that 

assertion of fact is at least plausible, or, to use the

vernacular of this Court in Stolt-Nielsen, the Court 

said in Stolt-Nielsen that the stipulation left no room 

for an argument that the parties had agreed. 

And similarly here, the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no -- in 

Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract 

said nothing on the issue of class proceeding. In this 

case, we have no such stipulation --

MR. WAXMAN: Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the arbitrator is 

interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule 

is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's 

interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right, 

unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --

everyone agrees in this case, as one would have to, 

based on the holding in Stolt-Nielsen, that if the --

this arbitration clause in this case just said all 

disputes will be arbitrated, not litigated, that the 

arbitrator could not -- the arbitrator would be reversed 

if it -- if he found that that indicated an actual 

agreement of the parties to class arbitration. That is 

inconsistent with the actual holding in Stolt-Nielsen. 

And in this case, that sentence is 

indistinguishable from that orthodox clause. All that

I would say this, in the vernacular of Stolt-Nielsen, 

this language, quote, "leaves no room" for a conclusion 

that the parties agree to arbitrate on the facts --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying -- you're 

saying that the -- that the deference which we give to 

arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we 

give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a 

limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact 

becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact,

question of Federal arbitration.

arbitrators' factual decisions?

principle, that at some point if it's too much off the

have, or where Federal courts have with our approval,

That there was simply not enough basis to support it.

sort of trying to scroll through all your arbitration 

decisions. I can't -- there may be. I can't think of a 

holding of this -- well, no, I guess -- I guess First

arbitrability question. And this Court held that that 

was wrong as a matter of fact. 

The Court reviewed the -- the facts of the 

case and said there is no way that the Kaplans agreed to 

have the arbitrability question submitted. 

And if I may -- I realize this isn't an 

actual case -- but my brother gives the example of a 

form of deferential review, which would allow a court to 

examine and reverse an arbitrator's decision in a 

context in which the arbitration agreement says, this is 

going to be arbitrated under California law, and the 

arbitrator says, well, I'm going to apply New York law 

in this case because -- I don't know, the parties have 

all moved to New York and they like New York and they 

litigate in New York. 

My brother says that is reviewable and 

reversible. And that's exactly what we have here. We 

have here a clause that this Court has said cannot 

suffice to establish actual agreement to arbitrate as a 

class. 

And the arbitrator has said nonetheless, I 

have read it that way. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but it's not 

exactly -- this is not the only clause that provides for 

arbitration. It is not the standard boilerplate so you

could say when he interprets it, he's really making a 

decision about arbitrability. And you can follow -- I 

mean, you may disagree with it, I may disagree with 

it -- but you understand the reasoning. It says, no 

civil action be brought, all such disputes will go to 

arbitration, this is a class action, this is a civil 

action, so it must go to arbitration, and therefore, 

it's there. 

Now, you -- you may not agree with it, but 

it -- it at least purports to be an interpretation of 

the language rather than a general rule. 

MR. WAXMAN: The fact -- the fact that the 

arbitration clause -- the sentence has two clauses. One 

says, you cannot bring a civil action in court about any 

dispute under this agreement, you must settle your 

disputes in arbitration, is completely orthodox. 

And as we point out at page 24, note 3 of 

our blue brief, it's quite arguably required by New 

Jersey law and laws of other States that say to be 

perfectly -- it is -- you have to be perfectly clear 

when you are telling a contract -- a contracting 

counterparty that disputes will be arbitrated. You have 

to tell them that that means that they cannot bring 

their disputes in court.

I -- I submit to you that, consistent with grammar and 

ordinary meaning of words, it cannot be plausibly read 

to say that you can't bring a civil action about any 

dispute in court means that you can -- you are agreeing 

to arbitrate your dispute on a class basis, for a whole 

variety of reasons. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could I just ask 

you what you think the standard is under 10(a)(4) 

because my understanding of the standard was that a 

court had to find that an arbitrator was exceeding his 

powers, was acting outside the scope of his authority --

MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And that we have said quite 

a number of times that the fact that the arbitrator 

committed an error and even a serious error is not 

enough, that he had to be doing something that was 

simply outside the scope of his authority. Do you agree 

with that or disagree with that? And if you disagree 

with that, what's your standard for what we should be 

thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4). 

MR. WAXMAN: I agree with that as a 

proposition of what review is under 10(a)(4), that is 

whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority. In this 

case, in the context of the question about actual 

agreement to arbitrate on a class -- as a class, this

Court has interpreted Federal law to require evidence of 

a contractual basis of actual agreement between the 

parties and has precluded, as a matter of Federal law, 

an arbitrator from inferring such agreement from an 

all-disputes clause. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And you don't disagree, do 

you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion, 

you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's 

doing is trying to construe a contract. 

MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I mean, trying 

I think is not a defense. What I would say, in 

addition --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but he is going -- but 

he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure 

out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit 

statement about what the parties agreed on. 

MR. WAXMAN: Right, but he did not take 

cognizance of the holding of this Court in 

Stolt-Nielsen, reiterated in Concepcion, that you may 

not infer intent from an agreement to submit to 

arbitration. And more fundamentally, he did not heed 

the presumption in the Federal -- under the Federal 

Arbitration Act that this Court's holdings in those two 

cases reflects.

to believe that defendants would ever bet the company 

with no effective means of review. 

There is therefore a presumption in the law 

that, absent a very clear statement of a meeting of the 

parties' minds there is no consent. But he indulged the 

opposite presumption. His presumption was --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So now you're saying that he 

exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of 

clear statement presumption. But I don't think that 

we've ever suggested that there is such a clear 

statement presumption. In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that 

if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed 

on anything, then we're not going to accept class 

arbitration. 

But we've not said that in the process of 

construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule. 

Now, maybe we should have said that, but -- you know, 

it's -- it's no place in our case law now. 

MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Am I wrong? 

MR. WAXMAN: We are not -- you didn't say

into class arbitration. What you held was that you 

cannot have class arbitration in the absence of 

affirmative agreement that is not evidenced by an 

all-disputes clause. And the -- that background -- that 

strong presumption must, as a matter of Federal law, 

inform the arbitrator's decision. 

And in this case, not only didn't it because 

you said, look, an all-disputes clause doesn't suffice. 

And he said, well, there's the word "civil action" in 

here and I think that that not only suffices, but that 

indicates an actual agreement to require class 

arbitration. That doesn't pass any test. It doesn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a combination of 

the two provisions. He said that everything that is 

excluded by the first provision is included in the 

second. And he also said something, which may or may 

not be so. He said that this particular way of 

describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an 

unusual wording. We have -- there's no civil action in 

the first clause and then arbitration in the second. He 

said that he had never seen this particular language. 

Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is 

unusual?

any dispute to court, you must bring all disputes to 

arbitration, is -- is utterly commonplace. There was 

a -- there was a clause in the Steelworkers' trilogy. 

mean, they -- there's a lot of citation to Enterprise 

Wheel in this case. 

The -- the provision in -- in the 

Steelworkers agreement, and virtually all labor 

agreements, make this explicit. It's not precisely 

every single article and preposition in the clause here, 

but it is functionally indistinct. The same was true --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was this -- was this a --

well, was this an experienced arbitrator? 

MR. WAXMAN: I -- so far as the record 

shows, yes. But my -- whether he was right or wrong 

about this, I submit to you two things: Number one, 

there is no way -- three things: 

Number one, there is no way consistent with 

the rules of grammar that one can read this sentence as 

sending class actions to arbitration -- requiring class 

arbitration. 

Number two, there is no heed by the 

arbitrator -- Number two is that -- that for all intents 

and purposes this clause is the clause that is orthodox, 

that was at issue in Stolt-Nielsen. It's the same as 

the one the Fifth Circuit decided and the Second Circuit

1 decided in the cases -- the other cases that created the 

2 split here. It's the same as the standard labor clause 

3 that was at issue in the Steelworkers v. Enterprise 

4 Wheel. 

And -- and this is my other point -- it is 

6 plain from the arbitrator's decisions, both in his 2003 

7 decision and in his post-Stolt-Nielsen 2010 decision, that 

8 he not only was not applying the Federal law presumption 

9 that this Court identified in Stolt and Concepcion, but 

he was applying the opposite presumption. 

11  He said in 2003 that because -- if this --

12 if this clause wouldn't be construed to permit or 

13 require class arbitration, it would mean that the 

14 parties had agreed not to resolve their disputes in any 

forum using a class manner, and that would be, quote, 

16 "so bizarre, it would require an express provision." 

17  In 2010, he said, well, I overshot the mark 

18 here. But the point is still the same. And this is on 

19 page 41a -- 40a and 41a of the petition appendix. He 

said, the -- the point is that if he is not allowed to

arbitration, then Dr. Sutter's original class action 

must be outside of the arbitration agreement 

altogether." 

In other words, he was indulging a 

presumption that it is so unnatural --

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that comes under 

our basic thing -- as I read this, the difference was 

between this and Stolt-Nielsen, you have two parties 

here and they both say, arbitrator, you decide whether 

or not this language, that says nothing about it, did 

encompass class or not. 

In Stolt-Nielsen, the claimant, who wanted 

arbitration, agreed that the clause said nothing about 

it. So, given his concession there, the only way it 

could have gotten in is if the arbitrator was doing some 

policy thing. Given the lack of any similar concession 

here, the way that the arbitrator got it in is he read 

this ambiguous language, looked at the situation, and 

said, hmm, guess it's in. 

Now, in the latter case, we should presume 

everything from the arbitrator's favor. Former case, 

no, they've admitted that it wasn't in the clause. 

Okay. So that -- now, what's the response to that? 

MR. WAXMAN: So the arbitrator -- so a 

couple of responses. The arbitrators in Stolt-Nielsen

didn't apply -- didn't construe AnimalFeeds' lawyers' 

concession at oral argument before the arbitrators the 

same way this Court did. What it said was that it is 

looking at the language of the contract and as this 

Court's majority opinion points out, there are several 

textual references in the arbitrators' decision, and 

they decided, well, we're interpreting this, applying, I 

think they said, New York principles, that the parties 

didn't agree to preclude it, therefore, they must be 

understood to have permitted it. 

What this Court said is, as a matter of law, 

no. Silence doesn't mean consent. Consent can only be 

shown in this type of decision by an actual agreement. 

The Court italicized the word "agreement" twice in its 

opinion. And it doesn't show actual agreement if you 

just agree to arbitrate, not litigate, your disputes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Out of curiosity, 

Mr. Waxman, in a case like this, how is the arbitrator 

paid? Is the arbitrator paid by the hour or a flat fee? 

MR. WAXMAN: I am not sure, Justice Alito, 

if the record shows. I believe it's by the hour. 

The -- the point is that what this 

Court's -- the fact that there was a stipulation that 

the Court identified in Stolt-Nielsen made it easier to 

apply the principle that you -- that -- that actual

agreement is required, but you can't infer it from an 

all-disputes clause to the case. The Court said that 

the stipulation, quote, "left no room for an inquiry 

regarding the parties' consent." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, how wrong 

does an arbitrator's decision have to be to become an 

issue of law? Meaning -- because that's the rule you're 

proposing. I used to think that exceeding your powers 

was deciding an issue the parties hadn't agreed to 

arbitrate, but here you've conceded that you gave the 

issue to the arbitrator. So he hasn't exceeded his 

power to construe the contract with respect to this 

dispute, do you agree with that? 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes, I do, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what 

instead you're saying is that "exceeded your powers" 

means that an error the arbitrator makes has to be of 

what quality? 

MR. WAXMAN: If you -- so if you -- an 

arbitrator exceeds his powers if it -- if he decides to 

arbitrate a subject matter that the parties have not 

agreed to arbitrate. He -- he exceeds -- he or she 

exceeds his or her power if they -- if he or she

And as I said, we are not at the -- if you 

asked -- I don't -- I would apply -- I think you could 

simply apply the standard that you applied in 

Stolt-Nielsen, which is the "leave no room" standard, 

which is pretty darn deferential, and you would have to 

find that this sentence, in light of Federal law as 

announced by Stolt-Nielsen, leaves no room for a 

conclusion that the parties, that Oxford and Dr. Sutter, 

actually agreed to class arbitration regarding their 

disputes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, of course, this 

was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no --

it was drafted by Oxford. And you made a point about 

betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed 

to it. But on the side of the doctor, he has a 

$10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without 

a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no 

means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none 

of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000 

doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because 

the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they 

could get at the end.

about whether this is a contract of adhesion or whether 

this is a so-called negative value case. 

There was litigation over Federal court 

subject matter jurisdiction and the court found that 

there was, in part based on evidence that Oxford 

submitted, that there were many claims that were far in 

excess of $75,000. And it is not true that Dr. Sutter's 

claims as he brought them to arbitration was $1,000 or 

anything like it. 

May I reserve the balance of my time?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. KATZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. KATZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I would like to start out by discussing the 

applicable standard. There are only two ways a losing 

party can vacate an arbitration award under 10(a)(4), 

which is the only standard that applies here. It's the 

only question that came up to this Court on cert and --

under the exceeding powers standard. Number one, the 

arbitrator had no authority to interpret the contract; 

or number 2, the award was based not on an 

interpretation of the contract.

Oxford cannot satisfy either of those 

standards here. Oxford does not dispute that the 

arbitrator interpreted the contract. Oxford's sole 

dispute here or challenge is that the -- that the 

arbitrator interpreted the contract incorrectly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's all he has 

to do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the 

contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right? 

MR. KATZ: Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we were 

concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company 

betting the company, right, on -- on class action 

whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because 

class arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company 

and without an appeal to the court or -- you know, 

not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway. And you're 

saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every 

time. 

So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator 

to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not, 

which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever 

he likes, right? He can find -- so long as he says, I'm 

interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly 

inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's 

nothing the courts can do about it.

MR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, Stolt-Nielsen 

taught us that the language of the contract or any other 

evidence has to demonstrate the -- that the parties 

agreed to class arbitration. Stolt-Nielsen did not 

alter this 10(a)(4) standard, the same standard which 

before it was codified --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that standard 

-- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to 

say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what 

he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to 

what the contract says, and the court has to accept 

that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract. 

MR. KATZ: This Court's jurisprudence for 

almost 2 centuries has held just exactly that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Just exactly that? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think so. 

thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award 

displays manifest disregard, or words like that. I 

mean, Misco is -- is not absolute. Misco has a narrow 

exception, and that exception is where there's just no 

basis in the contract for the decision. And so I 

thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not 

so, there is a basis.

basis. What Misco -- as I understand what Misco teaches

is that it has to be unambiguous, that the arbitrator --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different thing, 

that's a different thing. It doesn't say whatever he 

says about the contract, he wins. It says what he says 

about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it 

isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et 

cetera. There is language in the cases to that effect. 

So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there 

is no loophole no matter how tiny? That's news to me. 

MR. KATZ: Well, Justice Breyer, I don't 

think manifest disregard -- certainly, manifest 

disregard is not a standard by which this matter has 

come up before the Court. And this Court has held in 

Hall Street and other cases that 10(a)(4) is the 

exclusive ground set forth by Congress, that this Court 

did not have the authority -- and I'm quoting the 

Court -- it "did not have the authority to expand." 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I 

think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that 

something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring 

plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even 

an arbitrator. Now, suppose I think that. Then do I 

decide against you? 

MR. KATZ: No, Justice Breyer, because here

Stolt-Nielsen, came to the arbitrator and said, we want 

you to decide it. They told the arbitrator at that 

time, look at the agreement, look at what transpired in 

2002, back when this matter was in the superior court 

and make your decision. 

So the arbitrator applied the law that --

and applied the -- the standard that he was told to 

apply. He didn't just disregard it. He didn't make a 

decision saying, I don't care what you are telling me to 

do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What supports his decision? 

I mean, you -- you say that. What -- what supports his 

decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's 

the standard. Did they agree to class arbitration? 

What -- what supports that? 

MR. KATZ: Justice Scalia, they did agree. 

When we were in court in 2002, Oxford represented to the 

State court judge there that not only are the disputes 

going to arbitration, but all actions regarding the 

disputes. 

And the judge specifically relied upon that, 

expressly relied upon that, in not sending just the 

disputes, but sending everything that had been asserted 

by Dr. Sutter, including the claims of the class. And

page 5, the red brief, where Oxford has expressly --

it's both on page 5 and page 6 and I will refer to page 

6, the top of 6. This is Oxford's counsel in 2002. 

"The contract" --

MR. KATZ: The top of page 6, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. KATZ: Plaintiff quoted the contract 

here as saying "that any dispute under the contract 

needs to be arbitrated." That's wrong, the contract 

says "actions concerning any dispute." That was what 

Oxford has always argued at all times before the 

arbitrator. The arbitrator understood that. 

The arbitrator interpreted the agreement. 

It's based both on the agreement and on the 

representations made by Oxford as to what its own 

agreement meant.

initial decision, which is that if you have something 

that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of 

class arbitration at all, that you can't have class 

arbitration. 

MR. KATZ: The arbitrator, however, 

Mr. Chief Justice, cannot be faulted or -- or his award 

vacated based upon changes or arguments that were never 

made at the time. The parties made their arguments to 

the arbitrator. Oxford, if you will, sat on the 

sidelines. 

And this Court has also held that a party cannot 

sit on the sidelines, wait till the award comes down, 

and when it's against them then raise new arguments for 

the first time. Oxford --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you get 

back -- I'm sorry, go ahead. 

MR. KATZ: I'm sorry. I was just going to 

finish saying, Oxford could have raised these arguments 

and maybe at the end of the day, if they raised those 

arguments, they would have carried the day. 

But I respectfully submit, as this Court has 

repeatedly held, that courts do not have the authority 

to second-guess the arbitrator and make decisions or 

come up with a resolution that would have been different 

with the arbitrator just because they disagree.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Getting back to 

Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First 

Options is fairly strong authority for him because there 

you have a situation with the arbitrator determining 

that a particular entity or individual is bound by the 

agreement. And we said that's something that we will 

review de novo, without deference. Why isn't it the 

same here? 

In other words, not everything an arbitrator 

says is subject to the deferential standard of review, 

even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the 

agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options 

did? 

MR. KATZ: Here, Mr. Chief Justice, the 

arbitrator did exactly what the parties had asked him to 

do, though. He did not venture and do something outside 

of what the parties had asked him. 

The parties specifically presented the 

question to the arbitrator as to whether class 

arbitrations were available and specifically directed 

the arbitrator both to the agreement -- the language in 

the agreement, as well as the representations and the 

submissions that were made below in the court system in 

making their respective arguments.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that Oxford

entitlement to de novo review. 

MR. KATZ: That is correct. Oxford has 

always maintained that it was the arbitrator's decision 

to make, and in 2010, even after Stolt-Nielsen, came 

back to the arbitrator and asked the arbitrator to 

reconsider his opinion from 2003. The -- Oxford had 

never, until after losing this case obviously, has 

Oxford sought the Court for the first time for a de novo 

interpretation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- counsel, you 

seem -- I don't know. I see two questions here. The 

first was an arbitrator exceeds his power if he decides 

a question is arbitral when it's not. And -- but here 

there is no dispute about that because you are right, 

your adversary submitted this question to arbitration. 

And that's what I'm hearing you respond. He did, 

there's no question, he said the arbitrator has to 

decide this issue. 

Justice Breyer raised the second question. 

Assuming he could, is there any remaining power in the 

Court to overturn his decision? And Justice Breyer

law, why would you still win? 

Because your adversary is saying, the law is 

clear. You have to find some hook in the agreement to 

agree to class action -- arbitration, and he says there 

is none. That's basically his position, that the 

arbitrator's decision on its substance manifestly 

disregarded the law. So that's the question that I 

believe is extant still.

Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language 

here says all disputes will go to arbitration. It 

doesn't say whether they are supposed to be class or can 

be or can't be. You decide what it means. 

And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it 

doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision. So what 

kind of a case is it? Small claims. And then it says 

something about court suits where they have class. Hmm, 

gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says, 

that's what it means. It means it could include class, 

too. Okay? 

Where in our case law is that a manifest 

disregard? He's looked at the language, there were two 

plausible constructions, he came up with one of them. 

What's the problem? Now, that's of course their 

problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why 

they are saying no it's not going to help me. 

MR. KATZ: Well, I don't believe that is --

the materials that were put forth before him, the 

agreement and the evidence, and he made a decision. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not enough. As 

stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a 

plausible construction. It's not enough that he said, 

I'm construing the contract. I have looked at the terms 

of the contract and what the parties' said, and my 

construction of the contract is X. That's not enough. 

It has to be plausible. 

MR. KATZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is this plausible? 

MR. KATZ: Well, with all due respect, 

Justice Scalia, I don't think plausibility comes into 

play. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Use whatever word you want. 

Manifest disregard, stick to the law. Now, suppose the 

arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it. 

I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball. Now, 

we would strike that down because that is not relevant. 

But he didn't say magic 8-ball. He said class. And 

there are many class arbitrations. So it isn't quite 

magic 8-ball. 

Now, you explain to me --

MR. KATZ: Justice Ginsburg, what the 

arbitrator had found was that the "no civil action" part 

of the clause was -- was coextensive. It was completely 

interrelated with the mandatory arbitration provision. 

In other words, what the arbitrator found was that 

everything that was prohibited from being filed in a 

litigation in the court had to be arbitrated, and that 

was based on not only --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question on

JUSTICE ALITO: All right, so 20,000. And 

the effect of the arbitrator's decision is that all of 

those 20,000 doctors are deemed to have agreed to class 

arbitration, right? 

MR. KATZ: Correct. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And if we assume -- if I ask 

you to assume, for the sake of argument, that this 

agreement does not constitute an agreement to engage in 

class arbitration, where did the arbitrator get the 

authority to make that holding with respect to all of 

these absent class members? 

MR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrate --

JUSTICE ALITO: If they didn't agree to 

class arbitration, how can they -- and they didn't agree 

to have the arbitrator decide whether the agreement 

calls for -- for class arbitration. How did he purport 

to bind them to that decision? 

MR. KATZ: Well, the arbitrator made the 

decision based on the language and the evidence 

presented before him and finding that it authorized 

class arbitration. That was the determination that was 

made initially. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the -- is the contract 

authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are 

similarly situated, they got the same contracts?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So either the contract 

means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't. 

If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then 

everybody's bound. 

MR. KATZ: That -- that is correct. Now, 

ultimately, when the matter was certified --

JUSTICE ALITO: Wait a minute. Where did he 

get the authority to make that decision to interpret the 

contract with respect to them? 

MR. KATZ: Well, the --

JUSTICE ALITO: You're saying he can do it 

with respect to Oxford because Oxford agreed to have the 

arbitrator decide whether this calls for class 

arbitration. But these other people didn't. They 

didn't agree to have the arbitrator decide whether it 

calls for class arbitration. 

MR. KATZ: Well, Justice Alito, this -- this 

is no different than in any other contract 

interpretation issue. The arbitrator makes a 

determination based upon the reading of the language and 

what the parties are telling him that language means. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the difference 

is in First Options. The one thing First Options says 

is the question of who's going to be bound by

arbitration is decided by the court de novo. And in the 

class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who 

did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular 

interpretation. 

MR. KATZ: But Stolt-Nielsen, which the 

arbitrator faithfully reviewed, analyzed, and followed, 

makes clear that you can have class arbitration as long 

as the arbitrator determines that the contracting 

parties to that agreement establish that class 

arbitration is available. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did these other people 

agree to this arbitrator? I mean, they might have said, 

this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say 

that -- that we agreed to class action. We didn't agree 

to class -- I don't want this arbitrator. 

They didn't agree to this arbitrator. Why 

should they be bound by -- by whatever he says? 

MR. KATZ: Well, for one thing, 

Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Oxford wanted. 

Oxford argued that the class action should go into 

arbitration. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they -- could they 

opt out? 

MR. KATZ: Well, ultimately, they could --

they could opt out when it was certified. And I want

to -- I'd like to be clear on a point, if I may. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can they opt out if 

they've agreed to class arbitration? 

MR. KATZ: Well, they can opt out of the 

class and pursue, if they wanted to at that point, an 

individual arbitration if that's what they chose to do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure? It seems to 

me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've 

agreed to class arbitration. 

MR. KATZ: Well, they -- they proceeded --

they agreed for the matter to proceed as a class 

proceeding. But the matters --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those -- and there 

are rules that governed that, right? 

MR. KATZ: That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. That is before we get to the issue of whether 

the class itself be certified. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but how could --

how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says, 

as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we 

have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case. I 

decide that there is a class action, all these people 

are in the class.

arbitration was only the first issue that was decided. 

We then engaged in the procedural mechanism by which the 

matter could be certified and that they could --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, presumably they could 

opt out, but did they agree to be bound by this unless 

they opted out? That's not the usual way people are 

bound by litigations. 

MR. KATZ: But everyone, Justice Alito, 

everyone signs the same agreement. And therefore, if 

the arbitrator's going to make a determination here --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but I think you're --

you're not -- you're not accepting my assumption that 

this is an incorrect interpretation of the contract. 

That's the assumption. This is incorrect. If we were 

reviewing this as an appellate court reviewing the 

interpretation of the contract under Stolt-Nielsen, we 

would say, this is wrong. This is really wrong. Okay? 

Assume that to be the case. 

Then how are they -- how are these absent 

people bound? And it's really not an answer to say, 

well, they can opt out. If they didn't agree to be 

bound by this arbitrator's decision, then they didn't 

agree to be bound absent by opting out, which is an 

unusual procedure for being bound by an agreement.

class action arbitration if that were so. 

MR. KATZ: If -- if it was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be impossible 

because you could never get in advance -- they find out 

that by getting notice and then they decide whether they 

want to stay with it or opt out. 

MR. KATZ: Well, in any class arbitration, 

the arbitrator is not going to decide the same questions 

as to the 20,000 of the same agreements. It's decided 

based upon the class representative who brings the 

matter. 

And even if the arbitrator was wrong, 

Justice Alito, I submit that under 10(a)(4) in the 

applicable standard, that even in Concepcion, this Court 

said 10(a)(4) is -- is not an issue of mistake, it's an 

issue of misconduct. And that's not what we have here. 

If there was a mistake, that still would not be enough 

with respect to the courts to have vacated the 

arbitrator's determination on this matter. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this may not --

I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be. I 

thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these 

things quickly. This has been going on 11 years, right? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. KATZ: This has been going on 11 years.

That is true. It's been going on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- it's not 

a facetious question because I think one of the concerns 

about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the 

supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have 

sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when 

it's going to bind 20,000 people. 

MR. KATZ: Well, class arbitration is, as in 

many arbitrations in this day and age, involves complex 

issues, that sometimes you have major corporations doing 

battle over -- over major agreements that they know at 

the time involved big ticket items. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask -- ask 

you this question because I think it's consistent with 

the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little 

bit different, though. Suppose you have -- and this is 

a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I 

don't know the facts. Suppose you have an attorney in a 

small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big 

practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator. 

And if he arbitrates the one case, he's 

going to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000. He 

says -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can 

keep this going for 11 years, I will make a million 

dollars.

Does he have the obligation to say, I'm 

going to decide the class action issue under this theory 

that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have 

a conflict, I'll bow out. I'll just say, there is a 

class action, and then I will leave it for some other 

arbitrator. Does he have that obligation? And if he 

doesn't, should that bear on our decision here? 

MR. KATZ: Justice Kennedy, that should not 

bear on the decision here because this matter comes up 

under 10(a)(4). If there were questions about the 

partiality of the arbitrator, then I want to rule in 

favor of Katz because I want to prolong this thing as 

long as possible, then perhaps Oxford should have 

brought the matter under 10(a)(2) and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long -- can we 

straighten out this 11 years? How many years was this 

in the New Jersey courts before there was ever an 

arbitrator appointed? 

MR. KATZ: Well, the matter wasn't in the 

New Jersey courts for that long, but various points in 

time because the AAA rules allow for a -- a filing of 

a Federal suit to vacate Oxford, on multiple 

occasions --

why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our

decision? That should not be a factor in our decision? 

MR. KATZ: Partiality is not a factor, 

Justice Kennedy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but surely --

MR. KATZ: -- in this decision. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Finish 

your answer. 

MR. KATZ: In this decision, because 

partiality or what could potentially be perceived as a 

subjective intent, so the arbitrator does not play under 

10(a)(4). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under --

under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is 

addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another 

party. 

I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to 

an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a 

decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to 

partiality between parties, but a problem about the way 

the system would work, that would create an incentive 

for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a 

ruling that expands his authority. 

MR. KATZ: Well, arbitrators -- I would 

submit that an arbitrator who was doing something that 

was -- that was documented or perceived to be crazy -­

and pardon my vernacular -- or just way out of line, 

then I'd submit that arbitrator is not going to be hired 

again. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how -- what 

is the history of class actions and arbitrations? There 

are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of 

rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right? 

MR. KATZ: That's correct. I think it's 

important -- if I could just address a couple of points 

regarding that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many have there been? 

Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands? 

MR. KATZ: Well, I don't know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any idea? 

MR. KATZ: Well -- I don't think there has 

been thousands, but there -- I know there have certainly 

been a number so far that the American Arbitration 

Association has set forth rules --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure there's been a 

number. What's the number? 

MR. KATZ: I -- I don't -- I don't know the 

number. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It could be less than 100?

But -- if I may point this out, class 

arbitrations were certainly in existence at the time 

that this matter was sent into class arbitration. And 

in fact, I think it's also worthy to understand that 

when I brought this matter in superior court, I argued 

that the class action should be kept in court, but it 

was Oxford's argument that everything including the 

class action go into arbitration. 

It was Oxford's interpretation of its own 

clause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this 

case completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in 

Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own 

rules based on some policy preference about arbitrations 

-- about class actions which wasn't present here. 

And if I could address an issue that was 

raised about -- that the arbitrator discussed something 

was bizarre. In 2003, that was a pre- -- so that 

was prior to Stolt-Nielsen -- the arbitrator expressly 

disavowed that in his 2010 opinion. And he made it very 

clear that he based his decision on the interpretation 

of the agreement as well as the representations made as 

to what that agreement meant to the court system. 

I think this Court has recognized for 2 

centuries that an arbitrator's error in law or fact 

cannot be the grounds for a vacatur.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to just 

interrupt. For most of that two centuries, courts 

refused to enforce arbitration agreements. That's the 

whole reason we have the FAA. 

MR. KATZ: But here, both sides, Mr. Chief 

Justice, expressly asked the arbitrator. This is not a 

question of arbitrability because both sides wanted the 

arbitrator to make that decision. Then even after 2010, 

when it came to light that Bazzle -- there was a 

plurality and the issue of whether it's a question of 

arbitrability is an open question, Oxford didn't go 

running to court then. 

Instead, it went back to the arbitrator and 

said, we want you to reconsider your 2003 decision. And 

the arbitrator again went through the analysis of 

interpreting the agreement and the representations made 

by the parties about what that agreement meant. 

I submit we have to -- if we trust 

arbitrators to handle such important issues as civil 

rights issues and other very important matters of 

singular importance, we have to expect that they will 

follow the precepts of this Court and the FAA as to what 

constitutes grounds for class arbitration. 

I think the Third Circuit should be 

affirmed, if there are no other questions.

Mr. Waxman, you have 2 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. WAXMAN: Thank you. 

I have three points, two small ones and one 

significant one. 

The first small one is that this notion, 

this canard, that we told the district -- the State 

court judge that class actions should be sent to 

arbitration is dispensed with on pages 13 and 14 of our 

reply brief, following the sentence, "Tellingly, Sutter 

resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous 

positions." 

And I refer the Court again specifically to 

footnote 7 on page 14, where we quote my brother's 

statements to the State court judge explaining that what 

we were asking for was, quote, "a motion to compel 

individual arbitration." 

The second small point goes to the issue of 

what the number is of class arbitrations. I also don't 

know that. But we know that as of this Court's decision 

in Stolt-Nielsen because this was reported in the AAA 

amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been 

rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in

any class arbitration. 

The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted 

after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open 

the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in 

this case said was surprising because the arbitrator 

said quite correctly that everyone expected that in 

Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as 

class arbitration. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your significant 

point? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WAXMAN: I can't go back 200 years, but 

let's just go to 1960 in terms of the standard. And in 

the Steelworkers v. the Enterprise Wheel case, what this 

Court held was, quote, "An award is legitimate only so 

long as it draws its essence from the agreement. When 

the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this 

obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse 

enforcement of the award." 

And our submission is that this award, the 

conclusion that the all-disputes provision here 

manifested an actual agreement by the parties to class 

arbitration, cannot possibly be reconciled with the 

plain language or Stolt-Nielsen's holding. 

Thank you.
