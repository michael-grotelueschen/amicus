P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:04 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian 

Legal Society Chapter of the University of California-

Hastings v. Martinez. 

Mr. McConnell. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

If Hastings is correct, a student who does 

not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to 

lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not 

promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its 

forum for speech. 

The First Amendment -- under the First 

Amendment, rights run the opposite way. Hastings is the 

government; CLS is private. A public forum for speech 

must be open and inclusive, but participants in the 

forum are entitled to their own voice. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, these are fundamental 

arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on 

factual matters because that's frustrating to both the 

Court and the counsel.

But we do have the problem of the 

stipulation. The stipulation makes it clear that 

Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other 

one's club. That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the 

Joint Appendix. You want to get away from the 

stipulation by what, according to your reply brief, 

Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation 

supersedes the answer. 

So if both counsel could just address for a 

moment: What is the case that we have here? You have 

different views on what case is before us. 

MR. McCONNELL: Happy to, Justice Kennedy. 

If you just look with me at Joint 

Stipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear. 

That's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states: 

"Both parties agreed that in order to become a 

registered student organization a student organization's 

bylaws must provide that its membership is open to all 

students" -- that's the all-comers policy -- "and the 

organization must agree to abide by" -- "abide by the 

Nondiscrimination Policy." That's capital N, capital P, 

a defined term. The "Nondiscrimination Policy" is 

defined in Joint Stipulation Number 15. That is what we 

have been calling the written policy. And the idea that 

membership must be open to all students is described in

Joint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of 

what that policy is. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't -- doesn't the 

one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the 

nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with 

that you automatically comply with everything in the 

nondiscrimination clause? 

MR. McCONNELL: It is broader. It's our 

position that either of these justifications for 

excluding CLS is unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the latter, 

the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not 

viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon 

a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the 

all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that 

argument is not available to you. 

MR. McCONNELL: Justice Scalia, our 

argument -- there are two policies. They have invoked 

both. We believe both are unconstitutional, but for 

slightly different reasons. The written policy is 

unconstitutional because it’s overtly viewpoint 

discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating 

the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar. 

The all-comers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell,

Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers 

policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to 

deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean 

in her deposition said, loud and clear: "Our policy is 

all-comers. Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the 

Democratic group and vice versa." So unless you are 

challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, 

as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see 

how we can listen to your argument about the so-called 

written policy. 

MR. McCONNELL: Well, both policies we contend 

are unconstitutional. Let's begin with the all-comers 

policy, and when you conclude that it is 

unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the 

other since they have two arrows in their quiver. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can do that, but you --

it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS 

differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican 

Clubs. That’s a much different -- frankly, it's a much 

easier case for you. But it's -- it's frustrating for 

us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us. 

MR. McCONNELL: Your Honor, it's a case 

where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite 

different justifications for denying our right and both 

of them are unconstitutional.

Let's begin with the all-comers policy. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. McConnell, when I 

read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted 

to the district court at the same time that the joint 

stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after 

another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its 

policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in 

fact insisting that all registered student organizations 

admit all applicants. And when I read their brief in 

the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and 

again. 

So that led me to believe that what was 

stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which 

they enforced under which anybody who applied to any 

group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean 

Kane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not 

necessarily the actual policy that was employed. And 

that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was 

making; isn't that correct? 

MR. McCONNELL: That's entirely correct, 

Justice -- Justice Alito. That’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should -- if that 

was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence 

of different treatment of other groups. And there --

as I --

MR. McCONNELL: Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is none of that 

except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your 

brief, as I --

MR. McCONNELL: Well, but that is in fact the 

evidence. When --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell, here 

is a statement, a stipulation. It's a stipulation for 

summary judgment. It says: District Judge, you take 

this to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered 

student organizations allow any student to participate, 

become a member, seek leadership positions in the 

organization. That is not qualified. It says: 

District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate. 

It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not 

really enforced. It's not qualified at all. 

MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we 

stipulated that this was their policy. That stipulation 

contains nothing about the historical facts as to how 

Hastings has actually applied it. But let's talk about 

the policy, because it is unconstitutional --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. You are 

going to waste your whole time just discussing this 

stipulation point. Let's assume -- let's assume that --

MR. McCONNELL: Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy. 

MR. McCONNELL: Yes, because the policy is I 

think blatantly unconstitutional. It is manifestly 

overbroad with respect to any purposes stated. And, of 

course, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any 

restriction on a student speech forum may be no more 

extensive than is required by its purposes. It is also 

a frontal assault on freedom of association. Freedom of 

association is the right to form around shared beliefs. 

To say that groups may not form around shared beliefs --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is this an exception 

that you want to talk about as it is applied to 

religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group 

wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all 

handicapped persons, whatever other form of 

discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school 

has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds, 

and otherwise lend it space? 

MR. McCONNELL: Not at all, Justice 

Sotomayor. Our position is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then, what is --

what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't 

wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates? 

MR. McCONNELL: The stipulation is that they 

may not exclude based on status or beliefs. We have

only challenged the beliefs, not status. Race, any 

other status basis Hastings is able to enforce. But 

they may not tell a group --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, what if the belief --

MR. McCONNELL: -- that you just have to let 

you in that don't agree with you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the belief is that 

African Americans are inferior? 

MR. McCONNELL: Again, I think they can 

discriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on 

the basis of the status. So that if the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could have --

MR. McCONNELL: -- if there were racist 

organizations --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a student 

organization, I suppose, of that type. It wouldn't 

include many people. But if there were such an 

organization, I assume that they would have that -- that 

belief required, right? 

MR. McCONNELL: That's right, but they could 

not go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of 

status, under our --

JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn’t this say the 

opposite? It says we are -- you have to let anybody in --

anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs. So you can't

discriminate on the basis of status or belief. That's 

what the policy says I just read. It doesn't say you 

can; it says you can't. 

MR. McCONNELL: It's that the group may not 

confine its leadership based upon its beliefs. That means 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what you say, but 

that's not what the policy says. The policy says that 

you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status 

or belief. 

MR. McCONNELL: Right. And -- and our view is 

that the status --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you cannot discriminate on 

the basis of status or belief. 

MR. McCONNELL: The status half of that is 

perfectly constitutional and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say you --

MR. McCONNELL: -- the belief half of that is not. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- you have to -- you 

have to let these organizations discriminate on the 

basis of belief. And they say: No, we don't want to; 

that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones 

we should, which ones we shouldn't. We'd rather let them 

work off-campus. We just don't want to get into this 

business. It's not just against religion. It might be

against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish 

is extremely important to speak or a chess club that 

thinks the same. It could be a lot of people. 

Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First 

Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First 

Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have 

those on campus organizations, too much trouble. 

MR. McCONNELL: What is -- what is wrong with 

that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must 

be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum. The 

purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation 

Number 8. It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints 

among registered student organizations. If the student 

organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of 

beliefs, there can be no diversity among them. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this sounds like a 

debate over whether the policy as the school believes it 

should be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that 

their choice? Don't we give deference to an educational 

institution in terms of the choices it makes about 

effecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here 

is we don't want our students to discriminate. 

MR. McCONNELL: There is a stipulation as to 

what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a 

diversity of viewpoints among registered student

organizations. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's their way of doing 

that. 

MR. McCONNELL: It is a stipulated fact. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Hastings takes the 

position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only 

among the groups but within the groups. So --

MR. McCONNELL: Which is not the joint 

stipulation. The stipulation is that the purpose of the 

forum is diversity among groups. Their policy is not --

it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is 

contrary to it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is that they --

MR. McCONNELL: It defeats the purpose of the forum. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, yes, we believe in 

diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity 

within the group; that's a good thing. They are not backing 

off from: We think diversity among groups is fine. 

MR. McCONNELL: They say that in their 

brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the 

case.

example, and that’s --

stipulation? 

MR. McCONNELL: It's page 216 in the Joint 

Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8. It is the only 

stipulation in the case having to do with what the 

purpose is of the RSO forum. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute now. A 

diversity --

MR. McCONNELL: "Hastings seeks to promote a 

diversity of viewpoints among registered student 

organizations." 

And note how destructive an all-comers 

policy directed on belief is toward -- toward that. 

That means that if, for example, there’s an NAACP 

chapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead 

to sit on -- in on its planning meetings. That means 

that if there’s an environmentalist club that has a 

demonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade 

legislation, they would have to allow --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be --

MR. McCONNELL: -- a global warming skeptic 

to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be an ill-advised 

policy, but the school says: It's our policy. It's 

working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about 

sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.

MR. McCONNELL: They haven't happened 

because this policy came into being -- was announced for 

the first time in 2005. So there couldn't possibly be 

any -- any record of that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not the 

policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that 

correct? 

MR. McCONNELL: That's correct, it was not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- when they were 

refused participation in the -- in the student 

organization program, they were not told about the 

all-comers policy. 

MR. McCONNELL: That's correct. Joint 

Stipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the 

-- that they were informed, and I quote: "They were 

informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the 

religion and sexual orientation provisions of the 

Nondiscrimination Policy." 

JUSTICE ALITO: And was there any written 

document memorializing this policy prior to the time 

when the former dean gave her deposition? 

MR. McCONNELL: Never. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: And is the -- is the policy 

as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as 

the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?

MR. McCONNELL: I don't think so. Every 

time the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into 

something else. When the dean announced it at the 

deposition, she said all students may participate on 

the -- in all activities, period, full stop. Now we 

find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have 

conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can 

have attendance requirements, they can have competitive 

contests to see whether they get in. 

This -- this policy is -- it changes with 

every wind. 

And -- but the fundamental problem with 

this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in 

Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot 

allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just 

to say that whatever their policy is, that that 

determines the contours of the program, because that 

would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that was not a 

religion case. Your argument at its most fundamental 

level is that religious organizations are different 

because religion is all about belief. But at that point 

don't we also have a tradition of separation? That's 

the whole reason why church and state for many purposes 

are kept separate, so that States are not implicated

with religious beliefs. 

And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to 

consider that when we are considering your argument. 

Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is 

different from that. 

MR. McCONNELL: The separation is between 

church and state, but this Court has held over and over 

again that speech forums -- that people participating in 

a speech forum are not the state. The state is 

Hastings. We are perfectly private. There is nothing 

wrong with a religious organization, even on public --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, as I understand 

your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an 

argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature 

of CLS. You would make the same argument of 

unconstitutionality with respect to the student 

Republican Club, wouldn't you? 

MR. McCONNELL: We would. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or --

MR. McCONNELL: Now, we do --

there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I 

don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause 

protects is exactly what the associational freedom test 

would protect for everyone.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that an 

important part of the case, of your case, is that belief 

is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must 

be protected. But if the protection causes problems 

within the school for other policies, then doesn't the 

separation policy come into play? That's -- that's what 

I'm asking. 

MR. McCONNELL: Again, separation does not 

apply to private parties when they are operating, even 

on government property. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, let's say 

it is the belief of this group, based on their reading 

of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible 

studies, can become officers of the group, and that's 

based on their fundamental belief that that's what the 

Bible instructs. On your view, must Hastings give this 

organization status as a recognized student 

organization? 

MR. McCONNELL: No, Justice Ginsburg. Our 

position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit 

groups to form around beliefs but not around status. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the belief is -- this 

is the belief. 

MR. McCONNELL: They can insist that -- that 

everyone who participates in the group have that belief,

and that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to 

be a very small group. But they cannot discriminate on 

the basis of status. But belief -- as this Court said 

in Cantwell v. Connecticut, belief, the freedom to 

believe, is absolute. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, they -- they would have 

to negate their belief in their practice. They could 

believe this, but they couldn't implement it? 

MR. McCONNELL: Well, it's not unusual to 

say people -- people can believe in all kinds of things 

that are illegal. That doesn't mean that they can do 

them. It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction 

in our law. But let's look at --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This was the basis -- your 

distinction between status and belief was the basis for 

your saying that the original policy, whatever --

whatever we call it -- what is the name of it? 

MR. McCONNELL: The written policy? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The written policy -- when 

it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual 

orientation was complied with by CLS because it would 

not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on 

the basis of belief. 

MR. McCONNELL: That's correct.

relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to 

work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my

premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent

they admit that person or not? 

MR. McCONNELL: Yes. There’s a joint 

stipulation to that effect, Number 34.

belief that marriage is between a man and a woman? 

MR. McCONNELL: It -- it does. I thought 

that Justice Breyer posited the case of a person of 

homosexual orientation who shares that belief. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no. 

JUSTICE BREYER: He shares the belief that 

there should be no premarital sex --

Again, he's able to attend all the 

activities. CLS has all of its activities entirely open 

to everyone. And what it objects to is having -- is 

being run by non-Christians, because after all, this is 

a group whose very purpose is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep talking about 

being forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a 

little bit confused by your yellow brief. 

The school has taken the position that any 

group can apply to use its facilities; priority and 

funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student 

groups. But your group is not being excluded or 

ostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you 

can meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces 

in the school. You can apply like everyone else, any 

other nonstudent group, recognized student group. But 

you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation 

that you're barred from the campus. And so I'm a little 

confused as to exactly --

MR. McCONNELL: What I -- Justice Sotomayor, 

I believe what we consistently say is that we have been 

denied the right to meet on campus. And that is 

completely true. Look -- if you would look at Joint 

Stipulation Number 10, at the top of page 219, it provides

that CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible 

to apply for permission for rooms. But there is no 

stipulation that that will ever be granted, and the 

record shows that every time CLS has requested 

permission to meet they have gotten a complete 

run-around. They have been told: Well, you have to 

apply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't 

get an answer on time and when they get an answer it's, 

well, because you’re not a registered student group --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- could we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's assume, 

because I'm not quite sure what the record is on these 

issues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions 

underlying this case. But let's assume two things: One, 

that in fact you have the option of applying for use of 

the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and 

other things that -- that are in the normal course would 

preclude your use, that you would be granted use. Is your 

argument different in that situation?

access to campus communications is absolutely essential,

MR. McCONNELL: I only cite Cantwell for the 

proposition that belief is absolute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. And Cantwell 

said that belief is central to -- to religions and that 

people would disagree. But that's precisely why 

Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is 

inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is. And 

if -- will you just address that, please? 

MR. McCONNELL: I would address it. The 

forum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed. They 

are to provide a diversity of expression among student 

groups. Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum 

and therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light 

of that. And what is more, what they have done is --

it's also not reasonable because it's independently 

unconstitutional. What they have done is they've said 

you may not have fundamental freedom of association or, 

if you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available 

benefit from you. 

As recently as the unanimous decision of 

this Court in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the 

-- the now I think 100-year old principle that 

constitutional rights may not be penalized by the 

withdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by 

direct prohibition.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

This case was decided by both courts below 

on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the 

petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the 

funding and benefits that go to student groups that 

obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit 

all students 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why do 

you have --

MR. GARRE: -- regardless of their status or 

their beliefs. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have a policy, 

a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says 

anything about all-comers. You’ve got a written 

policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on 

the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.

this is a case about injunctive relief. As a matter of 

law, the only policy that’s relevant is the current 

policy, and that's the one --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why is --

MR. GARRE: -- that both sides agree is 

in place. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this 

nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books? 

MR. GARRE: No. It’s -- it's the way in which 

Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this 

particular forum. And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit 

decision in this case. It’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is not an 

implementation of the nondiscrimination policy. I mean, 

the two policies are quite different. Now, are you 

telling us that the written policy is no longer 

operative? 

MR. GARRE: No, it -- Justice Scalia, this 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, what? No, it's not 

operative or no, you’re not telling me that? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GARRE: It is operative. This -- the 

all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this 

context. And the written policy applies not only to the

enumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary 

unreasonable discrimination, and the law school --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't --

it doesn't say that. 

MR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor. It says in 

the first paragraph on -- this is on page 220 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. GARRE: -- of the Joint Appendix: The 

college is committed to a policy against legally 

impermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory 

practices. And then it also goes on and enumerates 

specific factors. And this is spelled out, I believe in 

page --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they -- so you’re 

saying the second paragraph is totally 

unnecessary. You say the first paragraph says you can't 

discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph 

spells out the bases. So why do you do have the second 

paragraph? 

MR. GARRE: I think it provides additional 

guidance. But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any 

debate about what policy is at issue here. The Ninth 

Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long. 

The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this 

case. And it says: "The parties stipulate" --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think this case 

deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit? 

MR. GARRE: Justice Alito, it was decided in 

the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which 

had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but 

had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing. 

So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was 

controlled by the Truth decision. So in that respect --

JUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is yes, this case 

which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of 

pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the 

court of appeals? 

MR. GARRE: In the -- in the sense that it 

was backed up by the Truth decision, yes. But look at 

the petition for certiorari in this case. Nowhere did 

-- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's 

characterization of the policy at issue. The petition 

says on page 2 that "There are no disputed issues of 

material fact." 

JUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't it been -- hasn't 

it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this 

case that Hastings has not in fact required every group 

to admit any student who applies? Don't they say that 

over and over again in their district court papers, in 

the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?

MR. GARRE: If -- if they believe that that 

caused the school to adopt a different policy, they 

shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did. 

And they should have challenged at a minimum --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they stipulated that 

the policy exists. They didn't stipulate that it is --

is being faithfully applied by Hastings. What do you do 

about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws 

referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which

comply with the rules and regulations of the school or 

say that they will admit all students. That includes 

all the bylaws.

from the bylaws, and this evolved as they’ve tried to

the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like 

the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are 

members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled 

if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct. There 

is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's 

policy. The school's interest is not in allowing 

students to disrupt the activities of students' 

groups --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they 

quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild, 

which says any member must “agree with the objectives 

of the organization as set forth herein.” That's not 

all-comers. That's a bylaw that restricts an 

organization according to its -- members can't join 

unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in 

objectives of the organization. 

MR. GARRE: There’s a fundamental 

difference between a group that says people of a 

particular sexual orientation are not allowed to become 

members --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they don’t say that.

do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National

the objectives of the organization. 

MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, the district 

court made a -- may I? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, start with mine. 

MR. GARRE: Okay. My apologies. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as 

Dean -- as director of student services testified, the 

fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are 

interested in our activities doesn't mean that the 

bylaws are excluding students who want to join. And 

there’s a fundamental difference, again, between saying 

students that have these particular beliefs or status 

cannot become members of our group --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

your position is continually evolving wherever the First 

Amendment pressure comes. You’ve got a written 

nondiscrimination policy. And then you say, well, yes, 

but we use an all-comers policy. You’ve got an 

all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow 

the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to 

that. It seems to me that we should go with -- why 

shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written

bylaws? 

MR. GARRE: Well, with respect, Your Honor, 

I think it's my friend's position that is evolving. You 

have joint stipulations before you as to what the policy 

is. You have the decisions of both courts below 

describing that policy consistently with the joint 

stipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari 

that never challenges that the all-comers policy is at 

issue. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with the 

selective application argument, which is what 

Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is 

it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their 

groups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic 

descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its 

-- its beliefs. What are we going to do with this 

selective application argument? 

MR. GARRE: This case wasn’t --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's in the case, isn't 

it? And if it is, what does it do to your policy? 

MR. GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, this case 

wasn't litigated as a pretext case. If you look at the 

briefs in this case, the first time that the word 

"pretext" is used is in the reply brief in this Court. 

It was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious

challenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers 

policy in this particular forum. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the two are connected, 

though, Mr. Garre. Frankly, one reason why I am 

inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so 

weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to 

admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to 

officership. To require this Christian society to allow 

atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, 

right? That's crazy.

out? 

MR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And doesn't it work out that 

the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican 

club and run for officership anyway. 

MR. GARRE: Hastings --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So why -- what’s --

what interest does this -- does the school have in this 

policing mechanism that it's imposing? 

MR. GARRE: A few -- a number of things, 

Justice Kennedy. The first is the line-drawing issue 

that has been made clear during the first part of the 

argument this morning. If you're going -- they appear 

to take off the table race and what they say are other 

status considerations. I'm not sure why that excludes 

sexual orientation. 

But if you’re going to allow religious 

groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some 

people, then you have to determine where to draw the 

line. And I think a school can reasonably say: We 

don't want to get into this business at all; we want to 

allow all comers

JUSTICE ALITO: You now say in your brief that 

it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements 

that are neutral and not based on beliefs. Isn't that right? 

MR. GARRE: That doesn't go to status or

MR. GARRE: -- those are merits-based

As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have

all, they did explicitly say that groups could not 

exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. 

Now, they -- there was some confusion about 

how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws. The school 

went back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding 

members? La Raza said: No, we’re not; we’re open to 

all. And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their 

bylaws. That's the one example they've come up in the 

20-year history of this policy. And what does it show?

If you want to look at --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait. Twenty 

years? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the 

one we’re arguing about now, that is to say, the 

all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this 

litigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the 

record is a letter from the dean describing this policy 

after the litigation began. 

MR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, it's based on 

the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who 

had been at the school since 1993, the director of 

student services, who had been there at least since 

1999, as this is how they had implemented the 

nondiscrimination policy. I don't think there’s any 

basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What we have is a rule, a 

stipulation. And as I read it, to try to make sense out 

of it, it does seem to discriminate against 

organizations in respect to which intellectual purity 

would be important. They’re going to have a harder 

time. The ones that don't care that much will have an 

easier time. 

Now, in trying to judge the 

constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which 

these organizations are. We've got one of them, but

there may be a lot of others. I don't know if the 

Democratic Club is or is not. I don't know how big the 

tent they want. I don't know whether the Turkish 

Society even exists. I don't know how the chess club 

feels about players of tiddlywinks. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: So I have an absolute void 

in this record, which in turn I think would be important 

to fill that void, because their justification --

MR. GARRE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is they don't want to get 

into this, it's too complicated, and we’re not 

doing that much harm to them because they can meet 

off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of 

these things. 

And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay 

bias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't 

much, because that isn't really the point here, and 

that's what we think, anyway. It's just an example of 

something. 

So with that great unclarity, asked to 

decide a constitutional issue where I feel I’d need more 

facts and I don't have them --

MR. GARRE: Well, you --

know what it really is, which I don't have, what should 

I do? 

MR. GARRE: If the Court believes that, 

respectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as 

improvidently granted. This case was litigated based on 

stipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues 

that we’re now talking about for the first time before 

this Court. 

Now, I think it is common ground that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- Mr. Garre, you 

did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition. 

There’s no prior evidence. But there are schools, 

including law schools, that have this policy. Is that 

not so? 

MR. GARRE: That's true. Georgetown Law 

School does. Columbia Law School. Look, there’s an 

amicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations 

representing thousands of colleges and universities 

across the country, including the Association of Jesuit 

Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a 

not-uncommon and a reasonable policy. We’re not saying 

it's the only approach that colleges can take in 

balancing the competing interests here. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let’s explore --

constitutional --

JUSTICE ALITO: Let's explore the 

implications of this policy. Suppose at a particular 

campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus. 

And there’s a small Muslim group; it has 10 students. 

If the group is required to accept anybody who applies 

for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up 

and they want to take over that group, you say the First 

Amendment allows that? 

MR. GARRE: Justice Alito, that’s the 

claim, obviously, that the other side is making. And, 

with respect, this example has never happened at 

Hastings in 20 years. It has really never happened in 

the history of American education. If you look at cases 

like the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion 

case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law 

that says every newspaper that’s published in the 

United States must be reviewed every day by the 

government's censor board, and the fact that the 

government's censor board decides not to do it, then 

that law is okay? 

MR. GARRE: I think this Court would 

ordinarily take into account the likelihood that 

something would happen, and if you're dealing where the

only experience --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A newspaper sues 

saying that law is constitutional, and we’ll say it's 

all right; it has never been applied? 

MR. GARRE: Of course this Court is going to 

examine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I.D. case, 

where you had had people saying this was going to and, 

on secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting 

to the -- ballot access. This Court said, look, that might 

happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law 

across the board. Come back with an as-applied challenge. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was because 

they might adopt a different policy. We’re not dealing 

with a future different policy in this case. 

MR. GARRE: And there's -- as to the 

takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has 

happened. Groups can take measures to prevent it. They 

can require attendance requirements before people become 

members. They can instruct into their bylaws --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not going to 

help if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to 

take over the group. 

MR. GARRE: People have to be -- attend a 

certain number of meetings before they can join. They can 

have --

MR. GARRE: They can have in their -- they 

can -- sure. I mean, we can entertain the 

hypotheticals. But they can have in their bylaws a 

provision just like the Constitution of the United 

States, that amendments can only be made by a 

super-majority --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, CLS obviously thinks 

this is a real threat. Now, what do you propose that 

they do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when 

the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is 

administered, then precisely what they fear begins to 

take place. Do they have any recourse? 

MR. GARRE: I think if that started to take 

place, the college would reconsider its policy. It 

could bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, do they have any --

MR. GARRE: -- that would --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do they have any recourse? 

MR. GARRE: I think at that point --

sign up? 

MR. GARRE: I think obviously the members 

would rejoin and form another group, Your Honor. I 

mean, we’re not dealing with this in a factual vacuum. 

CLS's predecessor existed at the schools for 10 years 

and in --

JUSTICE ALITO: I understand the answer to 

that question. So, if -- if hostile members take over 

CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?

across-the-board rules for all student conduct against 

disruption, against incivility. The list would certainly 

carry over. 

MR. GARRE: Absolutely. And CLS, like any 

group, can have a rule that disruptive members should be 

expelled.

from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with 

this group has applied for membership. 

MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, the record 

does show that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's -- that's 

what so puzzling about the -- the case. 

MR. GARRE: The record does show, Your 

Honor, that there was a gay student who was a member of 

the group. And that's -- let me give you that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the predecessor 

group. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The predecessor group --

MR. GARRE: That was the predecessor group. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and obviously uncomfortable 

with their position, so he or she left. 

MR. GARRE: Well, actually --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way it works. 

MR. GARRE: -- what the record shows is that 

she participated in discussions that the officer of the 

group said it was a joy to have her and that both sides 

learned. 

I think CLS's position depends on the dark 

notion that students would not have any interest in 

joining a group with different viewpoints on certain 

issues except to disrupt that group. And I think that

greatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of 

students. It greatly undersells the fact that groups 

have many different interests and perspectives. 

The church has a stance in homosexuality, 

but it has stances on many other issues, too. And if a 

student -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on 

homosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of 

the groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of 

that group, they want to take advantage of intangible 

benefits like not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Teach Bible classes? 

Right? 

MR. GARRE: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to let them teach 

Bible classes, too, right? 

MR. GARRE: In fact, the record in the --

case shows that only officers teach Bible classes, 

and groups are perfectly free to structure their 

organization like that. They can have requirements 

that people attend certain meetings before they do that. 

CLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes.

said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that 

men and women should sit separately at religious services, 

would Hastings deny registration to that group? 

MR. GARRE: If it was excluding students 

from that group on the basis of their beliefs or their 

status, then, yes, it would. 

Hastings isn't in the business of 

second-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual 

groups, and the whole point of the policy really is to 

stay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that’s 

equally neutral. 

JUSTICE ALITO: We have -- we have two amicus 

briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a 

Muslim group. So, your answer is that they could not be 

recognized under Hastings' policy because of their 

religious beliefs regarding the way religious services 

should be conducted? 

MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think even my 

friend recognizes that a group could not exclude an 

individual on the basis of their gender or their 

beliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race. 

And remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's because 

gender or race is fundamentally different from religious 

brief. Gender and race is a status. Religious belief --

it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are 

not open to everybody. We have beliefs, you have to 

subscribe to them. And we’ve always regarded that as 

a good thing. That type of exclusion is supported in --

in the Constitution. The other types of exclusion are 

not. 

MR. GARRE: But not at all costs, 

Mr. Chief Justice. In the Bob Jones case, the claim was 

from a -- a small private religious school that has a 

sincere religious belief that people who believed in 

interracial dating should not become members of their 

school. And this Court, nevertheless, held that that 

belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that 

denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance 

on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that 

discriminated on the basis of religion. 

Here we have a -- a group that wants to 

exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. We 

can -- CLS has tried to change that part --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrase it that 

way. It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious 

group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude 

people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs. 

MR. GARRE: They -- there is a binding 

judicial admission. And, again, this gets back to the

Bob Jones example. I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- yes, let's get back 

to this homosexual orientation. You say that that's 

established in the case. 

MR. GARRE: Look at page -- J.A. page 460, 

which is where the district court said that CLS made 

a binding judicial admission that they wanted to 

discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Keep 

in mind that this case began because CLS came back to 

the law school and said we’re happy to say we won't 

discriminate on some grounds, but we’re not going to 

say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual 

orientation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What’s supposed to happen? 

I don't know the answer to this. Hastings, let's say, 

or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious 

chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say 

we’re open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, 

conservative, and reformed. And then the orthodox say 

we want men and women to sit separately. 

Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we’ll 

let the reform come, we’ll let the conservatives come, 

but not the -- not the orthodox Jews. They can't 

have their service. Would -- would that be 

constitutional?

women?

an after religious school organization.

MR. GARRE: In fact, Your Honor, it's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their problem here. 

MR. GARRE: -- unusual for schools to have 

all male or all women clubs. They are not recognized 

parts of the community. These -- these are activities 

that are subsidized by the students themselves through the 

mandatory student activities fees. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And their reason to put in 

a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews 

to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group, 

women in another -- and discuss the religious service 

-- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting 

none like that is?

club. 

MR. GARRE: The reason why the school has a 

policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit 

all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all 

students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and 

school-recognized activities. 

Number two, it avoids the line-drawing 

problems that we’ve discussed early this morning and I 

think are necessarily going to arise and also create 

strife in small educational communities. 

Number three, it allows --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about number 2, 

the -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you 

just letting yourself into even more line-drawing 

problems? 

MR. GARRE: Not with the all-comers rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the other -- it’s 

whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of 

the forbidden bases. But now you’re saying you can't 

discriminate on any basis, which means there’re going 

to be even more lines to have to draw. Why does it 

solve your problem? 

MR. GARRE: I don't think it -- that 

happens at all, Justice Scalia. I think when you’ve

regardless of their status or belief, that gets the 

school out of the business of determining whether, 

number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an 

essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner 

describes his -- their rule. 

JUSTICE ALITO: As I understood the 

position, your latest position in your brief, you 

really don't say you have an all-comers policy. There 

are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest, 

knowledge; is that correct? 

MR. GARRE: Competitive-based, merit-based 

requirements are not excluded. It -- they’re 

not --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- well, could a 

group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy, 

require that members who want -- anyone who wants to 

become a member show a particular level of knowledge 

about the subject of the group? 

MR. GARRE: Yes. And I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: So if the CLS required 

anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on 

the Bible, that would be okay? 

MR. GARRE: If it were truly an objective 

knowledge test, it would be okay. It would be no 

different than the law review. These are merits-based

determinations. There’s a fundamental difference 

between excluding people on the basis of merit and 

excluding people on the basis of status or belief that 

has no connection to merit. That -- that, I think, is a 

long-standing understanding of discrimination. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --

that -- that's pretty tough. That has no connection to 

merit. I assume there are groups that think subscribing 

to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly 

religious groups. So, how can you have a -- a test that 

allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not 

beliefs? 

MR. GARRE: I think it goes to the nature of 

whether it's discrimination under the school's policy, 

and I think status or belief. People understand -- that's 

why we are talking about things like race or gender or 

sexual orientation, disability, military status, any 

number of these things. And I think the school's policy 

avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group 

has a sufficient enough belief that military members 

should become a member of the Amnesty International club 

because they disagree with the war, that disabled 

members should be -- disabled students should be a 

member of a particular group. And the school's policy 

avoids these line-drawing --

Mr. Garre?

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question?

Do you think that, in order to decide this case, we have

question. 

MR. GARRE: I believe you have to do that, 

because that is the policy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So they're all --

MR. GARRE: -- before this Court. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: There may be a lot of 

other things we can decide, but in all events, we must 

decide that much? 

MR. GARRE: Absolutely. Absolutely. If I 

could just discuss briefly the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I just ask one 

quick question relating to that?

If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for 

the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint, 

does it violate the First Amendment? 

MR. GARRE: If it's pretextual in the Church 

of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes. No -- no school can 

purposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy 

it adopts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what if we think that 

the policy has not been evenhandedly applied? Can't we 

decide the case on that basis, and then we could just 

assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice 

Stevens' question. 

MR. GARRE: I don't think so, Justice --

Justice Kennedy, because that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- was there any proof 

in this record? I mean, there’s a stipulation for summary 

judgment. Was there any proof showing that it wasn't 

evenly applied? 

MR. GARRE: No. And I get back to the 

petition for certiorari. On page 2 of the petition, the 

petition --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just say, suppose 

it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you’d 

have no problem with our saying that it’s then 

unconstitutional.

MR. GARRE: It -- yes. We don't think that 

that's the case here. But if a policy is applied 

evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral 

way and it burdens religious groups, then there’s 

common ground that that policy violates the 

Constitution. Of course, we think the policy here is --

JUSTICE ALITO: If this were an employment 

case, and when an employee is denied promotion the 

employee said it's for reason A, and then after 

litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really 

wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a 

policy that we’ve long had, but there’s never --

there’s no written documentation of this new policy; 

and then at a later point in the litigation the employer 

says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or 

reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary 

judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on 

the issue of pretext? 

MR. GARRE: I think that that would create a 

factual issue and that that issue might well be tried, 

Justice Alito. 

And the one thing that is important to keep in 

mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not 

damages. So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v. 

Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all

parties agree that the current policy is the all-comers 

policy. That's the policy supported by the record in 

this case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. All 

parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers 

policy. Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy 

was the written nondiscrimination policy. 

MR. GARRE: I understood my friend's opening 

brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy 

the school has said it has today. It is the school's 

policy. It’s supported by substantial history and 

sworn deposition testimony. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, the -- the 

so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a 

correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it? 

MR. GARRE: It does. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The categories that are 

listed there are the categories that under California 

law are proscribed bases for discrimination? 

MR. GARRE: It does. And that is an 

additional basis for the school's policy. Look at 

California Education Code 66270. It explicitly 

prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and 

educational activities by public schools like Hastings. 

Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit

discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The 

reason why we’re here today is because CLS insisted 

on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the 

basis of their sexual orientation. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, section 66270 applies 

to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational 

institution, and your position is that if -- if a 

religious group complies with your policies and then it 

conducts religious services, those religious services 

are conducted by Hastings? 

MR. GARRE: Our position is that the 

registered student organization program is a program 

of the university; it’s subsidized by the university; 

it’s recognized by the university; and that all students 

should be able to enjoy access to that program. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to 

Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your 

position that California law requires religious groups 

to admit people who do not believe in their religious 

beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group? 

MR. GARRE: Your Honor, our position is that 

the provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve 

out an exemption in this program for a religious student 

organization. On its face --

question is "yes"? 

MR. GARRE: Yes. On its face, it excludes --

it has an exemption for religious schools; it does not 

include an exemption for religious organizations within 

the context of this program. And we think that the 

program is reasonable.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. McCONNELL: Well, thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

First, in answer to Justice Stevens' 

question, we do believe that the Court needs to 

reach the constitutionality of the all-comers policy as 

applied to CLS in this case. We brought only an 

as-applied challenge. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Put -- put to a side a 

moment -- forget the as-applied. Just take a -- a pure 

all-comers policy. Must we decide the constitutionality 

of that? 

MR. McCONNELL: Not facially, but as applied

to CLS, yes. Several other points, I know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you talk about -- I had 

understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a 

policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition, 

but that it was only homosexual conduct. 

MR. McCONNELL: That's correct as 

stipulated to, undisputed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- but your 

complaint said otherwise. Your -- your --

MR. McCONNELL: That's -- that's because we 

-- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings' 

definition of sexual orientation. We were told that our 

conduct rule, our nonmarital conduct rule, violated their 

sexual orientation provision, and therefore we sought 

relief from their sexual orientation provision. It was 

nothing more than that. 

There -- it is -- it is stipulated in Joint 

Stipulation 40, I believe it is, that -- that CLS's rule 

is based on conduct --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay. 

MR. McCONNELL: -- not orientation. 

Several other points: My friend twice in 

his presentation stated that the all-comers policy is 

simply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination 

policy. But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be

environmentalist club from leading -- from requiring its 

leaders to share environmentalist views --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell --

MR. McCONNELL: -- in order to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you don't 

challenge that there are universities, including four 

law schools, that have an all-comers policy? 

MR. McCONNELL: So far as we’ve been able 

to tell, there is no public university law school in the 

country that has such a policy. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are private 

universities. 

MR. McCONNELL: There are some private 

universities that, according to the AALS, have such a 

policy. We know nothing about them. They are not in 

the record, and, frankly, I’d be a little bit 

surprised, because the policy is so absurd. 

Think of how it would apply to the law 

school itself, and this policy does apply to the law 

school itself. Does Hastings really mean to say it is 

committing itself to an all-comers policy when it hires 

faculty or admits students? Do they not care about the 

belief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of --

about, say, affirmative action? The very idea of it is

advance learning is everyone gets together in a nice

MR. McCONNELL: Hastings has a perfectly

that is destructive of that --

Healy v. James requires a substantial justification for 

exclusion of a student group from a registered student

justification; it is a silly justification. If it is
