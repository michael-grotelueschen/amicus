3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this term in Case 09-907, Ransom v. FIA Card 

Services. 

6  Mr. Burke. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. BURKE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  In 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act. 

12 It made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion 

13 on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and 

14 necessary expenses. It did so by creating a formula 

that entailed an aggregate set amount of expenses for an 

16 individual. 

17  Now, Congress could have created this from 

18 scratch. It could have used an arbitrary figure. But 

19 instead, there were figures that the IRS already had, 

based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide, 

21 in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a 

22 month on average. 

23  In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's 

24 approximately 2500 a month. Forgetting about how it's 

divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the

1 following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did, 

2 and that's age, location, household size, gross income, 

3 and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get 

4 a $2500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to 

$150,000 over a 5-year period. 

6  Now, the crux of this is whether or not 

7 courts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the 

8 standard aggregate amount. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the crux of it? 

Congress made reference to the local standards, right? 

11  MR. BURKE: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: And were the -- was the 

13 commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in 

14 existence at the time when Congress enacted this 

provision? 

16  MR. BURKE: There was a Collection Financial 

17 Analysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as 

18 a prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't 

19 passed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And that explains what the 

21 IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that 

22 right? 

23  MR. BURKE: I would disagree with that. I 

24 would say -- well, it would -- it would explain what the 

IRS means, but that's where I would end it, because the

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but 

4 Congress decided to make reference to the local 

standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it? 

6  MR. BURKE: Standards. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

8  MR. BURKE: It didn't go beyond that. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: And this -- and at the time 

when it did that, there was official IRS commentary 

11 regarding the meaning of those standards, correct? 

12  MR. BURKE: For the IRS to use in collecting 

13 taxes. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that 

Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by 

16 the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the 

17 standards. 

18  MR. BURKE: Correct, not their methodology 

19 or interpretation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't the chart say 

21 "ownership costs"? 

22  MR. BURKE: Yes. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would read that 

24 to mean non-costs as well? I mean, if the -- if the 

table is called ownership costs, then why not use the

1 IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition 

2 says, what, loan payments and lease payments? 

3  MR. BURKE: Because you -- we have to look 

4 at it as a standard aggregate. And what I mean by that 

is -- okay, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define ownership 

6 costs. And ownership costs could be the replacement 

7 value. It could be buying a new vehicle. It could be 

8 the costs associated with making payments on a vehicle. 

9  What that -- that average number is, in this 

case, $471, is a nationwide figure that somebody would 

11 spend on average in a month. It doesn't mean that any 

12 one individual spends that amount. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Burke, isn't it -­

14 isn't it the case that, even on the other side's 

interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual 

16 costs anyway? Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand 

17 it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the 

18 entire deduction? 

19  MR. BURKE: That's their position, or even 

$1. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Even one payment of $1, you 

22 get the entire deduction. So to argue this case as 

23 though it's a question of whether you actually expend 

24 the money that you're getting the credit for is 

simply -- is simply false. You don't do that under

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you, 

4 Mr. Burke.

 (Laughter.) 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, before you 

7 respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event 

8 that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could 

9 propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that 

cost is no longer being incurred? 

11  MR. BURKE: The cost has never been 

12 incurred. That's the point. And -­

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is: In the 

14 situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not 

automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there 

16 could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect 

17 that that -- there's no longer any expense for 

18 ownership. 

19  MR. BURKE: In the situation where there is 

a dollar, of course, an amendment can be made. But see 

21 the -- the dollar doesn't show up in the means test. 

22 The means test is the aggregate -­

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it isn't 

24 automatic that because there's one payment, then 

forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the

happens under the tax law? Do they make an adjustment 

6 under the tax law as well? 

7  MR. BURKE: Of course -- under the tax law, 

8 you get a standard deduction. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: A standard -­

MR. BURKE: No different than here. Nobody 

11 goes behind the scenes and says, hey, what is that 

12 standard deduction? 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So that they -­

14 what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the 

IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but 

16 then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee 

17 takes you out of the chart. Is that what you think is 

18 the law? 

19  MR. BURKE: No, that's not what I think is 

the law. What I'm saying is Congress has given, in this 

21 case, an individual like Jason Ransom $150,000 over 5 

22 years to spend. They are not saying whether he actually 

23 spends it in any one category. 

24  For instance, the car ownership might be -­

equate to $28,000 over 5 years. Rent might be 1,000.

1 That's 60,000 over 5 years. Congress did not say go 

2 back and make sure Mr. Ransom is spending every dollar. 

3 These are averages across the nation. And when it comes 

4 to a car ownership expense, we're not saying spend $471. 

Oh, you have no payment? You didn't spend anything for 

6 5 years? 

7  No. What it's saying is, over 5 years, I 

8 have a cost associated with owning that vehicle, whether 

9 it's a loan or lease payment, whether it's replacing the 

vehicle, whether it's major repairs, on average, across 

11 the country. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: You do. You do, but the 

13 difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to 

14 Justice Ginsburg's first question.

 Of course you have all kinds of costs 

16 dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it 

17 says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the 

18 applicable costs from IRS. And what it has on page 5a 

19 is it has something called "ownership costs."

 MR. BURKE: Correct. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: And it defines those as 

22 $471. 

23  MR. BURKE: Correct. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: And then on 3a, where it 

says what ownership costs are, it says the

1 transportation standards consist of nationwide figures 

2 for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as 

3 ownership costs. So when I read that, I said ownership 

4 costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing 

else. 

6  Now, you have all kinds of other things. 

7 It's just these words "ownership costs" don't refer to 

8 those other things, because of that definition given 

9 right there. That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was 

initially asking. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I was. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: And I -- and how -- how do 

13 you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear 

14 language which says what these standards refer to?

 MR. BURKE: Because the standards refer to 

16 the numbers. It's a chart. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it doesn't -- for 

18 example, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and 

19 they cost you $48 extra. You're not going to say the 

ownership costs refer to the apples, even if you 

21 decorate the car with them. 

22  (Laughter.) 

23  MR. BURKE: What -- what -­

refers to lease and loan payments. Nothing else.

say is applicable? 

6  MR. BURKE: What the statute says is the 

7 applicable -- you shall get, mandatory, the applicable 

8 amounts specified based on where a debtor resides -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. The -- the 

applicable amounts specified where? 

11  MR. BURKE: In the national local standards. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Read the text of the 

13 statute, would you, please, for me? I couldn't even get 

14 it from your brief. You had to refer me back to the 

petition. Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or 

16 printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of 

17 kicking me back to dig out your petition? 

18  MR. BURKE: "The debtor's monthly expenses 

19 shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

specified under the national local standards." 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: "Amount specified under" 

22 the standard. 

23  MR. BURKE: Specific amount, "applicable" 

24 modifies "amounts specified."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Applicable amounts

1 specified," not the amounts specified if applicable. 

2  MR. BURKE: Correct, based on where a debtor 

3 resides. 

4  Now, the only way a court can say that an 

individual has to have a debt on a car to get this 

6 deduction -- there's two ways: One -­

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Look at the local standard, 

8 which is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right? 

9 And all it says is "Ownership Costs," "First Car," 

"$471." That's the relevant text, isn't it? 

11  MR. BURKE: Yes. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: What if a person leases a 

13 car? Do you think they get ownership costs? 

14  MR. BURKE: Yes, because they get the cost 

whether they owe on it or not. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: But they don't own the car, 

17 so how can they get ownership costs? 

18  MR. BURKE: There's a different definition. 

19 "Ownership" doesn't mean -- it can mean possession. 

But -­

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get that, from 

22 the -­

Financial Standards?

1  MR. BURKE: No. The Collection Financial 

2 Standards say you get the lease -- you get the deduction 

3 if you have a loan or a lease payment. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get the 

definition that somebody who leases something owns it? 

6  MR. BURKE: I don't. I'm not sure they do 

7 own it. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Then how do they get 

9 ownership costs?

 MR. BURKE: Because you have possession of 

11 it. It's based on having the item. It's costs 

12 associated with having the item, whether it's paid off 

13 or not. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: If somebody rents an 

apartment, do they own the apartment? 

16  MR. BURKE: Probably under ownership, their 

17 possession is some type of an ownership. It may be just 

18 possessory. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there something wrong 

with the IRS saying what they mean? It says ownership 

21 costs means monthly loan or lease payments. Now, is 

22 there something -­

1 defining ownership costs in that way? 

2  MR. BURKE: No, for the collection of taxes, 

3 there is not. But if you're going to use -- start 

4 digging into the manual, you might as well bring it all 

into 707(b), and, as we discussed earlier, there was 

6 language that said the collection financial analysis 

7 should be brought in, but that was deleted in the final 

8 version. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not just -- it says 

you are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership 

11 costs. So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for 

12 is -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs. And 

13 they say ownership costs means those two things. 

14  MR. BURKE: Well, I don't -- there's no 

reason to limit it. If you're going to -- the text 

16 doesn't say -- it says national local standards. It 

17 doesn't discriminate or give disparate treatment to that 

18 one item. If you're going to give it to one item, then 

19 it can be pulled in, and it should be -- the same 

treatment should be given to all items, and we should 

21 have to prove some type of a -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow that. If 

23 the simple thing is to just -- what does the word 

24 "costs" mean? And then you look to the IRS manual, and 

it tells you that "costs" means loan or lease payments.

4 it and say "under the IRS's interpretation." That 

language was taken out. And if we were to use the IRS's 

6 interpretation, here's the whole problem: It's 

7 discretionary. It goes up and down. It's based on an 

8 IRS revenue agent. It -- let me give you a separate 

9 example. Nobody -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Burke, if we could stay 

11 with this. The $471 is derived by looking at the 

12 average loan or lease payments nationwide. Then, in 

13 addition to that, we know that the IRS has a separate 

14 category for operating costs that is meant to reflect 

costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease 

16 payments. So, between those two things, why wouldn't we 

17 say that ownership costs means your loan and lease 

18 payments, but operating costs means your other costs of 

19 having a car, and that you get the operating costs if 

you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments, 

21 and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and 

22 lease payments? 

23  MR. BURKE: Because to reach that, you have 

24 to go into the Internal Revenue Manual. It's not in the 

statute that says you have to owe on it to get it. And

1 if you go into the Internal Revenue Manual -- let's look 

2 at operating expenses. What it says, in collecting 

3 taxes -- and it's in the Joint Appendix at pages 83 

4 through 88. But what it says, when it comes to local 

national other expenses, an internal revenue agent has 

6 discretion. You only get these expenses -- this is the 

7 overall idea -- if they produce income or if it's for 

8 health and welfare. 

9  And so, when we look at the Joint Appendix 

page 88, section B, under the local standard 

11 transportation expenses, when it talks about operating 

12 costs, which is something you just mentioned, it says 

13 you only get transportation expenses that are used to 

14 produce income or the health and welfare of an 

individual and their family. 

16  Plus, the fact that you own a car, the IRS 

17 under its discretion can take away the operating costs 

18 if it's on four cinder blocks in your backyard. You're 

19 not incurring fuel costs, mileage costs; you are not 

probably paying registration or any of those other 

21 operating costs. The IRS agent, under their manual, can 

22 take away that expense. 

23  So, why stop and say, well, we're just going 

24 to look at the ownership costs? And all they're saying 

here is if you owe on it, you get it; if you don't owe,

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, the -- it's 

6 unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of 

7 calculating disposable income although you don't have 

8 any expense. I understand how you get to that 

9 conclusion with respect to car ownership. Is there any 

other provision that in -- in calculating disposable 

11 income, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that 

12 you don't incur? 

13  MR. BURKE: If the Court understands my view 

14 that Congress gave -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. The question -- is 

16 there anything else that works like this? You don't 

17 have the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction? 

18 Any -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions, 

19 expenses. Is there any other one that works this way? 

It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: For example, Mr. Burke, what 

22 would happen if you didn't actually have any 

23 out-of-pocket medical costs? Could you still claim a 

24 deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?

of the courts? Is the answer that you just gave

9 cases. They are split almost 50-50, actually more -­

you're saying. He asked, are they split 50-50 on the

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do they apply -- do the 

19 courts apply the housing and utilities listed amount 

whether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or 

21 not you rent? 

22  MR. BURKE: There's two published cases I'm 

23 aware of, and both allowed it. One, somebody had 

24 military housing; one, the house was paid off. Both 

courts said you get it under the local standards. But

4 less.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, once again, Mr. 

6 Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this 

7 out. This is not the difference between your position 

8 and the position of the other side. You get the 

9 deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you 

are making the payment. Now, maybe it can be adjusted 

11 by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned, 

12 so long as you make one payment of $1, under their 

13 theory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't 

14 that right?

 MR. BURKE: That's correct. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: So. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question, incidentally, 

18 about courts was not with reference to the car expense. 

19 It was with reference to the hypothetical or to the 

issue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what 

21 if you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have 

22 the medical expense. And the answer -- and your -- and 

23 I wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly 

24 by the courts that have looked at this, or if there is 

also a split on that point?

1  MR. BURKE: I apologize for not 

2 understanding it. No, every other expense deduction 

3 that I have seen besides the car ownership, somebody 

4 gets it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they get it 

6 whether or not they incur that expense or not? 

7  MR. BURKE: Correct. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 

9 food -- you don't have to say, well, he did spend this 

much money on food, so he gets the standard deduction. 

11  MR. BURKE: Correct. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he doesn't eat as 

13 much as somebody else, he gets the same deduction, 

14 right?

 MR. BURKE: Correct. Or if he lives at home 

16 and mom cooks for him. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Burke, even you 

18 would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a 

19 car at all, you can't claim the car costs?

 MR. BURKE: Yes.

4 a public transportation, or two cars; pick the one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's in the chart -­

6  MR. BURKE: It's in the chart. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you claim -- okay. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: What if you own a car, but 

9 it's completely inoperable and it has no value? You buy 

it for a dollar. It's a junk car, and you're planning 

11 possibly to restore it at some point. Do you get the 

12 deduction then? 

13  MR. BURKE: Based on a strict reading of the 

14 code, you get it.

 Now, would the IRS allow it? Again, that's 

16 a discretionary standard, but any time you have an 

17 objective test, there's going to be line-drawing and 

18 perceived unfairness on the outskirts. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And would your answer be 

the same if the allowance was set, the decree was made, 

21 and -- and the debtor then went out and bought the 

22 junker to put in his driveway just in order to get the 

23 400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an 

24 evasion of the law that could be addressed by the 

Bankruptcy Court?

1325(a)(3), that deals with good faith. So if it 

6 appears somebody is not acting in good faith, then -­

7  JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- we've got about 

8 half the courts in the country agreeing with you. And 

9 so you've read all those arguments, and what in your 

opinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am 

11 stuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point? I 

12 mean, I can think of millions of examples. You have a 

13 form that says -- the employer says entertainment 

14 expenses. Then it defines entertainment expenses as 

food and transport, and they leave out movies, you know. 

16 Or you could have vacation expenses, and vacation 

17 expenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they 

18 leave out meals. And here we have a definition of 

19 ownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning, 

and they leave out other forms of ownership. 

21  MR. BURKE: Because -­

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the argument is, well, 

23 that's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable.

 MR. BURKE: The means test is a form, and if 

6 you look at the form -- the means test is a form.

say I'm not entitled to that deduction?

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  The Bankruptcy Code precludes an above­

13 median-income debtor like Petitioner from shielding from 

14 his creditors $471 a month for a car payment that he 

does not have. A debtor with -­

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- food costs, housing 

17 costs, utility costs, by getting his parents to pay for 

18 those things and still take this deduction? 

19  MS. MAYNARD: The statute allows a debtor to 

take an applicable monthly expense amount. So if the 

21 debtor truly has no food costs, then the food standard 

22 would be not applicable to the debtor, so -­

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary said that 

24 only two courts have addressed this issue and have 

permitted those deductions. So under what reasoning

1 would we apply a different standard to the car costs as 

2 opposed to those other costs? 

3  MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, with respect -­

4 I think the cases he was talking about were housing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Housing. 

6  MS. MAYNARD: Right. So housing and car 

7 costs are part of the local standards. Food, clothing, 

8 house cleaning supplies, those are part of the national 

9 standards. The -- in our view, the text that goes along 

with -- accompanies the tables, which is not the 

11 Internal Revenue Manual -- it's just the pages reprinted 

12 at 1a to 3a of our brief. The Collection Financial 

13 Standards, the prefatory explanation for what the tables 

14 mean. In our view, that is -- goes along with -­

incorporated into the national local standards. 

16  The national standards, Justice Sotomayor, 

17 are allowed, as long as you have under the calculations 

18 -- as explained in the standards, under the national 

19 standards, a debtor would receive the allowance in the 

table as long as they have any such expense, so 

21 regardless of amount. However, if they have no such 

22 expense, then they are taken out by the statutory 

23 language in the means test, which says that the standard 

24 must be applicable to the debtor. And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they have

1 pre-purchased their food expenses, so long as they have 

2 $1 of food expense they get the entire expense even

4  MS. MAYNARD: If they are -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are things 

6 like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver 

7 your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if 

8 you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that 

9 is allowed?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I think if, 

11 over the 60-month period looking forward, you know, that 

12 you're going to -- you've already paid up for your food 

13 for the next 60 months and you're not going to incur any 

14 additional food expenses, no, then in that situation the 

standard would be inapplicable to you. You would be 

16 having no -- in that hypothetical -­

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you paid $1 

18 for food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?

the way the standards operate, Your Honor. 

21  I haven't seen any cases litigated over food 

22 expense -­

24 leads to a result that's just as absurd as your

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that was a 

4 big part of your argument. You said his position leads 

to an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd. 

6  MS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

7 for this reason, which is that the national standards 

8 are food, clothing, house cleaning supplies, things that 

9 you expect every debtor to have. You don't see much 

litigation about those expenses. The local standards, 

11 however, operate differently. In our view -- and our 

12 view's different from the government's, Justice Scalia. 

13 In our view, under the local standards and the way that 

14 they apply as explained in the Collection Financial 

Standards, is that the debtor is allowed their actual 

16 expense for the local standard or the amount in the 

17 table, whichever is less. So in the hypothetical -­

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that? 

19  MS. MAYNARD: In our -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The debtor's monthly 

21 expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly 

22 expense amounts specified under the national and local 

23 standards. So the national and local standards have 

24 amounts listed. Where does it say you take only the 

actual, not the national or local standard?

Official 

1  MS. MAYNARD: I read that text, Your 

2 Honor -- again, the Court doesn't need to decide this 

3 maximum cap issue to decide this case, because the 

4 Petitioner has no expense whatsoever, and so it's not 

applicable to him. 

6  But in our view, Justice Sotomayor -- in our 

7 view, you get it from the language of the statute that 

8 says the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

9 specified under the national standards and local 

standards. And the way that we understand the national 

11 and local standards to work is, if you look at page -­

12 it's explained on page 1a of the petition to our brief, 

13 the red brief. Maximum allowance -- it's the third 

14 paragraph down: "Maximum allowances for housing and 

utilities and transportation, known as the Local 

16 Standards, vary by location. Unlike the National 

17 Standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually 

18 spent or the standard, whichever is less." 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's -- but that's 

not what the provision at issue here says. It says you 

21 use the amount specified under the national standards, 

22 and you use actual for everything else. That's what the 

23 statute said. So now you're trying to move the actual 

24 into the first half of the text?

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you even 

3 bother? Why don't you -- if -- if what you're arguing 

4 is that only actual expenses are -- are what you can 

claim, you wouldn't need the first half. 

6  MS. MAYNARD: Yes, you would, Your Honor, 

7 because what the -- what the statute's purpose here is 

8 -- I mean, I think it's helpful to step back. 

9  Chapter 13 sends one to chapter 7's means 

test for the purpose of calculating the amounts 

11 reasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of 

12 the debtor. And Congress chose to import the -- the 

13 methodology of the national standards and local 

14 standards as a way both to set the categories of 

expenses that debtors could receive payments for, and, 

16 with the case of the national and local standards, to 

17 set the amounts. They were worried about capping upper 

18 discretion because Congress -- it's quite clear from the 

19 text and the legislative history -- was concerned about 

above-median-income debtors taking luxurious expense 

21 amounts. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you would have 

23 the statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses 

24 shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts 

specified, as a -- as a maximum. You would have to add

1 "maximum" somewhere there. 

2  MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, because the 

3 amount under the national standards, as the national 

4 standards operate, is the -- is an allowance, not an 

actual, and the amount under the local standards, as 

6 they operate, is the amount actually spent or the amount 

7 in the table, whichever is less. And, again -­

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your 

9 position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in 

advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for 

11 things like their car. I would have thought the 

12 Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that 

13 they're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay 

14 off, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying 

expenses in advance. Why should somebody who does that 

16 be in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody 

17 who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back? 

18  MS. MAYNARD: Money is fungible, Your Honor, 

19 so to the extent the debtor has incurred expenses before 

going into bankruptcy instead of, as here, paying off 

21 this more than $85,000 in credit card debt, shouldn't be 

22 able to -­

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he hasn't 

24 incurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses. It's the whole 

point, I guess, that he's paid for something.

1  MS. MAYNARD: He used his money, perhaps, to

3 credit card debt, and so he has a salary of $50,000, and 

4 he has a credit card debt of $85,000, and he owns a 

2-year car -- 2-year-old car outright. He should not be 

6 able to deduct, as a measure of his reasonably necessary 

7 expenses for his maintenance and support over the next 

8 50 months, $28,000 that he doesn't need for a car 

9 payment that he doesn't make.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're -­

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he can 

12 do it -- even though he can do it for everything else -­

13 he can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping 

14 expenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he 

can even do it -- the other, the final category is 

16 miscellaneous, so he can do it for anything. 

17  MS. MAYNARD: Well, the miscellaneous, all 

18 those numbers are capped, and the legislative history 

19 makes clear Congress thought all those numbers would 

actually effectively act as caps. In other words, to 

21 the extent there was debate in the Congress, Congress 

22 was concerned that these numbers were actually too low, 

23 not that they were going to give anybody a windfall.

1 is that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court 

2 and show what their monthly food bills have been over 

3 what period of time, how much their personal supplies 

4 have been over what period of time? How can you 

calculate forward what they are going to spend on a 

6 monthly basis for each of those items? Isn't that the 

7 reason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do 

8 that? 

9  MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor, and in the 

national standards, which all the items you just list 

11 are national standards, under the national standards you 

12 don't do the actuals. On page 1a, it explains: 

13 "Allowances for food, clothing and other items, known as 

14 the National Standards, apply nationwide except for 

Alaska and Hawaii.... Taxpayers are allowed the total 

16 National Standards amount for their family size and 

17 income level, without questioning amounts actually 

18 spent." 

19  For -- yes, for those hard-to-calculate 

items, you do -- our position is you do get the amounts 

21 in the chart. For local standards -- the local 

22 standards, however, which include home, mortgage, lease 

23 expenses, utilities, and transportation, which include 

24 both ownership costs and operating costs, you get the 

actual or whichever is less.

2 more logical than the position that you read in some of 

3 the instructions applicable to the -- to the chart 

4 that's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not 

others. I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read 

6 in the requirement that have to have made a lease 

7 payment, you should also read in the requirement that 

8 you're referring to now, which would mean your deduction 

9 is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease 

payment. 

11  I don't see why -- is there any reason why 

12 one would read in the other one and not read in yours? 

13  MS. MAYNARD: Not in our view, Your Honor, 

14 because in our view the chart is -- is ambiguous about 

what the number stands for. And so in the national 

16 standards, the text, the prefatory text, explains that 

17 the amount is an allowance if you have the expense. In 

18 the local standards, the prefatory text explains that 

19 the amount operates as a cap.

 But the important point for this case, Your 

21 Honor, is that you don't have to decide anything about 

22 the national standards because Petitioner is left at the

2 old -- 200,000 miles, and it was going to break down, 

3 you know, within the next 5 years? Would the debtor 

4 then be able to take the deduction?

 MS. MAYNARD: If the debtor owns the car 

6 outright at the time they file for bankruptcy, they 

7 would not get the deduction. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though if you look 

9 ahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that 

the debtor is going to have to incur those expenses? 

11  MS. MAYNARD: They would not get the 

12 deduction under this calculation. However, under this 

13 Court's decision in Lanning, when one goes to project 

14 the disposable income, it's conceivable that the debtor 

could prove that it's known or virtually certain that 

16 they will need a new car and that that could be 

17 accounted for. 

18  But -- but also the Bankruptcy Code in 1329 

19 allows for modification of a plan, and so when the time 

arises that their car conks out and they need a new car, 

21 they can move to modify their plan. I think it's -­

3 says look: This whole thing was written for a different 

4 purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those 

things from the beginning into the tables, we're really 

6 going to get into a mess. For example, we are going to 

7 give people deductions when they have lease payments, 

8 even though they're not owners when they have lease 

9 payments. The company owns -- not even an ownership 

expense, but it does say use the lease payment. And 

11 then it has all these other things.

13 ownership expense. You go to the registry of motor 

14 vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner? And they'll 

tell you, yes or no. And if the answer is yes, he 

16 deducts $471. Sometimes that's too little; sometimes 

17 that's too much. But once we depart from that, we're 

18 really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all 

19 these things mean that were written for other purposes. 

So, what do you say to that? 

21  MS. MAYNARD: I say, Justice Breyer, that 

22 there's nothing in the statute or the legislative 

23 history that suggests this was meant to be an overall 

24 budget for above-median-income debtors. This was about 

capping upper discretion and limiting the expenses 

38

1 available as reasonably necessary expenses for 

2 above-median-income debtors. 

3  And I think that point is made perfectly 

4 clear by the fact that if you can compare it to what 

happens now to a below-median-income debtor, a 

6 below-median-income debtor in the same situation as 

7 Petitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed 

8 no amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he 

9 doesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably 

necessary. 

11  And I think that the 2005 Congress would 

12 think it was a senseless result, as they argue here, 

13 that Petitioner gets $471, above-median-income debtor, 

14 the very class of debtors with whom Congress was 

concerned in the 2005 amendments, to shield from his 

16 creditors over the life of the plan when he has no 

17 comparable expense. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that -­

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What we are talking about 

is a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who 

21 has a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he 

22 gets the deduction. Why is that, in light of the second 

23 sentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the 

24 statute, which says, "Notwithstanding any other 

provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the 

39

1 debtor shall not include any payments for debts." I 

2 mean, that would be the car company. 

3  And has -- has that point been litigated? 

4  MS. MAYNARD: That -- that sentence is 

somewhat of a conundrum, Your Honor, and I think that 

6 the Court doesn't need to decide the meaning here, 

7 because whatever it does, it doesn't get Petitioner 

8 within the Romanette ii calculation -­

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No -- no, but it would -­

MS. MAYNARD: -- because he has no payment. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would eliminate the 

12 anomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies. There 

13 are many anomalies in each position. It would eliminate 

14 one of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern 

the counsel and the Court. 

16  MS. MAYNARD: Well, my understanding of that 

17 provision is that it serves two purposes. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That it? 

19  MS. MAYNARD: Serves two purposes. The 

first is that it makes clear -- in the back of our 

21 brief, we have the other necessary expenses from the 

22 IRM. And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the 

23 categories of other necessary expenses are secured or 

24 legally perfected debts and unsecured debts.

 So I think the -- the otherwise -- the 

40
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 "notwithstanding" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii 

2 should not capture those other unsecured debts and 

3 secured debts, that it's the very purpose of this whole 

4 calculation to figure out how much money you have to pay 

those things. 

6  The second purpose the sentence serves is to 

7 make sure that there is no double-counting, because 

8 Romanette iii, the very next provision in the means 

9 test, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for 

secured debts. Now, many car loans are probably secured 

11 debts, and in our view if you actually have a car loan 

12 -- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a 

13 car lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment. 

14  But if -- if one actually did have a car 

loan that was secured by the car, which I think is the 

16 vast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor 

17 expenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only 

18 the actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the 

general position was you get either the actual payment 

21 or the 471, of whichever is higher. 

22  MS. MAYNARD: Whichever is less. 

23  I think that -- that's my understanding of 

24 how the local standards work, Your Honor. I think, 

then, as a practical matter, that really will end up

1 only applying to car leases with respect to 

2 transportation ownership costs, because I think that the 

3 "notwithstanding" sentence removes secured car loans 

4 from Romanette ii and has them calculated under 

Romanette iii, where there is no comparable cap. 

6  And the -- but -- but the point at issue in 

7 this case doesn't involve the interaction between 

8 Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how 

9 those two things interact, when the debtor has no 

payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any 

11 car ownership costs, because what we're trying to figure 

12 out is what amounts does he reasonably need for his 

13 maintenance and support? And this question is a very 

14 important question. This scenario happens a lot.

 In the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did is 

16 -- at Congress's request to which Petitioner cites in 

17 his reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in 

18 claiming this transportation ownership expense was $335, 

19 which is a lot when you're talking about the standard in 

the chart being 471. There are many debtors who are 

21 getting this expense either above their amount or when 

22 they have no such expense at all, and so even if the 

23 Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are 

24 implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple 

one, which is: This debtor has no applicable monthly

12 please the Court: 

13  The only question this Court needs to 

14 resolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership 

expense is applicable to Petitioner. The answer is no. 

16  The ownership cost is for loan and lease 

17 payments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just 

18 doesn't have any payments of that type. To allow him to 

19 pretend that he does would create absurd results. He'd 

be able to shield approximately $28,000 from his 

21 unsecured creditors, and he'd be better off than lower 

22 income chapter 13 debtors. And we just don't think that

comfortable with that result? 

6  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that goes to the 

7 question of whether the amount in the table is the 

8 amount to be used or a cap on actual expenses. In our 

9 view, it is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I understood 

11 your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole 

12 amount, not simply as a cap. 

13  MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. Now, of 

14 course, we haven't seen -- the executive office for 

U.S. Trustees has not seen any $1 payments. It doesn't 

16 know of any such commercially available payments. It 

17 suspects the payments would be -­

19 $1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that 

would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000 

21 and the amount would give him $30,000? The trustees 

22 have probably seen loans like that. 

23  MS. SAHARSKY: What I'm saying, Your Honor, 

24 is that there are many circumstances in which an expense 

amount is a standard amount, but you still need to make 

44

1 a threshold showing that it's applicable to you. 

2  And if I could give the Court one example: 

3 When an individual does his Federal income tax forms, 

4 you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you 

can't just take a deduction for any child you have. You 

6 have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if 

7 the person lives at home with you for more than 1 year 

8 and have you a certain amount of expenses to support 

9 them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on 

your tax forms. The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure 

11 out their actual costs. 

12  It is the case in real life that there are 

13 allowance amounts that are average amounts that are 

14 given to people once they meet the criteria. And that's 

what we are saying happens here. 

16  Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as 

17 to what you do with people who actually have vehicle 

18 ownership expenses. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why aren't -- why isn't one 

of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum 

21 allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, 

22 known as the local standards, vary by location, and 

23 unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed 

24 the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is 

less? Why doesn't that apply?

3 that's on page 1a of the red brief appendix. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. SAHARSKY: And that -- what that's 

6 referring to is -- it says the amount actually spent or 

7 the standard. And that's distinguishing between the 

8 amount that's actually spent or the standard, which is 

9 the standard -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: -- amount in the table. 

12 Right. 

13  And of course, we look to what -- the text 

14 that Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that 

says that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the 

16 debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified 

17 under the national standards and local standards. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not applicable. It's 

19 not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much. 

Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no 

21 payment at all. 

22  MS. SAHARSKY: I think that it is -- it 

23 would further Congress's purposes to say that you 

24 have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the 

debtor has. But we just don't think the text goes that

2 category is applicable to the debtor, that then you use

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- but the 

gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is: Why are you 

6 running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel 

7 relied on? And if that were clearly relevant to this 

8 statute, it would seem to me to answer the question. 

9  Are you saying we -- we don't look at this 

because it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a 

11 regulation? What is -- what is -- in your view, what 

12 effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia 

13 quoted? Nothing at all? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: It would not be relevant in 

the bankruptcy context, in our view, and the reason is 

16 because the -- the statutory text refers to the 

17 standards. And in our view, you can look to the IRS 

18 commentary to see what the standards mean, what their 

19 scope is, as Justice Breyer was discussing with his 

apples hypothetical. 

21  But this additional language is guidance to 

22 IRS agents in tax delinquency cases about how to collect 

23 taxes. As Petitioners -­

think the word "applicable" is ambiguous and difficult

1 to construe. Do we then look at this language at 1a, or 

2 do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all 

3 respects? 

4  MS. SAHARSKY: You -- Your Honor, you could 

look at this language, but we think that it reflects not 

6 the standards, but what -- how the IRS uses the 

7 standards in individual cases of tax delinquency. 

8  To the extent that the IRS is defining what 

9 the standards are, what the scope of the standards are 

-- for example, that ownership costs are loan and lease 

11 payments -- of course, we would think that you would 

12 look to that, but this additional guidance to IRS agents 

13 we don't think is what Congress meant when it said 

14 "expense amounts specified under the standards."

 But we do think that the text could be read 

16 the way you suggest. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then you would be 

18 comfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who 

19 only pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of 

the housing and utilities allowable living expenses 

21 because that's the amount specified? 

22  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the housing and 

23 utilities expenses have been broken out into a mortgage 

24 and rent component and a utilities component. So in 

that circumstance, we would say the individual only is

actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses, 

16 do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are 

17 they available for everybody? All the creditors? 

18  MS. SAHARSKY: They're not available for the 

19 creditors. The idea behind this calculation is that 

there, of course, are secured debts that have priority, 

21 and then this calculation is used to figure out how much 

22 money is left to pay unsecured creditors. And the idea 

23 is that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs 

24 to keep money for himself so he can continue with the 

everyday business of life. For example, the car

don't have any such payment, then they don't have this 

6 need for this additional fund because -­

9 he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the 

car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the 

11 food expenses? 

12  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, certainly the 

13 Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what 

14 happens to that regard. What it's just trying to do is 

figure out the disposable income that is available to 

16 pay unsecured creditors, that the debtor doesn't need. 

17  And I should just note with respect to this 

18 question of whether there is an overall budget that the 

19 debtor is allowed, you know, that's certainly not the 

case in any of the other provisions that follow this 

21 applicable monthly standards and local standards. You 

22 have the actual other necessary expenses, actual 

23 continuation of taking care of chronically ill family

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Saharsky, could you 

8 explain to me the government's position on when a debtor 

9 with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under 

Romanette ii? In other words, this goes back to Justice 

11 Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and 

12 whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes 

13 all loan and lease payments from Romanette ii? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: It does not have that effect, 

Your Honor. What it does is to take out the actual debt 

16 payments that are part of the other necessary 

17 expenses -- these are on page 25a of the red brief -­

18 that counsel on our side mentioned. These are other 

19 necessary expenses that are actual debt payments, and 

the local and national standards are expense amounts. 

21 We don't think that Congress defined those to be debt 

22 payments. 

23  So the function of the payments for debts 

24 language, we agree with Respondent's counsel, would be 

twofold. First, it would excise the other necessary 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 expenses that actually are debt payments, which makes 

2 complete sense. You know, one of them is an unsecured 

3 debt payment, and you wouldn't want to consider that one 

4 of your expenses because the whole point of the 

calculation is to figure out how much money you have 

6 left to pay unsecured debts. And then the other 

7 function that it serves is in Romanette iii because you 

8 were getting secured debt payments there to not 

9 double-count them in Romanette ii.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, in other words, the 

11 loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes 

12 of the notwithstanding clause; they count as expense 

13 amounts? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: We say that those are expense 

amounts that are specified. They're not payments for 

16 debts. I should note, because Justice Kennedy asked 

17 this question, that this was not something that was 

18 relied upon by the courts below. I don't believe that 

19 there's any definitive court of appeals opinion that 

goes through in detail what that provision is designed 

21 to do. So I would urge this Court that it need not 

22 resolve it in this case and instead do what the court of 

23 appeals did, which is to say that, just looking at the 

24 plain text, the word "applicable" means not everybody 

can get these amounts in the national and local 

52

1 standards, and it needs to be someone who actually has 

2 those payment amounts. The whole point of this part of 

3 this statute is to figure out what money is available to 

4 pay unsecured creditors, and it's payments that need to 

be made for expenses that matter. It's not whether the 

6 individual debtor has a car. 

7  I also note, just because it came up earlier 

8 and is a very important point, that to the extent that 

9 the Court only wants to look at the tables to figure out 

what are ownership costs, are they loan and lease 

11 payments, just looking at the title of the table, 

12 Ownership Costs, you need to have costs. Looking at the 

13 fact that there are two different ones -- there's 

14 ownership costs as opposed to operating costs -- makes 

clear that some of the things that Petitioner suggests 

16 might be ownership costs are, in fact, operating costs.

4  MR. BURKE: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As opposed to -- it would 

6 be 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471? 

7  MR. BURKE: Correct. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the 

9 disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was 

willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500. Why did the 

11 debtor come up with a $500 figure when projected 

12 disposable income without the car ownership would be -­

13 if he gets the car ownership, would only be $210? 

14  MR. BURKE: This is exactly why our view of 

the law works. The means test is a minimum amount. 

16 It's a bottom-line quick figure based on standard 

17 deductions. It was $200 based on our calculation if 

18 he's given his deductions based on age, location, et 

19 cetera.

 We then go back to I and J, and J, which is 

21 on page 44 of the Joint Appendix, is his current 

22 expenses. And if we look at line 13A, there is no 

23 vehicle payment. He's not taking $471. He took his 

24 income and expense. The bottom line was 500. He knew 

he had to pay at least 200. He's willing to pay the 

54

1 500. He's not getting a $471 deduction because there is 

2 no car payment on his Schedule J. 

3  And if we look at the formula that way, the 

4 means test is a general form to give standard 

deductions, to give us a quick bottom line, and the 

6 debtor is either going to pay that amount or more based 

7 on his income and expense, and he would pay more if he 

8 really didn't have that expense. So if he didn't have a 

9 rent expense of $1,000 a month, it would show up on 

Schedule J that he didn't have 1,000, so his payment 

11 would go to $1,500 a month. That's the good faith 

12 that's involved in this case. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: It would have to go to 

14 1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart, 

would decide to pay that amount? 

16  MR. BURKE: He's going to have to pay an 

17 amount of at least $200. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

19  MR. BURKE: It would be hard to confirm a 

case if he doesn't pay somewhere in that range. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. So why -- why would 

22 we assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an 

23 extraordinarily generous fellow. I don't think most
