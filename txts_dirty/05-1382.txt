 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now we'll hear 

argument in 05-1382, Gonzales versus Planned Parenthood 

Federation of America.

 General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may 

it please the Court:

 This case presents the same basic 

constitutional question concerning the Federal 

Partial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case. Of 

course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review 

here went much further in invalidating the Federal act. 

If I could begin by talking about whether what we're 

talking about here is medical necessity or just some 

marginal effect on the risks. I think in order to 

fairly understand the argument that respondents are 

making in this case, their argument has to be a matter 

of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of 

this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor 

really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in 

a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such. 

What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure

on a living fetus.

 So if a doctor really thinks the D&X 

procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise 

at the outset of the procedure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the problem with this 

is that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree. I 

mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have 

hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after 

doctor who takes the other position, and they say: 

Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the 

fetus in a single pass. The fetus is going to die 

anyway. It's not viable. We're trying to remove it in 

a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is 

if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the 

womb. There may be fetal parts left inside the womb. 

Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's 

an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the 

womb. If you try to induce demise through a drug 

before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into 

the system. If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a 

serious problem of not trying to get the child out as 

quickly as possible. If you have preeclampsia or 

eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman 

will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could 

be such a situation. The doctor thinks only one thing:

Get it out as fast as possible. All right.

 Now, I know there are doctors who think the 

contrary. There's lots of testimony of the doctors who 

think roughly along the lines I've taken. That was true 

in Stenberg as well. So I think the issue is not that 

you don't have support -- you do -- but that the support 

is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that 

case?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let 

me take as a point of departure the specific risks that 

you associated with the injection that induces fetal 

demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to 

that injection, then all the other benefits that are 

associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because 

they can perform the D&X procedure. Now if you look 

through the record on this point, I think you will not 

find any testimony that supports a significant risk from 

that injection. Yes, there are risks because there are 

risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not 

significant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a definition in 

the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying, 

I've been trained to try to save life and I want to 

perform the safest possible way? Is there some legal 

definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant

risk?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With all respect, I think 

if a single injection that doesn't take any particular 

risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that 

counts as a significant risk, then we might as well 

strike the word "significant" from the discussion in 

Stenberg. And Then I think what you have is that it's 

very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance 

for any marginal risk to maternal health.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my question is the 

same as Justice Breyer's. Is there anything in the 

literature, including medical literature, that talks 

about significant or minor risks? I mean, you fill out 

forms when you go to the dentist about risks. Now, 

if -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that 

significant? I mean, I don't know.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's a very 

difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice 

Kennedy. And I think it actually, that question, 

though, has direct bearing on this case, because 

Congress after all found that there was some risks with 

the D&X procedure. The most prominent one that I would 

point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because 

the D&X procedure does -- it does require additional 

dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing

future pregnancies. And that was born out, although not 

at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen 

study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17 

women who had the D&X procedure and were available for 

follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the 

follow-up.

 So I think those risks are born out in the 

only study that's available. And I think the question 

becomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for 

something that there was no other known cure for, you 

might think, well, those are the risks you run. But 

when there remains available the D&E procedure, which 

has been well tested and works every single time as a 

way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that, 

if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for 

some life-threatening condition with no known cure, 

those risks might not be significant in that context.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there is a risk 

if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some 

forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk 

of being punctured.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: There is a risk, Justice 

Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in 

those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk 

between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are

really as far as I can tell nonexistent. Even in that 

condition, unless there's some reason not to put the 

injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X 

procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as 

Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th 

week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium 

chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has 

nothing to worry about from this statute.

 And I think the very fact that they are 

attributing significant risks to a single injection 

shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance 

position. And that's a legitimate position, I suppose, 

but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's 

precedence, most notably the Casey decision. Because if 

all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk, 

then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour 

waiting period in the Casey decision, because the 

plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has 

imposed significant risks. They were backed in that 

point by an amicus brief by ACOG. But this Court didn't 

say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal 

risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule.

 This Court instead upheld the 24-hour 

period, even though it required overruling Akron I's 

contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to

Akron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that 

put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing 

interest that the government has in this area.

 And so with respect, I think that the 

argument they are making is effectively an argument for 

returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of 

law was that there would be no interference between a 

doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best 

judgment as to how to treat the patient. This Court of 

course consciously moved away from that in Casey and 

expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and 

Thornburgh to that effect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I follow up on a 

question the Chief Justice asked you during the last 

argument? We got into the government's construction of 

the statute to narrow it to intentional situations. 

Would you explain a little more exactly what situations 

you would exclude and what you would include in your 

interpretation of the statute?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, justice Stevens, let 

me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take 

you specifically to the text, I can do that. But I 

think the bottom line would be that under our view of 

the statute, the most important thing is for those 

doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do

the D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100 

percent of the time. Well, in the 1 percent of the 

cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past 

the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not 

covered by the statute because they would not satisfy 

what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the 

statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus 

be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of 

committing the overt act of killing fetus. And in those 

cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing 

the D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to 

deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the 

dismemberment procedure. So they would not be covered 

by the mens rea requirement of the statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you measure the mens 

rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the 

dilation a day or two before the actual operation is 

performed, or is it at the time of beginning the 

operation?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could measure 

it from either time point. I think the better view is 

actually that it would be measured from the beginning of 

the surgical operation, though the evidence of their 

intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very, 

very relevant. The reason I would say that is I think

if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme 

amount of dilation at the point they start the 

procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be 

for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point, 

rather than an intact removal.

 But if this Court thought that the 

constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then 

you could start from the beginning of the dilation 

because I think in fairness the differences between the 

two procedures are probably most manifest in the 

dilation regimen. I also think, though, the record 

supports the notion that there are differences even once 

you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the 

fetus. I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to 

do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg 

removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing 

the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal 

body. If you're -- obviously if you're performing a 

dismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second 

leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on 

the first extremity that prevents itself.

 So I think there are differences even at the 

procedural level. So I think that it would probably be 

most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it 

from the beginning of the surgical part of the

procedure. But if you, as I say, in order to save the 

statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary 

interpretatio.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think you're wrong about 

-- you're probably wrong about this. But just before 

you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to 

get into the medical procedure. I heard you as saying, 

perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a 

lethal injection to kill the fetus. All right? That 

rang a bell. So I look up and see what the lower courts 

said about that and what they said is that nearly 

everyone agrees it is not always possible to kill the 

fetus by injection.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but can I respond to 

that specifically?

 JUSTICE BREYER: He says It is not always 

possible -- what?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Can I respond to that 

specifically?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, he then goes; he 

tells you why. He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says 

you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery, 

pelvic inflammatory disease. And then another one says 

they are not considered appropriate candidates because 

of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera.

So there's a list of medical situations where they 

couldn't use a fetal injection.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, if I could 

respond to that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, there are certain 

situations where the injection is contraindicated. I 

think they'd be relatively rare situations. And I 

think, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the 

statute might pose a problem if you could identify 

particular conditions where a D&X was particularly 

useful, and those were also situations where an 

injection would be contraindicated. I think, you know, 

the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a 

million; I don't know, but it's very small.

 Another point that's made in the record 

which I think is important is they suggest well, you 

know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into 

the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be 

successful something like 92 percent of the times. I 

think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement 

would certainly take care of any concern that the 

physician would have --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's bothering me, why I'm 

using this as an illustration is that there are so many

of these things. Of course there are special cases. We 

are only talking about a few, rare special cases. And 

as soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is 

that the judges are supposed to start deciding whether 

this is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than 

relying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor 

is now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work. 

At least I don't see how it's going to work without some 

people suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes 

by the judge.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I wish we 

were talking about just a few rare cases because I think 

if we were, there would be, the statute would be 

amenable to not being applied in those rare cases. But 

this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the 

other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that 

their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure 

in rare cases. They think it's a safer procedure every 

single time. And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and 

Dr. Frederickson try to do the D&X procedure every 

single time, and they don't do it because they are 

indifferent to health, I suppose. In their best 

judgment they think that's the better way to go.

 And it's just a question ultimately of 

whether you're going to defer to individual doctors'

judgments, even when it's very much of a minority 

judgment; I mean anything you want to say about this 

procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the 

orthodoxy. Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E 

procedure, not the D&X procedure. Even in the Nebraska 

case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the 

intact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a, 

know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking 

about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure.

 And so the question is when you have a 

perfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors 

who like to do is it a different way, can Congress 

countermand the doctors' judgment or do the doctors get 

the final word?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the doctor has the 

intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in 

utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in 

the last three months, with women with this particular 

shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that 

the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going 

to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented 

with the problem.

 Does he have the prohibitive intent? 

Because aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit 

the, most likely consequences of your acts?

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so. I mean 

that might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a 

realistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that. 

If that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that 

might be an example of where this question I talked 

about with Justice Stevens might matter. Which is in 

that case it might matter whether or not the intent was 

measured --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's important to 

me because you seem to think that there is a standard 

D&E. In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me 

that D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries 

quite without the intent of the doctor. Now maybe 

that's wrong.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record, 

it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform 

a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up 

performing a D&E. But the doctors that set out to 

perform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred 

percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment. 

Dr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up 

with dismemberment.

submission is that we can tell who is setting out to

perform which, by the dilation protocol. Those were the 

record references that you gave earlier?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. And you can, you 

can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a 

doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case, 

Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact 

removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to 

do a second round of dilation with a second round of 

laminarias. And of course, that second round of 

laminaria is also a medical procedure. Like the 

injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks 

of infection. If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony, 

this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition 

appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second 

round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the 

patient. And that's his testimony.

 So there are countervailing indications 

here. And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a 

practice that involves further dilation is not an 

irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one 

of the things that Congress heard was that there were 

risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence. 

And that's a particularly important concern because 

first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very 

good position to evaluate that risk because they provide

abortion services, not follow-up services. So they're 

not in a good position to judge that risk.

 Second of all, the only study we have here 

points out that there is a greater incidence of that 

preterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure. 

Now again they say, they are going to come up and say 

well it's not statistically significant. But the 

numbers I think are striking. They had 17 women in the 

group that had a D&X and came back. Two of them had a 

preterm pregnancy. The D&E group was much larger, 45, 

and two of them had a preterm delivery. Now I think as 

a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to 

be in a room with 17 people where two people were going 

to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with 

45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I 

know which room I'd like to be in. And all I'm pointing 

out --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, once you're making a 

point of that study, I think it was also the case that 

the ones that had the intact were older or rather 

further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Therefore the risks were 

greater.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well if I could just --

JUSTICE BREYER: And therefore since the 

risks were greater, the other side says that this 

actually shows it was safer. I mean, I don't know how 

to evaluate that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it's even more 

complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact, 

you're right that the D&X patients were at a further 

gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually 

older. And so I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I missed that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. But it happens 

that, the D&E patients were on average two years older, 

which I think also would be associated with greater 

risk. So I think it's a wash. But I still think the 

Chasen study net is quite helpful to our side. For one 

thing, this is a study put together by one of the 

plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern 

District case, based on a study of his own practice. 

And of course one of the intuitions about the D&X 

procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to 

be a faster procedure and there is going to be less 

blood loss.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, what did he find 

when he studied that? It was exactly the same for those

two procedures. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: Because your time is 

running out I did want to ask you about a feature of 

this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is 

perhaps stimulated by Stenberg. But up until now, all 

regulation on access to abortion has been state 

regulation and this measure is saying to the states, 

like it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a 

particular practice and we are going to take away the 

choice from the states, in an area where up until now 

it's, it's been open to the states to make those 

decisions. How should that weigh in this case? And it 

is something new.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean I don't think 

it should figure in this Court's decision. I mean 

principally because the other side in neither case makes 

a challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose 

there is two reasons for that. That legal reason that 

they don't bring the challenge is because there is a 

jurisdictional element that I think would address the 

challenges as a doctrinal matter. The practical reason 

I think is because this isn't the only instance in which 

the Federal Government has gotten involved to address 

issues related to the abortion context.

question of funding --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well but also access to 

clinics, in the the face act, which is also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The bes example where 

government has gotten involved in overriding what the 

states want to do is Casey. It seems rather odd for 

this Court to be concerned about stepping on the toes of 

the states.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- it's certainly 

true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal 

level one way or another since 1973. So I think that's 

also part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you 

know, the Federal Government gets involved in this 

issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good 

or for harm. It's there to protect access to the 

abortion clinics --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, That 

brings up a question I was intending to ask you. I 

notice the finding says nothing about interstate 

commerce but the statute says any physician who in or 

affecting interstate commerce performs the procedures. 

Does that mean that the procedure is performed in a free 

clinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would 

not be covered?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't

think we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken 

a definitive position on that.  I think it could be 

interpreted either way. I think my understanding is the 

face context, a free clinic would be covered. There's 

not a jurisdictional element in the face statute. So 

there may be differences as, in application.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But how could the Commerce 

Clause justify application to a free clinic? I don't 

understand.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think by, I mean, 

you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has 

suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate 

service is provided in commerce but in order to get the 

services they have to take --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Activities that --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. Exactly. I don't, I 

mean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case. If it 

had been we'd probably have a definitive position one 

way or another. But I don't think the constitutionality 

in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a 

feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that 

question one way or another.

 I think in regards to the Chasen study the 

last thing I would say about it though is that it's 

important because most of the arguments on the other

side are intuitive arguments. They are intuitive 

arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will 

be more safe. And what I think is telling is that the 

same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be 

quicker and there will be less blood loss. And when 

that was actually tested in a controlled study, it 

turned out not to be the case.

 The last thing I'll say about the Chasen 

study is there was this indication that the two most 

serious complications were associated with the D&E 

procedure. But one thing that I think is important to 

understand about the Chasen study is it is a 

retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own 

practice. Now what they do in every case is they set 

out to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are 

studying and what they call the D&X procedures, that 

cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X 

procedure and they were successful.

 The D&X cohort from this study, is you know, 

are those circumstances where he and his partner tried 

to do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E 

procedure.

 Now why is that significant? Because it 

shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those 

situations that were D&Es and they were associated with

serious complications there was nothing he could have 

done about it. He could have performed a D&X, he tried 

to perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended 

up performing a D&E. And so I really think on balance 

the Chasen study ends up supporting our position, 

because the first time you have any kind of controlled 

study what you find is that some of the intuition turns 

out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these 

are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study 

is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation. 

Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it 

does bear out one of Congress's concerns.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Could you address the 

question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case 

about the availability of other facilities? Because 

there are alternate methods but some of these require 

hospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals 

aren't always open.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right, I -- I --

JUSTICE BREYER: So it doesn't make much 

sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if 

you can't be admitted to the facility.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure. And as I tried to 

indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern 

because, the difference is whether some clinics will

only offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that 

basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the 

induction procedure. But that doesn't really, I don't 

think matter, because the point is anybody could can got 

a D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E.  In every 

single case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also 

offer the D&E. And since the D&E is what the district 

court in the Nebraska case described as the gold 

standard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is 

going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy 

option. And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you pin your 

whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es 

sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but, Justice 

Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is 

the best reading of the statute requires the intent at 

the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in 

the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to 

performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the 

world because everybody would look at that and say 

that's a D&E. In the one case --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do you do that, because 

I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it 

with the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a

doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an 

abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus. 

That's the language basically, right. And in this one 

it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the 

purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows 

will kill the fetus. So I look at those two sets of 

words. I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I 

don't see the difference.

 So if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too 

vague, why is the other one here not too vague?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, it's 

because of the addition of the anatomical landmark 

language to the Federal statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll grant you that 

in respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess 

was you didn't know what the words "significant 

substantial portion of the child," that tends to be 

cured. But if what Cathcart was worried about was the 

fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will, 

making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered 

and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom 

portion of the fetus descends outside the womb. And 

there he is and now what happens? If that's the 

concern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern 

exists here.

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, only with the 

caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't 

have to confront the second concern because it had the 

first concern. And if you thought that a leg, which 

this Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was 

the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either 

way it was covered no matter what your purpose was, 

because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to 

induce fetal demise.

 Here the compound mens rea requirement works 

with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you 

need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and 

purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel 

with the purpose of performing an overt act that will, 

will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you 

don't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past 

the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're 

trying to do something that's going to take place in 

utero.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time 

for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General 

Clement.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MS. GARTNER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 In Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the 

government cannot ban pre-viability abortions. Despite 

Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow 

category of pre-viability abortions, intact D&Es, as 

this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be 

banned so long as the ban contains a health exception. 

But I'd like to leave the health exception question 

aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that 

Congress has enacted here.

 The question is whether Congress can enact a 

pre-viability abortion ban that does not track the 

hallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court 

understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban 

a substantially greater array of abortions than would be 

banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in 

the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact 

D&E. And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in 

Stenberg and in the dissents.

 It is our position that this Court must 

reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license 

that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to 

allow such an expansion of pre- viability abortions that

can be banned would set the stage for continued 

legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the 

classic D&E method of abortion until truly there would 

be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is 

unconstitutional to ban pre- viability second trimester 

abortions.

 The government in this case has conceded 

that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact 

D&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg. But I want 

to highlight for the Court how the language of this act 

departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these 

departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the 

very facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E 

abortions, that enhance their safety.

 There is three respects in which the act 

departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood 

in Stenberg. First, the act does not require breach 

extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the 

primary hallmarks that this Court understood in 

Stenberg. Instead, the act applies once the fetus is 

extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence 

than extraction to the head. And in fact the government 

in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their 

reply concedes that in any of what the government calls 

standard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the

fetal navel before demise occurs.

 In addition, the act does not require the 

fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the 

procedure, another component of what is considered to be 

a hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg.

 In fact, the word intact appears nowhere in 

the statute and again the government concedes that some 

non-intact D&Es would violate this law as drafted. In 

fact, the government contends that one of the 

"advantages," in its words, is that the law would ban 

more than intact D&E. And finally, the act does not 

require that the fetus be extracted in a breach 

presentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court 

thought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks 

of intact D&E.

 Now this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I think 

this question was asked earlier, but I want your 

position. How often does the vertex delivery occur in a 

D&X procedure? I --

MS. GARTNER: Your Honor, two, two doctors 

in particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified 

that they have used in their practice the vertex 

presentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated, 

the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that

involved a greatly distended abdomen. The fetus 

presented in a head-first presentation. The head 

delivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way 

to complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the, 

of the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size 

because of the underlying fetal condition.

 In those cases, those doctors testified that 

that was absolutely the safest way to terminate the 

pregnancy for the woman. The only alternative way would 

have been abdominal surgery, which, which all the, 

virtually all of the doctors, even the government's 

doctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman 

than a vaginal surgical abortion.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Miss Gartner, with regard 

to your argument that the statute here did not track 

what you have described as the characteristics, the 

hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is 

that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a 

clear line between a legitimate abortion and 

infanticide. And if that is the theory, then whether 

it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is 

irrelevant. What would your answer be to that?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, two answers, Your Honor. 

First of all, the clear line that this Court drew in 

Stenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to

the head followed by an act that results in fetal 

demise. Very clearly what this Court understood in 

Stenberg could -- was, was an intact D&E and several 

members of the court suggested that that would be 

constitutional to ban.

 In addition, the government today seems to 

suggest --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we said that that 

would be an appropriate line. But the question here is 

is it really essential to an appropriate line that we 

talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or 

a non-breach delivery.

 MS. SMITH: Your Honor, I would agree that 

of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in 

Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the 

least central; that the other two hallmarks, the 

extraction to the head followed by a completely intact 

delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks 

that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and 

those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that 

Congress enacted.

 Today General Clement seems to be arguing 

that there is a different line that's protected in this 

statute, a different line than the Court recognized in 

Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when

demise occurs. But, but this Court in Stenberg 

understood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E, 

as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside 

the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs. The Court 

recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard 

D&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the 

women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation 

occurs, and after that fetal demise. So even in a 

standard D&E the line that the government today is 

offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus, 

would be violated in any D&E --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood the 

statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the 

statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed 

after passing the anatomical landmark.

 MS. GARTNER: Well, that's right, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we just say your 

hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be 

would not be covered by the statute.

 MS. GARTNER: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's 

right. But what I'm saying is that some part of the 

fetus, no matter what, is outside the women's uterus, 

whether it's an intact D&E, a non-intact D&E --

leg dying. We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and 

I think that's not the leg.

 MS. GARTNER: I think the important point is 

that the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E, 

what it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted 

past the anatomical landmark. So the anatomical 

landmark isn't a bright-line decision between intact 

D&Es and non-intact D&Es. But in Stenberg this Court 

drew that line between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es. 

It suggested --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does the 

government concede that in a standard D&E the living 

fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?

 MS. GARTNER: It does so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that was 

-- I thought their position was that that was not the 

standard D&E.

 MS. GARTNER: Right. It does so in two 

places, Your Honor. On page 32 of their initial brief 

they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they 

say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law 

from banning non- intact D&Es. The first is the 

anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of 

an overt act. They describe the overt act as saving 

non-intact D&Es that were not already excluded from the

anatomical landmark requirement. So that suggests that 

there are some standard D&Es that would not be saved by 

the anatomical landmark requirement.

 In addition, in their reply brief on page 22 

they explicitly say that the fetus is usually not 

delivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard 

D&E, but they don't say that that never occurs. So they 

do admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact 

the government witness, doctor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought their 

answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will 

lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of 

deliberately and intentionally removes those situations 

from the scope of the statute.

 MS. GARTNER: Well, I think that's not how I 

understood it, Your Honor. But in addition, the 

government witnesses, witness, Dr. Sadigian, admitted 

that in any standard D&E the fetus can be extracted past 

the navel, the anatomic landmark of the navel, of the 

naval, even in a standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Prior to demise?

 MS. GARTNER: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you understand the 

government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if 

the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to

do that, then the doctor is not liable?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I think this 

gets to the point I was going to make about the safety 

of doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the 

law, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether 

the intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E, 

the intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments 

into the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as 

possible, because each insertion of the instruments 

increases the risk of causing harm to the woman's 

uterus. And so in every D&E, regardless of whether the 

physician expects to have an intact fetus at the very 

end of the procedure, they do want to minimize the --

the amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few 

parts as possible and so there is a deliberate and 

intentional delivery of the fetus as far as possible 

which often can be past the navel, though in most cases 

it won't be up to the head. So that's why the line that 

this Court drew in Stenberg is the line that first of 

all delineates between two distinct procedures: intact 

D&E and nonintact D&E. The difference between those two 

procedures is whether the fetus is extracted to the head 

or not to the head before demise occurs. This, this 

statute doesn't draw that line. It draws a different 

line and in doing that, it captures far more abortions

than the other law would and, and the key thing is that 

if this law stands with the past the navel line the 

inevitable result is that doctors in order to try to 

avoid the reach of this statute will have to stop trying 

to minimize the instrumentation and stop trying to draw 

the fetus out as intact as possible because often when 

that happens --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My concern with your 

argument is it's not just the anatomical line. The 

statute, I guess the Solicitor General referred to this 

as the multiple mens rea requirement. It's not simply 

the extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but 

with the purpose of demise at that point. So, if in the 

typical D&E the demise is going to be accomplished 

before extraction passed the anatomical landmark. It 

wouldn't be covered by this law.

 MS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I guess to 

some extent it comes down to what intent means but if 

what it means that the doctors would prefer, would like 

it to come out as far as possible before they have to 

take any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing 

part, that's, that's what they intend.

 The doctor only uses disarticulation when 

it's necessary to clear an obstruction because the 

continued extraction --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

Solicitor General's reference with respect to the 

differing protocols on dilation which suggests a 

different intent going into the procedure for the D&E 

and D&X?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, two points, Your Honor. 

One is the statute makes no mention of dilation 

protocols even though some group like the American 

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists when they 

intend to define an intact D&E abortion they've defined 

it specifically by reference to dilation protocols. And 

some state statutes have also used dilation protocols as 

part of the definition of intact D&E but this statute 

makes no mention of dilation protocols.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the dilation 

protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of 

intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?

 MS. GARTNER: I think it would be relevant, 

Your Honor, but I think it's not -- it really can't be 

dispositive of the physician's intent be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because?

 MS. GARTNER: Some doctors use a one day 

protocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that 

in of itself isn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're telling us that

some do this and some do that and the question is why 

wouldn't following one protocol rather than another 

protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?

 MS. GARTNER: Because some doctors use a two 

day protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to 

get an intact D&E. There is not a direct correlation, 

there's some correlation between the amount of dilation 

and the percentage of times that a physician achieves 

intact D&E. To some extent doctors also use other 

agents to dilate, they use misoprostol and medication. 

That even if they're doing a one day protocol --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have any indication 

in your case about the effective safety of any other 

aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change 

their, their method of operation and go to a one-day 

protocol?

 MS. SMITH: In terms, one-day protocol?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MS. GARTNER: Some doctors -- I think one 

thing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when 

they do them in a way that they are most accustomed do. 

They are doing them the way they were trained to do 

them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to cut your 

answer but I want to know whether there is anything

specifically in the record in your case that bears on my 

question.

 MS. GARTNER: There is nothing specific 

about doctors changing protocols. There is significant 

evidence about increased risks if doctors were to stop 

trying to extract the fetus as intact as possible. 

Several witnesses, including several government 

witnesses have agreed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you mean start and stop 

with a different intent?

 MS. GARTNER: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As opposed to adopting a 

completely different procedure entirely -- a different 

protocol entirely.

 MS. GARTNER: Well, no actually even the 

other government witness, Dr. Cook, agreed that -- and 

the other government witness, Dr. Lockwood, agreed that 

removing the fetus as intact as possible in any D&E is 

the safest way to perform a D&E procedure regardless of 

whether the intent was to do an intact D&E procedure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: For such a doctor, a doctor 

who thinks that I'm trying to remove in this emergency 

situation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as 

possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be 

thinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll

make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's 

most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it 

will come out and then the head of the fetus will 

dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out.

 Is that --

MS. GARTNER: I would say it certainly is 

not never and it's not always. It's somewhere in 

between but I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: So if a doctor is being 

honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor 

could escape the language of the statute on the 

government's interpretation?

 MS. GARTNER: I think not Your Honor because 

the intent is to extract the fetus as intact as 

possible. In a good many cases it will be extracted 

past the navel though not to the head. So the doctor 

falls within the deliberately and intentionally language 

and I don't think, the government also proffers the idea 

of specific intent, but again because this statute 

doesn't track the actual differences between the two 

procedures, the having the specific intent doesn't save 

the statute. The doctor may intend to perform the 

abortion as defined in this law but not intend to do an 

intact D&E and that was the testimony in these cases.

thing for me? You say it's always the doctor's intent 

to extract as much as possible before causing fetal 

demise. I thought there was significant number of cases 

in which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal 

demise before I start any extraction?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor there is 

testimony in our case, in the California case, that a 

few doctors that testified said the beginning at 

approximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women 

the option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before 

the procedure began. But the testimony was also 

overwhelming, including from the government witnesses, 

that that injection procedure carries significant risks 

for some women. For example, women with either 

susceptibility to infection, like women with HIV or 

hepatitis, you definitely don't want to do an additional 

injection. That in addition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: From the point of view of 

the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid 

criminal responsibility.

 MS. GARTNER: It -- but the problem is as 

the district court, found it's an unnecessary medical 

procedure that subjects the woman to additional risk. 

Now if the doctors --

doctors in that case propose that option to their 

patients?

 MS. GARTNER: At 22 weeks and later, as the 

abortion is getting closer to the viability line, the 

doctors feel that some women would feel more -- it's for 

psychological reasons for the woman. That's why it's an 

offer; it's not a requirement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what 

are the psychological reasons?

 MS. GARTNER: If she would prefer that the 

fetus undergo demise before the extraction begins, some 

women may feel better about that. The testimony was 

also that other women absolutely don't want that. And 

you know, feel that they -- you know, it's a very 

personal question that really goes to the heart of this 

case. It's a very personal decision how the woman who 

has made this very difficult moral/religious decision to 

end her pregnancy, often for very tragic reasons, how 

does she want the fetus to undergo demise? Different 

people will have different views about this. But here 

Congress has legislated that for the woman and done so 

pre-viability, when the state interests really are 

insufficient to require the woman to undergo a procedure 

that is not marginally safer but significantly safer for 

her.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well is there a 

difference between, in your view, in the 

constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly 

safer? In other words, I take it we don't, you 

obviously were here for the discussion in the prior 

case. We don't have evidence on marginal significant. 

And do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal 

difference in safety, does that, is that still enough to 

override Congress's interests in this case?

 MS. GARTNER: Yes, Your Honor, it does 

matter. Marginal safety would not be enough but I think 

what is important is that you assess, you assess the 

question of marginal versus significant by looking at 

the averted harms. It's not a question of quantifying 

how many women would avert the harms.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do we just 

look at the averted harms, or -- or do we, or Congress, 

also look at the incidence of the averted harms? Is it 

a theoretical -- is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to 

some extent a quantified inquiry?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I think it 

can't be a quantified, quantified inquiry. Ultimately 

this Court has never looked at the constitutional 

question of when an abortion statute interferes with a 

woman's health to an extent that it's unconstitutional,

in terms of how many women are affected. The question 

is, is how seriously would a woman be affected if she 

affected? And the evidence here is overwhelming.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't the answer to my 

question turn largely on the age of the fetus? Isn't it 

a vast difference between the kind of decision the 

mother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the 

one hand and 26 week fetus on the other?

 MS. GARTNER: Well, I'm not sure if that's.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: For example, one of the 

congressional interests described in the finding is 

avoiding fetal pain to the fetus. And I guess they 

don't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20 

weeks there is some risk of pain. And that seems to me, 

that could affect a calculus very dramatically for the 

woman making the decision.

 MS. GARTNER: For the woman, but I think the 

important point, Your Honor, is that this, that the 

intact D&E procedure, and the testimony was overwhelming 

to this effect, that -- in some cases this procedure 

averts catastrophic health consequences for the woman. 

It averts uterine perforation, it averts the spread of 

sepsis or infection; it averts the spread of --

potentially the spread of malignant cancer throughout 

the women's body.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if the woman 

can take into account the impact on the fetus at a 

certain point in time, and your option, as you said some 

physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure, 

why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can 

take into account?

 MS. GARTNER: Because what Congress has done 

here is take away from women the option of what may be 

the safest procedure for her. This Court has never 

recognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump 

the woman's interest in her health. If the woman and 

her doctor together agree that proceeding in this way is 

going to avert significant health risks to her, and the 

testimony here is overwhelming that there are situations 

where that occurs, this Court has never recognized a 

state interest that was sufficient to trump that woman's 

paramount interest in her health.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but we have -- we 

have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of 

substantial medical judgment. It can't be an 

idiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.

 MS. GARTNER: Absolutely, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So to that extent --

MS. GARTNER: And that's -- and I take that

here. Given the overwhelming testimony from doctors 

from the American College of Obstetricians and 

Gynecologists, and this Court's holding in Stenberg, 

where the record was less robust, that we have that 

substantial medical authority here. And given that 

substantial medical authority, doctors need to be able 

to use their appropriate medical judgment, in the words 

of Roe and Casey, to provide this procedure for their 

patients when in their judgment -- not in their 

unfettered discretion, but in their sound clinical 

experience and medical judgment it's going to be the 

safest for her and avert catastrophic health 

consequences.

 So this is -- again, it may be that the 

number of women is not large, but for the women who are 

affected the impact of this ban is undoubtedly 

significant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to 

misinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor 

General's remarks but he indicated in those case there 

could be an as applied challenge.

Kennedy, you answered that question as well as I could.

abortion for her health, and file a proceeding wait for

the court to grant relief, undoubtedly she would not get 

the relief she needed in time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the answer that the 

Solicitor gave -- General gave to that was, you could 

have a pre-enforcement proceeding. That you can back up 

the clock.

 MS. GARTNER: Right. I'm not sure that I 

actually understood his answers though, because I think 

that that's what we have here, in fact, is a 

pre-enforcement proceeding to, to determine that this 

law blanketly banned intact D&E abortions even when the 

doctor believes it's, it would have significant health 

benefits for the patient.

 So this is not, I want to go back to, 

because my light is on, Stenberg suggested that there 

was a line that could constitutionally be drawn between 

banned, between permissibly banned procedures and, and 

procedures that have constitutional protection. But the 

statute didn't draw the line and it didn't draw that 

line in two ways. This, this statute defiantly rejected 

this Court's view that because there is substantial 

medical authority for the proposition that intact D&E is 

sometimes safer, a health exception is absolutely needed 

here, and they also refused to draw the line at what 

this Court understood was the defining difference

between intact D&E and nonintact D&E.

 In the Solicitor General's reply brief they 

talk about the promise of Stenberg. Well, the promise 

of Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this 

case in both respects, both in terms of preserving the 

health of the woman and allowing her to use what a 

substantial medical authority thinks is the safest 

procedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the 

line at a limited ban on pre-viability abortions given 

that Casey recognized that women have a constitutional 

right to choose to end their pregnancy pre-viability.

 I was going to address briefly some of the 

concerns that the Solicitor General offered about some 

of the health risks of intact D&E and cervical 

incompetence. Just briefly. The, all of the government 

witnesses in this case agreed that the congressional 

findings completely overstate any risks of intact --

there is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude 

that intact D&E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm 

than standard D&E, and in fact the evidence is quite to 

the contrary. It averts catastrophic health 

consequences in some circumstances. There is no strong 

evidence that intact D&E has any impact on cervical 

incompetence.

the two cases in Dr. Jason's study, but both of those 

women who experienced cervical incompetence had, in 

future pregnancy, had had cervical incompetence in prior 

pregnancies, and that's a condition that tends to stay 

with the woman. So there is no reason to think that it 

was the intact D&E itself that caused cervical 

incompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of 

intact D&E.

 And finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen 

used intact D&E or attempted to use intact D&E in all 

cases, and the women who had D&Es, three of them 

suffered very serious medical consequences after having 

a D&E. The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried 

to do intact and he failed so, so there was really 

nothing to say about this law. But the fact is, if this 

law went into effect, no woman could have intact D&E. So 

even though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was 

able to do intact D&E, he would no longer be able to do 

that. So the incidence of those women having 

catastrophic health consequences, which in the Chasen 

study, three of the women having D&Es had catastrophic 

health consequences. Inevitably if this law is upheld, 

an intact D&E is not available as an option to doctors 

when in their judgment based on substantial medical 

authority, it's the best option for the woman.

Inevitably there will be more and more women having D&Es

situations where if intact D&E had been available, those 

catastrophic consequences could have been averted.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 A few final points. First of all, I don't 

think the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on 

whether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to 

the head. Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw 

a line. I think drawing the line at more than halfway 

out is a pretty good place to draw the line.

 Second, my learned co-counsel is certainly 

correct. This is a pre-enforcement challenge, in 

response to your question, Justice Kennedy. But the 

point is, this is a pre-enforcement spatial challenge, 

and if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to

go into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility 

of a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that 

focuses on particular medical conditions. That's not 

something, though, that one can reach in this record, 

because as the district court in this case found at 

147a, there is no specific condition here in which the 

D&X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise 

is medically necessary. Rather, the claims in this case 

are that it's always better. That's what some doctors 

say. It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority 

position, but it's not focussed on specific situations.

 The other thing it's not focused on, and 

this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer 

mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies. Another 

thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its 

opinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure, 

neither of them are particularly good in dealing with 

true medical emergencies where time is of the essence, 

because both these procedures require substantial 

advance time to do the dilation. And since the D&X 

procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an 

emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E 

procedure if you performed either one, because you'd 

need less time for the dilation in an emergency.

 The other thing I should point out is that,

of course, there is this question about what's a 

significant risk. And one thing about the lethal 

injection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin 

injection, is the other side concedes that the mother 

gets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that 

procedure. Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of 

course after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think 

anyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly 

inflicting significant risks on his patients after 17 

weeks by following that regimen in every case after 17 

weeks.

 And I think it's worth noting that the legal 

regime that respondents would construct is a legal 

regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have 

that shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's 

okay, but Congress can't make this judgment. But it's 

important to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise 

that takes place in utero is one thing. That is 

abortion as it has always been understood. But this 

procedure, the banned procedure is something different. 

This is not about fetal demise in utero. This is 

something that is far too close to infanticide for 

society to tolerate. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General 

Clement. The case is submitted.
