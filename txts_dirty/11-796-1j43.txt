3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument next this morning in case 11-796, 


Bowman v. Monsanto Company. 

6  Mr. Walters. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. WALTERS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Patent exhaustion provides that once a 

12 patented article is sold, it passes outside the 

13 protection of the Patent Act, and it is available to be 

14 used by the purchaser to practice the invention. 

Now, what's the invention here? The 

16 invention is a bit of DNA that, when inserted into a soy 

17 bean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow 

18 from that seed resistant to the active ingredient in 

19 Roundup. Now, the only way to practice that invention 

is to plant the seed and to grow more seeds. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the world 

22 would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed 

23 if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow 

24 more and have as many of those seeds as they want? 

MR. WALTERS: I agree no one would do that, 

3

1 and I don't think that is the situation here. I think 

2 we have, and we have explained how Respondents here can 

3 protect their invention through contracts. They don't 

4 have to sell it outright. They can sell it through an 

agency model, but the more I think important --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true, that's 

7 true in the case of any patented article, right? 

8  MR. WALTERS: Correct. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the patent system 

is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual 

11 protection is inadequate to encourage invention. 

12  MR. WALTERS: Well, part of the patent 

13 policy, as well, is to protect the purchaser, and that's 

14 been part of this Court's law for more than 150 years. 

Under Respondent's theory, any farmer who 

16 grows a soy bean seed is infringing the patent, but for 

17 the grace of Monsanto. And that's -- a lot of farmers 

18 in this country, when we have over 90 percent of the 

19 acreage that is Roundup Ready. So under Monsanto's 

theory, there is really no limit by the Exhaustion 

21 Doctrine? 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that 

23 last sentence. Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans 

24 is violating the patent? 

MR. WALTERS: Is infringing under license by

1 Monsanto. Let's take the first --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that their claim 

3 is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow 

4 additional seeds from his first crop. Right? Isn't 

that the only claim here? 

6  MR. WALTERS: The reach of Monsanto's theory 

7 is that once that seed is sold, even though title has 

8 passed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks 

9 associated with farming, that they can still control the 

ownership of that seed, control how that seed is used. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, not that seed. It's 

12 different seed. That seed is done. It's been planted 

13 in the ground and has grown other seed. It's the other 

14 seed we are talking about. It's not the very seed that 

was sold. Right? 

16  MR. WALTERS: That's correct, Your Honor, 

17 but if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated, 

18 rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away 

19 the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in 

commerce. You have essentially a servitude on these 

21 things that are exchanged, and every grain elevator who 

22 makes a sale is infringing. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you may be 

24 right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument, 

and I have great difficulties with characterizing it 

5

1 that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates. But 

2 Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a 

3 patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses 

4 the seed to replant. That's not as far as Monsanto 

goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize 

6 their argument and to make it sensible. 

7  MR. WALTERS: If you assume that there is 

8 exhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer --

9 let's take our particular case here. Mr. Bowman went to 

a grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator 

11 without restriction seeds to – and it was his purpose to 

12 plant them. Now, the only way that he can make use –-

13 if you assume in the first instance that there is 

14 exhaustion to the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from 

the grain elevator, you are taking away any ability for 

16 him to use that seed or use the invention. 

17  Let's take for example Claim 130, which is 

18 at the supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for 

19 selectively controlling weeds in a field. It has two 

elements; the first element is planting the crop seed 

21 and it's a particular crop seed with all the particular 

22 genetics that encode for resistance to Roundup, and then 

23 the next step is to apply to the crop and weeds in the 

24 field a sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide. 

Now, if you say that there is exhaustion in

1 the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain 

2 elevator, but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny, 

3 you are not allowing him to actually practice the 

4 invention to grow more seeds. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but you are allowing 

6 him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do. 

7 It has nothing to do with those seeds. 

8  There are three generations of seeds. Maybe 

9 three generations of seeds is enough. 

(Laughter.) 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: It is for this example. 

12 First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation 

13 they sold. They have children, which is the second 

14 generation. And those children have children, which is 

the third generation, okay? So bad joke. 

16  (Laughter.) 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: So we are talking here --

18 he can do what he wants with the first generation. 

19 Anything he wants. And moreover, when he buys them from 

Monsanto, he can make new seeds. He can make generation 

21 2 because they've licensed him to do it. 

22  Here, he buys generation 2. Now, he can do 

23 what he wants with those seeds. But I'll tell you, 

24 there is a problem because the coming about of the third 

generation is itself the infringement. So the second 

7

1 generation seeds have nothing to do with it. If he went 

2 into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and 

3 he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and 

4 behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would 

have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third 

6 generation, would he not? 

7  MR. WALTERS: No. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: No, he wouldn't have? You 

9 mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these 

seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and 

11 you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo 

12 and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented 

13 seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed? Why not? 

14  MR. WALTERS: Well, I guess I misunderstood 

your question. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: My question is the same 

17 with the grass as with the magic box. I am saying the 

18 problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement 

19 lies in the fact that he made generation three. It has 

nothing to do with generation 2. That has just a 

21 coincidence. But that is, in fact, the way he made 

22 these seeds. But he can sell, resell generation 2, he 

23 can do whatever he wants with it. 

24  If he sterilizes it and uses them in a 

circus, he can do it. The only thing he cannot do is he

1 cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use 

2 generation 2 seeds to rob a bank. 

3  You know, there are certain things that the 

4 law prohibits. What it prohibits here is making a copy 

of the patented invention. And that is what he did. So 

6 it's generation 3 that concerns us. And that's the end 

7 of it. 

8  Now, what is your response to that? 

9  MR. WALTERS: Justice Breyer, my response 

is, if you applied the law that way to side making over 

11 use, you are eliminating the Exhaustion Doctrine in the 

12 context of -- of patented seeds. You're saying that he 

13 can do --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why --

MR. WALTERS: -- anything but practice the 

16 invention. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- you said 

18 making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as 

19 the other side has pointed out. You can use the seed to 

make new seeds. So use and make aren't -- it's not 

21 either you use it or you make it. You can use it to 

22 make a new item. 

23  MR. WALTERS: Justice Ginsburg, that is the 

24 point of the invention here. If you look at claim 130 

again, for example, you are saying he can't practice

Official 

1 claim 130, which is certainly embodied in the seeds he 

2 purchased from the grain elevator. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose he -- he 

4 had never bought any Monsanto seeds. He just goes to 

the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds 

6 have the genetic composition. So -- and he planted that 

7 and he harvested it. Would he be infringing on 

8 Monsanto's patents? 

9  MR. WALTERS: No. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he never has to buy 

11 any seed, at all, from Monsanto. 

12  MR. WALTERS: Well, in practical matters it 

13 doesn't work that way because the seed that's available 

14 at a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed 

and farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the 

16 need to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every 

17 year by going to the grain elevator. 

18  Great evidence of that is the fact that my 

19 client, every year that he planted a second crop using 

the grain elevator seed, he bought high quality seed 

21 from Pioneer. Now, if this grain elevator -- grain 

22 elevator seed was so good, why didn't he use it for his 

23 first crop? 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm still not getting the 

answer. I'm going to try once more. Now, when you buy

1 generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do 

2 with it. You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to 

3 your family, make tofu turkeys. I mean, you know, there 

4 are a lot of things you can do with it, alright. 

But I'll give you two that you can't do. 

6 One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just 

7 bought and throw them in a child's face. You can't do 

8 that because there's a law that says you can't do it. 

9  Now, there's another law that says you 

cannot make copies of a patented invention. And that 

11 law you have violated when you use it to make generation 

12 3, just as you have violated the law against assault 

13 were you to use it to commit an assault. 

14  Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit 

is trying to get at. And so it really has nothing to do 

16 with the Exhaustion Doctrine. It has to do with some 

17 other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think 

18 should give you the right to use something that has as a 

19 basic purpose making a copy of itself. Maybe you 

should, but I don't see that. Where is that in the law? 

21  MR. WALTERS: Your Honor, that's an 

22 exception to the Exhaustion Doctrine for 

23 self-replicating inventions. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. WALTERS: The invention here is --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that there? Is that --

2 is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine? 

3  MR. WALTERS: It is not there. This -- this 

4 Court has -- has not created an exception to the 

Exhaustion Doctrine, and in fact it's explicitly said it 

6 won't do that and that's an act -- and that's an 

7 activity for Congress. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The 

9 Exhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you 

buy. It never permits you to make another item from 

11 that item you bought. So that's what I think 

12 Justice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed, 

13 you can plant it, but what you can't do is use its 

14 progeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny 

is a new item. 

16  MR. WALTERS: This is obviously a brand-new 

17 case where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of 

18 patent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating 

19 technologies. So what you have here is if you take the 

Federal Circuit's view, then you have no ability -- you 

21 have no exhaustion at all for someone to practice the 

22 invention. Sure, you can do all the things that you 

23 talked about, Mr. Breyer -- or Justice Breyer, but that 

24 has nothing to do with the -- or with the invention. 

So you're taking the Exhaustion Doctrine for

Official 

1 self-replicating inventions, you're modifying this 


2 Court's case law substantially, and that's something 


3 that ought to be done in Congress. In fact --


4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just said 


that -- that we haven't had a case involving 

6 self-replicating. I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was 

7 shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article 

8 that you could use and then you use it and it's used up. 

9 But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you 

have a new -- when you create a copy of the original. 

11  So it's -- it's not that we have law in 

12 place. We've been dealing with an item with the 

13 Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items, 

14 thousands of items, all growing from that original seed. 

MR. WALTERS: The Exhaustion Doctrine, the 

16 policy that underlies this Court's cases is 

17 fundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in 

18 that personal property over the patentee's rights in the 

19 monopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales. 

This Court has always chosen the purchaser's rights over 

21 the patentee's rights to increase sales. And we're just 

22 asking you to make the same choice here. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, except to the extent, 

24 as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that 

the purchase is going to use the article just to create

1 a new one of the exact same kind.  And it seems to me 

2 that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that 

3 says that the purchaser does not get to do that should 

4 have an exception for self-replicating technologies. 

MR. WALTERS: First, we disagree that the 

6 activity of basic farming could be considered making the 

7 invention. If you read the statute, it says making the 

8 invention, not just making a copy like it would be in 

9 the Copyright Act. We have the invention, which is a 

particular genetic sequence that was made, principally, 

11 by Monsanto's genetic engineers. And farmers, when they 

12 plant seeds, they don't exercise any control or dominion 

13 over -- over their crop. Otherwise, every year they'd 

14 have a bumper crop. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you mean they don't 

16 do any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients 

17 it needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from 

18 animals? They do no work --

19  MR. WALTERS: They absolutely --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in growing the seed? 

21  MR. WALTERS: They absolutely do work, but 

22 they don't have control over the creative process. They 

23 plant, they spray and they pray. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure if they don't 

do all of the things I said, it doesn't grow. So aren't

1 they involved in its creative -- in its creation? 

2  MR. WALTERS: They certainly aren't in 

3 control of it. You ask any farmer who's lived through a 

4 drought or through a terrible flood and they will say 

they're not the ones who are making these --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you only need 

7 one -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or 

8 two of them are going to grow and you still have the 

9 same case, right? 

MR. WALTERS: Absolutely. And -- and that's 

11 how broad this position is. It doesn't matter how you 

12 come into possession with these seeds. You are 

13 committing patent infringement if you -- any cell 

14 division is patent infringement. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but that's 

16 what I thought you were going to respond. I thought you 

17 were going to respond to me that my question then makes 

18 it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from 

19 Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto, 

they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes 

21 generation 2. And generation 2, on the basis of what I 

22 was asking you, is just as much a violation. 

23  But I think, though I'll find out from them, 

24 that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is 

just as much of a violation. That's why we, Monsanto, 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 give the buyer a license to do it. 

2  And so it all seems to work out. You don't 

3 need any exception. There's no exception from anything. 

4 When you create a new generation, you have made a 

patented item, which you cannot do without the approval 

6 of the patent owner. Therefore, Monsanto gives that 

7 approval when you buy generation 1. 

8  Now, it seems to me all to work out without 

9 any need for exception. And I'm putting to you my whole 

thought so that you can respond to it. 

11  MR. WALTERS: Thank you, Justice Breyer. 

12 What Monsanto wants to do in your scenario is they want 

13 the farmer to assume all the risks of farming. They 

14 want -- but they still want to control and act as owners 

of the property that is owned, no doubt, by that farmer. 

16 When that farmer grows the progeny seed, that they 

17 insure the risk that they're not going to have a crop in 

18 the first place. If they drive to the grain dealer to 

19 sell their harvest -- they get one paycheck a year, by 

the way -- they, if they get into a wreck, that's not 

21 Monsanto's problem; that's the farmer's problem. 

22  So what they're essentially asking for is 

23 for the farmers to bear all the risks of farming, yet 

24 they can sit back and control how that property is used. 

And that's fundamentally inconsistent with how this

Official 

1 Court has interpreted the Exhaustion Doctrine. The 


2 thing that's very important is this is not a license, 


3 this is an outright sale to the farmers of the first 


4 generation. 


And then they are -- they plant those seeds 

6 because they have, under the Exhaustion Doctrine, a 

7 right to use the invention, and then those progeny seeds 

8 are owned outright by every farmer, and they assume all 

9 risk of loss. So if -- if -- Monsanto wants to 

control --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they may -- they may 

12 they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are 

13 infringing. They may -- the seeds are owned by the 

14 farmer. But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's 

infringing on that patent. So I don't think that the 

16 ownership has anything to do with it. 

17  MR. WALTERS: It's the servitude on the 

18 title. And those things get sold to the grain 

19 elevators, and now every time the grain elevator makes a 

sale, it's technically infringing. And -- and that's 

21 something that our law has never allowed for centuries. 

22 And one of the main problems is that you have farmers, 

23 their main livelihood here is to sell the seeds that 

24 they grow. Now, if they don't have clear title and if 

they don't have the ability to sell the property that

1 they -- that they grow, then that impinges upon their 

2 ability to make a living. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have only one question 

4 so far, it's a farming question. With some crops if 

you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in 

6 longer. In -- what about soybeans? If the farmer has 

7 the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going 

8 to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human 

9 consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds. Does he 

leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time? 

11  MR. WALTERS: You know, most farmers are not 

12 growing soybeans for -- for seed. There are various 

13 types of --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would not? Okay. 

MR. WALTERS: -- various types of farmers 

16 who are -- who are growing foundation seed, for example, 

17 that is very close to the -- to the first generation 

18 seed that's engineered. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand this. I 

thought soybeans are seeds. 

21  MR. WALTERS: They are. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- if you're 

23 going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour, 

24 do you leave them in the ground any longer? 

MR. WALTERS: I don't know the answer to

1 that question. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Walters, could you go 

4 back to the Chief Justice's opening question because the 

Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would 

6 have to produce this kind of product if you were right. 

7 And you said, well, they can protect themselves by 

8 contract. 

9  Actually, it seems to me that that answer is 

peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because 

11 all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web 

12 of these contracts, and that seed because it can 

13 self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes 

14 all the contracts worthless. So again, we are back to 

the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no 

16 incentive to create a product like this one. 

17  MR. WALTERS: Taking our example here 

18 where -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's 

19 an undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized 

how different every single seed is, you don't know a 

21 Monsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow. You don't know 

22 the maturity rate. If I am a farmer, I need a 

23 particular maturity bean for my field because I don't 

24 want it to mature before it gets high enough for the 

combine to come around and cut it.

1  So you want to be able to have -- you have 

2 all these things dialed in, these different 

3 variabilities. So if you go to the grain elevator and 

4 you don't know what exactly it is that you want and you 

just get a mixture, that's not going to be real --

6 competitive at all to Monsanto's first generation seed. 

7  Now, the possibility of somebody selecting 

8 one and saying, ah, that's the exact one that I need for 

9 my field, I'm going to cultivate that and let it grow 

into enough seeds so I can plant my first crop, that 

11 would take a number of years to grow a 1,000-acre farm, 

12 and it's not -- and by that time, farmers -- the nature 

13 would have changed and evolved where you would want the 

14 latest in disease resistance by that point. 

So there are --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Please correct me if I am 

17 wrong. I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here. 

18 He went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds, 

19 and -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix, 

but he used them. 

21  MR. WALTERS: Well, he --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So he did exactly what you 

23 said is uneconomical. 

24  MR. WALTERS: No. Actually, he did 

something quite different. He didn't select a

1 particular variety. He selected for the particular 

2 trait, Roundup Ready, but there are probably more than a 

3 dozen different ways in which the seed can vary --

4 disease resistance, maturity rates. And if you are a 

farm --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, maybe I 

7 didn't read this right. I thought what he did was plant 

8 all the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup, 

9 so that all that was left was the Roundup resistance 

seeds, and then he used those. 

11  MR. WALTERS: That's correct. But if you 

12 look at a field that you plant with grain elevator 

13 seed, it's going to be all different color because 

14 they're going to be all different variety, they're all 

going to mature at a different rate. So that if -- when 

16 it comes harvest time, some of them are going to be too 

17 close to the ground so that your combine's going to 

18 miss --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the Monsanto 

seeds? 

21  MR. WALTERS: Including the Monsanto seeds.

3 This is a very poor choice -- choice of seed, but it 

4 only makes sense to plant in a risky situation, like 

when a farmer has been washed out from a flood, for 

6 example, and it's late in the --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I mean the 

8 very first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready --

9 Roundup Ready seeds and you plant those. Are you 

telling us you have the same problem with them growing 

11 at different rates and all that? 

12  MR. WALTERS: Yes. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that doesn't make 

14 the commodity seeds any different? 

MR. WALTERS: I'm sorry. I must have 

16 misunderstood your question. The commodity seeds, 

17 with -- the Roundup Ready commodity seeds will all grow 

18 at different rates and have different disease 

19 resistance, different maturity rates. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But not the original batch 

21 that he buys from Monsanto? 

22  MR. WALTERS: Correct. So --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: The original batch that he 

24 buys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to 

the chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that,

1 they all mature at the same rate. 

2  MR. WALTERS: Exactly. They're of a uniform 

3 variety. They are exactly what a farmer needs for 

4 their --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So all the Monsanto seeds 

6 are not -- are not fungible. 

7  MR. WALTERS: That's correct. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: There are some of them that 

9 mature early, some mature late. 

MR. WALTERS: It makes sense. I mean, they 

11 allow these seeds to be dumped into the common grain 

12 elevator. They don't put any restrictions on what the 

13 elevator does with it. There were no restrictions on my 

14 client when he purchased them from the grain elevator. 

So it's less of a problem for Monsanto for 

16 people going to the grain elevator to plant. 

17 Nevertheless, it's -- it's an outright sale, an 

18 exhaustion applies to that particular sale, and permits 

19 that farmer to use it. It's never going to be a threat 

to Monsanto's business -- people planting grain elevator 

21 seed. 

22  Now, to answer your question, Justice Kagan, 

23 about -- well, under our theory, if somebody does breach 

24 a contract with Monsanto, they don't have to do it under 

contract law, they can actually do it under an agency

1 model, like General Electric did in the 1920s. And then 

2 that's only fair because there, the agent growers are 

3 assuming -- well, Monsanto was assuming the risk that 

4 the farmers are. 

And there is some equitability there with 

6 the -- the risk sharing between the farmers and 

7 Monsanto. Now they want the farmers to take all the 

8 risks associated with farming, yet they want to control 

9 how they use those seeds all the way down the 

distribution chain.

14  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

16  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

17 may it please the Court: 

18  I'd like to start by talking about this 

19 Court's decision in J.E.M. because I think it largely 

resolves this case. J.E.M. was a patent case, and the 

21 issue there was whether or not you could get a utility 

22 patent on a plant. The argument was that you couldn't 

23 get a utility patent because the Plant Variety 

24 Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in 

that respect. 

24
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  This Court rejected that argument, and the 

2 reason it rejected that argument was because it found no 

3 conflict between the two statutes. The reason it found 

4 no conflict between the two statutes is because it said 

that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that 

6 reason, you get greater protections -- under the Patent 

7 Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the 

8 Patent Act than you do under the PVPA. 

9  And it said, most notably, there is no seed 

saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research 

11 exemption in the Patent Act. The consequence of 

12 Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not 

13 only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent 

14 Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much, 

much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion. 

16  Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the 

17 Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this 

18 case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has 

19 always been limited to the particular article that was 

sold, and we are talking about a different article here. 

21 And it's never extended to the making of a new article. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean, 

23 this -- the reason it's never is because this is an 

24 entirely different case. It's the reason it's here 

because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion 

25
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented 

2 articles. So I don't think it gets you very far to say 

3 that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that 

4 way either. We have never applied the Reinvention 

Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant 

6 seed. 

7  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: It's true that the Court 

8 hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the 

9 sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has 

talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the 

11 specific article that's sold and it has done that for a 

12 reason. The concept underlying exhaustion is that when 

13 the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets 

14 the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold. 

Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the 

16 commodity grain that we are talking about. It's not 

17 even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you 

18 mentioned the three different generations of seeds. 

19 There is actually quite a few more generations than 

those three. 

21  If the concept is the sale of a parent plant 

22 exhausts the patentholder's rights, not only with 

23 respect to that seed, but with respect to all the 

24 progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to 

the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as 

26
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 part of the transformation event. Every single Roundup 

2 Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one 

3 parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would 

4 eviscerate patent protections. There would be no 

incentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans 

6 or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a 

7 bit broader than that. 

8  In order to encourage investment, the Patent 

9 Act provides 20 years of exclusivity. This would be 

reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only 

11 sale. It would be near impossible to recoup your 

12 investments with that first sale and so the more likely 

13 consequence is that research dollars would be put 

14 elsewhere. 

The other --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a pretty horrible 

17 result, but let me give you another horrible result, and 

18 that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be 

19 able to do a second planting by simply getting the 

undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator 

21 because at least a few of those seeds will always be 

22 patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything 

23 from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use 

24 it for second plantings where the risks are so high that 

it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed. Now they can't do

1 that anymore because there's practically no grain 

2 elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in 

3 it. 

4  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: And the answer to that is 

this is actually not a traditional farming practice. 

6 Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally 

7 go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in 

8 the ground as seed. If you look at the American Soybean 

9 Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean 

farmers, it says as much. If you look at the CHS brief, 

11 which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also 

12 explains that. 

13  And there is a number of reasons why that is 

14 the case. They’re the reasons that Petitioner talked 

about, which is that they are an undifferentiated mix, 

16 but there are other reasons as well. The business of 

17 grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed. 

18 If that was their business they would have to comply with 

19 seed labeling laws. They do not do so because it's not 

their business model. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's why it's so cheap. 

22 And that's why farmers --

23  (Laughter.) 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's why farmers 

want to use it, for a cheap planting. 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: But farmers wouldn't be 

2 able to use it for another reason as well. Even if you 

3 take patent law and you put it entirely to the side, 

4 there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But correct me -- correct 

6 me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did. 

7  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Bowman did, absolutely 

8 did it in this circumstance. But Bowman also said that 

9 he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in 

this practice. 

11  And again, there is another reason. Putting 

12 aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety 

13 Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their 

14 amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of 

the commingled grain is not only protected by patent, 

16 but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection 

17 Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe 

18 the Plant Variety Protection Certificate. So even 

19 putting patent law to the side, this is not an 

economically viable source of seed for farmers, 

21 regardless. 

22  And Petitioner's argument again isn't 

23 limited to the grain elevators. It would apply to 

24 saving your own seed and planting it generation after 

generation.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, sure, I understand. 

2  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: It would apply to selling 

3 seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow 

4 seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon 

the first sale. 

6  Now to the extent --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when -- when are 

8 the patent rights exhausted in the seed? 

9  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The patent rights are 

exhausted in the seed at the same time they are 

11 exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an 

12 authorized sale. And so, Justice Breyer, again you had 

13 it right when you were saying that you can do what you 

14 want. In our view, once there is an authorized sale, 

you can do what you want with respect to the seed that 

16 you've actually purchased. That is the tangible article 

17 that you paid for. 

18  But you do need permission from the 

19 patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed. 

If -- to the extent, you know, any middle ground is 

21 warranted, with all due respect, we would point to 

22 Congress as the appropriate body. This Court said --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just so I can follow 

24 your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells 

the seed to the farmer. And you are saying if the 

30
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to anybody he 

2 wants, right? 

3  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: If Monsanto authorizes --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting aside 

all the contracts and stuff. 

6  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Right. So if Monsanto 

7 authorized that first sale and authorized the planting, 

8 they would also have to authorize the sale of the second 

9 generation seed because it's a new article. And that's 

exactly what happened here. 

11  If you look at the technology agreement --

12 and it's not just because it's a contract because I 

13 think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon 

14 the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed, 

authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it 

16 authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop 

17 or to use it for any purpose other than replanting. 

18  That is an authorized sale. So if you take 

19 that second generation seed -- "second generation" is a 

bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you 

21 follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect 

22 to that particular seed have been exhausted. But you 

23 cannot take that seed without separate authorization, 

24 plant it in the ground, and come up with the next 

generation of seed. That would be --

2 patent rights haven't been exhausted then. 

3  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: They have been exhausted 

4 with respect to the particular article sold. When the 

Court's talked about patent exhaustion, you are not 

6 exhausting the rights with respect to the patented 

7 invention. You're exhausting --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean it’s been 

9 exhausted with respect to the one bean? 

MS. ARBUS SHERRY: Yes, and that's always 

11 the case just as if I sell -- I mean, even if you think 

12 in the copyright --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's always the 

14 case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't 

involved the -- this situation where you are talking 

16 about a self-regenerating product. 

17  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: But I think there is 

18 other technology out there. I mean, even if you think 

19 of software, for example, there are plenty of other 

products where one reasonable use is to make more. I 

21 can purchase software; one reasonable use would be to 

22 make a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell 

23 on eBay. It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing 

24 one.

2  (Laughter.) 

3  MS. ARBUS SHERRY: The Court hasn't had that 

4 case exactly, but it did decide Microsoft v. AT&T, and 

granted that was on a slightly different issue, but in 

6 that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was 

7 copies from a master disk, and it treated them as 

8 separate copies because they were actually separate 

9 articles, even though it was really easy to do, even 

though the actual copying is not done by human hands, 

11 it's done by -- by mechanical processes. In fact, in 

12 that case the Court talked and compared the making of 

13 software to the reproduction through biological 

14 processes, which is what we are talking about here. 

And so all we are asking the Court to do 

16 today -- I recognize it's a new technology and to the 

17 extent new technologies require different rules, 

18 Congress is the body that should be making those 

19 different rules. And when Congress has acted in this 

area, in the Plant Variety Protection Act and also in 

21 the software context in the Copyright Act, it has not 

22 adopted the wholesale exemption that Petitioner is 

23 asking for here.

Official 

1 before launching into our doctrinal position. 

2  First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are 

3 soybeans. They are harvested at a particular point in 

4 time, whatever use is going to be made for them. It is 

not a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which 

6 has to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa. The bean is 

7 the seed. 

8  All soybeans have to be processed to be used 

9 in any way. If they are going to be planted, they have 

to be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the 

11 right time. If they are being fed to either humans or 

12 animals, they have to be processed in a way that 

13 eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by 

14 animals. 

Justice Scalia, your question about well, 

16 farmers now just can't do second plantings because 

17 soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different 

18 varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if 

19 one or more of those soybeans were protected by a 

patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented 

21 inventions without a license would be infringement, 

22 although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of 

23 it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that 

24 there was an act of infringement. 

But more to the point, farmers -- I mean,

Official 

1 the planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of 

2 interspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very 

3 common. There are hundreds of thousands of soybean 

4 farmers who do this every year. 

Mr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as 

6 he knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way. 

7 But there are plenty of other ways in which he could 

8 obtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a 

9 particular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow 

to the same height and germinate at the same time. And 

11 in fact, he explained this to the district court in his 

12 response to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a 

13 of the joint appendix. 

14  He said defendant wanted a cheap source of 

seed for his second crop beans because of the normal 

16 risks in growing "wheat beans;" that is, the second crop 

17 that follows the harvesting of winter wheat. 

18  Quote, "defendant simply wasn't going to 

19 plant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat 

crop." And here's the relevant sentence. "Defendant 

21 could have purchased conventional seed, that is, 

22 non-patented seed, and then saved its offspring for 

23 wheat beans." 

24  In other words, he could have gone and 

bought a non-patented -- a bag of non-patented seed for

1 much less money, and used it as his second crop, or 

2 harvested a portion of it -- and soybeans replicate at a 

3 rate between 20 and 80 times in each generation -- and 

4 have a perpetual source for his second crop thereafter. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he couldn't put the 

6 herbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought 

7 conventional seeds, not the genetically improved seeds 

8 --

9  MR. WAXMAN: Exactly. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- then -- then he 

11 wouldn't -- what would the yield be if he puts the 

12 herbicide on it and they are all killed? 

13  MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 

14 glyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a 

particular plant, it changes the way you have to control 

16 weeds. And he would not be able to use Monsanto's 

17 technology that would allow aerial application of an 

18 herbicide. He would have to -- if he wanted to buy 

19 plain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to 

control for weeds in the conventional way. 

21  And here's the very next sentence in his 

22 response to the Court. "Defendant" -- that is, instead 

23 of purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he 

24 says "Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's 

commodity grain because he felt there was a good chance

4  Mr. Chief Justice, your question about this 

is a new case and -- let me go first to your first 

6 question in the case, which is why would a company ever 

7 want to do this? I think the answer is that without the 

8 ability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it 

9 to other kinds of readily replicable technologies --

without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans 

11 containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have 

12 commercialized its invention, and never would have 

13 produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural 

14 technology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was 

pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready 

16 soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup 

17 Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have, 

18 under Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only 

19 Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all 

progeny unto the -- however many generations 

21 Justice Breyer thinks is "not too many." 

22  I think it's important to understand how 

23 this technology works. The Department of Agriculture 

24 licensed Monsanto to engage in a transformation event; 

that is, to introduce its recombinant gene into soybean

1 germ plasm. It's illegal to do it unless you get a 

2 government license to do it. And you can do it once. 

3 And that is done by the technology company, use --

4 taking something that's called a gene gun and using the 

gene gun to inject recombinant DNA into regular germ 

6 plasm. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean you can do 

8 it once? I don't know what you --

9  MR. WAXMAN: The -- the Department of 

Agriculture authorized Monsanto to engage in -- to 

11 transform natural -- natural plant material with its 

12 recombinant gene in one single event that is referred to 

13 as a transformation. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: One shot of a gun. 

MR. WAXMAN: I think you may be able to 

16 shoot several -- I don't know whether you can shoot a 

17 whole round or whatever. But in any event, it's one 

18 event. 

19  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't rob a bank with 

21 it, though, right?

1 But the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site 

2 for the transformation event with respect to Roundup 

3 Ready is -- is provided in a footnote in our brief. 

4 What happens then is that Monsanto uses those 

transformed cells to grow a soybean plant. 

6  And that soybean plant produces genetic --

7 produces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant 

8 Roundup Ready technology in it. Monsanto then provides 

9 -- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in 

licensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of 

11 different seed companies that produce different 

12 varieties, and they make both conventional seed with a 

13 particular varietal makeup and a Roundup Ready version 

14 of that variety. 

Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has 

16 transformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of 

17 seed companies for consideration. Under Mr. Bowman's 

18 theory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with 

19 respect to this technology. The very first time it took 

an original transformed seed and sold it to a seed 

21 company so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and 

22 produce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of 

23 its patent rights.

4  Now, we --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, there is a 

6 worrisome thing on the other side, though, too. And 

7 that is that your position has the -- has the capacity 

8 to make infringers out of everybody. And that is 

9 highlighted actually in this case by how successful this 

product is and how large a percentage of the market it 

11 has had. 

12  So that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto 

13 a farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have 

14 Roundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is 

infringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a 

16 science project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes 

17 to the supermarket and gets some edamame, and it turns 

18 out that it's Roundup seeds. 

19  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And, you know, these Roundup 

21 seeds are everywhere, it seems to me. There's, what, 

22 90 percent of all the seeds that are around? So it 

23 seems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an 

24 infringer at this point, aren't they? 

MR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. Let me make --

1 let me make three points, starting with the edamame and 

2 moving up to inadvertent infringers. 

3  Edamame is an immature form of the soybean 

4 seed. You can plant edamame --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. I'll change the 

6 hypothetical. 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. WAXMAN: If I take my -- you know, my 

9 Girl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment, 

it will rot, but it will not generate. And that --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: And I thought I was being so 

12 clever, too. 

13  (Laughter.) 

14  MR. WAXMAN: Well, it also reminds me that 

my original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is 

16 that edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the 

17 thing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in 

18 any other way. 

19  Your point about the ubiquity of Roundup 

Ready -- Roundup Ready's use is a fair one. I mean, 

21 this is probably the most rapidly adopted technological 

22 advance in history. The very first Roundup Ready 

23 soybean seed was only made in 1996. And it now is grown 

24 by more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in 

the United States.

1  But size -- that is, success -- has never 

2 been thought and can't be thought to affect the contour 

3 of patent rights. You may very -- with soybeans, the 

4 problem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans. 

Soybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy 

6 to blow a soybean into some other farmer's field. And 

7 soybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect 

8 flowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the 

9 stamen, so that they -- which is the reason that they 

breed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn. 

11  The point that there may be many farmers 

12 with respect to other crops, like alfalfa, that may have 

13 some inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields 

14 may be true, although it's -- it is not well documented. 

There would be inadvertent infringement if the farmer 

16 was cultivating a patented crop, but there would be no 

17 enforcement of that. 

18  The farmer wouldn't know, Monsanto wouldn't 

19 know, and in any event, the damages would be zero 

because you would ask what the reasonable royalty would 

21 be, and if the farmer doesn't want Roundup Ready 

22 technology and isn't using Roundup Ready technology to 

23 save costs and increase productivity, the -- the royalty 

24 value would be zero.

1 an interesting question because you can imagine -- you 

2 see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with 

3 all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with 

4 hosts of things which are self-replicating. 

MR. WAXMAN: Mm-hmm. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And some of the 

7 self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end 

8 up inadvertently all over the place. Is there anything 

9 in the patent law that deals with that? Is an 

involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law 

11 as a voluntary infringer? 

12  MR. WAXMAN: Well --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there precautions 

14 that you take? I mean, is there anything in patent law 

that helps? 

16  MR. WAXMAN: So infringement is -- unlike 

17 contributory infringement or induced infringement, the 

18 act of infringement, that is a violation of Section 

19 271 --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. 

21  MR. WAXMAN: -- is a strict liability tort, 

22 but it requires affirmative volitional contact --

23 conduct. That is, it's not that -- a thing doesn't 

24 infringe; a person infringes.

4 imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a --

where Justice Kagan's question could apply. 

6  MR. WAXMAN: I mean, take the --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: But you're just saying that 

8 would need a --

9  MR. WAXMAN: Sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- modification in patent 

11 law. 

12  MR. WAXMAN: Of course. I mean, take the 

13 example, and this goes to I think the comment made by 

14 the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we 

haven't had this case yet. You did have this case in --

16 in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know, 

17 Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating 

18 System on it, which is patented, and was being exported 

19 overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that 

were manufactured overseas. And AT&T's patent, which 

21 was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the 

22 Windows software. 

23  And this Court held that, although the 

24 writing of the Windows Operating System into computers 

in the United States would have infringed the patent, 

45
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's 

2 patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard 

3 drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of 

4 infringement occurred overseas and there was not an 

export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes 

6 of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f). 

7  So I think you have decided in the context 

8 of software, which of course replicates even more 

9 readily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or 

plasmids, that the copies that are actually made when 

11 a -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a 

12 computer is a different thing than the disk that was 

13 sent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United 

14 States. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about 

16 the other question --

17  MR. WAXMAN: So the other one --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I want to go 

19 back to a different question that was asked, which was 

the question what do you think we should do about this 

21 other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect? I mean, 

22 I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's 

23 license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's 

24 relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is 

just permissive.

1  It is to create generation 2. But -- but 

2 they also said something in the circuit about a 

3 license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on --

4 on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for 

creating generation 3, namely you can't do that. 

6  Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that 

7 there's some restriction in a license and they have a 

8 doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict 

9 licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after 

it's been sold. And that would seem contrary to the 

11 First Sale Doctrine. 

12  MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Let me -- let me answer 

13 your question this way: First of all, we don't think 

14 that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we 

agree with the government that there's no need for the 

16 Court to address the question of conditional sales and 

17 the extent to which patent law recognizes under some 

18 circumstances conditional sales because in this case the 

19 Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we 

advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and 

21 I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix. 

22  "Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the 

23 commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would 

24 be of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman 

plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup

1 Ready technology and the next generation of seed 


2 develops, the grower has created a newly infringing 


3 article." 


4  In other words, what the Federal Circuit 


decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be 

6 affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think 

7 generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake, 

8 since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by 

9 Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags 

of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed 

11 dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to 

12 produce generation N plus 1. But then, what about N 

13 plus 2? 

14  So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2 

has never been sold. It was created, it exists without 

16 a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent 

17 exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale, 

18 there is no exhaustion. 

19  Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in 

any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only 

21 privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as 

22 Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never 

23 privileges the making of a new infringing product. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you prevail 

in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?

Official 

1  MR. WAXMAN: If you're referring to 

2 generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those 

3 are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of 

4 Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no 

authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without 

6 Monsanto's authorization. That is a -- just a 

7 straightforward application of Section 271. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I want to go 

9 back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as 

a different question, with I think the same answer --

11  MR. WAXMAN: Okay. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but I just want to 

13 make sure you and the government are exactly on the same 

14 page. 

Both of you are suggesting, I think -- that 

16 was Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit 

17 enough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever 

18 lingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with 

19 respect to conditional sales at all in this case?

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're telling 

22 us we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.

2 need --


3  MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think --


4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- generally in -- in 


clarifying some lingering confusion? 

6  MR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I think that an 

7 appropriate case will come up where it will be important 

8 for you to determine that. And our third argument, 

9 which wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't 

necessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not 

11 ipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant --

12 everybody understands that if instead of selling 

13 technology, you lease it, and you sign a license that 

14 imposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they 

are unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related 

16 to exploitation of the invention are enforceable. Mr. 

17 Bowman acknowledges that. Everyone acknowledges that. 

18  Our single submission here is that where you 

19 have a technology that cannot be leased because it will 

consume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and 

21 therefore has to be -- an article embodying the 

22 invention has to be sold and where the invention cannot 

23 be commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to 

24 realize its full costs of development and a reasonable 

rate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is

1 this necessary sale in order to commercialize the 

2 invention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions 

3 unenforceable. And that's all -- if you were to reach 

4 the conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we 

think this case stands for. And the reason I think --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually then you do 

7 have a different position than the government does. 

8  MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and I think the reason, if 

9 we take it out of the soybean area, let's look at 

vaccines. Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially 

11 immunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same 

12 way that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals 

13 that receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a 

14 herbicide -- a life threat. 

Okay. Vaccines are live. They have live 

16 cultures; they can regenerate themselves. If a company 

17 develops the vaccine for, you know, H1 -- I shouldn't be 

18 using -- an important life-saving vaccine --

19  (Laughter.) 

MR. WAXMAN: -- it's unsupportable to say 

21 that you cannot sell a quantity of that vaccine without 

22 exhausting all of your rights in it. 

23  I mean, when -- when Schering-Plough or 

24 Bristol-Myers develops a vaccine and sells some of it to 

CVS so I can go in and get injected, they haven't lost

1 all of their patent rights in that vaccine. CVS can't 

2 turn around and become a competitor. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Simplifying this case, 

4 you can't take the person who's been given the vaccine 

and take vials of their blood and keep selling it? Is 

6 that your --

7  MR. WAXMAN: Yes, and keep -- well, keep 

8 replicating it in competition. Take another example --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that how it 

works? 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean I'm 

13 serious. I mean, your example, it seems to me, is not 

14 quite on point because it's not a situation where the 

intended use of the vaccine necessarily results in 

16 regeneration of it. In your hypothetical, CVS was going 

17 to some lab and making more, right? 

18  MR. WAXMAN: Well, CVS was presumably buying 

19 it either from the manufacturer or another lab. But the 

point here is that to take the software example, if I go 

21 to, you know, Staples and buy the Windows operating 

22 system on a disk, I don't have the authority to put it 

23 in a disk replicator and press a button and make a 

24 million copies of it. And --

4  MR. WAXMAN: Yeah. Well, let me -- the 

example that comes to mind is, of course, poor 

6 Dr. Chakrabarty who, you know, invented a new man-made 

7 bacteria. Bacteria replicate themselves, unlike 

8 soybeans which require human intervention. I mean, the 

9 notion --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word 

11 "use."

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word "use" 

14 and you get to the same place. 

MR. WAXMAN: I mean, my submission about --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think you can think 

17 of an example. I mean, you say -- I don't think you can 

18 think of an example where if you win on the other 

19 ground, you can produce a bad result for the 

manufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated 

21 the conditional sale like a license. I'm not saying you 

22 can't, I just can't think of one. 

23  MR. WAXMAN: Okay. Here's one. I will use 

24 something that doesn't make itself because we think that 

is covered by the new article. Let's say that I invent

4 to commercialize it, but I want people to be able to 

study it and research it. And so, like Monsanto with 

6 its seeds, I sign -- I provide a copy of the machine to 

7 MIT, with a research-only license; that is, you can use 

8 this machine to figure out how it works and develop new 

9 applications and all that sort of stuff. 

If that sale is exhausting for all purposes, 

11 I can't prevent MIT or a third party that MIT provides 

12 the machine for --

22 that goes back to Justice Scalia's example. What about 

23 the commodity bin that has 2 percent of the patented

1 days. But let's have some different commodity where 

2 there are three or four different patented items, but 1 

3 percent, 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin. You 

4 can't -- you can't sell those. That seems to me a very 

extreme result. 

6  MR. WAXMAN: Well, I mean, when you say you 

7 can't sell them. So, as Ms. Sherry was pointing out --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can't sell them if 

9 they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you 

can't use them for seeds even though there is only 

11 1 percent of the seeds? 

12  MR. WAXMAN: That would be true even if this 

13 case came out another way, Justice Kennedy. First of 

14 all, because grain elevators are prohibited by State and 

Federal law from selling seed, period. They sell --

16 they buy grain and they sell grain. They can't sell 

17 seed. 

18  Number 2, almost all varieties of soybeans 

19 or other crop plants are currently protected by the --

under the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act. 

21 As this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites 

22 for getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a 

23 registration requirement. 

24  And we know from J.E.M., and the relevant 

provision of the PVPA, that it is unlawful to divert 

55

1 crops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for 

2 reproductive uses. So irrespective of all of this, 

3 whatever happens, even if there is only 1 percent of 

4 patented soybeans in a grain elevator, the grain 

elevator can't sell it as seed both under the Federal 

6 and State seed laws and under the Patent Variety 

7 Protection Act. 

8  That's why the solution for farmers like 

9 Monsanto -- like Mr. Bowman, is to simply buy 

conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40, 

11 50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of 

12 it to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to 

13 buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use 

14 the glyphosate aerially.

places, he discusses how he's gone to the grain elevator 

6 over the years a number of times, and how other farmers 

7 have gone to the grain elevator for generations. So a 

8 ruling in favor of Monsanto here would effectively 

9 eliminate that seed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that it's 

11 unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting? 

12  MR. WALTERS: No. I do not. And what he is 

13 referring to is State labeling laws that prevent grain 

14 elevators from actually scooping up grain, packaging it 

up and saying this is seed, because they all look alike 

16 to -- to the eye. And so grain elevators are certainly 

17 not allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are 

18 there to protect the seed purchasers. 

19  Mr. Bowman bought grain without any 

restrictions on how he could use it. That broke no 

21 laws, and it does not violate the PVPA. I mean, 

22 Monsanto didn't assert a PVPA certificate. Surely it 

23 has them. Did not assert them in this case and could 

24 not assert them in this case because there's no single 

variety that Mr. Bowman planted. So that's not a good

1 argument. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about 

3 Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this 

4 in Microsoft v. AT&T? 

MR. WALTERS: That case is not on point, 

6 Your Honor. That had to do with 271(f), and actually 

7 came out on the side of more restrictive patent rights. 

8 And this is not like software. This is an invention 

9 that the only way to use the invention -- now, repeat, 

the only way to use the invention -- is to plant it and 

11 to grow more seeds. 

12  So if you don't apply the Exhaustion 

13 Doctrine and allow someone to use it, you're choosing 

14 patent rights over personal property rights, and that's 

never been done in 150 years of this Court's exhaustion 

16 case law. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Don't people or animals eat 

18 them? 

19  MR. WALTERS: That is certainly a use, but 

it's not the invention. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why is it the 

22 only way you can do is to plant them? That isn't the 

23 only thing you could do with it. 

24  MR. WALTERS: Well, that's not use of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can go buy them in the

1 grain elevator and sell them for other things. 


2  MR. WALTERS: It's not use of the 


3 invention, Justice Breyer. And exhaustion is about 


4 conferring on the purchaser a right to use the 


invention. There's no limit to Monsanto's --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: The invented product. The 

7 invented thing. The invented aspect of the seed is it 

8 has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or 

9 something that they have. I understand that. 

MR. WALTERS: The same argument came up in 

11 Quanta, Your Honor, with --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: You don't use that. I 

13 don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead. 

14 You go ahead. 

MR. WALTERS: There were other uses for the 

16 computer chips, of course, that were asserted. And the 

17 key was that those computer chips practiced the patent. 

18 And you would swallow up the Exhaustion Doctrine 

19 entirely if we just could think of other uses for these 

things that have been sold. 

21  The key is, does it use -- is the purchaser 

22 allowed to use the invention? And under Monsanto's 

23 theory, the purchaser isn't allowed to do that. And 

24 that's no Exhaustion Doctrine at all --

1 grain elevators are mostly people who take these 

2 chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell 

3 them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or 

4 this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there? 

MR. WALTERS: But the only use of the 

6 invention is to plant it, and that's the use that 

7 Mr. Bowman makes. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but that's --

9 nothing prevents him from planting it. What he is 

prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of 

11 that planting, the second generation seeds, for another 

12 planting. That's all he is prevented from doing. He 

13 can plant and harvest and eat or sell. He just can't 

14 plant, harvest, and then replant. 

MR. WALTERS: So -- the judgment in this 

16 case was based on acres planted, and so I'm not sure how 

17 many -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation, 

18 and we don't know in the record what the N plus 2 

19 generation was, in terms of his sales or his yields. 

That wasn't before the district court on summary 

21 judgment. So I'm not sure how you could affirm based on 

22 the judgment below, which was a finding that conditional 

23 sales prevented the application of the Exhaustion 

24 Doctrine.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't 

2 follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question. 

3  MR. WALTERS: Could you ask it again? 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, you're saying 

that you are preventing him from using it. He's not 

6 prevented from using it. He can use it for what it's 

7 meant for, for raising a crop. He just cannot use the 

8 product -- that new crop -- for replanting. That's all. 

9 He has to sell that new crop for feed or for some other 

purpose. But to say that -- that he's prevented from 

11 using what he has bought is simply not true. He can use 

12 it, plant it, and harvest the crop. 

13  MR. WALTERS: But you're saying that there's 

14 no exhaustion in the progeny where he owns that seed 

outright. 

16  With that, we'll submit, and we'll ask that 

17 the Court of Appeals be reversed. 

18  Thank you. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
