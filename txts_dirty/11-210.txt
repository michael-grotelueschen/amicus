3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-210, United States v. 

Alvarez.
 

6  General Verrilli.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and
 

may it please the Court: 

11  Military honors play a vital role in 

12 inculcating and sustaining the core values of our 

13 nation's armed forces. The military applies exacting 

14 criteria in awarding honors, and Congress has a long 

tradition of legislating to protect the integrity of the 

16 honors system. 

17  The Stolen Valor Act continues that 

18 tradition by prohibiting knowingly false statements that 

19 one has been awarded a military honor. It regulates a 

carefully limited and narrowly drawn category of 

21 calculated factual falsehoods. It advances a legitimate 

22 substantial, and, indeed, compelling governmental 

23 interest, and it chills no protected speech. 

24  This Court has recognized -­

1 hypothetical? During the Vietnam War, a protester holds 

2 up a sign that says I won a Purple Heart -- for killing 

3 babies. 

4  Knowing statement. He didn't win the Purple 

Heart. As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and 

6 is a combat veteran who opposes the war or whether he's 

7 a citizen protesting the war. 

8  Is that person -- if he's not a veteran 

9 having received a medal, is he liable under this Act?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think, Your Honor, it 

11 would depend on whether that was -- that expression was 

12 reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of 

13 fact or as an exercise in political theater. If it's 

14 the latter, it's not within the scope of the statute -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Somewhat dangerous, 

16 isn't it -­

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and it wouldn't be 

18 subject to liability. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to subject speech to 

the absolute rule of no protection? Which is what 

21 you're advocating, I understand. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, Your Honor -­

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That there are no 

24 circumstances in which this speech has value. I -- I 

believe that's your bottom line.

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, what -- what I 

2 would say with respect to that, Your Honor, is that this 

3 Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, 

4 that the calculated factual falsehood has no First 

Amendment value for its own sake. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's not -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure 

8 that that's quite correct. It has said it often but 

9 always in context where it is well understood that 

speech can injure. Defamation, Gertz -- page 12 of your 

11 brief, you make this point, and it's what Justice 

12 Sotomayor is indicating. You think there's no value to 

13 falsity. 

14  But I -- I simply can't find that in our 

cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to 

16 say that there's no value to falsity. Falsity is a way 

17 in which we contrast what is false and what is true. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I want to be -­

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -­

GENERAL VERRILLI: I want to respond with 

21 precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what 

22 this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is 

23 to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz 

24 itself that contains this Court's statement that false 

statements of fact have no First Amendment value. That

1 doesn't automatically mean that a false statement of 

2 fact lacks First Amendment protection. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's in the context 

4 of a defamation case.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you want to take the 

7 Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation 

8 is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that 

9 the government can inveigh against what's false.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- no, I'm trying to 

11 say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy, 

12 that, with respect to factually false statements, the 

13 government has the authority, if it can meet the 

14 "breathing space" principles that this Court's cases 

have articulated, along with the recognition that 

16 factually false statements have no intrinsic First 

17 Amendment value. Those are substantial constraints, but 

18 they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in 

19 this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very 

narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated 

21 factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an 

22 individual has won a military honor, and that's 

23 information that is within you, and only punishes speech 

24 about yourself. So, it is speech that's uniquely within 

the knowledge of the individual speaker.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose, 

2 General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and 

3 Congress had said we don't like people saying that they 

4 were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never 

served for a single day in any armed force. So, they 

6 have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to 

7 the false claim that one has served in the armed forces. 

8  I don't see in your argument that there's 

9 something special about the decorations.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I do think the 

11 decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg. We -- we think 

12 that that kind of a statute would be a harder case and, 

13 under the Court's "breathing space" principles, closer 

14 to the line because the category is much broader, much 

harder to define, and it would depend on the interest. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it much harder to 

17 define? I don't -- why does the broadness have anything 

18 to do with the breathing space? I mean, I suppose your 

19 argument here is that there is harm; it's not just 

falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just 

21 as libel is. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's -- that's exactly 

23 our argument, Justice Scalia. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -- and in the

Justice Scalia, is that -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Their service is demeaned 

12 when everybody says I served in the armed forces. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: Congress -- under this 

14 Court's "breathing space" principles, Congress would 

need to articulate a substantial interest. We think 

16 that would likely qualify. We just think that's 

17 a harder case to make. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, where do you 

19 stop? I mean, there are many things that people know 

about themselves that are objectively verifiable where 

21 Congress would have an interest in protecting. High 

22 school diploma. It is a crime to state that you have a 

23 high school diploma if you know that you don't. That's 

24 something you can check pretty easily. And Congress can 

say: We want people to finish high school. It's a big

1 thing to have a high school diploma. So, we want to
 

2 make sure nobody goes around saying they do when they
 

3 don't.
 

4  What about that case?


 GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that that case, 

6 Your Honor, I think if it's an objectively verifiable 

7 fact -- it would seem more likely that a State 

8 legislature might enact a law like that. If it were an 

9 objectively verifiable fact and the State could 

articulate a substantial interest of the kind that Your 

11 Honor identified, States -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The substantial 

13 interest is the one that I've just said. 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: States -- States do have 

laws, some States do have laws respecting false claims 

16 to have received a diploma from a public university. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- that's for 

18 submitting résumés. That's -- when -- that's fraud. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: I do -- if I could get 

back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm, 

21 it is true that in Gertz you had the particularized 

22 harm, but this Court -- the common characteristic that 

23 allowed this Court to move from defamation to 

24 false-light privacy, to intentional infliction of 

emotional distress in the Falwell case, then to baseless

1 lawsuits, the sham exception in Noerr-Pennington, the 

2 sham exception under the National Labor Relations Act, 

3 the common characteristic was not an analogy to the 

4 particularized harm that existed in defamation contexts. 

The common characteristic that this Court's opinions 

6 identify is the calculated factual falsehood. 

7  It is true that the harm here is different. 

8 It's a -­

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They were -- they were in 

a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional 

11 infliction for emotional distress. Here it does seem to 

12 me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a 

13 trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and 

14 the armed forces have a particular interest, and we 

could carve out a narrow exception for that. I think 

16 we'd have to do that. 

17  But just to say that the cases you mentioned 

18 say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply 

19 cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition. 

They do in the particular context of a recognized tort 

21 like intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that is true. 

23 And this -- this is a case in which the -- one of the 

24 harms that justifies this statute is the 

misappropriation of the government-conferred honor and

1 esteem, and that is a real harm and a significant harm. 

2 And there is also the particularized harm of the erosion 

3 of the -- of the value of the military honors confirmed 

4 -- conferred by our government; and those are 

particularized harms that are real. And the kind of 

6 speech that this statute regulates are a genuine threat 

7 to those harms in a way that, looking backwards, looking 

8 and anchoring this argument in the tradition of this 

9 Court's precedents, this is a type of calculated factual 

falsehood that 

11 has -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Harms -- General, I 

13 spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases 

14 that you cited in your brief defining the various 

statutes that basically impose penalties for 

16 impersonation of some sort or another. And virtually in 

17 every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either 

18 an economic interest that was harmed by the 

19 impersonation, either by the face of the -- by the very 

face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a 

21 dilution of a trademark by taking on someone else's 

22 valuable property rights. 

23  And so, I went back reading our cases, and 

24 Justice Story many, many years ago said, look, 

falsehoods have no value as such, but the "breathing

1 space" concept is defined by those falsehoods which 

2 cause injury to rights that people possess, to pecuniary 

3 -- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the 

4 reputation of others. And almost every statute where 

we've approved a harm concept as being permissible for 

6 recovery has affected one of those three things. 

7  So, please tell me what's wrong with 

8 Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how 

9 does the definition of harm fit in that? What's the 

harm here that fits within that descriptor? 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think three 

12 points. First, if I could just make a general point in 

13 response to Your Honor's question. I think that one 

14 reality here is that, as I read this Court's cases, this 

Court has never held or even suggested in any context 

16 when the government wants to regulate a properly defined 

17 category of calculated factual falsehood, that it has to 

18 meet strict scrutiny. That would be a real break and a 

19 -- and a real change in the law that would subject -­

1 way. 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: And that's why I want to 

3 get to -- that's why -- but I think it's relevant, Your 

4 Honor, to the point about Justice Story in the following 

way: The -- the -- there are a series of statutes, 18 

6 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 962, the impersonating a Federal 

7 officer statute; 1001 being the false statement statute; 

8 perjury statutes. Those are designed to protect the 

9 integrity of the government processes. There isn't -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not really. They're 

11 intended to protect the right of the government to 

12 secure truthful information. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: Rights -­

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The government has a 

right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and 

16 force you to tell the truth. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Statute -­

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if you -- that's a 

19 right. That fits within Story's definition.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: But not a -- as -- as I 

21 read what Justice Story is talking about, he was talking 

22 about the rights of private citizens, and what I'm 

23 saying is there is an additional category of 

24 long-recognized, well-accepted government regulation of 

-- of factual -- calculated factual falsehood that

2 to the Stolen Valor Act, the -- Congress -- Congress is 

3 building the Stolen Valor Act on a statute that Congress 

4 enacted in 1923 which prohibited the -- the wearing of 

medals without justification to wear the medals. 

6  And, of course, one of the reasons Congress 

7 acted in 1923 to do that was out of concern that the 

8 misappropriation of the government conferral of esteem 

9 was going to cause substantial harm. That's been on the 

books for the better part -­

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Is your argument limited to 

statements that a person makes about himself or herself?

17 category that the statute regulates. That is -- and it 

18 seems to me in a situation in which the statute is 

19 limited to factually verifiable information, the person 

is speaking about himself or herself, and the category 

21 of what's prescribed is clear -­

22  JUSTICE ALITO: What's the principal reason

6 the First Amendment? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that would be a

talking about calculated factual falsehood, you'd have

8 what -- who knows whether your grandfather was telling 

9 the truth when he -- when he said he won the medal. And

under the Court's "breathing space" analysis you 

6 would -- you'd have to look long and hard and have 

7 significant concerns about that kind of a -- a statement 

8 because it's so bound up with matters of ideological 

9 controversy that -- that you'd want to exercise care, 

but that's really quite different from what we have 

11 here. 

12  This is a pinpoint accuracy, a specific 

13 verifiable factual claim about yourself, that you've won 

14 a medal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I -- I want to 

16 follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I'm not 

17 sure I understood. The Government's position is that 

18 there is no First Amendment value in a false 

19 representation of fact, by which I understand you to 

mean not parody or something like that, but a statement 

21 that's intended to be understood as true. There is no 

22 First Amendment value in that statement. It may be 

23 protected because of the "breathing space" argument, but 

24 in whatever context, in whatever guise, there's no 

protection in that false representation as such.

1  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, that is the 

2 position we've taken in this case, Your Honor, and the 

3 reason we've taken it is because we read the Court's 

4 precedents, Gertz and many others, Falwell v. Hustler, 

as saying precisely that. In fact, Falwell goes a step 

6 further and says false statements of fact are 

7 affirmatively harmful to First Amendment interests 

8 because they impede the -- the search for truth. 

9  That's -- so, our -- our position is based 

on the precise language of cases stretching back a half 

11 a century. Garrison said calculated falsehood is a 

12 category of speech that is no part of the expression of 

13 ideas or the search for truth, and then it 

14 cites Chaplinsky -­

18 falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race, 

19 and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political 

candidates? How would your analysis apply to those? 

21 Would they come out the other end as constitutional? 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think that those kinds 

23 of statutes are going to have a lot harder time getting 

24 through the Court's "breathing space" analysis because 

the context in which they arise is one that would create

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- just about your 

6 qualifications, about what you've done in your life, 

7 your -- you know, whether you have a Medal of Honor, 

8 whether you've been in military service, whether you've 

9 been to college. So, any demonstrable statement that a 

candidate, political candidate, makes about himself. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I think under the 

12 Court's "breathing space" analysis, because of the 

13 political candidate context, those statutes are going to 

14 pose a particular risk of chill that this statute does 

not pose because this is a statute about verifiable 

16 factual falsehoods. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't understand 

18 why it would be more chilling in the one case than in 

19 the other. They're the same kind of statement, and one 

knows the same sorts of things about oneself. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think the idea 

22 would be, in a situation like that one, the government's 

23 power and authority is being trained specifically on the 

24 political process and statements in the political 

process. And this is -- this is quite different. This

interest in maintaining the political sphere free of 

6 lies. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: But I -- what -- I guess 

8 the chilling effect seems to me, at least, to be 

9 materially different than in a situation like this one, 

where what we're talking about is a very specific 

11 pinpoint thing, one thing: Have you been awarded a 

12 military honor or not? And a statement that is about 

13 yourself only, not about somebody else, and that -- and 

14 is supported by a quite strong particularized interest 

in ensuring the integrity of the military honors system. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that even in the 

17 commercial context we allow a decent amount of lying, 

18 don't we? It's called "puffing."

18 the U.S. attorney or the deputy district attorney 

19 bringing a -- filing a prosecution of someone 2 weeks 

before the election saying, well, you lied about this or

8 it backwards. It presumes that the government is going 

9 to have a ministry of truth and then -- and allow 

breathing space around it. I just don't think that's 

11 our tradition. On the other hand, I have to acknowledge

1 claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was 

2 someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal 

3 to get money. 

4  What I'm trying to get to is what harm are 

we protecting here? I thought that the core of the 

6 First Amendment was to protect even against offensive 

7 speech. We have a legion of cases that said your 

8 emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough. 

9 If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear, 

and that's what I think the court below said, is you 

11 can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of 

12 the medal that he or she received because someone's 

13 claiming fraudulently that they got one. They don't 

14 think less of the medal. We're reacting to the fact 

that we're offended by the thought that someone's 

16 claiming an honor they didn't receive. 

17  So, outside of the emotional reaction, 

18 where's the harm? And I'm not minimizing it. I too 

19 take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but 

I take offense when someone I'm dating makes a claim

9 get to the top. That's not what the military honors 

system is -­

12 this because the medal has been debased. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's not -- well, 

14 that's not what the honors system is about. The honors 

system is about identifying the attributes, the essence, 

16 of what we want in our service men and women: Courage, 

17 sacrifice, love of country, willingness to put your life 

18 on the line for your comrades. And what the medals do 

19 is say to the -- to our military this is what we care 

about. It's what George Washington said in 1782, when 

21 he set up the honors system. It's designed to 

22 cherish -- it's designed to cherish a valorous ambition 

23 in soldiers and to encourage every species of military

government to say this is a really big deal and then to 

6 stand idly by when one charlatan after another makes a 

7 false claim to have won the medal does debase the value 

8 of the medal in the eyes of the soldiers. It does do

speech, as well as allow for private attorneys.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course, 

6 they do in countless areas, the state does, whether 

7 you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all 

8 sorts of things. You can't adopt that as a general 

9 principle and apply it without regard to the situation.

 MR. LIBBY: Well, that's right, Mr. Chief 

11 Justice, but in all of those examples, those are 

12 examples where we have harm attached to the falsehood. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, sometimes the harm is 

14 just the impairment of governmental purposes, such as 

section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false 

16 statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake. How do 

17 you justify that? Because the making of the false 

18 statement impairs a governmental investigation. And 

19 what is being urged here is that the making of this type 

of a false statement impairs the government's ability to 

21 honor valorous members of the armed forces. 

22  MR. LIBBY: Well, we believe there's -­

23 there's a difference there, Your Honor. With respect to

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Libby, you've
 

suggested to us that we should apply strict scrutiny to 

6 all of these cases. Now, almost nothing passes strict 

7 scrutiny. Why should 1001 pass strict scrutiny? I 

8 mean, it seems to me you're proposing a test that would 

9 invalidate all of the laws on the books regarding false 

statements. 

11  MR. LIBBY: Well, no, Your Honor. What 

12 we're suggesting is false statements -- false statements 

13 laws do have a history in this country. And the Court 

14 could recognize a historical category of -- of imminent 

harm or potential risk of imminent harm to government 

16 functions. And perjury certainly falls into that 

17 category. 1001 very well may fit into that category. 

18 Since the beginning of our nation, Congress has passed 

19 these various false statement laws.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And do we give some 

21 deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to 

22 governmental purposes, or do we make it up ourselves?

conduct rather than content. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure. 

22 You know, the Tinker case with the arm band; it's purely

6  MR. LIBBY: If -- if there's -- if Congress 

7 does not have a non-speech purpose for prohibiting the 

8 wearing of the medals, then if it's strictly an 

9 expressive purpose, then, yes, there would be a 

significant First Amendment problem. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, don't you think 

12 that's the case? There's no non-expressive purpose that 

13 I can think of. 

14  MR. LIBBY: Well -- and that very well may 

be. What I can say is in this case what we're dealing 

16 with is strictly a content-based regulation on speech. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: But you -- you acknowledge 

18 that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the 

19 regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain 

kinds of harms. And the problem I have with your 

21 argument is determining which harms you think count and 

22 which harms don't count. 

23  Would you go as far as was suggested earlier

 MR. LIBBY: I believe -- what we believe the 

6 right way of looking at this is you -- you determine 

7 whether or not there is imminent harm or a significant 

8 risk of imminent harm to an individual or to a 

9 government function that would result from the speech.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When you say "imminent," you 

11 mean -- what do you mean by that? 

12  MR. LIBBY: I guess I'm suggesting the 

13 Brandenburg standard, which is -- if -­

standard, then most of the prosecutions for making false 

16 statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not 

17 going to survive, are they? 

18  MR. LIBBY: Well, but the issue is what 

19 about the law. And the issue with 1001 and those false 

statement statutes is it's the substantial risk of 

21 imminent harm to the government that could result from 

22 the falsehood. 

23  So -- well, certainly, it may not result in

8 there's certainly a significant risk of harm that the

that's why we believe that's -- that's where you draw 

11 the line. And that's where this Court appears to have 

12 drawn the line in those categories of speech that it has

19  So, if -- if that's so, is -- how is it that 

this statute will chill any truthful speech? What 

21 truthful speech will this statute chill? 

22  MR. LIBBY: Your Honor, it's not clear that

4 only win this case if this Court decides that the Gertz 

statement was a kind of overstatement, an exaggeration, 

6 puffery. 

7  MR. LIBBY: Well, we do -- well, we do have 

8 the situation where we believe the statute currently 

9 does cover -- someone could be prosecuted for engaging 

in parody or satire or exaggeration. Certainly, there's 

11 nothing on the face of the statute to suggest that

read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision. So, 

16 let's assume that we are not going to cover 

17 performances, satire. It's just a bald-faced lie. 

18 That's all that this covers. 

19  MR. LIBBY: Then it's still our position 

that it's still a -- that all speech is presumptively 

21 protected unless we go back and it fits into one of the 

22 historical categories of speech that this Court has 

23 found historically is unprotected. And bare falsity

4 totally unprotected. I understand them to argue -- I 

mean, is -- it's totally unprotected. I understand them 

6 to argue that it can be limited under its "breathing 

7 space" rationale. In other words, it's not within one 

8 of the categories of totally unprotected speech. You do 

9 have to analyze it under the First Amendment, and you 

analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech. 

11  MR. LIBBY: I suppose I read the 

12 Government's argument differently. As I read the 

13 Government's argument, it's that it's entitled to, at 

14 most, limited protection. So, the Government seems to 

start from the presumption that it's not fully protected 

16 speech; whereas, of course, what we should be starting 

17 with is the presumption that it is fully protected 

18 speech unless this Court has previously said it's in one 

19 of these historical categories of unprotected speech.

4 defamation, are those that cause harm.

 So, I go back to Justice Alito's question 

6 because you really haven't answered his question. 

7 You've dealt with the government process cases, although 

8 I -- we could argue about whether that's protecting a 

9 process or protecting a government right to truthful 

information. That's a different issue. 

11  But the question is how do you deal with the 

12 intentional infliction of emotional distress? Because 

13 damage -- we require injury, and it's defined under law 

14 what kind of injury. So, tell me how you define harm in 

the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell 

16 me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that 

17 definition. 

18  MR. LIBBY: Well, in the situation with 

19 intentional infliction of emotional distress, you are 

dealing with an instantaneous harm, a mental distress 

21 that results from the false statement. So, there -­

22 there's imminent harm as a result of -- that results in 

23 intentional infliction of emotional distress for 

24 false-light -­

2 winners, experience in seeing fake people or hearing 

3 fake people claim a medal -- why isn't that comparable? 

4  MR. LIBBY: Well, I don't believe that fits 

into the same category of -- of mental distress that we 

6 look at in intentional infliction of emotional distress. 

7  Certainly, people are entitled to be upset 

8 by these false claims. I mean, I'm personally upset by 

9 these false claims. But the fact that there is a 

certain level of upset doesn't mean that you were -­

11 you're harmed in the sense of the intentional infliction 

12 of emotional stress tort. And so, what we're dealing 

13 with here is simply a non-instantaneous harm. 

14  Now, what the Government has suggested is 

that there's no harm that really results from a single 

16 claim, that Mr. Alvarez's falsehood did not cause harm 

17 to any individual. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me what you're 

19 -- what you're arguing is that we should determine that 

there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the 

21 prohibition of a false statement and there are certain 

22 harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what 

23 judgment Congress made about the significance of those 

24 harms. Is that -- is that accurate?

 MR. LIBBY: That's certainly part of it. I

2 that it needs to be targeted harm to an individual or 

3 to -- to government function, that it can't be the type 

4 of diffuse harm that the Government -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 

6  MR. LIBBY: -- says took place here. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Because, after 

8 all, we're willing to protect the Olympics Committee 

9 when a false person saying he's the Olympics Committee 

might deprive the Olympics Committee of a penny, while 

11 here they're saying that to win this great medal, say, 

12 the congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award in 

13 the military the nation can give, you're deserving of 

14 the most possible, grandest possible respect, and we 

don't -- we don't even want you to have to think about 

16 somebody having taken that name falsely; and so, we will 

17 just criminalize it to discourage such activity that 

18 undermines the very thought and purpose of giving the 

19 medal. All right?

 So, I'm just saying in my mind there's real 

21 harm. And there's real harm, and yet, I can think of 

22 instances where we do want to protect false information. 

23 And I want you to accept that as a given because that

4 also would cause serious harm, what the government is 

aiming after, are there less restrictive ways of going 

6 about it? And, if so, what and why? 

7  MR. LIBBY: There are. First of all, more 

8 speech. There's time to fix the problem. If someone 

9 tells a lie about having received an honor, there's time 

for them to be exposed. And, in fact, that's 

11 what typically happens-­

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The government is going to 

13 hire people to follow, you know -- is that realistic? 

14  MR. LIBBY: Well, what -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is a 

16 sanction. You know, when there's a sanction in place, 

17 you think twice before you tell the lie. But if there's 

18 no sanction except you might be exposed, who's going to 

19 expose you? That sanction already exists, and there are 

a lot of people nonetheless who tell the lie. You 

21 really expect the government to hire investigators to go 

22 around the country outing people who falsely claim 

23 military honors?

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not going to happen. 

2  MR. LIBBY: Isn't that exactly what's 

3 happening right now with this law? Because the law is 

4 on the books, the government is sending FBI agents out 

to investigate these allegations. How do they find out 

6 about it? It's because it's reported. Individuals hear 

7 the statement, and they think it may be false. They 

8 investigate it. And -- and conduct their own 

9 investigations.

 So, that's what happens, and that's what's 

11 supposed -- that's the whole idea of more speech. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else -­

13 that the threat of criminal prosecution might discourage 

14 from lying who would never be caught. So, at least as 

to that set, exposure won't work. So, you have a less 

16 restrictive alternative that helps some but not 

17 completely. Are there others? 

18  MR. LIBBY: Well, of course if you're never 

19 caught, then under the Government's theory, then no one 

has been harmed individually or in the -­

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Not under my theory. My 

22 theory is that it does hurt the medal, the purpose, the

suggested that the military has been a little lax in 

11 identifying true heroes and awarding them medals. So, 

12 that could be done. 

13  The government could publicize the names of

3 sanction for telling something that you say is protected 

4 under the First Amendment, whether you get 6 months or a 

medal of shame doesn't matter under your theory. 

6  MR. LIBBY: Well, there is a significant 

7 difference between a criminal sanction that puts someone 

8 in prison versus simply exposing them for what they are, 

9 which is a liar. And Mr. Alvarez -- whether or not he 

in fact was sentenced to a crime, he still was exposed 

11 for who he was, which was a liar. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose the 

13 statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require 

14 an intent to obtain anything of value.

 MR. LIBBY: That would turn the law into a 

16 fraud statute. And, of course, fraud is an unprotected 

17 category of speech. So, that certainly would be a 

18 constitutional law.

a lot of people out there who don't know what it is.

13 that your willingness to say that this statute is valid

it's an awfully big concession.

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's just the basic
 

9 definition of fraud in the criminal law.


 MR. LIBBY: That's right. Now, could it -­

11 could it be a nonpecuniary thing of value? As it's 

12 currently proposed, yes. But that's -­

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if he -- so, if 

14 he makes this statement at a debate when he's running 

for office, then you can prosecute him because getting 

16 the office is presumably something of value. It 

17 presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it. 

18  MR. LIBBY: Perhaps, Your Honor. And, 

19 again, it may come down to how the courts ultimately 

interpret a thing of value. It's not clear that simply 

21 trying to obtain a vote from somebody is necessarily a 

22 thing of value, would be considered a thing of value.

falsely assume or exercise powers, duties, and
