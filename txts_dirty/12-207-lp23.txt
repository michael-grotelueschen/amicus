3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in Case 12-207, 

Maryland v. King. 

6  Ms. Winfree? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MS. WINFREE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Since 2009, when Maryland began to collect 

12 DNA samples from arrestees charged with violent crimes 

13 and burglary, there have been 225 matches, 75 

14 prosecutions, and 42 convictions, including that of 

Respondent King. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's really good. 

17 I'll bet you, if you conducted a lot of unreasonable 

18 searches and seizures, you'd get more convictions, too. 

19  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That proves absolutely 

21 nothing. 

22  MS. WINFREE: Well, I think, Justice Scalia, 

23 it does, in fact, point out the fact that -- that the 

24 statute is working, and, in the State's view, the Act is 

constitutional.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: So that's its purpose, to 

2 enable you to identify future criminals -- the 

3 perpetrators of future crimes? That's the purpose of 

4 it? I thought that that wasn't the purpose set forth in 

the -- in the statute. 


6  MS. WINFREE: No, not -- not just to 


7 identify people -- the purpose of the statute is to 


8 enable the State to identify perpetrators of serious 


9 crimes and -- and to use the information to make bail 


determinations for people who are validly in their 

11 custody. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm having a hard 

13 time understanding the bail argument because, in my 

14 time, most bail decisions were made at the time of 

arrest. And, here, the arrest was in April, and the 

16 results didn't come up until August. 

17  MS. WINFREE: That's true, 

18 Justice Sotomayor. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And, yet, he was 

detained anyway, correct? 

21  MS. WINFREE: He was detained anyway. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and there might 

23 be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be 

24 the rare case. 

MS. WINFREE: Well --

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- you don't use it 

2 routinely for the bail determination. 

3  MS. WINFREE: At this point, you're 

4 absolutely correct, Justice Sotomayor. We don't use it 

routinely for a couple of reasons. For one, as in 


6 Mr. King's case, there has been, in the past, a more 


7 substantial delay in getting those results back. 


8  Our -- our lab now is getting results 


9 between 11 and 17 days. Now, that, of course --


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that doesn't 

11 include the time to collect the sample, send it to you, 

12 or the time to do the match. It's just to do the genome 

13 rapid, correct? 

14  MS. WINFREE: No, that's for the whole â€“-

that's for the whole process, Justice Sotomayor. It's 

16 for getting the sample and getting it into the system, 

17 the DNA profile, and getting the match back. That's 

18 what we're being told. It's from 11 to 17 days. 

19  Now, of course, that wouldn't be timely for 

that first bail determination, but the State, under 

21 Maryland's procedure, certainly has the ability to go 

22 back to -- to the judge and ask that sentence -- or 

23 that -- I'm sorry -- that bail determination to be 

24 modified. And, in point of fact, though, we don't have 

any particular statistics in Maryland.

1  In California's amicus brief, which was 

2 joined by the 49 other States and D.C. and Puerto Rico, 

3 they actually do cite two particular examples where --

4 where two people, Castillo and Shamblin, were arrested. 

One was arrested on a credit card charge and 

6 another on a drug charge. Mr. Castillo was actually 

7 released on his -- on OR, and, when his sample was 

8 matched, it came back to a -- an unsolved rape and 

9 sodomy, and his OR was revoked. 

In Mr. Shamblin's case, he was granted 

11 diversion because his drug charge was a relatively 

12 low-level offense and, when the match came back, it --

13 it tied him to a rape and murder. His diversion was 

14 revoked, and he's currently pending charge -- pending 

trial on both of those charges. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your 

17 procedure limits the collection to certain violent 

18 offenses, right? 

19  MS. WINFREE: It does, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument 

21 would not be so limited, would it? Under your theory, 

22 there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure 

23 with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic 

24 violation? 

MS. WINFREE: Well, in Maryland, it's not

1 just the fact that we have those -- those violent crimes 

2 and burglaries. Actually, we don't collect DNA unless 

3 someone is physically taken into custody. 

4  Now, with respect to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand. 

6 But there's no reason you couldn't, right? I gather 

7 it's not that hard. Police officers who give 

8 Breathalyzer tests, they can also take a Q-tip or 

9 whatever and get a DNA sample, right? 

MS. WINFREE: Well, what I would say to that 

11 is that, with respect to a traffic stop, this Court 

12 said, in Berkemer, that a motorist has an expectation 

13 that a traffic stop is going to be relatively brief and 

14 temporary, that he or she will be given a citation and 

sent on their way. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how long does 

17 it take to -- to undergo the procedure? You know, you 

18 say, ah, and then -- you know. 

19  MS. WINFREE: It doesn't take long, but what 

I was suggesting is that, because of the nature of a 

21 traffic stop, this Court might well decide that a 

22 motorist has a reasonable expectation of privacy not 

23 to --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a Terry stop? 

A Terry stop?

1  MS. WINFREE: In a Terry -- well, this 

2 Court, I guess we would look at two -- one case in 

3 particular, this Court's case -- decision in Hayes 

4 v. Florida. That involved a defendant who was taken 

into custody, so his -- he was not arrested, but taken 

6 into custody for -- to get his fingerprints, and this 

7 Court held that that was not -- that was not 

8 constitutional. 

9  But the Court further said that there could 

be a circumstance in a Terry stop, if the officer had 

11 reasonable suspicion to believe that -- that the 

12 individual was --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But these -- these are 

14 all cases -- I mean, the dominant use is to solve what 

they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example. 

16 This case is another. A rape committed 6 years before, 

17 right? 

18  And there was no reasonable suspicion, there 

19 was no -- nothing, right? And the suspicion comes up 

only because the DNA sample comes back as a match. So 

21 is it the -- this is a very reliable tool, but it's not 

22 based on any kind of suspicion of the individual who's 

23 being subjected to it, right? 

24  MS. WINFREE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And, if I could go back to your question

1 about the Terry stop, the cornerstone of our -- and I do 

2 believe that this Court could -- could -- who knows how 

3 this Court would come out in that situation, but I 

4 think, in terms of our argument, the corner --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know. 

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MS. WINFREE: Well, happily, we don't have 

8 to decide that one today. But what -- what I -- the 

9 cornerstone of our argument is that when an individual 

is taken into custody, an individual is arrested on a 

11 probable cause -- a probable cause arrest, that person, 

12 by virtue of being in that class of individuals whose 

13 conduct has led the police to arrest him on -- based on 

14 probable cause, surrenders a substantial amount of 

liberty and privacy. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Winfree, that can't 

17 be quite right, can it? I mean, such a person -- assume 

18 you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't 

19 have the right to go search your house for evidence of 

unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct? 

21  MS. WINFREE: That's correct, Justice Kagan. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: It doesn't have the right to 

23 go search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes. 

24  MS. WINFREE: That's correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Just because you've been

1 arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy 

2 expectations and things you have that aren't related to 

3 the offense that you've been arrested for. 

4  MS. WINFREE: That's correct, but what we're 

seizing here is not evidence of crime. What it is, is 

6 information related to that person's DNA profile. Those 

7 26 numbers --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well -- and if there were a 

9 real identification purpose for this, then I understand 

that argument. But, if it's just to solve cold cases, 

11 which is the way you started, then it's just like 

12 searching your house, to see what's in your house that 

13 could help to solve a cold case. 

14  MS. WINFREE: Well, I would say there's a 

very real distinction between the police generally 

16 rummaging in your home to look for evidence that might 

17 relate to your personal papers and your thoughts. It's 

18 a very real difference there than swabbing the inside of 

19 an arrestee's cheek to determine what that person's 

CODIS DNA profile is. 

21  It's looking only at 26 numbers that tell us 

22 nothing more about that individual. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but, if that's what 

24 you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an 

arrestee. I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it

1 could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense. 

2 It could be just any old person in the street. 

3  Why don't we do this for everybody who comes 

4 in for a driver's license because it's very effective? 

MS. WINFREE: I think the difference there 

6 is these people are lawfully in custody, having been 

7 arrested based on probable cause, and that --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, now, I 

9 see two lines of cases, okay? The Fourth Amendment, 

which says you can't do a search without a warrant and 

11 probable cause, and Samson, and most of your brief 

12 argument was based on Samson. 

13  As I read Samson, it was the special 

14 relationship between the parolee or the probationary 

person, that line of cases, and the assumption being 

16 that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse 

17 of the State. So the State has a right to search their 

18 home, just as it would their cell, essentially. 

19  Why is that true for an arrestee? What 

about -- what creates this special relationship that 

21 permits you to intrude, search their home, search their 

22 car, search their person, to solve other cases? 

23  MS. WINFREE: Well --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you're going to 

have to tell me why searching their person is different 

11

1 than searching their home or car. 

2  MS. WINFREE: Well, if I could start at the 

3 back end of your question, Justice Sotomayor, we're not 

4 suggesting -- and this statute doesn't permit the State 

or police to search an arrestee's home or his person 

6 beyond -- beyond simply swabbing the cheek for the DNA. 

7  Now, in terms of the -- the individual's 

8 relationship to the State, an arrestee is not that 

9 dissimilar. There is, obviously, a range of -- of 

relationships with the State. Those of us who are out 

11 on the street, ordinary citizens are at one end, people 

12 who are imprisoned upon conviction are at the other end. 

13  And -- but, in terms of when an arrestee is 

14 physically in custody, he has a reduced expectation of 

privacy, and that's what makes, in our view, it makes 

16 this case more similar. To be sure, this is not Samson. 

17 It's -- there's no -- there's no one case in this 

18 Court's jurisprudence that's exactly like this. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no other case, 

but Samson, in that line that permits searches on this 

21 balancing. 

22  MS. WINFREE: Well --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what I want to know 

24 is what's the legal theory now? How far do we let the 

State go each time it has some form of custody over you,

1 in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has

3  MS. WINFREE: Well, those are different 

4 situations, Justice Sotomayor. We're not suggesting 

that -- that the police could swab a student for -- for 

6 a DNA sample.  We're talking about a special class of 

7 people who, by their conduct, have -- have been arrested 

8 based on probable cause. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you a particular 

specific quick question? 

11  MS. WINFREE: Yes, Justice Breyer. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: As I read this, this 

13 concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of 

14 violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary, or 

attempted burglary. 

16  MS. WINFREE: Yes, Justice Breyer. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: And so we're not talking 

18 about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and 

19 all these other things? 

MS. WINFREE: That's absolutely correct. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: The only thing we have to 

22 decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause 

23 to arrest a person for those four crimes, their 

24 fingerprints are all taken.

14  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

16 and may it please the Court: 

17  Arrestees are in a unique category. They 

18 are on the gateway into the criminal justice system. 

19 They are no longer like free citizens who are wandering 

around on the streets retaining full intact Fourth 

21 Amendment rights. 

22  The arrest itself substantially reduces the 

23 individual's expectation of privacy. The arrestee can 

24 be searched and sent to arrest. His property, whether 

or not connected with a crime, can be inventoried.

2 can be subjected to a visual strip search. If he's 

3 admitted to the population of the jail, he'll be given a 

4 TB test and a thorough medical screen. These are not 

individuals who are like free citizens, and they are not 

6 like free citizens in another significant respect. 

7  Arrestees are rarely arrested for the first 

8 time. They tend to be repeat customers in the criminal 

9 justice system. Up to 70 percent of arrestees have been 

previously arrested. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that 

12 doesn't mean, for example, that you can go into their 

13 house without a warrant. 

14  MR. DREEBEN: That is certainly correct, 

Chief Justice Roberts, and the reason for that is going 

16 into the house will expose a substantial number of 

17 highly private things to the view of the State. Taking 

18 a DNA sample is not of that character. It is far more 

19 like taking a fingerprint. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- this 

21 is a factual question. I understand your emphasis on 

22 the fact that it only looks at 26 loci, and they are 

23 supposedly not connected in any way with other 

24 information. 

Does the sample that you retain, can it be

1 evaluated more broadly? In other words, saying, well, 

2 the law says we only look at these 13, but we have this 

3 saliva, we want to look at all sorts of other stuff. 

4  MR. DREEBEN: Well, by law, the -- the 

government, under CODIS, and the States cannot look at 

6 anything except identification information. The sample 

7 contains the entire genome. The sample cannot be looked 

8 at as a matter of law. 

9  And I think it's critical to this case to --

for the Court to understand that, if the Court 

11 concludes, as is probably correct, that the individual 

12 will retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the 

13 genomic material that does not reveal identity, then 

14 additional Fourth Amendment scrutiny would be required 

before the government could make use of the rest of the 

16 genome. 

17  Here, it's making use of an identity 

18 indicator that is highly similar to fingerprints with 

19 one significant difference: It is far more accurate. 

When Respondent committed his rape --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it 

22 really? Because, if this were like fingerprints, I 

23 think that you would have a quite good case. But, as 

24 I've been reading about this, it -- it seems as though 

the technology is not the same as the fingerprint

1 technology; and, because the technology is different, it 

2 is used differently. 

3  Fingerprints, you go in, you put in a 

4 fingerprint, there is identifying information that comes 

back to you in 5 minutes, right? 

6  This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree 

7 said was 11 to 17 days, in this case, it's four months, 

8 and it doesn't seem to be used because the technology 

9 doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine 

identifier that fingerprints does. 

11  So am I wrong about that? 

12  MR. DREEBEN: You are not wrong, Justice 

13 Kagan, but the future is very close to where there will 

14 be rapid DNA analyzers that are devices that can analyze 

and produce the identification material in -- in the DNA 

16 within 90 minutes. And the design of this program is to 

17 put them at the booking station, so that DNA can be 

18 taken, and, within 90 minutes, that information is 

19 known. 

In that circumstance, it will be highly 

21 relevant to the immediate release/custody decision, 

22 which it already can play a role in --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that part is 

24 surprising. Then do you think the States are wrong? I

4  So I guess the technology is there, now, to 

process this in 2 days, not 9 days. 


6  MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Breyer -- Yes, 


7 Justice Breyer. There is no question it can be done 


8 quickly because of the volumes. I'm not contending 


9 that, today, it is --


JUSTICE BREYER: In the case of -- do you 

11 have any information -- are there instances with 

12 fingerprints where returns have not come back for as 

13 long as 30 days? Or are they all, or almost all, done 

14 in 5 minutes? 

MR. DREEBEN: Fingerprint histories tend to 

16 come back quickly, except if the prints are 

17 unrecognizable or unreadable. It is very significant, I 

18 think, that fingerprints are used for crime solution, as 

19 well as --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you get on 

21 to -- before you go to that, fingerprints have been 

22 taken, I believe, from people who are booked for 

23 offenses for many, many, many years; isn't that right?

identification, and, contrary to the representation of 

6 Respondent in his brief, fingerprints are run against 

7 the latent fingerprint database, which reflects 

8 fingerprints from crime scenes. 

9  It returns about 50,000 hits a year. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the question that I 

11 had was this: If the constitutionality of taking 

12 fingerprints is dependent on the speed with which a 

13 fingerprint comparison can be done now by a computerized 

14 system, would that mean that the taking of fingerprints 

was unconstitutional back in, let's say, the '50s, when 

16 that wasn't possible, and fingerprints could only be 

17 compared manually? 

18  MR. DREEBEN: No, I certainly do not think 

19 that it would have been unconstitutional at any point 

because the State has a compelling interest in taking 

21 biometric identification information from the individual 

22 that is arrested and using it for a myriad of purposes, 

23 determining criminal history, attempting to solve 

24 crimes, funneling that information back --

1 understand how this works, exactly? The swab is taken, 

2 and if I understand -- there is a database which is 

3 known offenders, and there is a database which is kind 

4 of crime scene DNA, is that correct? 

MR. DREEBEN: That is correct. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, when the swab is taken 

7 and it's put into the system, you check that against the 

8 crime scene DNA database, is that correct? 

9  MR. DREEBEN: That is the routine method 

under CODIS, yes. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you check it -- does 

12 Maryland check it against the known offenders database? 

13  MR. DREEBEN: I do not know precisely 

14 whether Maryland does that. The Federal system does not 

routinely do that. Upgrades to the software system will 

16 permit it to do that, and many States do it. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because that suggests that, 

18 right now, it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, 

19 which is a good thing -- you know, that we should solve 

some crimes, but not as an identification device because 

21 you're -- if it were an identification device, you would 

22 be comparing it to the known offender database, not to 

23 the cold case database. 

24  MR. DREEBEN: I agree with that, and I think 

that, in California, the brief for the States indicates

1 that many States do that, and California itself uses it 

2 to resolve discrepancies in identity when a fingerprint 

3 comes back and it returns to multiple names, or the 

4 fingerprint is not good enough to permit an 

identification. California cross-checks, so it does 

6 perform an identification function. 

7  And, as I suggested, with the advent of 

8 rapid DNA, it's not that it is unconstitutional before 

9 rapid DNA, but rapid DNA will permit DNA identification 

to replace fingerprint identification because it's far 

11 more accurate, and it has far more utility in the 

12 secondary purpose of fingerprints, which is to match 

13 them to latent prints and solve crimes. 

14  And this is highly relevant to both of the 

major purposes for taking DNA, crime solution and 

16 facilitating the release/custody determination. Any 

17 judge who is looking at a bail case would like to 

18 know -- I have a guy who has been arrested on grand 

19 theft auto. He has no criminal history. 

Should I release him back on the street? 

21 Well, it's a first offense, he has family ties, maybe 

22 yes. If that judge --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, can you 

24 explain how it works, mechanically? Because I

1 statute, but if you can't use the swab that is taken 

2 from the arrestee when he is arrested -- it can't be 

3 used, it's inadmissible -- then you do it again. You do 

4 it -- but what it does supply is probable cause because 

you found out that he was a perpetrator of a rape 6 

6 years ago. 

7  Then you have probable cause and you get a 

8 warrant and do it again. What -- what is the reason for 

9 the doubling -- the doing it twice? 

MR. DREEBEN: That serves an enhanced 

11 reliability function, to ensure that there is no mix-up, 

12 and it provides an evidentiary function of permitting 

13 the new DNA match to be admitted in a sample that is 

14 taken under the warrant. 

It has nothing to do with undercutting the 

16 value of taking DNA on the spot because I was indicating 

17 the judge who would know this defendant's DNA came back 

18 and returned a cold case hit to a murder-rape. He's not 

19 such a good risk to be put back on the street. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That argument only 

21 makes sense if we're in your -- your future world where 

22 it's 90 minutes, right?

2 something else, but you are not going to put off the 

3 bail hearing for 2 weeks? 

4  MR. DREEBEN: No, but bail can be revoked, 

and the government will go back in and make a motion to 

6 revoke bail, if new information emerges that indicates 

7 this individual is a danger to the community. 

8  And the whole point of this is we are 

9 talking about arrestees, somebody who has taken a step 

into the gateway of the criminal justice system. The 

11 criminal justice system, at that point, has to deal with 

12 this person. 

13  It has to know who is this person, which 

14 includes what has this person done, so we know whether 

to release him and, if we keep him, in what situations 

16 do we keep him. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't explain why 

18 you can't go into his home. 

19  MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it does, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean -- you know, if 

21 the whole issue is how dangerous is he, you should be 

22 able to go into his home, into his car, to any place he 

23 has visited, to just sort of run rampant in his life to 

24 make sure that he is not a bail risk.

1 and I don't think that the Court's balancing test 

2 suggests that these two cases are equivalent. My first 

3 submission is that because we are talking about --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are because what 

you are saying really is law enforcement need, alone, 

6 without any suspicion whatsoever of another crime, 

7 permits you to take this information from the person and 

8 use it. 

9  MR. DREEBEN: I'm saying that because an 

arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to 

11 probable cause that he committed a crime, he's in a 

12 different position from ordinary citizens. And this 

13 Court does, as it did in Samson and in Knights, balance 

14 the expectations of privacy against the governmental 

interests. 

16  And, here, the expectation of privacy is 

17 minimal in the cheek swab, and the information obtained. 

18 It's identical --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: According to Samson 

and Knights, you're dealing with people who are still 

21 subject to the -- a criminal sentence. 

22  MR. DREEBEN: Well, they're differently 

23 situated in that respect, Mr. Chief Justice. And I will 

24 acknowledge that there is no case on my side that 

decides the case this way. And there's no case that --

1 on Respondent's side that decides the case for him. The 

2 Court, I think, has treated the category of what he 

3 calls special needs cases -- what the Court has called 

4 special needs cases -- as dealing with suspicionless or 

warrantless intrusions on ordinary citizens. 


6  JUSTICE KAGAN: But the typical special 


7 needs case is one in which we say there's no law 


8 enforcement interest, that there's an interest other 


9 than the interest in solving crime. 


MR. DREEBEN: Well, we have a strong law 

11 enforcement interest with respect to people who are 

12 arrested based on probable cause. They are no longer 

13 similarly situated to other people. They can be 

14 deprived of their liberty. Their property can be 

searched upon entry into the jail. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: When you started, 

17 Mr. Dreeben, you started by saying -- you know, they 

18 have a reduced expectation of privacy, and we have 

19 important interests. You went right into free-form 

balancing. That's typically not the way we do it. 

21  If we said to you, look -- you know, the way 

22 we do it is you need a warrant, and if you -- there is 

23 some exceptions, then you have to put yourself into a 

24 well-recognized exception where you can search without a 

warrant. And that's especially the case when there is

2  How would you do it? How would you do it 

3 short of free-form balancing? What exception are you a 

4 part of? 

MR. DREEBEN: We're not asking for a new 

6 exception. What we're asking for is for the Court to 

7 apply what it called "the key principle of the Fourth 

8 Amendment." It said that in Bell v. Wolfish. It said 

9 that in Martinez --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The key principle is the 

11 Fourth Amendment --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- is it your 

13 position that this is a search incident to an arrest? 

14  MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy, it's not. 

That stands on its own doctrinal footing. But we do 

16 think the fact that --

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't this is a search 

18 incident to an arrest? 

19  MR. DREEBEN: It is certainly a search --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just -- just like taking 

21 the pockets out and -- and seeing what's in the person's 

22 overcoat and so forth. It is a search incident to an 

23 arrest. 

24  MR. DREEBEN: You can certainly look at it 

as an incident of the arrest. The Court's search

1 incident to arrest cases have been bottomed on different 

2 justifications than the ones that we're advancing here. 

3  I'm entirely happy if you, Justice Kennedy, 

4 view it as an incident to arrest in that sense because I 

think that it is appropriately viewed as something that 

6 the government has a compelling interest in doing once a 

7 person has been arrested, and that is, knowing who that 

8 person is, which includes knowing what the person has 

9 done. 

And DNA does that in a far more powerful way 

11 than fingerprints has done --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but our -- our search 

13 incident to arrest cases don't allow that. That's sort 

14 of the point. They -- they allow you to search for 

firearms, they allow you to search for material that 

16 relates to the crime for which the person has been 

17 arrested. 

18  But you can't search the person for other 

19 stuff. 

MR. DREEBEN: That's inaccurate, 

21 Justice Scalia. A search incident to arrest allows a 

22 full search of the person for any destructible 

23 evidence because a person who has been arrested has a 

24 tremendous incentive to destroy evidence. 

And I just want to come back --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Evidence 

2 relating to matters other than the crime of arrest? 

3  MR. DREEBEN: Yes, on -- on the individual's 

4 person. The crime of arrest limitation appears only in 

Arizona v. Gant, and it relates to cars. But I think 

6 it's critical to note that Respondent has conceded that 

7 an individual can have their DNA taken once convicted. 

8  Suppose we have the same individual who's 

9 picked up on grand theft auto, and that individual knows 

that, if he's convicted of grand theft auto, he is going 

11 to have his DNA taken, but he also knows that he's 

12 committed a string of rapes. And, if the government 

13 cannot take his DNA now, it will not connect him -- may 

14 I complete the sentence -- it will not connect him to 

those rapes. 

16  So he has a tremendous incentive to flee. 

17 The government has a tremendous need for this 

18 information at the time of arrest to solve crimes, 

19 exonerate the innocent, and give closure to victims.

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. Just to be clear, 

Justice Kennedy, we're not disputing the proposition 

6 that certain intrusions on privacy are permissible as to 

7 arrestees, but where we fundamentally disagree with the 

8 State and the Federal Government is with regard to the 

9 argument that this Court should take the rationale of 

Samson v. California and essentially extend that 

11 rationale to the point of arrest. 

12  The government --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think -- I think there 

14 is some merit to your argument in that regard. In 

Samson, he was a parolee, and he actually, as I recall, 

16 signed a -- a consent form as part of the probation. 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct. An agreed 

18 condition of parole. That is -- that is correct. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that is right. 

But I'm curious as to why your position is that -- let's 

21 say he served his time. He's no longer subject to the 

22 criminal justice system. He's not on parole; he's not a 

23 probationer. You concede that the DNA evidence can be 

24 taken from him, correct? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I would concede,

Official 

1 Mr. Chief Justice, that it -- that it could be taken at 

2 least while he is still under the supervision of the 

3 State because, after all, both Samson and Knights were 

4 cases in which the individual was still under State 

supervision; that is to say, we're not arguing that, at 

6 the point of conviction, that the resulting lessened 

7 expectation of privacy extends in perpetuity as, say, a 

8 firearm or felon disability does. 

9  But what we are arguing is that -- to look 

at this Court's cases in Samson and Knights, they both 

11 centrally depended on the proposition that it is the 

12 fact of conviction that deprives an individual of the 

13 full protections of the Fourth Amendment. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 

pertinence of the fact -- I mean, this is not something 

16 that people are or can keep private. I mean, if you're 

17 in the interview room or something, you take a drink of 

18 water, you leave, you're done. I mean, they can examine 

19 the DNA from that drink of water. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that 

22 compromise the -- the expectation of privacy? 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: I think it's an open 

24 question as to whether or not there would be a search

2  And, to the extent that there's an argument 

3 that there would still be a search, it would be based on 

4 this Court's reasoning in Skinner, where the Court 

suggested that the subsequent analysis of a urine sample 

6 would constitute a further invasion of the test of the 

7 individualâ€™s --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's not a --

9  MR. SHANMUGAM: -- the privacy interest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My question was not 

11 trying to get at whether it's a search or not. It's 

12 whether -- it's getting at the reasonableness of the 

13 expectation of privacy that the -- your DNA is protected 

14 from examination when it's left wherever you happened to 

have been. 

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: I would say two things about 

17 the privacy interests at stake here. First of all, 

18 there is an intrusion into the body, and that is what 

19 triggers the applicability of the Fourth Amendment here, 

to be sure, but it is also a relevant intrusion for 

21 Fourth Amendment purposes. 

22  But, second, and perhaps more importantly, 

23 there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in the 

24 contents of an individual's DNA. And, to the extent 

that this Court were to engage in balancing, we

3 that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, 

4 whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in 

a person's DNA? 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, and we think that the 

7 answer to that question is yes, that an individual 

8 has --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, but 

you're simply just -- you're -- I guess that's begging 

11 the question. And -- well I'd just be repeating my 

12 question -- how legitimate is it to you to expect 

13 privacy in something that the police can access without 

14 you even knowing about it, without any voluntary or 

involuntary -- if you take a drink of water, if you 

16 leave behind a cigarette butt? 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

18 I've heard Mr. Dreeben to concede, as I think he must, 

19 that an individual retains a legitimate expectation of 

privacy in at least some of the information contained in 

21 the individual's DNA. 

22  And I suppose we can have a dispute about 

23 what types of information would qualify. But I think it 

24 really is settled that there are profound privacy 

concerns raised by the government's coming into

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, I -- I 

3 wouldn't have made the concession that you've made, that 

4 this case is about reasonable expectation of privacy. 

If there's no reasonable expectation of privacy, there's 

6 no search. 

7  But, here, there is a search. You have a 

8 physical intrusion. You -- you pull a guy's cheek apart 

9 and stick a -- a swab into his mouth. That's a search, 

reasonable expectation of privacy or not. 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- Justice Scalia, I 

12 didn't think I was conceding anything, but if I --

16 engaging in balancing here. Indeed, that is really our 

17 principal submission to this Court. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you think the 

19 intrusion is worse when you just take a swab and you go 

inside somebody's cheek, as opposed to rolling 

21 fingerprints? Which is the greater intrusion? 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we think that it is

3 trespass on the person and, therefore, a search when 

4 fingerprints are collected. I would note, 

parenthetically, that, in the first half an hour of this 

6 argument, we heard no explanation, either by the State 

7 or by the Federal government, as to their theory as to 

8 why fingerprinting is constitutional. 

9  Now, we --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the thrust of a lot of 

11 what we -- we have been presented with in the briefs and 

12 what we have heard this morning -- and, by the way, I 

13 think this is perhaps the most important criminal 

14 procedure case that this Court has heard in decades. 

The -- the attorney for the State began by 

16 listing a number of crimes just in Maryland that had 

17 been solved using this. So this is what is at stake: 

18 Lots of murders, lots of rapes that can be -- that can 

19 be solved using this new technology that involves a very 

minimal intrusion on personal privacy. 

21  But why isn't this the fingerprinting of the 

22 21st century? What is the difference? If it was 

23 permissible and it's been -- it's been assumed to be so 

24 for decades, that it is permissible to fingerprint 

anybody who's booked, why is it not permissible to take

1 a DNA sample from anybody who is arrested? 

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Alito, we think that 

3 fingerprinting is distinguishable on three grounds. 

4 First of all, as a practical matter, an individual's DNA 

contains far more information and far more personal 

6 information than an individual's fingerprints. But, as 

7 a doctrinal matter, we think that fingerprinting is 

8 distinguishable --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, as to -- as to the 

first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a 

11 urine sample is taken to determine drug use, the urine 

12 can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the 

13 presence of drugs, and the Court has said, in those 

14 cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are 

considering that this is a reasonable search with 

16 respect to the determination of whether the person has 

17 taken drugs, not all the other information --

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: But that is because --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: -- that might be obtained 

from it. 

21  MR. SHANMUGAM: But that is because, 

22 Justice Alito, in those cases, cases like Skinner and 

23 Von Raab and Vernonia, there was a special need, apart 

24 from the ordinary interests in law enforcement. And, 

here, it is clear that the primary purpose of the

1 Maryland statute and, indeed, the similar statutes on 

2 the Federal and State levels, was the ordinary interest 

3 in crime control, to solve unsolved crimes. 

4  And that is why those special needs cases 

are distinguishable. And I think that that's why the 

6 State, essentially, disavows any reliance on the Special 

7 Needs Doctrine --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: What are your other two 

9 distinctions? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: With regard to 

11 fingerprinting, we think that, notwithstanding the 

12 physical intrusion involved with taking an individual's 

13 fingers and putting them on the pad, that the better 

14 view is that fingerprinting is not a search, and, to the 

extent that this Court has addressed the question, it 

16 has suggested that fingerprinting is not a search 

17 because an individual has no expectation of privacy in 

18 their fingerprints because their fingers are constantly 

19 exposed --

JUSTICE BREYER: I would like a complete 

21 answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were 

22 asking, I think. I mean, to summarize that, if I look, 

23 in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally, I am 

24 talking practically. It doesn't seem to me -- I can 

argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than

1 fingerprints. You have to stand there, have the thing 

2 rolled; your -- stick out your tongue. I mean, it's 

3 hard to say it's more, for me, I'm not saying for 

4 others. 

Accuracy, it's much more accurate, and that 

6 doesn't just help the defendant. There is a whole brief 

7 here filed by the victims that have case after case, 

8 where people spent 5 years in prison, wrongly, and where 

9 this system and the CODIS helped victims avoid being 

arrested and sent to jail when they were innocent, so it 

11 works both ways. 

12  So, one, it's no more intrusive; two, it is 

13 much more accurate. And three and four and five, how 

14 it's different and worse in practice, is what I would 

ask you to summarize. 

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. Well --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: And, by the way, when you 

18 talk about what information you could get out of it, 

19 there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the 

field, and I came away from the brief thinking there 

21 isn't much more information because fingerprints can be

3 possibility of abuse, it's there, but these other 

4 things, photos, too. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Breyer, let me --


6  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, now, you tell 


7 me, in light of that hostile question --


8  (Laughter.) 


9  JUSTICE BREYER: -- I would like you -- I 


would like you to tell me, okay, it's different from 

11 fingerprints and worse because of one, two, three, and I 

12 will write it down, and I'll remember it. I promise. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: He gave us one and two. I 

14 have been waiting for three. Will you drop the shoe? 

(Laughter.) 

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: Let me -- I will gladly get 

17 to three with regard to fingerprinting, and then I would 

18 like to say a word about balancing, in the event that 

19 the Court reaches it. Obviously, we don't think that 

balancing is appropriate here because we don't think 

21 that the Special Needs Doctrine is applicable, and we 

22 don't think that Samson should be extended to arrestees. 

23  But, with regard to fingerprinting, the 

24 other reason why we think fingerprinting is different, 

above and beyond the fact that we think the better view

1 is that fingerprinting is not a search, is because 

2 fingerprinting, as it is currently practiced, does serve 

3 a special need. 

4  The primary purpose of fingerprinting is to 

identify an individual who is being taken into the 

6 criminal justice system. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Shanmugam, that 

8 seems to me a real distinction in this case, as it's 

9 been litigated. I take what the government is saying is 

something like, give us 5 years, and those won't look 

11 very different. 

12  In other words, we will be able to do, in 5 

13 years' time, exactly what we can do with fingerprinting, 

14 except it will be, as Justice Breyer says, more 

accurate. So we are just about 5 years ahead of that, 

16 so give us a break. 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: And my response to that 

18 would be that, under the Special Needs Doctrine, what is 

19 relevant is not how a system could conceivably operate; 

what is relevant is the primary purpose behind the 

21 program at issue. 

22  So, if the government were to come back in 5 

23 years' time with a DNA testing program, the primary 

24 purpose of which was pretrial supervision or 

identification, one of these other purposes that is

2 different. 

3  That is simply a consequence of the fact 

4 that this Special Needs Doctrine, unlike the rest of the 

Fourth Amendment, looks to purpose, namely, the purpose 

6 of the program at issue. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: A person -- a person has 

8 been arrested for a felony and is in custody, do the 

9 police -- does the justice system have an interest in 

knowing whether that person committed other crimes? 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: The justice system always 

12 has an interest in law enforcement and solving crimes, 

13 and we certainly don't dispute that proposition. But 

14 what we do dispute is Mr. Dreeben's principal submission 

to this Court, which is that simply because law 

16 enforcement can do certain things to arrestees, it can 

17 do others. 

18  The primary thing is --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: My question is whether or 

not the police, who have John Doe in custody for a 

21 felony, have an interest in knowing, at the outset or 

22 within a few weeks' time, whether or not that person has 

23 committed other crimes? 

24  MR. SHANMUGAM: The difference between an 

arrestee and an ordinary citizen, Justice Kennedy, is 

41

25

Official 

1 that, as to an arrestee, the police have probable cause 

2 to believe that the arrestee committed a particular 

3 offense. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But they also have a 

reason for keeping him in custody. 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: Related --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And my -- my question is, 

8 do they have an interest -- a legitimate interest in 

9 knowing if that person has committed other crimes? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: They have that interest, 

11 but, if they want to investigate other crimes, they have 

12 to do what they would have to do as to an ordinary 

13 citizen. They have to have a warrant or some level of 

14 individualized suspicion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are two 

16 different -- two different interests. One is we want to 

17 solve unsolved crimes; and the other is we want to be 

18 sure -- we have someone in our custody, and we want to 

19 be sure, before he is released back into the community, 

that he isn't a person who has committed five violent 

21 crimes before that. 

22  Now, your brief says, well, the only 

23 interest here is the law enforcement interest. And I 

24 found that persuasive because of the concern that it's 

going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they 

42

1 are going to have to release him or not before they know 

2 it. 

3  But if we are in a position where it now 

4 takes 90 minutes -- or will soon take 90 minutes to get 

the information back, I think that's entirely 

6 different because, there, you can find out whether --

7 it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want 

8 to release him or not? 

9  MR. SHANMUGAM: The touchstone of the 

analysis, under the Special Needs Doctrine, is what was 

11 the primary purpose of the program at issue. And there 

12 is no evidence that pretrial supervision was a purpose 

13 of any of these. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's 

because -- that's because we are not yet at a situation 

16 where it takes 90 minutes. Sure, it's not going to do 

17 you any good if it's taking 4 months or whatever it took 

18 in this case. 

19  But, if it's at the point where it's 90 

minutes, it would be critical to make that 

21 determination. 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as 

23 I said to Justice Kagan, the constitutional analysis may 

24 very well change at later point. But I think it's 

important to underscore that neither the State of 

43

25

Official 

1 Maryland nor the Federal government identifies a single 

2 instance in which a pretrial supervision decision in 

3 their jurisdictions was altered as a result of the DNA 

4 test. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's put it 

6 this way. Let's -- let's say the judge or the 

7 magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he 

8 says, well, it's important to me to know whether you are 

9 going to commit another crime. 

So we are not saying you have to give a DNA 

11 sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you 

12 refuse to do it. 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, outside the 

14 programmatic context, ordinary Fourth Amendment rules 

would apply. And ordinary --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what does that 

17 mean? Is that okay or not? 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think, in that 

19 circumstance, where there is no individualized 

suspicion, a search cannot occur. And an 

21 arrestee stands --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we do it --

23 doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer? You are 

24 pulled over, they say, we want you to take a 

Breathalyzer test. They say, you don't have to, but, if

2 whatever. 

3  Why isn't that the same thing. 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- you know, I will say 

that the one thing that is slightly different about your 

6 hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the analysis 

7 might be somewhat different where what you are talking 

8 about is a condition of release. I think you would 

9 trigger the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine and the 

analysis might operate somewhat separately -- somewhat 

11 differently. 

12  But, just to conclude with regard to my 

13 answer with Justice Kennedy and then to get back to the 

14 rest of Justice Breyer's question, Justice Kennedy, with 

regard to arrestees, the intrusions on privacy that are 

16 permissible are all intrusions that relate to the 

17 arrest. 

18  So to take the two principal examples, the 

19 Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine, which you mentioned, 

and searches associated with an individual's continued 

21 detention, so the strip searching example, those 

22 doctrines have discrete justifications that limit their 

23 scope. 

24  So the Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine 

permits searches for officer safety, to prevent 

45

25

Official 

1 destruction of evidence, and at least in the vehicular 

2 context, to search for evidence related to the offense 

3 of arrest. 

4  Now, none of those rationales apply here, 

and I would note, parenthetically, that in 

6 Schmerber v. California, this Court suggested that the 

7 Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine would not permit 

8 searches into the body. It will permit only --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are also talking 

about identity. I assume that, in Maryland and in a 

11 number of States, the time between release on bail and 

12 return for trial is more than four months. 

13  And, if it's found, as an identity matter, 

14 that this person has a criminal record or that they 

are -- suspected of serious crimes, that is a 

16 mandatory ground for reconsideration of bail. And you 

17 say there is no interest in that. 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: I am not disputing that the 

19 government has an interest in knowing about prior 

offenses that an individual has committed. What I am 

21 simply saying is that the primary purpose of DNA 

22 testing, unlike fingerprinting, is to investigate 

23 unsolved crimes. 

24  That is the ordinary interest in law 

enforcement, and when the government is indicating --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought 

2 fingerprinting -- Mr. Shanmugam, I thought 

3 fingerprinting was used to determine whether they -- the 

4 person has a record. We have this person, and now, we 

check the fingerprints to find out if he has a prior 


6 record, that's different from to find out if he has 


7 committed a crime that we don't know about. 


8  But -- but are fingerprints used to 


9 determine whether the person has a prior record? 


MR. SHANMUGAM: Fingerprints taken upon 

11 booking are primarily used for the purpose of 

12 identification, and, by identification, I would include 

13 determining whether the individual had a prior criminal 

14 record because, as IAFIS is currently structured, that 

is information that is returned once there is a hit for 

16 that initial search. 

17  Now --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: What was the purpose of 

19 fingerprinting before it was possible to make 

fingerprint comparisons by computer? 

21  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think fingerprinting 

22 really has, from the outset, served the purpose of 

23 identification because fingerprinting really came into 

24 being approximately 100 years ago because, in large 

urban areas, officers could no longer identify

1 individuals on sight. 

2  Now, to be sure, fingerprinting does serve a 

3 law enforcement purpose as well. As Mr. Dreeben 

4 indicated, there is a latent fingerprint database that 

roughly corresponds to --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I would assume that, 

7 before it was possible to do computer searches, the way 

8 in which fingerprinting established identification, what 

9 it did in that respect was to identify the person 

arrested on this occasion, so that, if the person was 

11 arrested again, then the police would know that it was 

12 the same person. 

13  There was no way of -- no practicable way of 

14 taking the fingerprints of somebody who was booked and 

determining whether that person -- you didn't have 

16 anything to compare it to. And they certainly -- you 

17 couldn't do it manually. 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is true. But, again, 

19 the purpose of fingerprinting, as it developed over 

time, was identification in the sense that, as 

21 fingerprints were being collected, individuals could 

22 proceed to be identified based on prior --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to --

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, so you know that, on 

day one, you have arrested -- you've arrested Mr. X, and 

48

1 then, a year later, you arrest somebody else, and you 

2 know it's Mr. X again. And DNA can do exactly the same 

3 thing, except more accurately. 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: But I think it's important 

to realize, Justice Alito, that at least, as the DNA 

6 system is currently constituted, when an arrestee's 

7 profile is prepared, it is compared against the offender 

8 and arrestee indices, not the forensic index. 

9  And, indeed, as we understand it -- and I 

think Mr. Dreeben's discussion of this is probably 

11 consistent with this, at least on the Federal level, it 

12 is not permissible to take that profile and search it 

13 against the offender and arrestee indices. 

14  Now, that very well may occur in certain 

States. We don't have any reason to believe that that 

16 is what takes place in Maryland. But, again, this is 

17 really what distinguishes the way in 

18 which fingerprinting is --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I think I can totally lose 

this because -- because I have a confusion that you can 

21 clear up. There is something to what you say. I see 

22 what you are saying. But what does this word 

23 "identification" mean? It's used for identification. 

24 We have a person, he's been arrested. 

He writes his name down, Mr. Smith. Maybe

3 future, we can look, see, and that's awfully good. 

4  And, now, you say, well, what is 

fingerprinting doing that photos aren't doing, in terms 

6 of identification? What does it do, in terms of just 

7 identification? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: What does it do? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: We think it means 

11 determining or confirming the identity of an individual. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: What does that mean, 

13 confirming his identity? We have -- you mean what? 

14 What exactly? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Confirming, for instance, in 

16 this case, that the individual in the government's 

17 custody was Alonzo King. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, really? I mean, do you 

19 think the fingerprints -- where do you go to find out if 

he's Alonzo King? A lot of people have never had their 

21 fingerprints taken before. 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but 73 million people 

23 are in the criminal offender --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it's for? To 

determine what his name really is?

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. You want to determine 

what his name really is, plus his adjudicated criminal 

6 history, and, here, we have the DNA, which I guess might 

7 or might not help determine what his name really is, 

8 and, with criminal history, it does about the same. And 

9 also fingerprints are sometimes used to -- for unsolved 

crimes, and they are sometimes used for unsolved crimes, 

11 but your point really is more for unsolved crimes. 

12  Have I got it. 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Breyer, no, I think, 

14 with respect, you haven't. With regard to DNA testing, 

a DNA profile -- at least as the Federal system is 

16 configured -- is compared against the forensic index. 

17 That is the index of samples from unsolved crimes. And 

18 so that is really in contradistinction to how the 

19 fingerprint database works. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I am 

21 really worried about the question you haven't satisfied 

22 me with, which is I agree completely that, today, it's 

23 used primarily and almost exclusively for purposes of 

24 solving other crimes. 

But let's -- is this -- the question that I

will use it to pull up a guy's criminal history, not 

6 unsolved crimes, but criminal history. Get to that day. 

7  MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. Well, 

8 Justice Sotomayor --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me what the -- tell 

me what the -- why you would then say that would still 

11 be unconstitutional? 

12  MR. SHANMUGAM: Justice Sotomayor, assuming 

13 that this Court does not accept the proposition that 

14 arrestees are somehow subject to a lessened expectation 

of privacy, the only other --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. Let's assume we 

17 go under a normal Fourth Amendment, you need probable 

18 cause to search. 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. And the only other 

potentially applicable exception to the principle that 

21 warrantless, suspicionless searches are unconstitutional 

22 is the special needs exception, and that exception looks 

23 to the primary purpose of the program at issue. 

24  And the mere fact that DNA testing could be 

used for other purposes wouldn't necessarily be

1 dispositive of the inquiry. If the primary purpose of 

2 DNA testing is still to investigate unsolved crimes, the 

3 program would still not qualify under the Special Needs 

4 Doctrine. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Shanmugam, just 

6 suppose -- I mean, I guess the question is would this be 

7 unconstitutional? It's not the world we are living in 

8 now, but let me -- 10 years from now, the government 

9 says, we are really switching over to a fingerprint 

system -- to a DNA system, and what that system is going 

11 to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to identify, 

12 and it's going to allow us to bring up the old criminal 

13 history, and it's going to allow us to see whether there 

14 are also unsolved crimes that we can tag to this person 

and discover that he's really, really dangerous. 

16  All right? And so the government puts that 

17 system into effect. Is it constitutional? 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: I think that it could be, 

19 and that would simply be because you would have a system 

where DNA testing is essentially being used as 

21 fingerprinting is being used today. But, again, I don't 

22 think --

1  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- well â€“ 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is, there is 

3 something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that 

4 is not the same as fingerprinting. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there is, and that 

6 gets me back, finally, to the rest of Justice Breyer's 

7 question from a few minutes ago because Justice Breyer 

8 had kind of asked how the analysis should work, in the 

9 event that the Court were to proceed to balancing. 

And so I just want to say a word about the 

11 relevant privacy interests and the relevant governmental 

12 interests and to explain why we think that the relevant 

13 privacy interests outweigh those governmental interests. 

14  On the privacy side of the ledger, we 

certainly believe that there are profound privacy 

16 concerns associated with the government's collection of 

17 an individual's DNA. And, leaving aside the question of 

18 how much personal information is contained in the 13 

19 loci -- and we certainly think that there is significant 

personal information, even as to those loci -- I don't 

21 think there can be any dispute that, when you evaluate 

22 the entirety of an individual's DNA, there is a great 

23 deal of personal information contained there. And, in 

24 our view, that has to be taken into account when 

engaging in balancing.

1  Now, the government's response to that is 

2 essentially the "just trust us" defense; namely, that 

3 the government is not looking at all that information, 

4 it is only looking at a certain subset of that 

information. But that has never been how this Court has 

6 analyzed privacy interests, at least outside the special 

7 needs context. 

8  Probably the closest analog is this Court's 

9 decision in Kyllo v. United States, where the Court said 

that it was of no moment that the heat-sensing device 

11 that was at issue in that case did not detect any 

12 information about the intimate details of activities 

13 within the home. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you disclose 

all of this intimate private information when you take a 

16 drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind. 

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: But, Mr. Chief Justice, as I 

18 said at the outset, we believe that there might still 

19 be -- indeed, we think the better view under this 

Court's cases is that there would still be a Fourth 

21 Amendment search there. 

22  The only difference would be that you don't 

23 have the intrusion into the body that makes the question 

24 of whether or not there is a search here an easy one. 

Now, I want to say just a word about the

1 governmental â€“-

2  JUSTICE ALITO: What if someone has a bloody 

3 shirt and throws it away in the trash -- in a public 

4 trash can along the street, you are saying that the 

police can't analyze that without a search warrant? 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: The argument would be that 

7 the subsequent analysis of the DNA, nevertheless, still 

8 constitutes a search. And the most significant decision 

9 on this issue, to date, is the Fourth Circuit's decision 

in United States v. Davis, which I would encourage you 

11 to look at, if you are interested in this issue, because 

12 it holds that the extraction of the DNA from an item 

13 that was lawfully in the government's custody still 

14 constitutes a search. 

Let me say just a word, though, about the 

16 governmental side of the balance here because I think 

17 this is important. Ms. Winfree started with the 

18 statistics about the efficacy of DNA testing of 

19 arrestees, but our submission is, simply, that, when you 

look at the relevant subset of cases, namely individuals 

21 who have been arrested, but who are not subsequently 

22 convicted of the offense of arrest, the law enforcement 

23 value of DNA testing is relatively modest. 

24  My understanding is that --

JUSTICE ALITO: But your client was

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, my client --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct? And he 

7 was sentenced to 4 years. 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is -- my client was 

9 convicted of the crime of arrest, to be sure. But, 

under the Maryland statute, that crime was not a serious 

11 enough crime to qualify for DNA collection at that 

12 point. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: For Fourth Amendment 

14 purposes -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, do you think 

that it is -- that it is permissible to take a DNA 

16 sample from someone who is convicted of an offense that 

17 would qualify as a felony under common law? 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: We think that it would be 

19 permissible to collect DNA from any individual who has 

been convicted and is subjected to the continued 

21 supervision of the State. And that is simply because 

22 those individuals have a lessened expectation of 

23 privacy.

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: I'm sorry? A felon who has 

12 been --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does a felon -- does a 

14 person who has been arrested for a felony have a reduced 

expectation of privacy at the time of his arrest? 

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: I would not say that that 

17 person has a reduced expectation of privacy. What I 

18 would say is that there are certain intrusions on 

19 privacy, some of which are quite substantial, that are 

permissible because there are justifications unique to 

21 the arrest. 

22  So, in Florence, this Court permitted the 

23 strip search of an individual who is being admitted into 

24 the general jail population, based on the special need 

of ensuring prison safety and preventing contraband from

4  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

6  MS. WINFREE: On the question of rapid DNA, 

7 the FBI estimates that we're about 18 to 24 months away 

8 from that world, and I would cite the National District 

9 Attorneys Association's amicus brief on page 20 where it 

discusses the -- that this is not science fiction. So 

11 we are very, very close to that. 

12  And I wanted to just address a couple of the 

13 questions that arose during Respondent's presentation. 

14 Justice Kennedy, the State does have a compelling need 

and a compelling interest in knowing who is in its 

16 custody, and arrestees do not have a legitimate 

17 expectation of privacy in their identity. 

18  We have a legitimate and compelling need to 

19 identify suspects and to aid in solving crimes. 

And our -- and our definition of what 

21 identification is, is somewhat broader than 

22 Respondent's. It's not just what his name is and what 

23 his face is and what his fingerprints show. It is that 

24 CODIS DNA profile, those 26 numbers, so that -- in our 

view, that's a broader definition of -- of identity.

1  And I wanted also, just finally, to address 

2 Justice Alito's question. This is the fingerprinting of 

3 the 21st century, but it's better. Typically, DNA 

4 evidence is used to identify rapes and murderers. 

Fingerprints typically do not solve those kinds of 

6 crimes. 

7  And, if the primary purpose of 

8 fingerprinting is just to identify, it also is used --

9 fingerprinting, now, is used -- the prints are compared 

against the latent database in IAFIS, and they are used 

11 to solve crimes. But they typically don't solve the 

12 kind of crimes that we are talking about here, and it 

13 wouldn't have been solved in Mr. -- in Mr. King's case. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can I base a 

decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in 

16 2 years? You say, in 2 years, we will have this rapid 

17 DNA available, but we don't now. 

18  Don't I have to base a decision on what we 

19 have today? 

MS. WINFREE: Well, that's really only one 

21 component of our argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that, 

22 certainly, with respect to a bail determination, we will 

23 be able to make it more rapidly at the time that that 

24 rapid DNA comes into effect. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, if we believe

1 that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's 

2 legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the --

3 that the purpose is immediate identification of the 

4 people coming into custody, you just can't demonstrate 

that now. Maybe you can in 2 years. 


6  The purpose now is -- is the purpose you 


7 began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, 


8 which is a good thing. But -- you know, the Fourth 


9 Amendment sometimes stands in the way. 


MS. WINFREE: It has a corollary purpose, 

11 Justice Scalia. What we are suggesting and arguing is 

12 that solving crimes, to be sure, is the key component, 

13 but in solving crimes and connecting an arrestee to a 

14 crime that's unsolved informs a judge's determination 

about whether to release that individual. 

16  And, as Mr. Dreeben said, bail modifications 

17 can happen; they do happen all the time. And, in 

18 Maryland, it's going to have -- it's going to be 

19 happening before rapid DNA. Right now, we are able to 

make that determination in a period between 11 and 

21 17 days. 

22  So we are not asking you to base your 

23 decision on the futuristic world, which is really only 2 

24 years out, with rapid DNA anyway. But we can make those 

bail determinations now, and, in fact, they are
