3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-8976, Smith v. United 

States. 

6  Mr. Kramer. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. KRAMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  From the first Congress in 1790, Congress 

12 has made the decision that all Federal statutes which 

13 are, of course, creatures created by Congress in 

14 statutes, should be subject to a statute of limitations; 

in this particular case, five years. When it comes to 

16 conspiracy cases, as this Court said in Hyde, the 

17 statute of limitations is treated a little differently 

18 because conspiracy statutes are -- conspiracy crimes are 

19 continuing offenses.

 So the Court said the way we determine --

21 one way to determine whether a particular defendant's 

22 involvement in a conspiracy has ended -- in other words, 

23 his membership has ended -- is by the doctrine of 

24 withdrawal.

 It's the statute of limitations that is the 

3

1 defense in the case. It's the doctrine of withdrawal 

2 that triggers -- that is the triggering event for the 

3 statute of limitations, which sets the date for when the 

4 statute of limitations starts to run. Withdrawal, in 

and of itself, is not a defense. It's the statute of 

6 limitations that's the defense. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- is that an 

8 element of the crime? 

9  MR. KRAMER: No. This Court has called it a 

defense in the Cook case, in the Oppenheimer case --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be raised by the 

12 defendant, right? 

13  MR. KRAMER: It does have to be raised 

14 initially -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means it's not an 

16 element, so it doesn't have to be charged in the 

17 indictment. Now, how can something that goes to the 

18 existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be 

19 an element?

 MR. KRAMER: Well, I don't -- it is -- it is 

21 not an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would 

22 say that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal 

23 statute by statute. This is not the common law, but by 

24 Congress' decision. I would also say that even though 

it's not an element of defense -- of the offense, in

Official 

1 Winship, this Court referred to the fact that the 

2 government must prove every fact necessary to prove a 

3 crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It's a fact 

4 necessary --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you could 

6 prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a 

7 reasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of 

8 limitations. And statutes of limitations exist for 

9 civil claims, as well as criminal claims.

 And in -- on the civil side, the statute of 

11 limitations is an affirmative defense. And it's up to 

12 the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove 

13 it, both the burden of production and persuasion. Why 

14 should it be different on the criminal side?

 MR. KRAMER: I think several reasons. First 

16 of all, obviously, the burden of proof is different in 

17 criminal cases as the court said in Mullaney v. Wilbur. 

18 It has been suggested that, because of the difficulties 

19 in negating an argument that a homicide was committed in 

the heat of passion, the burden of proof should rest on 

21 the defendant. 

22  And they said the same may be said of the 

23 requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many 

24 controverted facts, but this is the traditional burden 

which our criminal justice system applies. I also think

Official 

1 that the Court has distinguished on some grounds and is 

2 the civil statute of limitations from the criminal 

3 statute. 

4  In fact, in the number of cases, this Court 

has talked about the criminal statute of limitations. 

6 It has never referred to it as an affirmative defense. 

7 It has said it's a defense, but it has never said that 

8 the defendant is required to prove it. 

9  In fact, the Quick case said it's part of 

the merits of the case; although it doesn't have to be 

11 pleaded in the indictment, and the -- that it has to 

12 be -- the government has to present evidence of it and 

13 proof of it. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I think you --

you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden 

16 of production, not the government, the burden -- burden 

17 of coming forward with this defense and producing some 

18 evidence of the withdrawal. 

19  MR. KRAMER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do 

accept that there is a burden of production, as with 

21 several other things that are not affirmative defenses, 

22 like entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of 

23 production before the government has to prove the 

24 elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. So 

it's not --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. -- I'm sorry. 

2 I'm sorry. Finish your answer. 

3  MR. KRAMER: It's -- it's not dissimilar to 

4 those in that respect, and it does go to negate an 

element of the crime. In -- in the conspiracy statute, 

6 the membership in the conspiracy is an element of the 

7 crime. Withdrawal negates that element of the crime. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- only for the later 

9 period. It doesn't negate that this person was once a 

member of the conspiracy. The government has the burden 

11 to show membership, and it did. So it's not -- it 

12 doesn't reach back to negate that there was membership 

13 at some time. It just says, after withdrawal, we no 

14 longer prosecute.

 MR. KRAMER: That's true. What it does is 

16 extinguish liability for that offense past that time if 

17 the statute of limitations has -- if withdrawal occurs 

18 before the statute of limitations, someone can no 

19 longer, as the statute says, "be prosecuted, tried, or 

punished." 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that like an 

22 amnesty? Isn't that how you described it in your brief? 

23  MR. KRAMER: There are some cases that call 

24 it an amnesty. Some cases call it an extinguishment of 

liability.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference 

2 between the two, in your mind, that makes it an element 

3 of the crime or a negation of some element of the crime? 

4  MR. KRAMER: In a conspiracy, there's the 

conspiracy that -- the government has to prove, 

6 obviously, the conspiracy itself, which is an agreement 

7 between -- it can be anyone. And then they have to 

8 prove the defendant's membership in that conspiracy. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're a member, you 

are liable for all the foreseeable acts of your 

11 co-conspirators, whether or not you knew they were going 

12 to happen, so long as they were foreseeable? 

13  MR. KRAMER: Yes. Under Pinkerton, yes. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you can be liable 

for as long as you stay, until you prove you withdrew? 

16  MR. KRAMER: Until --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that extinguishes 

18 your liability for the continuing conspiracy? 

19  MR. KRAMER: I would say until you produce 

evidence that you withdrew, yes. And then the 

21 government has to prove that you were still a member of 

22 the conspiracy within the statutory limitations period. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? 

24  MR. KRAMER: This Court has never said in 

Hyde --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The why is, once you've 

2 joined, you're trying to extinguish liability. Why 

3 would the government have to prove that you're entitled 

4 to amnesty or not entitled to amnesty?

 MR. KRAMER: It -- I think, Justice 

6 Sotomayor, that it's really no different than if the 

7 government has to prove you guilty of a crime in the 

8 first place. They have to prove that you committed the 

9 offense. The statute of limitations, which is, as I 

said, engrafted on every Federal criminal statute --

11 almost every statute --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your argument 

13 basically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the 

14 statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as 

individuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy. 

16  MR. KRAMER: Yes. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, well, that's 

18 not true with respect to other aspects of the 

19 conspiracy. If members of the conspiracy commit a 

murder, and it was anticipated and all that, the person 

21 that has nothing to do with that, other than being a 

22 part of the conspiracy, is liable -- criminally liable 

23 for that as well. Why is there a special rule for 

24 statutes of limitations? Well, why is he treated as an 

individual, rather than a member of the conspiracy in 

9

1 that respect? 

2  MR. KRAMER: Well, he would be treated 

3 for -- for the withdrawal purpose. If he withdrew, he 

4 would also not be liable under Pinkerton. There is a 

membership element component of Pinkerton as well, for 

6 Pinkerton liability. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is 

8 that, once you prove the conspiracy, a member who 

9 doesn't -- that doesn't actually participate in the 

activities of the conspiracy, is still responsible for 

11 them. So it makes sense to say you can prove the 

12 statute of limitations with respect to the conspiracy, 

13 not with respect to each individual. 

14  MR. KRAMER: Well, I think, actually, it's 

just the opposite. If -- under -- under Grunewald, the 

16 government -- if the defense -- if the claim of 

17 termination is raised, the government has to prove that 

18 the conspiracy continued into the limitations period and 

19 that there was an overt act -- that was an overt act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what the Chief Justice 

21 indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your 

22 view, then there is going to be a different statute of 

23 limitations for each member of the conspiracy. And so 

24 you have four or five different statute of limitations. 

I find that -- I find that puzzling.

Official 

1  MR. KRAMER: Well, actually, in this case, 

2 there was different statutes of -- I believe there were 

3 three different statute of limitations that the district 

4 court instructed the jury about because there were 

superseding indictments and people were indicted at 

6 different times. 

7  So there were already, in this case, 

8 different statute of limitations. But if one of the 

9 reasons for withdrawal is to encourage people to get out 

of the agreement, Justice Kennedy, then -- and try to --

11 try to thwart the agreement, then people may have -- may 

12 come in and leave at different times during a 

13 conspiracy. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- is there any --

I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the 

16 statute of limitations. And what occurred to me, just 

17 as an example, that you might have in your practice 

18 found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair. Say 

19 that he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an 

intent to return it, and he produces evidence that he 

21 had an intent to return. 

22  Now, in such a case, once he produces the 

23 evidence, does the government have to prove beyond a 

24 reasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to 

return? Or does he -- is there any instance in which 

11

1 the burden of persuasion shifts? Do you see what I'm 

2 driving at? 

3  MR. KRAMER: I do, and I think that there --

4 that an argument can be made if the intent -- if one of 

the elements of that offense is to deprive the owner 

6 permanently of the property and he did not have that 

7 intent, the government would have to prove what it would 

8 have to prove originally, which is that he intended to 

9 deprive the -- the owner --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you have never found a 

11 case -- I will ask the government this -- in the 

12 substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even 

13 if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know 

14 anything about it, you've never found a case where, once 

the burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion 

16 remains on the defendant? 

17  MR. KRAMER: That the burden of persuasion 

18 remains on the defendant? 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because you agree the 

defendant has the burden of production here. 

21  MR. KRAMER: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: And so I was trying to 

23 think of some instance -- as I said, I would be 

24 repeating myself -- I'm looking for any instance in 

which, leaving the statute of limitations out of it, the 

12

1 burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant. So I'm 

2 saying, did you ever find one? The Thomas Crown Affair 

3 or some other instance, and your answer is, no, you 

4 never have heard of it.

 MR. KRAMER: Well, I guess --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Have you heard of it? So 

7 what? 

8  MR. KRAMER: Self defense and duress, as the 

9 Court said in Dixon, dealing with duress, because it did 

not negate the elements of the offense, it was an 

11 affirmative defense that excused --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is not -- this 

13 does not negate the elements of the defense -- this does 

14 not negate the elements of the crime.

 MR. KRAMER: If it doesn't negate the 

16 elements of the crime, I would say then this Court has 

17 classified it as an affirmative defense. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then if 

19 that's so, if it's an affirmative defense and if 

sometimes where it doesn't negate the elements of the 

21 crime the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant, 

22 then why shouldn't it here? Because he's the one most 

23 likely to know. 

24  MR. KRAMER: Well, I don't think, first of 

all --

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: And how do you prove it? 

2  MR. KRAMER: -- that the government has 

3 shown -- well, first of all, they -- they have to prove 

4 nothing more than what they would have to prove 

originally, that the defendant was joined -- knowingly 

6 and willfully joined the conspiracy. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you would have 

8 the government prove that twice. They prove his 

9 membership in the conspiracy. And then you say, once he 

alleges that he withdrew, they have to prove it again. 

11  MR. KRAMER: No, they would not have to 

12 prove that twice. They could just rest on what they had 

13 done originally. The -- the burden of production on the 

14 withdrawal, the government could just say to the jury 

that that's nonsense, there is no reasonable doubt here. 

16 We've proved that he was a member. There is a 

17 permissive inference that he's still a member within the 

18 limitations period. They would not have to prove it 

19 twice. They could rest on what they had done 

originally. 

21  It's very simple for them, however, to rebut 

22 this evidence. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you -- what 

24 would you have to produce to get over your threshold of 

satisfying the burden of production?

25

Official 

1  MR. KRAMER: Well, it's -- it's actually, I 

2 think, a quite high burden of production. You would --

3 the defendant -- in most cases, I would think the 

4 defendant himself would have to testify, which, of 

course, subjects him to extensive cross-examination on 

6 everything. 

7  He can -- of course, cannot call his 

8 co-conspirators as witnesses. He might be able to 

9 present third-party evidence which, again, would be 

subject to cross-examination. But he has to show that 

11 he took some -- produce evidence that he took some 

12 affirmative act to disavow --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why 

14 it's very difficult to put the burden on the government, 

because the people -- he says, well, I told so-and-so 

16 I'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it 

17 anymore. And so the government, if they had the burden 

18 of proof, would say, well, I don't think that's true, I 

19 want to call the person you -- you talked to.

 And the person says, well, I'm not going to 

21 testify because I take my rights under the Fifth 

22 Amendment. There is no way the government -- in many 

23 cases, there would be no way the government can carry 

24 this burden of proof.

 MR. KRAMER: No, I disagree with that. I 

15

Official 

1 think, in every case, it would actually be fairly simple 

2 for them. If the defendant can't call that person to 

3 support his defense, the government could just say, 

4 well, you didn't hear any testimony from that person 

supporting the defense. That's enough right there to
 

6 meet our burden.
 

7  The government, as in this case, had
 

8 extensive cooperating witnesses, had wiretaps, had
 

9 documentary evidence --

JUSTICE BREYER: They often do. I just want 

11 to go back, get the complete -- insofar as you can help 

12 with this. 

13  All right. Let's take duress or 

14 self-defense. The government shows all the elements of 

murder. Then the defendant comes in and says, I have 

16 evidence here that it was under duress or evidence that 

17 it was self-defense. Then to prevail, what's the 

18 standard of persuasion? How does it work? 

19  Is it then that -- is it that the defendant 

must show more likely than not? Or is it the defend --

21 that I was defending myself? Or is it that the 

22 government -- how does it work? What's the rule? 

23  MR. KRAMER: The defendant -- as I 

24 understand it, the defendant has to -- and, of course, 

it could vary by state.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course. Of course. 

MR. KRAMER: The states may put different 

In the Federal system --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.

 MR. KRAMER: -- the defendant has the 

6 burden, by a preponderance, to prove the duress defense 

7 or the self-defense defense. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, that's --

9 well, then their point is, well, this is awfully 

similar. 

11  MR. KRAMER: It's not, though, in the sense 

12 that the only thing that connects an individual 

13 defendant to a conspiracy is that defendant's 

14 membership, knowing and willful participation in the 

conspiracy. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: The fact that there is a 

17 statute of limitations makes your case weaker, not 

18 stronger, because -- because the statute of limitations 

19 is less directly connected to the elements of the -- the 

offense than is self-defense or duress. 

21  MR. KRAMER: I actually think it makes it 

22 stronger, in the sense that Congress has made this 

23 choice to require that every crime be proved to have 

24 been committed within the statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that you --

17

 MR. KRAMER: That was the jury instructions 

6 in this case. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and you agree that 

8 that's the rule of law, right? 

9  MR. KRAMER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't duress eliminate 

11 willfully? 

12  MR. KRAMER: The Court said, in Dixon -- it 

13 might, to my thinking, but the Court said, in Dixon, 

14 that it did not negate any of the elements of the 

offense, that the -- that she had to do the acts 

16 knowingly and willfully in Dixon and that it did not 

17 negate those elements. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: So why is that different 

19 from this? If that's not an element, for Pete's sake, 

even though the definition of the crime is knowingly and 

21 willfully, and yet, nonetheless, that's -- that's an 

22 affirmative defense, why -- why is that any different 

23 here? 

24  MR. KRAMER: Because the only way a 

defendant can prove -- the way a defendant shows that he

1 withdrew is to produce evidence of withdrawal. That is 

2 inconsistent with the fact that he is a member --

3 necessarily negates the element of membership in the 

4 conspiracy. If he withdrew, he cannot, at the same 

time, be a member of the conspiracy. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm having trouble 

7 understanding how your argument would work. Let's say 

8 that the -- the defense calls a witness other than the 

9 defendant to testify to a conversation in which the 

defendant allegedly withdrew from the conspiracy and, by 

11 doing that, satisfies its burden of production. 

12  Now, you say the government has the burden 

13 to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that this 

14 conversation didn't occur, but also, that the defendant 

never withdrew at any other time during the limitations 

16 period. Isn't that where your argument would lead? 

17  MR. KRAMER: No, I don't think they have to 

18 disprove the conversation. All they have to prove is 

19 what they had to prove originally, which is that the 

defendant was a member of the conspiracy within the 

21 limitations period, by any kind of evidence. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: But how can they prove that 

23 he did not withdraw at any other time during this 

24 conspiracy?

 MR. KRAMER: Well, as in this case, they had

6 Mr. Smith's actions. They could ask them, did the 

7 conspiracy -- did Mr. Smith continue to participate, was 

8 he involved, did he withdraw, any --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Aren't you transforming 

the -- the nature of withdrawal? You are seeming to 

11 argue that the government has to prove, beyond a 

12 reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy 

13 during the statute of limitations period, rather than 

14 the -- the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.

 MR. KRAMER: No. I don't mean to imply 

16 active participation, if that means an overt act. It 

17 can just be -- the government could simply rest upon the 

18 inference from Hyde that the defendant had been a member 

19 outside the limitations period and their continued 

participation is inferred. That's overcome when the 

21 defendant produces evidence of withdrawal. So --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what evidence of 

23 withdrawal did you produce in this case? 

24  MR. KRAMER: In this particular case, it was 

the -- well, it was the jury that actually called the

1 issue to the attention of everybody in the first place, 

2 by sending out a note saying that, if we -- the 

3 conspiracy continued, but we think a defendant left, 

4 must we find him not guilty?

 There was a number of pieces of evidence, 

6 primarily that he was incarcerated for over six years 

7 before the indictment --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove that he 

9 withdrew.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you agree --

11 you agree that that would not have necessarily meant 

12 withdrawal? 

13  MR. KRAMER: No, there are some circuit 

14 cases that say that alone may be enough, but there was 

more in this case. In this particular case, one witness 

16 said he recalled -- he did not recall any contacts 

17 between Kevin Gray, who was the ringleader, after the 

18 arrest. 

19  Another said that Mr. Smith was mad at 

Mr. Gray for not sending any money. They weren't 

21 communicating with him. Another witness -- there was 

22 testimony from another witness that Mr. Smith refused to 

23 comply with an order that Mr. Gray sent to him. 

24 So there were --

1 affirmative actions? I mean, the law is that he has to 

2 take an affirmative action withdrawing from the 

3 conspiracy. I don't think being in jail is -- is an 

4 affirmative action. I don't think being mad at the 

ringleader is an affirmative action. I don't think any 

6 of the things you've said amount to an affirmative 

7 withdrawal from the conspiracy. 

8  MR. KRAMER: Whatever that may be, it's not 

9 an issue in this case, in the sense that the government 

is actually the one who requested that the district 

11 court give the withdrawal instruction after the jury's 

12 note. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe not, but it -- it may 

14 mean that we are wasting our time.

 MR. KRAMER: I think that whether this 

16 qualified as affirmative acts or not is, in a sense, 

17 irrelevant to the question before the Court because, 

18 after the jury's note came out, the government itself 

19 requested the withdrawal instruction. And the 

government not only requested the withdrawal 

21 instructions, but said, we have no objection to placing 

22 the burden on us beyond a reasonable doubt, if that's 

23 what the defense wants.

1 trouble understanding how this works. You said a while 

2 ago that the government has -- doesn't have to do 

3 anything? In other words, he puts on -- he says, I 

4 withdrew. And I told this -- the head of the conspiracy 

that I wanted no more part of it. And the head of the 

6 conspiracy says, well, I'm not going to testify. 

7  And then the government doesn't have to do 

8 anything? 

9  MR. KRAMER: The government can just say --

they can rest on the fact that the proof outside the 

11 membership period and rest on the inference from Hyde 

12 that his membership continued. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how is that --

14 how is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to 

prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable 

16 doubt? It seems to me that, if the government just sits 

17 there and doesn't say anything, they'll never be able to 

18 carry their burden. 

19  MR. KRAMER: I think -- I think they can by 

just saying to -- well, I don't think they have a burden 

21 to prove the absence of withdrawal. They have the 

22 burden to prove membership within the limitations 

23 period. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they've 

already done that. That's --

3 the jury, look, this evidence of withdrawal is nonsense, 

4 you've heard the testimony, we've cross-examined him, it 

makes no sense. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. My 

7 hypothetical is, because we are talking about the 

8 criminal conspiracy, and the idea is did he tell those 

9 people he was out, they're probably going to say, I'm 

not going to testify. 

11  And so -- and you say, well, the government 

12 still doesn't have to do anything. It seems to me that 

13 you can't say that they've carried their burden of proof 

14 beyond a reasonable doubt, if they have nothing to say 

about an issue as to which you say they have the burden 

16 of proof. 

17  MR. KRAMER: Well, I think it's up to the 

18 jury whether to believe that evidence or not. And I 

19 don't think the government has to prove --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Believe what 

21 evidence? 

22  MR. KRAMER: The -- the evidence that was 

23 produced by the defendant that he actually told somebody 

24 he --

defendant had testified to that effect, that he -- if
 

6 there is no evidence, there is nothing for the jury.
 

7 There is no -- if there's -- the defendant has not
 

8 produced any evidence of withdrawal, then there
 

9 is nothing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, if the 

11 defendant does testify, and he says, I told the 

12 ringleader I want out, is an attack on his credibility 

13 sufficient to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a 

14 reasonable doubt?

 MR. KRAMER: Absolutely. And it happens all 

16 the time in trials, that the government relies upon the 

17 fact of a witness' unreliability and what happened on 

18 cross to say that they proved their case beyond a 

19 reasonable doubt. They don't have to prove anything 

they didn't have to prove originally in this case. In 

21 fact, it may be easier because it's within the 

22 limitations period. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to prove 

24 within the limitations period. They didn't have to 

prove that. You acknowledged that that the -- look,

3  MR. KRAMER: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge that that 

is an affirmative defense. And you are arguing that 

6 what establishes that affirmative defense in this case, 

7 namely, withdrawal, is an element. How -- how can 

8 something that is -- that does nothing more than 

9 establish an affirmative defense be an element?

 MR. KRAMER: I --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I can't understand that. 

12 Can you give me any other example in the criminal law

entrapment negate elements are not affirmative defenses.

17 happen in any case --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not an 

19 affirmative -- I want an example of something which is 

an affirmative defense and where the proof of that 

21 affirmative defense becomes an element. 

22  MR. KRAMER: I may have given the wrong

done it.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it up to the 

6 defendant to raise it, if it's an element? 

7  MR. KRAMER: I think, in Ledbetter, this 

8 Court said that, although there doesn't have to be a 

9 date in the indictment, the government -- it's 

sufficient if the government proves a date before the 

11 indictment within the limitations period, this Court 

12 specifically referred to in Ledbetter, which is at page 

13 21 of our brief.

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually thought your

2 hadn't committed the actual crime. 

3  MR. KRAMER: That is -- that is the heart of 

4 our argument, that it negates the element of membership 

within the statutory period, which is what the 

6 government has to prove. And I'm sorry if I did not 

7 make that clear. 

8  But the element that's at issue, that the 

9 statute of limitations negates, is membership within the 

statute -- membership in the conspiracy, knowing and 

11 willful participation --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: But the government doesn't 

13 have to prove within the statutory period. It's up to 

14 the defendant to raise that defense, and if he doesn't 

raise it, it's waived. 

16  MR. KRAMER: Well, I think it is up to the 

17 government to prove it. It may be that if -- this Court 

18 has never said a defendant waives it by not raising it. 

19 But I -- I think the government has to prove it in every 

case. It may be waived. 

21  Some circuits have said it's waived. This

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you,
 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

6  The Due Process Clause does not require the 

7 government to disprove withdrawal outside the 

8 limitations period because lack of withdrawal is not an 

9 element of the crime of conspiracy. This Court has been 

clear that the Winship burden attaches only to things 

11 that are elements in the constitutional sense. And when 

12 something is an element in the constitutional sense, 

13 then at least four consequences follow. 

14  As the Court has suggested, first, the 

government has to allege in the indictment in every 

16 case. Second, the -- the government has to prove it in 

17 every case. Third, the jury has to be instructed on it 

18 in every case. And fourth, a defendant can't waive the 

19 requirement that it be proved in his case by failing to 

raise it. 

21  But none of those things apply as to a 

22 statute of limitations --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: This is true, but his 

point -- basic point -- and he has responded to the 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 points I've made, is that, of course, if there's a 

2 five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the 

3 government that he create -- he committed a robbery 

4 before.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Correct. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So he's saying 

7 what you charged in the indictment is that he was a 

8 member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and 

9 2005. Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly. 

And he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show, 

11 as an element, that he was a member. 

12  Now, you did present some evidence that he 

13 was a member. And he wants to present some evidence, 

14 and has, that he wasn't a member. And he wasn't a 

member if he withdrew. And therefore, once he presents 

16 enough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove 

17 beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member. So you 

18 have to show he didn't withdraw. 

19  Now, this has nothing to do with the statute 

of limitations. By coincidence, it does. But a statute 

21 of limitations issue would be that you all agree that he 

22 withdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or 

23 1997? That's a statute of limitations issue, but this 

24 isn't.

 This is a question of whether he was a 

30

25

Official 

1 member of the conspiracy during the time period that you 

2 charged in the indictment. That's his point. So what 

3 is the response? 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: So I guess I have two 

responses. The first is that it is a statute of 

6 limitations question, in the sense that the government 

7 proved -- and there is no dispute about this -- that the 

8 conspiracy that was charged did exist within the 

9 limitations period. And so the question is just did 

this particular member of the conspiracy --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in other words, you 

12 can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here 

13 with what? Not charging them? You are saying there was 

14 a conspiracy? Doesn't he have to be shown to be a 

member of the conspiracy in order for you to get a 

16 conviction? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: He does, and there's no --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And that's an element of 

19 the crime?

 MS. HARRINGTON: And an -- but when 

21 Petitioner talks about the membership or participation 

22 element, what he is really talking about is the 

23 agreement element. The government has to prove that 

24 each defendant who is charged with a conspiracy 

intentionally agreed to join the conspiracy. And there 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 is no dispute that the government proved that with 

2 respect to Petitioner in this case --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: There is no more relevance, 

4 is there, to the fact that there happened to be a 

pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I 

6 shouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a 

7 bank before 1995? I mean, in each instance, there was 

8 criminal activity before 1995. 

9  Now, you can use that in order to prove that 

he was a member during '95 to 2000. That, I see. But 

11 he, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove 

12 he wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000. And, therefore, 

13 it goes to show whether you or the government have 

14 proved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a 

member between '95 and 2000. 

16  MS. HARRINGTON: But, again, the element is 

17 agreement, right? So we prove that he agreed to join 

18 the conspiracy, and we proved that each defendant agreed 

19 to join the conspiracy. We don't have to prove that 

that agreement happened in the limitations period, as 

21 long as we prove that the conspiracy continues to --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: So how do we tell that, 

23 Ms. Harrington? Because it seems to me that the crux of 

24 the difference between you and your friend is that you 

say the element is membership in the conspiracy at some 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 point, it doesn't matter whether it's in the limitations 

2 period. And he says the element is membership in a 

3 conspiracy in the limitations period. And if he's 

4 right, a set of things follow from that; and if you are 

right, another set of things follow. 

6  So how do we determine that the -- you know, 

7 that the statute of limitations -- that the timing 

8 question is not baked into the elements question, that 

9 it's just membership sometime, as opposed to membership 

at a particular time? 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we know it's not an 

12 element for the reasons I explained because it doesn't 

13 have to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to 

14 be proved in every case, the defendant can waive it. So 

it's not an element in the constitutional sense, for all 

16 of those reasons. 

17  We can also tell that, in the specific 

18 conspiracy context, it's not an element because this 

19 Court's decision in Hyde from 1912. In that case, the 

defendant, Mr. Schneider, who had raised the statute of 

21 limitations defense, had not done anything to 

22 participate in the charged conspiracy within what was 

23 then a three-year statute of limitations period. 

24  The jury was charged, he didn't do anything, 

the court said he didn't do anything. The court said,

Official 

1 it's fine, he's still a member of the conspiracy because 

2 he has not taken an affirmative act to withdraw from the 

3 conspiracy. 

4  So that's how we know that some sort of 

active membership isn't an element of the crime, as long 

6 as the government has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, 

7 that -- that the defendant joined the crime at some 

8 point and that the -- joined the conspiracy -- excuse 

9 me -- at some point, and that the conspiracy continued 

to exist in the --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the government charge 

12 in the indictment that the conspiracy existed during 

13 this five-year period?

I'm not sure it specifically used that phrase, but it

1 charged -- it charged overt acts that were part of the 

2 conspiracy that happened within the five-year period. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it didn't say the 

4 conspiracy only existed within that five-year period?

 MS. HARRINGTON: I'm not sure what -- I'm 

6 not sure exactly the language that is used in the 

7 indictment, but it --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume it did. 

9 Would -- would -- let's say, in a burglary indictment --

let's say the burglary occurred seven years ago, and 

11 there is a five-year statute of limitations. If the 

12 indictment just -- just accuses the individual of 

13 conducting a burglary seven years ago, is that -- is 

14 that indictment invalid?

 MS. HARRINGTON: This Court -- this Court 

16 has held since the Cook case that the -- the government 

17 does not have to charge that -- the satisfaction of the 

18 limitations period in the indictment. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's -- it's up to the 

defendant to say, no --

21  MS. HARRINGTON: It's up to the defendant --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- seven years is too long. 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: -- to raise it, right. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: So I guess the issue here 

is whether the government's statement that the 

35
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 conspiracy existed within this five-year period causes 

2 that to be an element of the crime? 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: But I think this Court has 

4 been clear, that it doesn't cause it to be an element of 

the crime. I mean, back as far as the Cook case, the 

6 Court said that it doesn't have to be -- timing is not 

7 an element -- is not of the essence of these crimes. 

8 And so it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment. 

9  And, again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if it is? 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: But what if it is? Of --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it is charged in 

13 the indictment? 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: Then that doesn't -- that 

doesn't cause it to be an element of the crime. I 

16 think, again, there is no dispute in this case that the 

17 government proved that the conspiracy did exist within 

18 the limitations period. I don't think Petitioner is 

19 contesting that. What he is saying is that he wasn't a 

part of that conspiracy within the limitations period. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What he's saying is 

22 that it wasn't proven to be within the limitations 

23 period with respect to him. 

24  MS. HARRINGTON: That's true, but 

once the -- it's true that that's his argument. But

1 once the government has proved that he willingly joined 

2 the conspiracy, which it did in this case, then the law 

3 presumes that every person who has willingly joined the 

4 conspiracy remains a member of an ongoing conspiracy, 

unless or until he takes some affirmative action to 

6 withdraw from the conspiracy. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I am looking at it 

8 as a puzzle here because I think you could look at it 

9 either way. I mean, if a person commits a burglary and 

the indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I 

11 did, there is no doubt about all the elements being 

12 satisfied, but it happened outside the limitation 

13 period. That's in the statute of limitations area. 

14  But where you charge a conspiracy taking 

place within a period of time, as I would think you 

16 usually would -- I would think the -- those words on the 

17 paper almost always have a date in them -- then you 

18 could look at it as a question of membership in that 

19 conspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's 

a question of the elements. 

21  And then, if you're in doubt as to whether 

22 or not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside 

23 the period, that becomes a limitations question. 

24  MS. HARRINGTON: But it can't --

JUSTICE BREYER: And then I'm -- I'm sort

Official 

1 of -- I'm torn here. I actually can see it either way. 

2  MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think it can't be 

3 an element of the crime because, if the defendant 

4 doesn't raise it, the government doesn't have to prove 

it or disprove it, depending on how you look at it. 

6 So --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't true. You 

8 have to prove membership. 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you have to prove 

membership --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: And it happens, in this 

12 instance, that you bring in a prima facie case. I'd be 

13 repeating myself. And that he says withdrawal, and 

14 withdrawal is designed to negate membership.

 MS. HARRINGTON: But withdrawal does not 

16 negate membership because, again, membership is really 

17 just the agreement. And, in fact, a withdrawal defense 

18 tends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to 

19 join a conspiracy because there is nothing to withdraw 

from if he didn't join --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But then the withdrawal 

22 prior to the time charged negates membership in the 

23 conspiracy that you have charged because there was no 

24 membership during that time.

case, where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you 

6 charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant 

7 raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the 

8 statute of limitations. Who bears the burden of proving 

9 it does, in that situation?

 MS. HARRINGTON: This Court stated, in 

11 Grunewald, that the government bears the burden.

13 bear the burden in the normal statute of limitations 

14 case, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes do you 

continue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime? 

16  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- and you still 

18 have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the 

19 statute of limitation there are that there was an 

agreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at 

21 any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy 

22 continues. 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have to prove 

that the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined

1 that conspiracy during the statute of limitations; 

2 that's your point. 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: We don't have to prove that 

4 he -- that the agreement happened in the limitations 

period or that any particular defendant did something to 

6 sort of re-agree within the limitations period. And 

7 that, again, is clear from this Court's decision in 

8 Hyde, where, in that case, the defendant raising the 

9 limitations defense had not done anything related to the 

conspiracy within the limitations period. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think his intuitive 

12 argument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't 

13 a part of during the limitations period. That really is 

14 the essence of his argument. And if it's your job to 

prove that he committed the -- a robbery during the 

16 limitations period, that it's your job to prove that he 

17 committed the conspiracy during -- that he was part --

18 that the conspiracy -- that he was part of the 

19 conspiracy during the limitations period --

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, what the statute --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that -- that's 

22 the simplicity of his argument. 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: It -- that is the 

24 simplified version of his argument. I think, if you

2 response to me.

4  MS. HARRINGTON: Okay. Well, if you look at 

Section -- if you look at Section 3282, which is the
 

6 statute of limitations, it says that the crime --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not a simple
 

8 response.
 

9  (Laughter.)


 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are already way too 

11 fast. 

12  MS. HARRINGTON: What we have to prove is 

13 that the crime was committed within the limitations 

14 period. We proved that the crime was committed within 

the limitations period because the conspiracy existed in 

16 the limitations period. By operation of law, anyone who 

17 has willingly joined the conspiracy at some point 

18 remains a member of the conspiracy, unless or until he 

19 takes an affirmative step to withdraw.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it essential to your 

21 argument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a 

22 crime that continues over time? 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. The way the 

24 statute of limitations defense operates within the 

conspiracy context is it asks the question whether and 

41

1 when a conspiracy was complete. But -- but the 

2 affirmative defense of withdrawal is actually an 

3 affirmative defense, even within that affirmative 

4 defense, because it asks the question whether a 

conspiracy was complete as to a particular defendant. 

6  And to take advantage of that affirmative --

7 affirmative defense within an affirmative defense, the 

8 defendant has to take some affirmative act. And it 

9 makes sense to require him to prove that he took those 

acts. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish I had -- we had the 

12 supervening indictment before us. It's -- it's not in 

13 the Joint Appendix. 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: It's very long.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it's described in 

16 the Court of Appeals opinion as follows: "According to 

17 the indictment in the district court and the evidence of 

18 the United States at trial, during the late 1980s and 

19 1990s, appellants Rodney Moore, Kevin Gray, John Raynor, 

Calvin Smith, Timothy Handy, and Lionel Nunn, along with 

21 others, some of whom were also indicted, but tried 

22 separately, conspired to conduct and did conduct an 

23 ongoing drug distribution business in Washington." 

24  So apparently, according to that 

description, it -- it was not charged as a conspiracy 

42

1 during those five years. It was just charged as a 

2 conspiracy. 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: It was charged as an 

4 ongoing conspiracy. It started before the beginning of 

the limitations period. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. So it would 

7 have been up to the defendant to prove that the statute 

8 of limitations barred -- barred his conviction. 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. That's 

why --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suspect I agree. 

12 If -- it's awfully tough to turn this on the presence or 

13 absence of particular dates in the indictment, but 

14 the -- the thing that motivates me -- I mean, I can see 

it's like a rabbit-duck. You know, is it a rabbit, or 

16 is it a duck? And -- and the -- the -- the thing that 

17 is so rare in the law --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a jackalope, maybe. I 

19 never heard of a rabbit-duck.

 (Laughter.) 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: Definitely a rabbit. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Yet it's so rare, that the 

23 government doesn't have the burden of proving beyond a 

24 reasonable doubt, that it suggests, when in doubt, say 

reasonable doubt.

2 thought of duress. We've thought of self-defense. 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Insanity is another. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Insanity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Insanity. 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Anything else? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: Extreme emotional 

9 disturbance. Just a constitutional matter, this Court 

held in Patterson that the government didn't need to 

11 disprove that. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Harrington, would you 

13 agree that, as this argument is developing, what is 

14 really at issue has less to do with the statute of 

limitations than the nature of conspiracy? And one view 

16 is Petitioners', and it's embodied in some of the 

17 questions that has been -- that have been asked, and 

18 it's this: That the crime is continuing to participate 

19 as a member of a conspiracy.

 And the other view is that a conspiracy is a 

21 dangerous thing. It's like rounding up a -- a pack of 

22 lions or wolves or setting loose some thing that 

23 continues to be a danger; and if you do that thing, by 

24 joining it, you are liable, criminally, for everything 

that happens after that, even if, at a certain point,

1 you walk away, and you do nothing. 

2  Now, if -- if he's right, that it is active 

3 membership, then there may be a problem for you here. 

4 But if the other view is correct, that you are liable 

for setting this thing in motion, whether or not you 

6 continue to do anything active in support of it during 

7 the limitations period, then you are correct. 

8  Now, which is the -- which is the 

9 established view of the crime of conspiracy?

 MS. HARRINGTON: The view established by 

11 this Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues, 

12 and once a person joins the conspiracy, he or she is 

13 liable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were 

14 reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy. 

And that's true, even if that person, once he joins the 

16 conspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you recognize --

18 you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question 

19 doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense 

and the question is how do you allocate the proof 

21 burden? 

22  So your case accepts that there is a 

23 withdrawal defense. Indeed, the judge gave a charge to 

24 the jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the 

difference between the two of you is you say, defendant 

45

1 can say, I withdrew. If he does that, he has to prove 

2 it. And the defendant is saying, I have to produce 

3 enough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you 

4 have the ultimate burden of persuasion.

 MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. And the 

6 Petitioners' view is grounded in due process concerns. 

7 Our view is that it is not a matter of due process 

8 because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the 

9 crime of conspiracy.

 So once you take due process out of the 

11 equation, then you have to ask what -- where would 

12 Congress have understood the burden -- the allocation of 

13 burdens to be, when it enacted these conspiracy statutes 

14 in 1970?

 And as a matter of logic, as a matter of 

16 history, as a matter of policy, there is no reason to 

17 think Congress would have thought the burden of 

18 persuasion to be anywhere other than on the defendant. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose that a 

conspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal 

21 objects, not to its membership. If there's five people 

22 that conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators 

23 has said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the 

24 conspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's 

a new conspiracy because it's a new group. 

46

1  But there is no support of the law for that, 

2 I take it. 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: No, this Court has said the 

4 opposite. It has said that -- you know, people can come 

and go in a conspiracy and --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's the criminal 

7 objects that define the conspiracy? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. And, again, 

9 there's no dispute in this case that the conspiracy was 

ongoing. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But 

12 you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy. 

13 You've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me 

14 why you don't have to show that that was -- that that 

individual's conduct was within the statute of 

16 limitations period. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Because once --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At least, when he 

19 comes forward with -- under the burden of production, 

with evidence suggesting the opposite. 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, if we can take 

22 the due process part off the table -- because we think 

23 it's not an element of lack of withdrawal, then you ask 

24 sort of, you know, what -- how would Congress have 

understood the state of the law to be when it enacted

1 these crimes, that's how the Court approached this 

2 question as to duress in Dixon. 

3  I think, as a matter of logic, because the 

4 government can prove that someone is liable for a 

conspiracy by proving that he joined a conspiracy at 

6 some point and that the conspiracy existed in the 

7 limitations period, it wouldn't make sense to require 

8 the government to disprove withdrawal, once it's 

9 asserted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but Mr. Kramer 

11 says it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to 

12 do -- he says you don't have to do anything at all. 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: I think that's kind of a 

14 remarkable assertion. If what he's saying is we have to 

be disprove withdrawal, once the defendant asserts it 

16 beyond a reasonable doubt, it's hard to imagine why the 

17 government would ever -- once a defendant makes a prima 

18 facie case of withdrawal, when the government would ever 

19 just say, oh, well, we'll sort of rest on our laurels 

and rest on the -- the evidence we have proving that he 

21 joined the conspiracy outside the limitations period. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose this thing doesn't 

23 come up in the -- in the statute of limitations context. 

24 Suppose it comes up in the context of whether this 

defendant is liable for an act committed by the

1 co-conspirators after he withdrew. So it's the same 

2 issue of whether -- whether he withdrew or not, before 

3 the murder of somebody, okay? 

4  He said -- you know, before that occurred, I 

was out of the conspiracy. What do our cases say
 

6 about -- about proving it in that context? Is the
 

7 burden on the defendant? Or is the burden on the
 

8 prosecution?
 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: Your cases don't say
 

anything about that. Our view is that the burden would 

11 be --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I didn't hear you. 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: Your cases don't say 

14 anything about that question, so our view would be that 

the -- the burden stays on the defendant to prove that 

16 he withdrew from a conspiracy in that context. The 

17 Pinkerton liability isn't at issue here, so you don't 

18 need to -- to wrap that up into this case, but our --

19 our view would be the same.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Nothing to do with statute 

21 of limitations. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy? 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was just -- I was 

24 curious. In 1997, the Petitioner did report the 

identity of another cooperating witness to Gray. You

1 don't -- you don't rely on that as showing that he was, 

2 indeed, part of the conspiracy? That's just irrelevant 

3 to your case? 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: No, we -- we do rely on 

that. That's mentioned in our brief -- at the back end 

6 of the brief where we talk --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was -- it was 

8 kind of a throwaway line. But why isn't that 

9 dispositive for you?

 MS. HARRINGTON: No, I think it is 

11 dispositive. And that was the reason we gave for the 

12 Court to deny the petition for Writ of Certiorari 

13 because there is plenty of evidence in this case that 

14 this defendant was in fact a member of the conspiracy. 

There's evidence that the leaders of the conspiracy gave 

16 him drugs and money. 

17  First of all, there's evidence that the 

18 reason he went to prison was to help out the leader of 

19 the conspiracy. There was evidence he was paid back 

because they gave him drugs and money while he was in 

21 prison. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of this is 

23 questions for the jury under -- under the Petitioners' 

24 view, right?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, certainly. I mean,

Official 

1 under -- under both views -- you know, it all -- all the 

2 evidence goes to whether -- you know, he had joined the 

3 conspiracy and whether he proved withdrawal. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I 

understand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington? 

6 The conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an 

7 element. Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of 

8 something which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say 

9 somebody commits a robbery, and you have to show that 

the person has committed a robbery and if the person 

11 brings up the question of timing, you also have the 

12 burden of persuasion on that. But would the timing be 

13 an element in that case or not? 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: Not.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And so you are essentially 

16 saying that this case should be treated just as every 

17 other case. You happen to have the burden of persuasion 

18 if somebody says the statute of limitations has been 

19 violated, but the question of when conduct occurred is 

never an element. 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: It's never an element. It 

22 is true that the government -- if a defendant raises a 

23 statute of limitations defense, the government has the 

24 burden of proving that the crime was committed within 

the limitations period. This Court said that in

1 Grunewald. It did not offer any explanation for that, 

2 but we have accepted that as our burden. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it then -- I mean, 

4 why would Grunewald be right, that you do have the 

burden if, in fact, this isn't an element? 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: I think, just because it 

7 is an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government 

8 by Congress in Section 3282. I think -- I think a 

9 reason one could think that it makes sense is that the 

government already has to prove all the things that it 

11 needs to prove, to prove that the crime actually 

12 happened. 

13  And generally, in proving that a crime 

14 actually happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you also 

prove when the crime actually happened. And so it 

16 doesn't really add very much to what the government's 

17 burden already is in proving the crime. 

18  But that sort of leads me into sort of the 

19 policy reasons for not allocating a burden of persuasion 

to the government as to the issue of withdrawal. And 

21 there are sort of four big reasons why Congress wouldn't 

22 have understood the burden to be -- for policy 

23 reasons -- wouldn't have understood the burden to be on 

24 a defendant as to the issue of withdrawal.

 The first is that the defendant will almost 

52

15

20

25

Official 

1 always be in a better position to have the information 

2 about whether he withdrew, except in cases where he 

3 withdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in 

4 which case, it's hard to imagine he's going to be 

indicted for -- for the indictment past that period,
 

6 except in those cases, he will know what he said in
 

7 secret to his co-conspirators.
 

8  Second, the government will often be
 

9 prevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an
 

assertion of withdrawal because it can't make a 

11 defendant testify, and it often won't be able to make 

12 his co-conspirators testify. 

13  Third, a defendant doesn't have to give any 

14 advanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal 

defense, and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's --

16 the government's ability to procure any other evidence 

17 it may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of 

18 withdrawal. 

19  And, fourth, Petitioner's role would 

encourage spurious assertions of withdrawal because it 

21 has -- it could have the effect of essentially making 

22 the government prove something extra. It already has to 

23 prove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the 

24 conspiracy existed in the limitations period.

 But under the government's -- under the 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 Petitioner's role -- excuse me -- the government would 

2 also have to prove that the defendant essentially took 

3 some other act to show his membership or somehow 

4 re-agreed to the conspiracy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that last 

6 point seems to me spurious itself because, to prove 

7 withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in 

8 the conspiracy in the first place. So if he doesn't 

9 have a good withdrawal defense, it's unlikely that he 

would raise it because it would cost him any argument he 

11 has against participation in a conspiracy in the first 

12 place. 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: But in cases where -- such 

14 as this, where a defendant goes through a period of 

inaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this 

16 Court said in Hyde is not enough to withdraw, then there 

17 would be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of 

18 withdrawal because it would require the government to 

19 sort of -- to rebut that by proving that the defendant 

had done something within that period, which it doesn't 

21 have to prove in order to establish liability. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose he could present 

23 his defense in the alternative, I didn't belong to the 

24 conspiracy, and anyway, I withdrew. I mean, he can make 

both of those points, can't he?

1  MS. HARRINGTON: He certainly can. I think 

2 there's a good deal of risk in that for a defendant. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean, 

4 that works in a civil case. But, I mean, in a criminal 

case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my 

6 first argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous 

7 conspiracy that's been going on. 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: That --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or then I wasn't a 

part of it after that. 

11  That's a little different in a criminal 

12 context. 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: It's true. And the theory 

14 of defense in this case was, in fact, that there were 

many separate conspiracies, not that any particular 

16 person had withdrawn, and it only came up, as my friend 

17 pointed out, because the jury asked a question about it. 

18  If I can just sort of wrap up on a -- on a 

19 broader note? A defendant does not become liable for a 

criminal conspiracy casually. As the jury was charged 

21 in this case, the government has to prove that every 

22 defendant was aware of the existence of the conspiracy, 

23 that every defendant understood that it had an illegal 

24 objective, and that every defendant willingly agreed to 

participate in the conspiracy with the aim -- aim of 

55

1 advancing that illegal objective. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have 

3 to prove that every defendant did? 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: That every defendant 

willingly joined the conspiracy, yes, with the 

6 understanding that they were advancing some illegal 

7 objective, the objective of the conspiracy. Now, that's 

8 a high evidentiary --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me -- so you 

charge ten people as participating in this conspiracy, 

11 and the jury determines that one wasn't, then 

12 everybody's off the hook? 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: No, no, no. No. I'm 

14 sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't have to 

16 prove --

17  MS. HARRINGTON: To prove liability for each 

18 person, you have to prove that that person --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. HARRINGTON: -- satisfied all these 

21 things. I'm sorry --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to treat 

23 them as individuals.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is what your 

2 friend is trying to argue for in this case? 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But that is -- this 

4 is high evidentiary burden that the government has to 

bear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative 

6 action to get into the conspiracy. And once the -- once 

7 the government proves that a defendant was a member of 

8 the conspiracy, then it's on the defendant to prove --

9 to take some affirmative action to get himself out of 

the conspiracy. 

11  And it only makes sense to require him to 

12 prove that he took that act, instead of requiring the 

13 government to prove negative that he didn't take that 

14 act in every case.

 If there are no further questions? 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this -- the burden 

17 allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic 

18 question? I mean, you pointed out that you had ample 

19 evidence to show that he remained a member of the 

conspiracy. 

21  So does the allocation of burden of 

22 persuasion to the defendant versus proof of production 

23 to the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it 

24 really make much difference? Does it have much 

practical consequence?

4 participation within the limitations period. It can 

make a difference in some other cases -- you know, I 

6 think, as a practical matter, most criminal conspiracies 

7 that are charged in the Federal system involve activity 

8 that was more recent than some of the activity that was 

9 involved in this case.

 But it certainly can come up, and -- you 

11 know, if we didn't have the type of evidence that we did 

12 about this particular defendant's behavior in prison, 

13 then it would have been hard to rebut his assertion of 

14 withdrawal caused by his incarceration. So it 

definitely can come up. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you say 

17 it wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're 

18 basically saying you had some good evidence. But a jury 

19 could have always decided against you, right?

21 have, right. It could have decided against us on the 

22 whole thing, but --

2  MS. HARRINGTON: Okay. I -- yeah. I didn't 

3 mean to be brazen about it. We think we had good 

4 evidence that the Petitioner continued in the conspiracy 

in this case.

9  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

11  MR. KRAMER: Thank you. 

12  I would just like to start with one quick 

13 point. My friend said that the government would never 

14 rest on its laurels, but that's precisely what they did 

in this case. It was 12 days into jury deliberation 

16 when they said, go ahead and instruct the jury on 

17 withdrawal, so they rested on the evidence that had been 

18 presented in the trial. So that's precisely what they 

19 did.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's because they 

21 thought that you had the burden. And it -- it does 

22 strike me that, if you are right that this is an 

23 element -- membership in the conspiracy at a particular 

24 time -- and the government has the burden, this idea 

that the government could -- you know, just sort of say,

1 well, we don't have any evidence, but we think you 

2 should presume that we're right, I mean, that's -- the 

3 government couldn't do that if you are right. 

4  MR. KRAMER: The -- the government could 

just rest on whatever they had presented originally and 

6 tell the jury that's plenty to prove beyond -- to meet 

7 our burden of proof. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you make an 

9 assertion, and they don't really respond to the 

assertion and -- you win. 

11  MR. KRAMER: It -- I mean, it happens all 

12 the time. The defendants say, I didn't do it, and the 

13 government presents their evidence and say, that defense 

14 is nonsense, we presented overwhelming evidence.

 In fact, in this case, also they did -- they 

16 didn't ask for the instruction because they thought it 

17 was our burden. They agreed, in the end, that the jury 

18 should be instructed --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: I think the crux of your 

argument is that the government is going to have to 

21 prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation 

22 in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations 

23 period because it is impossible for the prosecution to 

24 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day, during a 

five-year period, did the defendant withdraw from the

1 conspiracy. 

2  It simply can't be done. This person was 

3 under 24-hour video surveillance for the whole five-year 

4 period.

 MR. KRAMER: All they have to prove, 

6 Justice Alito, is that the person was a member of the 

7 conspiracy within the limitations period. That could be 

8 done by the inference that they were a member outside 

9 the limitations period and say that there was just 

insufficient -- that the --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: And say what? That there 

12 was insufficient evidence to prove --

13  MR. KRAMER: No. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: -- the opposite of what they 

have to prove? 

16  MR. KRAMER: No, that they -- insufficient 

17 evidence doesn't create a reasonable doubt in what they 

18 are required to prove, which is membership within the 

19 limitations period.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you argue that 

21 every day, that there is -- that something has to be 

22 proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution 

23 hasn't provided sufficient evidence? 

24  MR. KRAMER: It is. And the prosecution 

stands up and says, we presented plenty of evidence

1 that -- that there is no reasonable doubt here at all. 

2 And that happens every day, needless to say, that people 

3 are convicted by that argument when --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kramer, if they 

really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 

6 there is membership in the conspiracy during the 

7 limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say, 

8 well, there's membership in the conspiracy before the 

9 limitations period, and, you know, you should assume 

that it continued. 

11  I mean that's not a 

12 beyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it? 

13  MR. KRAMER: They get a permissive 

14 inference. And there are many cases when I think that 

would be proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a jury, 

16 absent some conflicting evidence presented by the 

17 defendant, more than just a proffer. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Couldn't you argue they have 

19 the burden of proving that the defendant did not 

withdraw during this five-year period? They have the 

21 burden of proving that. And did you hear any evidence 

22 from them that -- did you hear evidence disproving 

23 that -- that he didn't withdraw during that period? 

24 There is no evidence on that.

 MR. KRAMER: Of course --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: You can make that argument? 

2  MR. KRAMER: Yes. Or did we prove -- did 

3 you hear any evidence -- that there was no evidence that 

4 Mr. Smith was a member during the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Your -- I'm sorry. The 

6 Thomas Crown Affair again, all the evidence shows he 

7 took $10,000 from the bank. He testifies and says, oh, 

8 I was going to give it back, okay?  The prosecution puts 

9 on nothing. The jury says, are you kidding?

 MR. KRAMER: Right. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

12  MR. KRAMER: I mean, and that happens every 

13 day, I think, in cases where the prosecution just stands 

14 up and says, you heard that evidence, nobody would think 

that is a reasonable doubt, that someone was not a 

16 member. 

17  Thank you very much. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

19  The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
