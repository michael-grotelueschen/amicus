 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 07-772, Waddington v. Sarausad.

 Mr. Collins.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case comes before the Court under the 

deferential standard of review of the Antiterrorism and 

Effective Death Penalty Act. The Ninth Circuit decision 

should be reversed because the Washington court's 

adjudication of this matter was not objectively 

unreasonable. The Washington court concluded that the 

instruction at issue properly informed the jury of the 

elements of accomplice liability, and the prosecutor's 

argument informed the jury that it could only convict 

Sarausad if he acted with knowledge he was facilitating 

the commission of a homicide.

 The court also concluded that the trial 

judge did not abuse his discretion in directing the jury 

to reread the relevant instructions instead of giving 

the supplemental instruction proposed by Sarausad. The 

decision below was not an unreasonable application of

clearly established Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you think it was 

right?

 MR. COLLINS: I do think it was right, Your 

Honor, but I also believe that it was not objectively 

unreasonable, which is the standard before this Court. 

Turning to the PRP court's adjudication, the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: First, is there some 

constitutional minimum? Let's assume direct review. Is 

there some constitutional minimum requirement for 

scienter with reference to an accomplice?

 MR. COLLINS: I believe there is, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is it?

 MR. COLLINS: You have to have knowledge 

that you're facilitating -- you have to act and you have 

to have knowledge, both those two points.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the same -- is 

that the same as purpose?

 MR. COLLINS: I think it is, Your Honor. I 

think the model -- I think the Model Penal Code refers 

-- uses the term "purpose" as opposed to "knowledge," 

but I don't think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you don't take 

the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law

conforms to the Model Penal Code? I thought the Model 

Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're 

stating.

 MR. COLLINS: I believe that's correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're -- would --

would you say that the trial court in Washington states 

law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have 

to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the 

crime?

 MR. COLLINS: I believe that you would have 

to have -- you have to knowingly facilitate the crime, 

Your Honor. That's the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you agree there is a 

difference in "knowing" and "purpose"?

 MR. COLLINS: I'm not sure there is much of 

a difference, Your Honor. Frankly, I haven't thought 

about that question, but I think you have to have that 

mental component. You have to either have purpose or 

you have to do it with knowledge.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is 

knowledge of what. And I thought it is now recognized 

that in this State you have to know not just that a 

crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential 

for a homicide.

MR. COLLINS: That's right, Justice 

Ginsburg. You have to know -- you have to act with 

knowledge that you are facilitating a homicide.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why just a homicide? What 

was -- what was the indictment here? What was he tried 

for?

 MR. COLLINS: First degree -- a number of 

counts, Your Honor. First degree murder, second degree 

murder, attempted first degree murder, first degree 

assault with a deadly weapon, because there was one 

death and two people were shot -- wounded and then there 

was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't assault with a 

deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you 

have to know that it was first degree murder or second 

degree murder? I don't know how you get from the text 

of the Washington statute that all you have to know is 

that it was a homicide?

 MR. COLLINS: Because the statute refers to 

"the crime," so you have to have knowledge that you're 

facilitating a homicide, but you don't have to have 

shared --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but he wasn't 

prosecuted for homicide. I mean, the crimes are much 

more specific --

MR. COLLINS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- first degree murder, 

second degree murder.

 MR. COLLINS: In Washington, you have to 

have knowledge of the general crime that is homicide, 

but you don't have to have the same knowledge as to 

principle; therefore, you don't have to have knowledge 

of premediation. You just have to have knowledge that 

you're going to commit the general -- the general crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that appear from 

the statute? If I read the statute, I would have 

thought that you have to have knowledge that he was --

would negligent homicide suffice?

 MR. COLLINS: You could be convicted of 

manslaughter as an accomplice if you had knowledge of a 

homicide. You have to have general knowledge of the 

crime.

 Let me give you another example. In the 

Davis case, for example, this was a robbery case, and 

the defendants agreed to do a robbery, but the person 

who went into the store had a gun. The accomplice 

didn't know that he had a gun, but still he was 

convicted of armed robbery because he had a general 

knowledge that robbery was going to be committed. On 

the other hand, if the principal had shot the store

owner, the defendant would not be an accomplice to 

murder if his only knowledge was that he was 

facilitating the crime of robbery.

 So you have to have knowledge that you're 

facilitating the general crime charged. In this case 

crimes charged were various kinds of homicides, first 

degree murder, attempted murder. And in this case, the 

record is very clear that the prosecutor argued that 

Mr. Sarausad acted with knowledge that he was 

facilitating a homicide. Therefore, the PRP court's 

adjudication of that point is not objectively 

unreasonable under the AEDPA standard.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is -- the 

prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just 

filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a 

crime, that was sufficient. I don't find that what 

you've said is an accurate description of the charge --

MR. COLLINS: Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of the prosecutor's 

summation.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the prosecutor 

continually talked about the fact that they were going 

there for the shooting. For example, in the -- the 

joint appendix, the brown brief on page 123, the 

prosecutor tells the jury when they rode down to Ballard

High School the last time, "I say they knew what they 

were up to. Fists didn't work. Pushing didn't work. 

Shouting insults didn't work. Shooting was going to 

work. In for a dime, in for a dollar."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't the problem 

on your side of the case that there was another "in for 

a dime, in for a dollar" argument and that was the 

hypothetical holding the hands behind the back while 

some third party slugged the victim? And on that 

hypothetical, there was no reference to a definite 

crime. In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and 

under that hypothetical, there was no reference to the 

crime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the 

prosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went 

both ways.

 MR. COLLINS: I disagree, Your Honor. When 

the prosecutor used the hypothetical, and in fact on 

page 123 that I just quoted you, the prosecutor talks 

about, in fact uses that dime for a dollar hypothetical, 

and then immediately tells the jury that Mr. Sarausad 

acted with knowledge that there was going to be a 

homicide. They went --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, in that case. But 

there was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do 

that.

MR. COLLINS: I'm sorry. Are you talking 

about a different case, a case other than this, Justice 

Souter?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I did -- maybe I dreamed 

this. I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for 

a dollar example the example of the individual, the 

accomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third 

party slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim. 

And I thought in that hypothetical argument the 

prosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice 

was an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't 

know at the time the assault started that homicide was 

intended or would result.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's toward the bottom of 

page 123. And I have the same, I have the same, just 

tieing onto Justice Souter's question, on the same 

subject. It seems to me that that hypothetical is not 

necessarily correct.

 MR. COLLINS: The court, the PRP Court of 

Appeals said that that hypothetical is problematic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the 

statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed, 

in for a dime, in for a dollar? The law in the State of 

Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a

dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and 

you're helping in some fashion to bring about this 

crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion. And 

that was tied in to the person who thought he was 

assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim 

got killed.

 MR. COLLINS: Justice Ginsburg, the 

hypothetical may be problematic, but you have to 

consider --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the 

statement I just read, that the law of the State is you 

don't even have to be there if you're helping in some 

fashion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? Is that in 

the charge to the jury?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It's in the same 

paragraph, the paragraph with the example of the 

accomplice who is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not in the court's 

charges.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. This is in the 

summation.

 MR. COLLINS: Justice Ginsburg, the 

prosecutor's argument responds to the argument made by 

Sarausad's counsel that you had to have shared intent,

that Mr. Sarausad had to have the same intent as the 

principal. They do use the hypothetical about holding 

the arms, but as soon as they finish the hypothetical 

the court -- the prosecutor identifies what happened 

here, which is that the intention was to facilitate a 

homicide, and you have to take the argument as a whole 

just looking at the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you take the 

argument as a whole you've got at best an ambiguous 

argument. You've got an argument that points to a "the 

crime" interpretation and you've got an argument part of 

which points to an "any crime" interpretation, and to 

the extent that your case may ultimately turn on the 

significance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to 

me that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, of course, Your Honor, 

in this case my argument doesn't have to turn on that. 

The question is whether this is an unreasonable 

application and looking at the whole argument that the 

prosecutor made, whenever the prosecutor used "dime for 

a dollar" or that hypothetical, the prosecutor tied that 

to shooting. Mr. Sarausad was going to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I'm beating a dead 

horse, but it seems to me that what we've brought in our 

questions from the bench is that that is not correct.

In one instance the prosecutor clearly tied it to 

shooting. If that's all we had before us we wouldn't 

have an argument. But in the other iteration of the 

dime-dollar argument, the prosecutor didn't tie it to 

shooting.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I believe the 

prosecutor always tied it to shooting, and moreover 

that's the way the defense counsel argued the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you help me with this? 

Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a 

technical matter, an important but technical matter, and 

when they have questions about it I say read the 

instruction. Suppose I'm right as far as the 

instruction goes. But say the prosecutor gets everybody 

mixed up. Now, I guess if the prosecutor gets people 

mixed up enough, that could becomes a due process 

violation. But I suspect that it has to be quite a lot 

of mix-up, that intuitively is what I suspect. Are 

there any cases I should look at, one that would tell me 

how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before 

it's a due process violation?

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor, Brown v. 

Payton, which involved the Factor K in how you consider 

mitigating evidence in the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In Brown, in that case did

they find that he did get them too mixed up or he 

didn't?

 MR. COLLINS: He didn't get them too mixed 

up so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He did not. So unless in 

this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up 

than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly. Particularly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the appellate 

court? I mean, the first time around the appellate 

court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the 

prosecutor.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the appellate 

court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was 

enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely 

to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the 

indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et 

cetera, just a crime. And the second time around that 

appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know 

we got it wrong because there has been an intervening 

decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it.

 But what the prosecutor said, at least as I 

read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate 

appellate court said the first time around: Said he

didn't have to know that there was going to be a 

shooting.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, the intermediate 

appellate court did get it wrong the first time around. 

But I think you have to consider the context, Your 

Honor. The legal issue before the appellate court the 

first time on accomplice liability was Mr. Sarausad's 

claim that there had to be a shared intent, that is to 

say you didn't have to know the crime. You had to have 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, the court 

itself said: We got it wrong. We said go away 

appellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be 

committed.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think you have 

to consider the context of the case. The argument that 

the court of appeals was considering on direct review 

was not the argument here. The question, the point that 

you're looking at where the court said that it was not 

necessary to prove shooting, the issue before the court 

was Mr. Sarausad's claim that he was merely present, 

that he didn't do anything. And the court of appeals 

responded by saying no, there is evidence that you may 

have known of the fight, you may have known of the 

shooting. And then in what I would characterize as an

aside, the court said the State doesn't have to prove 

shooting, but there is evidence of shooting.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- hadn't other 

Washington State courts made a similar error in their 

interpretation of the Washington statutes?

 MR. COLLINS: A few, a few court of appeals 

decisions did misstate the standard, Justice Scalia, 

that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the same -- and hadn't 

the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard 

the same way and using "In for a dime, in for a dollar" 

to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if 

you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding 

you liable for homicide?

 MR. COLLINS: Some prosecutors made that 

argument, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including this one in an 

earlier case.

 MR. COLLINS: That's right. But in Boyde 

this Court pointed out that the fact that prosecutors in 

other cases made improper arguments -- in Boyde 

prosecutors were arguing about Factor K didn't allow 

consideration of mitigation evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The only reason I raise it 

is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on

the point. It asked for further instructions three 

times on this precise point, what did -- did he have to 

know. And all the trial judge did was say read, you 

know, read my instructions, which essentially recited 

the statute. And what all of what you've just 

acknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't 

help a whole lot. It doesn't clarify. It doesn't, it 

doesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor 

could have created.

 MR. COLLINS: Justice Scalia, with respect, 

I disagree that the same question was asked three times. 

In fact, if you look at the progression of the 

questions, you can see the progress of the 

deliberations. The first question asks about intent 

with regard to the two convict instructions 11 and 12.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's look at -- where is 

that?

 MR. COLLINS: That would be at JA 131 and 

132.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the white?

 MR. COLLINS: I'm sorry. The brown joint 

appendix 131, 132. And see "Request Clarification on 

Instruction Nos. 11 and 12, Intent." Now, 11 and 12 are 

the two "convict" instructions for first degree murder 

for Mr. Recuenco and Mr. Sarausad. The next questions

that were asked -- this is on page 135 of the same 

document -- they ask about Instruction No. 17.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Let's go back 

to 131 for a minute. I thought that applied to the 

"accomplice" instruction.

 MR. COLLINS: The trial court directed the 

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's a question 

specifically applied to the defendant only for the 

defendant or his accomplice.

 MR. COLLINS: They asked about "accomplice," 

but the -- this was not a question about the meaning of 

"accomplice liability." This question is different than 

the third question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't -- your 

point is that it doesn't go to the "aiding" issue.

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, excuse me. "Intent" 

is broad enough to go to the DA issue, isn't it?

 MR. COLLINS: This question really goes to 

if you look --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to my 

question? I mean "the" and "a" are references to what 

the accomplice had in mind at the time of acting. 

That's an intent issue.

MR. COLLINS: Your Honor -- it is an intent 

question, Your Honor. But the question, if you look at 

Instruction No. 12, which is on page -- page -- on page 

9 of the brown book, this talks about the fact that in 

paragraph 2, that the defendant or his accomplice acted 

with intent to cause the death of another person. So 

the question was: Did both -- do you have to have the 

same intent as -- does the accomplice have to have the 

same intent as the principal?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe so. Let's go to 

the third question, when the jury asks: "When a person 

willingly participates in a group activity, is that 

person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in 

the group?"

 MR. COLLINS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could the jury better 

express its puzzlement? It wanted to know, if someone 

participates in a group, but did not -- that that person 

is -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?

 MR. COLLINS: And that, Justice Ginsburg --

and that's the first time that the jury asked that 

question. The trial court referred them to the 

accomplice liability instruction and the knowledge --

and the knowledge instruction and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the counsel

for the defense says, tell them no.

 MR. COLLINS: And that would have been 

wrong, Your Honor. If -- if the trial judge -- there 

are two things wrong with that -- wrong, Your Honor.

 First of all, it would not have been accurate because 

you don't know what the group activity is, and you don't 

know what the knowledge is. If the knowledge of the 

group activity was going back to the school to 

facilitate a crime --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says "a group 

activity." When a person willingly participates in "a 

group activity," is that person an accomplice to any 

crime committed by anyone in the group? I don't think 

there is any ambiguity in that question.

 MR. COLLINS: With respect, Your Honor, I 

think you have to know what the group activity is. More 

-- but the important point is: The jury got the answer 

to the question and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't get an 

answer. They were told to read an instruction that they 

had been told three times to read and obviously didn't 

understand.

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, I think in the 

Weeks case this Court has held that it's proper to tell 

a jury to reread instructions. They are not required to

give a supplemental instruction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we already know that 

many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this 

"a crime." Was it "a crime," or "any crime." Or "the 

crime"?

 So I think you can't avoid the confusing 

nature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the 

statute. It doesn't get clarified until the Washington 

Supreme Court says it means "the crime," not "a crime," 

and not "any crime."

 MR. COLLINS: Your Honor, we are not arguing 

that there couldn't be some ambiguity, but what we are 

saying is that the adjudication by the PRP court was not 

objectively unreasonable. Because when you look at the 

instructions as a whole and the argument as a whole and 

the evidence as a whole, the PRP court's decision is not 

objectively unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't the 

argument for objective unreasonableness, number one, to 

begin with, what you just stated. Of course, there is 

some ambiguity there. I'll be candid to say that if I 

were stating it myself, I would say there is more than 

some ambiguity here. It seems to be, if not misleading, 

at least incapable of informing a jury of exactly what 

the law is.

Number two, the -- the second point in the 

argument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and 

although, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a 

proper answer to a jury request for clarification to 

say, go back and read the instruction; the answer is 

there. When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury 

questions that they are just not getting it, that they 

still have perplexity, the court has got to do something 

more than just say, oh, go back and do it again.

 And number three, in this situation in which 

there is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury 

confusion. There is an argument by the prosecutor 

which, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example 

argument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively 

reasonable to say under those circumstances that there 

was an inadequate instruction to the jury in -- in the 

correct Washington law?

 MR. COLLINS: I would say no, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then what would it 

take?

 JUDGE SCALIA: You -- you know, you are 

taking on more of a burden than you have to. And you 

could say, yes, it would be reasonable to say that, but 

it would also be reasonable to say -- to say otherwise, 

right?

this case would mean that the jury was properly 

instructed and was in a position adequately to 

understand Washington law correctly? That's the --

that's the opposite position.

think you are taking on too high a burden. You don't 

have to show that the jury properly understood it. You 

don't even have to show that it's reasonable. 

You have to show the opposite -- or your friend has to 

show the opposite, that there is no way that the jury 

could have understood this correctly or applied the 

correct constitutional law. That is, if there is a way, 

then it's -- it's not objectively unreasonable.

 MR. COLLINS: That's exactly right, Chief 

Justice Roberts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that way would be the 

way we just set out, wasn't it: That the jury, if -- if 

-- if, in fact, it's objectively reasonable to conclude 

that the jury did understand Washington law correctly on 

those circumstances, then -- then the -- the Respondent 

here cannot win in -- in his collateral attack?

 MR. COLLINS: We would say he cannot win 

because the decision of the Washington court was not 

objectively unreasonable.

please the Court:

 The State is here today making what we think 

is a rather extraordinary argument. It's arguing that 

there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this 

case interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the 

same manner that the State itself urged the jury to 

interpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court 

of Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case 

and in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of 

Appeals in fact interpreted it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- but is that 

the standard? You said there is -- they are saying that 

it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard. 

They have -- you have to show that it's objectively 

unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the 

State got it correct.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Your Honor. So 

there is a constitutional violation, and then our 

burden, which we believe we can carry on the 

extraordinary record in this case, is to show that a 

court, the Washington Court of Appeals, could not have 

reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable 

likelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When I read the opinion of 

the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me

that what they are doing is providing a literal 

interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we 

have to presume the jury did when they got that 

instruction.

 Washington Court of Appeals is interpreting 

Washington law. And they may be influenced by 

Washington case law, which is what they cite. They 

don't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say 

"the crime" means "a crime". That's how we interpret 

the language of the instruction.

 So there is an overlay of Washington case 

law, principles of accomplice liability that inform this 

instruction. So I don't know that you can -- it's 

reasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted 

Washington law, they were misinterpreting the literal 

language of the jury instruction.

 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Alito, we think 

it is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court 

of Appeals decision, they start by laying out the 

statutory language of Washington accomplice liability. 

And remember, the jury instruction in this case simply 

tracks that language. That's, in fact, one of the 

State's argument.

 Now, our response to that argument is, just 

as you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court,

as the Washington court later did in this case, steps in 

and applies a gloss to that language and interprets it, 

as this Court has said many times, it's as though that 

language is written into the statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The gloss that the 

Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the 

same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in 

this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the 

state of the law was, got it right.

 MR. FISHER: Got it right insofar as 

regurgitated the language of the statute. But the 

Washington law that would apply to this case -- and I 

think there is an agreement on this, Justice Kennedy, is 

that Mr. Sarausad has to know that he was promoting or 

facilitating a homicide. That's what he has to know. 

That's theory one of the State's --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what the 

instruction said. My problem is, I guess different 

people, I understand, can read the same words and come 

to different conclusions. But I have read the 

instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times 

by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity.

 It seems to be absolutely clear. What it 

says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I 

would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a

crime. Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is 

committed by another person for which he is legally 

accountable.

 Then it says you're an accomplice -- an 

accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with 

certain knowledge when he aids another person in 

planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree 

murder.

 What is the problem?

 MR. FISHER: The problem, Your Honor, is it 

starts with this Court recognized him void. Juries are 

lay people, and they understand things in terms of 

common sense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a different 

argument. I want to know first -- in my mind in two 

different categories. Category one: Is there an 

ambiguity in this instruction? And my answer so far, 

which is what I was asking you, is zero. Why not?

 And then the second question is, could the 

prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a 

typical thing like this, that it would violate due 

process? That's why I asked the question before. And I 

said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could.

 And then the question is, did they here? 

And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked

at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in 

that case did not rise to a federal due process 

question. So, I guess -- though it's only one person --

you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse 

prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.

 MR. FISHER: Let me take your question in 

two steps, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All my questions from the 

whole case.

 MR. FISHER: Thank you. First I want to 

emphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct 

in this case in any way. The problem is --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. But what I mean by 

that is that the prosecution would have had to have 

gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using 

shorthand for that --

MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- more mixed up than they 

did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. Let me -- all I 

meant to say was the prevailing view in the State at the 

time of this trial was that any crime was sufficient, 

and so that's why the prosecutor was entitled to make 

that argument.

Let me take your question in two steps, 

first the ambiguity in the language. As the Washington 

courts themselves and as the States themselves argue at 

page 38 and 39 of the appendix of our red brief, you can 

interpret the language in the statute, when you get to 

words "the crime", to mean one of two things:

 One, it could mean as you said, Justice 

Breyer, that the particular crime the principal 

committed; or it could mean one could understand it to 

mean simply the principal's criminal conduct. And in 

Washington --

JUSTICE BREYER: In my -- it it doesn't mean 

either. It means jury you are instructed that the 

person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury 

is sitting there and they are asked the question: Is 

the person guilty of second-degree murder?

 Now they are to apply the instruction. A 

person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da, 

da. And when it gets to "the crime", it is referring to 

second-degree murder. I don't know how -- anything else 

it could be referring to.

 MR. FISHER: Well, maybe the best that I can 

do, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence 

from the State itself, from the State of Washington, and 

if you need one further thing to look at, I commend to

you the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of 

Colorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was 

language exactly like this that comes to a textual 

analysis and comes to the conclusion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're convincing me that 

different people can reach different conclusions. What 

I'd like you to say is something that would change my 

mind on my initial conclusion that there is no 

ambiguity. I think you could say something like that, 

because as you quite rightly point out, other people 

have reached other conclusions.

 MR. FISHER: Because the articles "a" and 

"the" are simply not definite enough. And you can read 

the words "the crime" to simply mean criminal conduct.

 Now, let me talk about the prosecutor's 

argument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You might be able to 

and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you 

could read it one way or you could say it another way. 

And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it 

one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court 

reads it that way.

 MR. FISHER: I think if that's all we had, 

Mr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right. So let 

me turn now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is not 

objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct 

jurors as they did? If that's all you had, then that 

would be the point.

 MR. FISHER: Right. Right. Because the 

test that this Court has repeated many times is whether 

there is a reasonable likelihood that this jury 

misapplied the instruction.

 Now, let me turn to the prosecutor's 

argument, because there was a lot of discussion about 

that in the first half an hour.

 There is two places in the joint appendix 

that you might want to pay attention to, and I think we 

might have been referring to two different places 

earlier. In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor 

makes her opening argument and says -- and uses the 

assault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their 

back. And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice 

Ginsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of 

Washington.

 And again, in direct rebuttal at page 123 of 

the joint appendix, the prosecutor again says very 

specifically -- specifically to the jury, let me talk to 

you about the accomplice liability instruction.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an objection?

MR. FISHER: There were objections both 

before and after.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The objection was based on 

the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely, 

close to the model penal code that says you have to have 

the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not 

necessarily the law in every state.

 So the defense bears some responsibility for 

not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent 

theory either.

 MR. FISHER: There were times where 

Mr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a 

little more than he was entitled to. But Mr. Reyes' 

counsel made objections directly on point, which 

Mr. Sarausad joined, and as Justice Ginsburg noted 

earlier, when the jury comes back with the third 

question that is precisely on point, it's precisely the 

question on which that whole entire case turns -- and I 

might add there would be no reason for the jury to ask 

that third question, what kind of knowledge is required 

in this case, if they had decided, as the State argues, 

that Mr. Sarausad knew a homicide was going to be 

committed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't think that 

your reading of question three is definitive. I think

it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of 

two ways. If you look at question three, the issue 

could be whether others could have had an intent, in 

other words, others in the group, not simply -- it 

doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have 

the requisite intent.

 MR. FISHER: Well, we think it's pretty 

clear, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the more important 

sentence may be the one that precedes that question, 

which is the jury tells the court, after seven days of 

deliberations: We are having difficulty agreeing on the 

legal definition and concept of accomplice.

 Now, that is the question -- and let me 

return to the prosecutor's argument --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not the 

question. There are a number of areas, and I think the 

first two questions point in the opposite direction. 

They do not say we don't know whether it's "the crime" 

or "a crime". Their questions, neither one, two or 

three focus on that.

 It's a more general question that we could 

read the opposite way. Perhaps you can read it the way 

you are, even though it doesn't say is it "the crime" or 

"a crime".

 But there again, I think it's incorrect to

say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly 

not questions one and two, I mean question three is your 

strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are 

focusing on the "the/a" issue.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the best we can 

do, because we have to make reasonable inferences from 

the record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors 

what we thought, is we have to make, as the court has 

done many times, reasonable inferences as to what they 

are doing. And I think the fairest reading of this 

record, even if it's not absolutely clear, is that the 

jury was honing in progressively on the central issue in 

this case, and that was Mr. Sarausad's mens rea.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, then, what I take is 

authoritative on that are two sentences from the 

Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other 

judges have been all over the lot. The first sentence 

it says: The trial court correctly instructed the jury 

that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they 

mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it 

found he knowingly aided in commission of "the crime" 

charged, which was second-degree murder. That's their 

interpretation, which I could understand.

 Then the second thing is, it does not offend 

the principles of accomplice liability to hold

responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely, 

conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when 

the substantial risk of death results in actual death.

 So that would seem to be hornbook law. If 

you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial 

or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you 

know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's 

the Washington view, that's it. You've had it.

 And here they go on to say that he knew 

there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was 

engaged in a drive-by shooting. And then to put every 

dot on every "I", they say a drive-by shooting does run 

a substantial risk of death. Okay.

 Now that's what I read and at that point, I 

said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best 

answer.

 MR. FISHER: Your Honor, we are not 

challenging -- or this Court does not have authorities 

the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there 

might be enough evidence in the record for the jury to 

have found that. But the question is, did the jury find 

that? And we can't know from the instructions given in 

light of the arguments made to the jury by the 

prosecutor and the jury's own questions trying to sort

found that. And so if the State wanted -- this goes 

again to the prosecutor's argument.

 There is two things that I think we might be 

conflating improperly here. There is the first question 

of what the prosecutor argued to the jury Washington law 

meant. And I suggest to you if you look at JA 38 and JA 

123, there is no doubt what the prosecutor was arguing 

to the jury Washington law meant. It meant as she said, 

"in or a dime, in for a dollar." If you hold somebody's 

arms behind their back thinking that an assault is going 

to occur and the person dies, you can be found guilty of 

murder.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No objection from defense 

counsel.

 MR. FISHER: Both before and after, Justice 

Kennedy.

 But I would add that another reason the 

defense counsel may not have interposed yet another 

objection at that instance was because that was the 

prevailing view of Washington law at the time.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this 

question about the jury's question where they say we are 

having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and 

concept of accomplice; when a person willingly 

participates in a group activity, is that person an

accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the 

group?

 Suppose that the judge had answered that 

question by saying a person who participates in group 

activity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder 

if the person acts with knowledge that his or her 

conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the 

crime of second degree murder. Would you have a case if

That would have cleared up the ambiguity in the 

JUSTICE ALITO: That's almost a direct quote 

from the instruction that was given.

 MR. FISHER: No, it's not because what you 

did is you inserted the name of the crime in there.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I put in crime of second 

degree murder rather than the crime.

 MR. FISHER: That's exactly what defendants 

even still in the State of Washington are asking courts 

to do in the --

JUSTICE ALITO: That poses a difference 

enough to make A, a constitutional violation and B, make 

it unreasonable for the Washington Court of Appeals to 

say that there was no constitutional violation?

MR. FISHER: Yes, under the particular 

circumstances in this case, because the jury expressed 

confusion. So we know the jury was confused. We know 

the only reason they would have asked that is if they 

had not found the facts the State alleges, at least at 

that point, that Mr. Sarausad knew a murder was going to 

occur, and also because we know the prosecutor argued 

the exact opposite to them. They were actually asking 

the question -- another way to put it, I think which is 

a fair characterization is, is what the prosecutor told 

us correct? That --

JUSTICE BREYER: The prosecutor, I mean I 

thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I 

think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his 

back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps --

at least might run -- I can see a person saying that 

that runs a substantial risk of death. I mean Houdini 

died that way, apparently. So maybe hitting somebody in 

the stomach does create a substantial risk of death. Do 

you know anything about -- one way or the other on that?

 MR. FISHER: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. You 

need more than that in this case. Second degree murder 

is intentional. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: They intentionally hit 

somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about --

MR. FISHER: Intentionally killing is what 

the State says.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I realize that but what the 

State supreme court holds. I think correctly, that if 

the person conscious of the risk knows that a particular 

individual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is 

responsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the 

event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes 

about. I would be amazed that a State would say the 

contrary.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your answer to Justice 

Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the 

defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of 

this case, that you must have the same scienter as the 

principal, and that's not necessarily the law.

 MR. FISHER: I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It can go on in some 

States but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I 

understand it.

 MR. FISHER: The defendant didn't have to 

have premedication, Justice Kennedy. I think the best 

answer I can give and I -- is that we agree with the 

State on this. We agree with what the State said at 

page 31 of its brief, that it had to prove that 

Mr. Sarausad knew he was aiding or facilitating a

homicide. That he knew, and it was argued to this case, 

Justice -- as it was argued to the jury, Justice Breyer, 

the defense agreed that if Mr. Sarausad knew there was a 

gun in his car, or if he knew that the fellows were 

planning on killing somebody, that he could have been 

found guilty.

 That was the very -- that was the central 

issue in this case; and when the State stands up and 

says the prosecutor argued -- didn't make -- didn't make 

a misleading argument, what they are talking about are 

the prosecutor's arguments on the facts. After telling 

the jury had is what Washington law is, the prosecutor 

argued in various ways that Mr. Sarausad knew that a 

fight was going to happen, or -- or that a gun was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Washington -- in the State 

of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones 

helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's 

leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't 

aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense 

to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick. I thought 

he'd just hit him in the leg. I mean, that -- we know 

that isn't a good defense in Washington because the 

Supreme Court of Washington tells us that.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. But I think you 

don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference 

between that and punching him in the stomach?

 MR. FISHER: Because when somebody is 

punched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief 

that the person is going to be put in grave risk of 

death. And so as I said, the issue of this case, that 

the whole entire case was about, and that the jury was 

demonstrably perplexed about, was what did Mr. Sarausad 

know.

 And when the State says, well -- the 

prosecutor argued to the jury that he knew their 

shooting was going to happen or that he knew a gun was 

in the car, if the jury had believed that they could 

have come back with a guilty verdict in 30 minutes; but 

instead they asked a series of questions culminating in 

the one after seven days of deliberation which can only 

be interpreted as suggesting that we don't believe that 

Mr. Sarausad knew that the worst was going to happen 

here, and we are struggling to figure out what kind of 

verdict we have to render in light of that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: With the jury -- was the 

jury told that the arguments of counsel are not the law, 

that I, the judge, will tell you what the law is?

 MR. FISHER: I think a standard statement to 

that effect was made. But remember two things, Justice

Alito. First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the 

jury this is what the State of Washington law requires. 

And as this Court has recognized in other cases, the 

prosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front 

of a jury. The prosecutor carries with her the 

imprimatur of the government; and so we think it's 

perfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the 

prosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at 

the very least to have created a question in their 

minds.

 And if I contrast this case with Brown 

against Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about 

that case and it is another case where the prosecutor 

made what this Court found was a misleading argument to 

the jury, there you have a very different situation. 

Not only do you have no jury questions at all coming in 

that case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was 

in fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's 

advice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown, 

where this Court said that in light of the way that case 

was actually argued, the prosecutor was really making 

more of an argument on the facts, that these arguments 

the defendant has made shouldn't really be considered 

mitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this 

Court said the jury must have taken it as a factual

argument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing 

would have been totally unnecessary.

 Now, under the -- under the facts of this 

case, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to 

emphasize that at the time this case was tried, the 

prosecutor had the better of the argument as to what 

Washington law is.

 This case is only before you because it's 

the oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's 

like it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided 

in 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the 

State brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction 

for discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and 

then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not 

having a permit is required under the statute. It's not 

enough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the 

permit that -- that no permit existed. And then this 

Court said once we know that clarification under State 

law, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury 

didn't find that element.

 Now the only difference between that case 

and this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain 

the jury didn't find the element and the prosecution 

didn't argue otherwise. Here you have enough ambiguous 

evidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the

State was trying to backfill after it has lost the case 

in the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in 

this case even though we told them they didn't have to 

find it, did go ahead and find it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But the only difference 

between that case, which I know very well, and this case 

is that in that case there was no issue about jury 

instructions.

 MR. FISHER: Well, not directly.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So what's the relevance of 

it?

 MR. FISHER: Right. So, the relevance --

JUSTICE ALITO: Has to do with the 

retroactivity whether a State can -- whether 

Pennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its 

statute, or whether what they said it meant was what it 

always had meant.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Alito and 

I know that you know that case. The -- you're right. 

So we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the 

later decision from the State Supreme Court applies 

retroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the 

court didn't need to talk about jury instructions, 

because I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore 

that deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the

no-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was 

given there, simply an instruction that was simply 

wrong.

 And here our contention is that the -- that 

the jury charge taken in light of the case was 

ambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because 

as this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many 

other cases, all you have to show is a reasonable 

likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge.

 Now we have to show an additional layer of 

unreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no 

longer on direct review, but for all the reasons that 

are apparent on the face of this record this is the 

extraordinary case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, can I just ask 

you a question? Is it your view that the question that 

is troubling the jury was whether they had to find that 

the driver of the car knew that there was a gun in the 

car.

 MR. FISHER: There's two ways to think about 

it. Yes, that could be one way to think about it. The 

other way that they might have been thinking about it 

was whether he knew that a murder was going to happen 

and that a killing was going to happen.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Assume proof of the gun in

the car was enough to prove --

MR. FISHER: That's the way the case was 

presented to the jury.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It wouldn't -- and that's 

what presumably may have taken a lot of time 

deliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Stevens. 

The defendant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And in one theory it makes 

a difference; in another theory it doesn't.

 MR. FISHER: Precisely. And the defense 

counsel -- the defense counsel admitted in argument that 

if you find he knew there was a gun in the car, then we 

lose. And, remember, the jury earlier -- we've talk 

about the three jury questions about what the law meant. 

Remember the jury earlier asked to have Mr. Sarausad's 

testimony reread back to them. So, again, every 

indication is you have a jury really trying very, very 

hard to do their job.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, AEDPA of 

course requires that this be an unreasonable application 

of clearly established Federal law. What is the clearly 

established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?

 MR. FISHER: It's the rule that is stated --

again, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we

agree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that 

the jury applied instructions so as to violate the 

Constitution, then that violates due process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's 

articulated at a fairly general level.

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Yarborough, we've 

said that the more general the rule, the more leeway 

courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case 

determination. So you have a very general rule, and to 

find an unreasonable application, the court has broad 

leeway because it is a general rule. And you've already 

said that the instruction does not establish 

unreasonable application.

 Given that, isn't it pertinent, although 

people have objected -- you've objected to the idea 

that, well, all they did was send them back with the 

instruction. So they sent them back with something that 

you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly. So 

why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway 

the State court has because this is a general rule, why 

isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable 

objective? Yes.

 MR. FISHER: The State would have a better 

argument if nothing else had happened in this trial

other than simply the jury had been given that 

instruction, but our point is, and then this Court 

recognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton, 

that the prosecutor's arguments do matter. They are to 

be considered in the calculus. And this Court said in 

Estelle that instructions cannot be considered in 

isolation. They have to be considered in the totality 

of the way the case was tried.

 And so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the 

reason why the State cannot show that the State court of 

appeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just 

the instruction that had perplexed the State and 

Washington courts over the years; it's the fact that the 

prosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong 

interpretation of the instruction and that the jury came 

back and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to 

think about the case this way: After seven days of 

deliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a 

little bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair 

statement is that after seven days of deliberation, the 

jury was telling the court at a minimum there's a 

reasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice 

liability in this case and that we are going to find 

that as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and 

willingly participated in gang activity, that that's

enough to hold him liable for accomplice murder. And 

that's what the State had argued alternatively, Your 

Honor.

 So after seven days, there's no guesswork 

that's even required. We know the jury was confused and 

going down the wrong path. And so the only way the 

State can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to 

read the same charge that it been told to read three 

previous times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so 

dramatically that it reduced its confusion below the 

50/50 level. Now that's what this Court said in Brown 

against Payton. The reasonable likelihood test is below 

50/50.

 So we think if you were the Washington Court 

of Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask 

yourselves the question you have to decide in this case. 

If you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this 

record, would it be reasonable for you to say that this 

jury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the 

accomplice liability instruction in this case?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've already said 

that the instruction doesn't get you there. And I just 

heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we 

can dispute what the jury was asking. So it's hard for 

me to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness

if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if 

you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know 

that they were reflecting the confusion you have here. 

So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?

 MR. FISHER: Well, we have all three, but I 

don't want to give away too much. I think it is fair to 

say that the jury's third question is perfectly clear. 

I hedged a minute to be frank so that I could 

acknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and 

get my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that 

the third jury question makes it clear that the jury is 

confused. But we have -- again, unlike Brown against 

Payton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this 

amazing constellation of all these mutually --

JUSTICE BREYER: This argument -- I'm 

beginning to get your argument. The statement is -- the 

prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found 

guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to 

occur. You're saying that's absolutely wrong. There's 

no support for that in the record. In fact what the 

prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting 

didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang 

activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so 

wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that 

habeas was right. Is that the argument?

MR. FISHER: That's a fair characterization, 

Justice Breyer. If you look at the hypothetical that 

the State gives the jury as to what Washington law 

means, it is clear that's the argument they're making. 

On the facts they made alternative arguments.

 MR. FISHER: Thank you very much.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I want to just focus for a moment on the 

third question because Respondent focuses on that. To 

begin with, you have to understand what was going on in 

this trial. There was deliberation for seven-plus days 

but it was a 10-day trial, I mean the jury heard 

testimony for 10 days. There were three defendants 

being tried together. Each defendant was being tried on 

five counts. It was a complicated trial. The fact that 

the deliberations took seven days is not extraordinary 

at all.

 Mr. Sarausad assumes that the third question 

is directed at him. I suggest -- of course we don't 

know what was going on in the jury room, but I suggest

as likely an explanation is that question went to 

Mr. Reyes because Mr. Reyes was not driving, was sitting 

in the back seat. The question is, if you're just 

sitting in the back seat when your gang is going to do 

an activity, are you guilty? And they were told to 

reread the instruction. They did reread the 

instruction, and they deliberated. So the third 

question came on the seventh day of deliberation. After 

they got the answer to reread the instruction, they 

deliberated about 45 minutes. They took a break for the 

night. They came back, deliberated about another hour 

and a half, and then they pronounced their verdict, 

convicted Mr. Ronquillo of first degree murder, 

Mr. Sarausad of second degree murder. They hung on 

Mr. Reyes.

 It seems to me that the third question does 

not -- is not some kind of a smoking gun. When you look 

at the trial --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They didn't say anything 

at all about Mr. Reyes. They asked the question about 

an accomplice, a crime.

 MR. COLLINS: Exactly right, Justice 

Ginsburg, but Mr. Sarausad assumes that that's a 

question about him. We suggest it's just as likely that 

it's a question about Mr. Reyes.

JUSTICE BREYER: But what he's saying, I 

think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose 

the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he 

didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but 

that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had 

given the jury the impression that they could convict 

this person even if the person did not know there was 

going to be a drive-by shooting.

 And he's saying that the finding to the 

contrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme 

Court of Washington is wrong. When I look at that, I 

will find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the 

impression, as I just said, that even without a gun your 

involvement with this gang is enough to convict him of 

murder. What is your response to that? You know the 

record. I don't.

 MR. COLLINS: My response, Your Honor, is 

you will not find that when you look through the record. 

The prosecutor -- and the PRP court stated the 

prosecutor never argued that if the only knowledge was 

some kind of a fight, that you could convict him, 

because the defendants in this case testified that they 

were going to go fight. And you never had the 

prosecutor saying: This is an easy case; I win. The 

defendants have all testified that they were going to go

fight. In for a dime, in for a dollar. If they were 

going to go fight, they're guilty. Never argued that.

 You will not find that in the transcript or 

in the materials, Justice Breyer. What you will find is 

the prosecutor consistently arguing they knew they were 

going to facilitate a homicide, a shooting, a murder. 

And given that this is a case brought under AEDPA and 

the question is whether the PRP court's decision is an 

unreasonable application of Federal law, I don't think 

there's any doubt that it's not an unreasonable 

application, and, therefore, this Court should reverse 

the Ninth Circuit.

 If there are no more questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

above entitled matter was submitted.)
