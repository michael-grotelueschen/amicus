3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 10-879, Kurns v. Railroad 

Friction Products Corporation. 

6  Mr. Frederick. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

11  Congress enacted the Locomotive Inspection 

12 Act to ensure the safety of locomotives in use on 

13 railroad lines, not to regulate hazards to mechanics 

14 conducting repairs of locomotives.

 The doctrine of implied --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what do you -- what 

17 do you make of the ICC in 1916, in the Tiller case, 

18 regulating the lights that railroads had to have, 

19 locomotives had to have in the yard, and that those 

lights had to differ when the railroad was in use? 

21  MR. FREDERICK: That was actually I think 

22 pursuant to the Safety Appliance Act, Justice Sotomayor, 

23 if I'm not -- if I'm not mistaken. And the principle 

24 behind the safety in use regulation that this Court 

construed in Napier was to ensure that locomotives were 

3

Official 

1 safe for fit use on the line. And that was the 

2 consistent construction both in the ICC's statement that 

3 it made in 1922 and in this Court's post-Napier --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I 

understand. It prescribed different lights when the --

6 when the locomotive was in the yard. 

7  MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That had nothing to do 

9 with safety in use. It had to do with safety in repair.

 MR. FREDERICK: Our position is that it was 

11 not pursuant to the Locomotive Inspection Act that the 

12 ICC promulgated that rule. As the Court has said in 

13 numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect 

14 to different aspects of the train at different points in 

time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to 

16 address a very specific problem, which was boilers 

17 exploding on the line when the train was in operation. 

18 And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and 

19 subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has 

construed the Act. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me our 

22 reasoning in the Ray case. 

23  MR. FREDERICK: I'm sorry. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Distinguish for me the 

difference in the Ray case, that had to do with

1 navigation and where we held that the agency, in 

2 ensuring safety in navigation, controlled design 

3 completely, whether in repair or not. So, how do we --

4 why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, of course in Ray you 

6 addressed the Port and Tanker Safety Act, as well as the 

7 Port and Waterway Safety Act. And in the United States 

8 v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in 

9 terms of design in a statute that also specifically 

included the word "repair and maintenance," which is 

11 absent here. 

12  But what the Court was getting at in Ray was 

13 to ensure that States were not using their law to 

14 interfere with the design of equipment. Of course, that 

was for --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the argument 

17 here, which is --

18  MR. FREDERICK: No. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- once you regulate 

what -- what the design or use of asbestos is, you're 

21 interfering with what available components there are for 

22 locomotives. 

23  MR. FREDERICK: If I could make two points 

24 about that, Justice Sotomayor. That's not actually 

correct. The first is anything that the Court might

Official 

1 think about design does not impair our failure-to-

2 warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design 

3 of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its 

4 safe use. But to the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you're giving up all 

6 of your other claims? 

7  MR. FREDERICK: No. My second argument is 

8 that the design claim here involves repair work or 

9 problems uniquely; it does not include or intrude on the 

fitness for service standard that this Court announced 

11 in Napier or that has consistently been applied. The 

12 asbestos harms that the repair workers here faced are 

13 unique to the repair process, where they are scraping 

14 off the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, counsel, 

16 looking at Napier, the power that Justice Brandeis said 

17 was conferred in that case was to specify the sort of 

18 equipment to be used on locomotives, right? 

19  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this is 

21 equipment that was used in locomotives. 

22  MR. FREDERICK: Yes, but, Mr. Chief Justice, 

23 it also says on page 612 that the power delegated by 

24 Congress is to determine fitness for service. So, the 

words about the --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's the 

2 same -- that's the same thing, I'll give you that, 

3 fitness for service. 

4  MR. FREDERICK: No, it's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say 

6 something that's going to cause harm while it's actually 

7 being used. 

8  MR. FREDERICK: But, Mr. Chief Justice, the 

9 principle here is to ensure that the locomotives, when 

they are outside the repair yard and are on the 

11 locomotive -- on the railroad line, are -- are safe to 

12 operate. That standard in Napier had --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it 

14 depend -- you want to know if this equipment is safe to 

operate, right? To be used, whether -- whether it's 

16 going to be used. If you have a --

17  MR. FREDERICK: Not to be broken down. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have a boiler 

19 that's going to be used, that's within the power that 

was confirmed. It's not merely to inspect as, again, 

21 Justice Brandeis said. 

22  MR. FREDERICK: But the point here is that 

23 it is not to be broken down. And the locomotive repair 

24 workers here face unique hazards in repairing 

locomotives whose safety standards are to ensure that

1 they work properly on the railroad line, not when 

2 they're being taken apart and repaired. That they --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess your 

4 argument isn't limited to being taken apart. Your 

argument does depend on the fact that the asbestos 

6 doesn't come out during use; right? 

7  MR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct. 

8 That's why this is --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do we know 

that --

11  MR. FREDERICK: -- a unique hazard faced by 

12 the repair workers. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but if there's 

14 an accident or something, does the asbestos come out 

during the use of the locomotive? 

16  MR. FREDERICK: If it did, it would be 

17 covered under the Locomotive Inspection Act safety 

18 standard, and that would be covered by Federal law. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would say once 

there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's 

21 no longer in use. I suppose that's what you'd say. 

22  MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's unrealistic, but 

24 that's what you'd say.

 MR. FREDERICK: No. Well, it's governed by 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 a different statute, which is found at 49 U.S.C. 303. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the old 

3 insurance cases we've had, that, you know, when the car, 

4 you know, slams into a pole or something, it's not being 

used as a car anymore; and, therefore, the insurance 

6 doesn't cover it. 

7  MR. FREDERICK: Well, if I could finish my 

8 answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 there's a specific statute on that point, and it 

predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided 

11 that when there was a crippled locomotive, the railroad 

12 did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the 

13 crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it 

14 specifically said if a worker was injured during that 

process, the railroad would face liability. 

16  Our point here is that the Locomotive 

17 Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly 

18 because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively 

19 legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a 

conflict pre-emption regime in which if a State had a 

21 rule in place, that rule would be permitted to survive 

22 unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued 

23 a regulation. And there has never been a regulation on 

24 asbestos.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm concerned about I 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 think is the same thing that the Chief Justice 

2 mentioned, the particular language in Napier. And 

3 whatever -- however this might come out today if Napier 

4 were decided again, it did come out the way it did. And 

Justice Brandeis did write it, and it's been the law a 

6 long time. 

7  And the argument is made in Napier that this 

8 particular State regulation is aimed at preventing 

9 sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, 

and, therefore, it's not pre-empted. And the answer to 

11 that was not sickness and disease are an object of the 

12 statute, too. The answer was the Federal and the State 

13 statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment 

14 of locomotives; and, therefore, it is pre-empted.

 Now, how could we come out in your favor 

16 without overturning what seems to be that key sentence 

17 in Napier? That is the problem that's bothering me. 

18  MR. FREDERICK: Well, first, I would urge 

19 you not to read Napier like a statute, although Justice 

Brandeis is obviously --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. Okay. That's a --

22 the problem with (a) is that it's been followed and 

23 followed and followed and followed, and really read for 

24 all its worth, and so forth. So -- so one question is, 

to what extent can I go back and revise that sentence? 

10

25

Official 

1 That's (a). Okay? What's (b)? 

2  MR. FREDERICK: (B) is that he was 

3 addressing himself to fitness for service standards on 

4 the line, the Wisconsin and Georgia statutes at issue 

there purporting to regulate what the locomotive could 

6 do while it was in operation on the line. That's not 

7 what the claims in this case entail. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Not -- now, is there any 

9 way that you could win your case -- reasonably, in a 

reasonable way, not some far-out way -- but you win your 

11 case on this, and it does not affect the manufacturers' 

12 way of dealing with their equipment? 

13  MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: What is that?

 MR. FREDERICK: First is if you accept our 

16 proposition that warning claims are valid negligence 

17 claims. The warning claims are not -- do not affect the 

18 equipment, how it is made at all. It's simply how do 

19 you use the equipment safely.

 Secondly, the design claims here go to the 

21 unique hazards faced by repair workers. You could use 

22 asbestos, under our theory of the case, on the 

23 locomotive in exactly the same way that the locomotive 

24 equipment manufacturers have done, so long as there's a 

safer way to take the asbestos off the locomotive in the

1 repair yard. 

2  That is a distinct kind of design claim that 

3 doesn't go to the safe operation of the locomotive; it 

4 goes to what hazards are created when a repair worker is 

doing maintenance work on it. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I 

7 understand this. Are you talking about wearing a 

8 particular hazard suit? 

9  MR. FREDERICK: That would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about 

11 blowing out air? Are you talking about changing the 

12 design so the asbestos comes off without the dust cloud 

13 that's generally created? 

14  MR. FREDERICK: Both. The dust cloud is 

something that can be warned against and protected 

16 against with protective gear that has nothing to do with 

17 the design of a locomotive. There are, and there is 

18 evidence that there are, safer and were safer ways -- I 

19 remind you that asbestos isn't used on locomotives 

anymore, so this is part of an historical debate here --

21 but in ways that could be removed that would not create 

22 the cloud dust. That's the essence of the design defect 

23 claim. And the LIA and the FRA do not regulate in the 

24 repair shop. So, there's a complete gap here in 

terms --

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I 

2 understand you. Is -- if the Secretary tomorrow decided 

3 to issue a regulation saying railroads should no longer 

4 use these asbestos-containing brakes because of the 

hazards in the repair shop, do you think the Secretary 

6 could not do that under the statute? 

7  MR. FREDERICK: No. Absolutely --

8 absolutely can do that under the Federal Rail Safety 

9 Act, which, again, empowers the Secretary.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the Secretary cannot do 

11 that under LIA? Is that the idea? 

12  MR. FREDERICK: It -- it very well could 

13 because it's a fitness for service standard. But it 

14 always -- and if you look at its regulations, in parts 

229 and part 230 of 49 C.F.R., it always issues these 

16 regulations under both authorities because the FRSA 

17 expanded it. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay, then I'm a little bit 

19 lost. If the Secretary can issue such a regulation 

under LIA, L-I-A, then isn't it in the scope of 

21 regulation, and then isn't it also in the scope of 

22 what's pre-empted? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: It would have to do so under 

24 the B&O Railroad case in the early 1930s -- there was 

another Justice Brandeis opinion -- in which it would

Official 

1 have to make a finding that to make that regulation that 

2 you posit, Justice Kagan, was necessary to avoid 

3 unnecessary peril to life or limb. In that case, the 

4 Court struck down the ICC's attempt to issue a 

regulation on a particular type of equipment because the 

6 ICC could not make that demonstration. 

7  So, in the current world, the FRA would 

8 regulate under the FRSA; it would not regulate under the 

9 LIA because under this Court's jurisprudence it is a 

harder standard to meet to implement a regulatory 

11 standard. That's our point. 

12  The regulatory field here does not need to 

13 be read as expansively as the other side posits, because 

14 the FRA has all the authority it needs under the FRSA if 

it chooses to promulgate those rules, and it has not 

16 chosen to promulgate those rules. The FRA can use 

17 conflict pre-emption to displace any State rule, but 

18 what they are seeking to do is to take the doctrine of 

19 implied field pre-emption, gain immunity from State law 

liability, and not be subject to any Federal rules. And 

21 it's that proposition that is an extraordinary 

22 proposition of implied field pre-emption. We found no 

23 case from this Court that goes that far. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, could 

you -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker 

14

25

Official 

1 here? The railroad worker ordinarily has the FELA 

2 claim, but the FELA claim in this case was dismissed. 

3 So, can you tell us what recourse -- if you lose, what 

4 recovery can this plaintiff get? And also explain to me 

why the FELA claim was dismissed.
 

6  MR. FREDERICK: If we lose this case,
 

7 Justice Ginsburg, the decedent's family gets nothing,
 

8 takes nothing, because the FELA claim was rendered
 

9 summary judgment on the finding that there was no
 

negligence by the railroad. The only claim that the 

11 decedent's family has here is a third-party claim 

12 against the manufacturer for failing to warn or design 

13 defect on the basis of State law. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: You just -- you just said 

that, which I think you certainly have the right to 

16 bring a claim, don't you, to say the repair shop doesn't 

17 have adequate warnings. And if -- if that's -- if the 

18 railroad's at fault in that, or the manufacturers or the 

19 owner of the repair shop, everybody who ever puts the 

asbestos in there is negligent in not putting up 

21 adequate warnings. 

22  What's wrong with that? 

23  MR. FREDERICK: Well, here -- ordinarily, 

24 you'd bring a failure-to-warn claim directly against the 

manufacturer for not putting in the manual or stamping

 MR. FREDERICK: It's both. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: There's something I'm not 

12 seeing. 

13  MR. FREDERICK: No. It's -- it's both.

17 safe use of their equipment.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may

25

Official 

1 it please the Court: 

2  I think it's helpful in this case to try to 

3 separate out the field pre-emption issues from the 

4 conflict pre-emption issues. In the Government's view, 

the only issue properly presented in this case is 

6 whether Petitioners' tort claims fall within the field 

7 pre-empted by the LIA, and our view is that they do not 

8 because they arise from injuries that occurred when the 

9 locomotive was not in use.

 Now, Respondent would have the Court expand 

11 the field that's pre-empted by the LIA to include any 

12 claim that has anything to do with locomotive equipment, 

13 regardless of whether the equipment or the locomotive 

14 was in use at the time injury occurred.

 But it doesn't make sense to --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that one of 

17 the purposes of the legislation, which everybody 

18 understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be 

19 able to construct their engines without having to worry 

about a variety of different State requirements? 

21 Railroading is a national transportation industry, and 

22 whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this 

23 way, it's going to be okay. 

24  MS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it won't 

17

Official 

1 be okay because, although every State may have -- every 

2 State's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when 

3 the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have 

4 different requirements with respect to what the design 

has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's
 

6 being repaired. I think that truly frustrates the
 

7 purpose of the Act.
 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: I completely agree with
 

9 what you're saying. And -- and I'm sorry if you
 

missed -- if we didn't state our position clearly in our 

11 brief. Our view is that those kinds of requirements --

12 requirements that go to the design, construction, or 

13 materials on a locomotive that will be used, if those 

14 requirements are directed at the repair shop, then they 

would be conflict pre-empted. 

16  But they wouldn't fall within the field 

17 that's governed by LIA because the LIA's substantive 

18 standard of care only applies to locomotives that are in 

19 use.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not -- I'm not 

21 concerned about conflict pre-emption. I'm not concerned 

22 about State requirements that conflict with the Federal. 

23 I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict 

24 with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to 

all 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here,

1 which says your engine is safe if you do this. And 

2 you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume 

3 that. 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: No, I'm sorry. And let me 

clarify. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify. In 

6 our view, what the conflict is, is not a conflict with a 

7 Federal rule saying you have to use this piece of 

8 equipment and you can't use that piece of equipment. 

9 The conflict is with one of the purposes of the LIA, 

which is that the Federal Government be the only 

11 regulator of equipment that will be used on a 

12 locomotive. 

13  And so, what that means is if -- if the 

14 Federal Government hasn't spoken as to whether piece of 

equipment A can be used on a locomotive, that means that 

16 it can be, that the manufacturers know that it's okay. 

17 And if you have a State rule that would have the effect 

18 of dictating the equipment that can be used on a 

19 locomotive, that would conflict with the single 

regulator objective of the LIA. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's the difference 

22 then? How do you do it? How do you -- how do you --

23 what is it you're thinking of that the manufacturer's 

24 going to have to do in respect to his locomotive in 

order to comply with the State law about warning that is

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think it depends on 

4 what the warning claim is.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, give me an example. 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, under the -- under 

7 the Respondents' -- under the Respondents' view of the 

8 field that's pre-empted, a State could not regulate the 

9 disposal of equipment that's removed from a locomotive 

during their repair process, even though --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Does that have anything to 

12 do with this case, the removal, never further -- no 

13 further use of a bit of a locomotive? 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: No. But also --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay. Let's get to 

16 this case. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Also, in Respondents' view 

18 a State could not regulate workplace hazards, such as by 

19 requiring that workers wear goggles or masks.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I didn't know anybody 

21 denied that, that the State could regulate the repair 

22 shop, indeed require what warnings they wish, indeed 

23 require what equipment workers have to have. I thought 

24 we're only talking about those rules of State law that 

would affect what the manufacturer has to put by way of

2  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, but when you're --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: And that's what I'm having 

4 trouble thinking of one that would only affect repair 

shops and repairs, but -- maybe there's some kind of 

6 equipment that you could stick on the front of it, and 

7 it is a hook or something -- and it holds something, and 

8 before it goes back on the line, you take it off and put 

9 it in a locker. And -- but, you know, the more I 

thought along those lines, I thought I'm getting into 

11 outer space. This isn't reality. So --

12  MS. HARRINGTON: No. I think you could --

13 I'm sorry. I think you could imagine a world where a 

14 State says when a locomotive comes into a repair shop, 

the railroad or the repair shop has to attach a certain 

16 kind of clamp on the wheels, a certain kind of brake, 

17 that makes sure that the locomotive won't move while 

18 it's in the repair shop. And when you're done repairing 

19 the locomotive, you take them off, and the locomotive 

goes back --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, does that 

22 have more than theoretical value in this case? 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think in this case 

24 the claims that we say would not be conflict pre-empted 

or within the field are claims -- are the

1 failure-to-warn claims. Now, how a manufacturer 

2 actually issues the warning that would be required I 

3 think is a question that could be worked out as the case 

4 proceeds.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the manufacturer is 

6 really not controlling the repair shop, of what value is 

7 this failure-to-warn claim? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, I think it 

9 depends how the warning is issued. You could require 

that the manufacturer tell the purchaser of the products 

11 to pass the warning along, to post warnings in a repair 

12 shop. You know, there --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- they can't 

14 control whether they do or don't.

 MS. HARRINGTON: They could require it 

16 contractually through the sale of the products. I think 

17 those sorts of detailed issues would be things that 

18 would be worked out on remand in this case. 

19  Again, in our view, the only question 

squarely presented in this case is the field pre-emption 

21 question. And --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, on that question, Ms. 

23 Harrington, I'm still confused about the scope of your 

24 regulatory authority and whether you think you have the 

capacity to issue rules that are meant to protect repair

1 workers on railway equipment. So, can you issue a rule 

2 under the LIA that says no asbestos-containing brakes 

3 because we're afraid that these brakes injure the -- the 

4 guys in the roundhouse.

 MS. HARRINGTON: No. The LIA -- the 

6 standard of care under the LIA only goes to whether a 

7 locomotive is safe for use, and that is also the limit 

8 of the FRA's regulatory authority. This Court, in the 

9 United States v. B&O, addressed that issue. The ICC at 

the time had issued a regulation requiring a certain 

11 kind of reverse gear instead of a different kind of 

12 reverse gear. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what 

14 self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that "safe 

for use" does not include safe for use when it's being 

16 repaired. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Because the statute says 

18 safe for use on -- safe for use on the line. It's safe 

19 for use on lines of interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But this does seem a very 

21 limiting construction. Napier seems to have a broader 

22 construction, and if I read some of your history right, 

23 you've taken a broader understanding of your regulatory 

24 authority in the past. So, why this narrow view?

 MS. SMITH: I'm not aware that we've taken a

1 broader view of our regulatory authority under the LIA. 

2 In Napier, again, what's important to remember is that 

3 the State statutes at issue applied only to locomotives 

4 that were in use. And so, I think it's hard to take any 

-- any broad statements that were made in Napier and 

6 read them as applying outside that context. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if you're 

8 talking about -- I bet there are a lot of things on 

9 railroad cars that you can fix in the shop or you can 

fix while it's under way, right? We're not always 

11 talking about brakes. So, let's suppose there's one of 

12 those things. You get to the shop and the guy says: 

13 Boy, you got to fix this. And they said: Well, the 

14 train's leaving, and we're going to go in 10 hours. And 

he says: Okay, I can fix it during the -- while it's in 

16 use. Is that covered or not? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again the LIA only 

18 applies to the locomotives. So, if the thing that's 

19 broken that you could fix while it's in use would not 

make the locomotive unsafe to use, then it would not be 

21 a violation of the statute to use it while --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the line you've 

23 been talking about between the repair shop and the 

24 locomotive on the tracks, that's not really the line at 

all.

Official 

1  MS. HARRINGTON: The line is in use versus 

2 not in use. And that tends to match --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well, 

4 then what's the answer to my question? This is 

something you can fix in either place. It's covered 

6 while it's -- if you fix it while the train is under 

7 way, but it's not covered if you wait until it's in the 

8 shop? 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, if it's -- if the 

fact that it's broken makes the locomotive unsafe to 

11 use, then the railroad cannot use it, cannot repair it 

12 while it's in use. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, then it's not 

14 whether it's in use or in the shop. It's whether it is 

something that affects whether the locomotive can go, 

16 whether it's --

17  MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But here the 

18 injuries occur when the locomotive is not in use because 

19 it's in the repair shop. And in those situations, the 

LIA's substantive heightened duty of care doesn't even 

21 apply. And so, it doesn't make sense to think of those 

22 claims as being within the field that's pre-empted by 

23 the LIA because they're not governed by the LIA. Now, 

24 those claims might bump up against the LIA in a 

different way by conflicting again with the --

difference -- you make a distinction between field 

6 pre-emption and conflict pre-emption. Does that have 

7 any practical significance at all in this case, because 

8 I thought you agreed that the design defect claim would 

9 be barred?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we agree that they 

11 might be barred. I think, you know, this case comes to 

12 the Court without any real development of the 

13 plaintiffs' claim. All we have is what they stated in 

14 their complaint. Their complaint incorporates a master 

complaint which applies to all sorts of different kinds 

16 of plaintiffs. And so, I think it's really hard to 

17 understand exactly what their claims are, what the 

18 effect of their claims would be with respect to the 

19 design defect claims. And so, in our view, they would 

-- the design defect claims would be pre-empted if they 

21 would have the effect of dictating the character of 

22 equipment that could be on a locomotive while it was in 

23 use.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. HACKER 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

4  MR. HACKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

6  The LIA as construed by this Court in 

7 Napier, in particular in the passage quoted by Justice 

8 Breyer, delegates to the DOT the exclusive authority to 

9 determine the design and the materials of locomotive 

equipment. Petitioners, however, argue that States in 

11 fact may dictate locomotive design and materials so long 

12 as they do so for some purpose other than safety of use 

13 on the line. 

14  But, again, in the passage Justice Breyer 

pointed out, Napier holds that LIA pre-emption is not 

16 about the purpose of locomotive equipment regulation and 

17 is not about the geographic location of the locomotive 

18 on or off the line when the regulation is enforced. As 

19 Justice Sotomayor pointed out in the earlier argument 

this morning, regulatory power is broader than purpose. 

21 As Napier says, under the LIA, pre-emption is about the 

22 locomotive equipment itself, what Napier referred to as 

23 the physical elements of the locomotive. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hacker, could you 

explain to me -- I wasn't sure reading your brief

1 whether you agree or disagree with the Government's 

2 point that the agency cannot, under the LIA, issue the 

3 kind of rule that I suggested just, you know, saying no 

4 asbestos-containing brakes because of the danger that 

those brakes pose to the repairmen. 

6  MR. HACKER: I -- frankly, I would have 

7 thought it possible. I would have to defer to the -- to 

8 the DOT's view. It seems to me it would have been 

9 within DOT's power under the LIA to say a locomotive is 

not safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired. 

11 Because there's no point in having a locomotive ready to 

12 go on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line 

13 with a problem it's going to injure those who work with 

14 it. But we don't need to assert that position to defend 

the proposition we have now --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is that? If they 

17 are right as to the scope of their authority -- and 

18 maybe they're not right, but if they are right about the 

19 scope of their authority, why doesn't it follow that 

these claims would not be field pre-empted; might be 

21 conflict pre-empted but would not be field pre-empted 

22 because we're no longer in the field? 

23  MR. HACKER: Because the field is not --

24 it's not about the repair shop versus not the repair 

shop. The field is the physical elements of the

1 locomotive itself. What States cannot do -- what DOT
 

2 has exclusive authority over is the design, the
 

3 materials, and the construction of the locomotive.
 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: But only the design,
 

materials, and constructions for use. If you make that 

6 concession, it's only those aspects of design, 

7 materials, and construction that pertain to use. And if 

8 you take the position that use includes only use on the 

9 line and not use when it's being repaired in the repair 

shop, I think you're in trouble. 

11  MR. HACKER: I think we're not, Your Honor, 

12 because the design doesn't change between the line and 

13 the repair shop. And that's the key. If a State comes 

14 in and says --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's design for use. 

16  MR. HACKER: I understand, but --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the 

18 word "design"; I'm talking about "design for use." 

19  MR. HACKER: But the statute -- the reason 

the statute gives power to the DOT is to ensure that 

21 locomotives are safe for use on the line. But in order 

22 to accomplish that objective, the power they have is 

23 plenary over the design itself. They -- only one entity 

24 gets to decide what the design is, and that's DOT. A 

State can't come in and say --

railroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10 

6 locomotives in this division because I will be using two 

7 of them every week in the repair shop to repair them, 

8 right? I don't know why that isn't use, but you 

9 don't -- you don't seem to agree with that.

 MR. HACKER: Well, I don't necessarily 

11 disagree. We would certainly accept that proposition. 

12 We're just saying you don't have to go there. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I know it's use on 

14 the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an 

obvious extension of the line. Everybody knows that 

16 it's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month 

17 in the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the 

18 use. 

19  MR. HACKER: We don't disagree with that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would their law be 

21 pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad 

22 knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since 

23 it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has 

24 to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker 

safety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the

1 railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents 

2 to be given to the workers which explain the risks and 

3 how they can overcome them. 

4  Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump 

under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does 

6 the Act pre-empt those? It doesn't affect design of the 

7 railroad, nor does it affect the use. Neither. 

8  MR. HACKER: I would say two points, Your 

9 Honor. First of all, it does affect the design because 

a way to comply with that regulation is to use something 

11 other than asbestos, to change the design. It's the 

12 State saying, because you're using this design, you can 

13 only use it lawfully in this State if you do the 

14 following two or three things.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was 

16 not the nature of the notice claim. The design is 

17 whatever it is. But the manufacturer has to issue 

18 warnings so that the worker can protect himself against 

19 that hazard. So, I thought that the defective design --

yes, I understand your argument. You would have one 

21 standard for on the line and another when it's in the 

22 repair shop. But this is not telling them to change the 

23 design in any respect. It just says: Asbestos -- you 

24 could take these measures to protect yourself.

 MR. HACKER: At common law, a design -- a

1 failure-to-warn claim was a type of design defect claim. 

2 It was a way of saying you can't use that design 

3 lawfully unless you have the following type of warning. 

4 If you -- you can't assume away the design aspect of it 

because it still turns on -- it's a State conditioning 

6 the design. 

7  The LIA and the FRSA and SCAA and OSHA all 

8 together solved this problem by -- and FELA, solved this 

9 problem by saying it is the repair shop's responsibility 

to ensure the safety of workers. We are not, to be 

11 absolutely clear -- Ms. Harrington was incorrect when 

12 she said: We don't believe that repair shop -- States 

13 have the power to impose workplace conditions to protect 

14 employee safety in the repair shop. They do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But -- no, no, no. That 

16 argument would prevent States doing what they can do 

17 lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because 

18 with any given repair, with many of them, you could say, 

19 well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the 

locomotive design, for example. It carries beds with it 

21 so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate 

22 sleep. I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument 

23 that it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could 

24 comply with it by changing design, I don't think.

6 here's the conditions under which you can use this 

7 design, sell this design, distribute the design and 

8 these materials lawfully within the State --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: What would apply to the 

repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, 

11 I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the 

12 manufacturer that although the engine he has 

13 manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the 

14 Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: 

Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have 

16 to give you warning. 

17  I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what --

18 that that's what the statute means as applied, at least 

19 to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.

 MR. HACKER: Well, we agree with that, but 

21 we also think it applies with respect to manufacturers' 

22 liability in the repair shop for the reason I said 

23 earlier. The locomotive doesn't change. So, when it's 

24 certified as safe for use on line, it can't be -- and

JUSTICE BREYER: No, what they're saying 

6 is --

7  MR. HACKER: -- because this will make it 

8 safe in the repair shop. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: What they're saying is 

because when you open up the box, something no one does 

11 on line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we 

12 are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that 

13 tells workers about those risks. And, indeed, if there 

14 is a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of 

it. But why should that kind of thing fall within the 

16 scope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of 

17 course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't? 

18 It refers to a sign. You're not going to change the 

19 equipment.

 MR. HACKER: Well, for the reason I said 

21 earlier, Your Honor, which is, you don't know in 

22 advance. If you say, in theory, a State can adopt a 

23 warning requirement specific to a design otherwise 

24 approved by the DOT, you don't know in advance whether

18 that their employees have a safe work environment. If 

19 they're -- if a worker is exposed to asbestos --

 MR. HACKER: We don't have a problem with 

6 that position. We don't have -- we don't have a --

8 in use in the repair shop to establish that the 

9 pre-emption described by Justice Brandeis in Napier 

controls, because the pre-emption he was describing 

11 was -- the regulatory authority was over the equipment 

12 itself which is the same exact equipment. A railroad --

13 a locomotive designed a particular way doesn't change

fit for service.

18 different State regulations for the kind of gloves and 

19 things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's 

running the train on the track. And if that's so, it

1 regulation isn't about repairing. The DOT may well have 

2 authority -- they seem to think not -- over repairs 

3 under the LIA, but what the LIA is about is the design 

4 and the materials themselves. And States can't say for 

themselves what a better or more preferable or -- a 

6 locomotive design is for any other reason. The 

7 Respondents' brief and reply brief on page 5 makes an 

8 interesting point. They think they've proved their case 

9 when they say the LIA doesn't for example permit the DOT 

to impose a U.S. steel requirement, a domestic content 

11 requirement, on locomotives. The implication would be, 

12 of course, that a State could because it's outside the 

13 field as Petitioners define it, that a State could say 

14 locomotives can only be used within our State if they're 

made of U.S. steel. 

16  I don't think that makes any sense at all. 

17 It can't possibly be right, and the reason it's not 

18 right is that it misunderstands pre-emption under the 

19 LIA as described by Napier. Of course, it's within the 

general authority of the DOT to determine that a 

21 locomotive should be made with U.S. steel, but that 

22 authority can be abused. It might be arbitrary and 

23 capricious; it's not permissible for them to do that. 

24 But the content of locomotives is exclusively within the 

jurisdiction of the DOT, and States can't decide for

2 Federal regulations is --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're 

4 not saying here you have to manufacture it a certain 

way. They're just saying if you manufacture it in a 

6 manner that we consider unsafe, you have to warn people. 

7  MR. HACKER: Well, that's part of their 

8 argument, but their main claim is the first one, which 

9 is that you are prohibited in this State from using 

asbestos. It can't happen, even though Federal 

11 regulations said you could. That's the main part of 

12 their claim. They have a secondary claim, which is 

13 failure to warn and which we submit is essentially a 

14 type of design defect claim that says if you're going to 

use asbestos, then you have to warn. 

16  And we don't even know -- as Ms. Harrington 

17 was describing, there's a lot -- there would be a lot to 

18 be determined if conflict pre-emption applies to failure 

19 to warn in a given case. That's the whole problem, Your 

Honors, is that the LIA was saying we don't want to 

21 expose manufacturers to the potential of future State 

22 court litigation. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have to reach 

24 this failure-to-warn problem in this case?

1 mean, we think it's completely caught up in the design 

2 defect issue, but the other side is -- is trying to 

3 defend by saying we have a design defect claim, but we 

4 also have a failure-to-warn claim. But we submit the 

two are bound up together. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- if I'm 

7 understanding your argument correctly, you're saying 

8 that if Napier controls the design of -- and a 

9 locomotive part, that includes any design defect that's 

encompassed by State law, whether it's design in its 

11 traditional sense or failure to warn. 

12  MR. HACKER: That's correct. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's basically what 

14 the court below said.

 MR. HACKER: That's correct, and that's what 

16 Judge Kozinski said in the Law case, and Judge Winter 

17 said in Oglesby. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just as a practical 

19 matter, I'm assuming that some railroad repair yards are 

owned by the railroad itself, so the railroad repair 

21 people are railroad employees, correct? 

22  MR. HACKER: I -- I think that's right, yes.

say. I don't know the answer for sure, but I think they 

6 probably are, but there are also repair shops that then 

7 -- that are owned by other railroads, and that's part of 

8 a problem that manufacturers have, is you don't know, 

9 when you sell the -- the locomotive to a railroad, who 

is going to be --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be --

12  MR. HACKER: -- repairing under what 

13 conditions. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just to be clear, under 

your view of the LIA, there could be other laws that 

16 pre-empt it or prohibit it? States can tell railroad 

17 yards put signs up, wear protective equipment, do 

18 whatever it is to protect the worker from this repair. 

19  MR. HACKER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They just can't tell 

21 them --

1 itself. 

2  What we would say is the State has to take 

3 the locomotive equipment as a given. It is what it is. 

4 And then if that locomotive equipment creates risks for 

workers, the employer may have to do things to account 

6 for those risks, but the equipment can't be regulated by 

7 the State. The equipment itself can't be regulated by 

8 the State in any respect. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hacker, do you think we 

would decide Napier the same way if it came to us today? 

11  MR. HACKER: I do think so, Your Honor. Of 

12 course, I don't think that matters because Napier is 

13 what it is and has been relied upon for 85 years. But I 

14 think there would be a very good argument that it would 

be decided the same way today under the Ray case that 

16 Justice Sotomayor mentioned. That was a very similar 

17 kind of delegation of regulatory authority, and the 

18 Court held that there was the same kind of field 

19 pre-emption. There are some differences one could 

discuss, but Napier is what it is, as I say. 

21  If The Court has no further questions, I'll 

22 cede the balance of my time.

Official 

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

2  MR. FREDERICK: Manufacturers clearly have 

3 the best information about the dangerous aspects of 

4 their products, and they issue warnings and instructions 

in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that 

6 persons working on their equipment are going to know the 

7 special hazards. It doesn't make sense to inoculate 

8 those manufacturers from liability where they have the 

9 best information to ensure that repair workers are not 

going to be exposed to risks. 

11  With respect to the point about being on the 

12 line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection 

13 Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also safe 

14 to operate on the railroad line. Under the 

regulations -- and this is well established -- yard 

16 limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching 

17 operations and repair operations occur, so that 

18 everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies 

19 and where it doesn't.

 And the reason why the LIA has had this kind 

21 of history with respect to repair work goes to the 

22 history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the 

23 commerce power. Up until the New Deal era, it was well 

24 settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate 

activities, which are peculiar to repair yards. And so, 

44

Official 

1 this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid 

2 1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an 

3 FELA claim because his work was not in interstate 

4 commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce. And that 

is why the ICC throughout this entire period never 

6 devoted regulations to repair yards, because this 

7 Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal 

8 regulatory activity for that. 

9  So, if you look at this case from an 

historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear 

11 that the full parameters of the way the Court would 

12 explain Napier would be the same, because its approach 

13 to field pre-emption is so different after the New Deal 

14 era than it was before the New Deal era. And that is 

also why when this Court looks at regulatory 

16 implications of common law claims, it has had no problem 

17 allowing State law to have design defect claims with 

18 respect to planes, cars, motorboats, and trucks, even 

19 though the implications of a State law claim might find 

liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing 

21 an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to 

22 that risk with respect to that interstate modality. 

23  There's no reason why you have to have a 

24 broad and expansive view of the field here because 

Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to

1 give the Federal agency pre-emptive authority when it 

2 deems that authority appropriate. And as the Federal 

3 Government says --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it knows -- it 

knows about Napier and what's been going on for 85 

6 years, and if it wants to pull back on the pre-emptive 

7 effect of the provisions interpreted in Napier, it's 

8 free to do that, too. 

9  MR. FREDERICK: It did so, though, Your 

Honor in 49 U.S.C. 20106, where it said that unless and 

11 until the Federal Government issues a regulation in a 

12 particular field, the States are allowed to have their 

13 rule be in effect. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was -- that was 

the Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive 

16 Act. The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't 

17 put that clause in it. 

18  MR. FREDERICK: But that's why, Justice 

19 Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define 

the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an 

21 historical context that we just don't live in anymore. 

22 And there's no reason to give manufacturers a complete 

23 pass from liability when they have the best information 

24 to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how 

to work on their equipment in a safe way without
