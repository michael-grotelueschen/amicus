 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-1298, General Dynamics v. 

United States, and the consolidated case, 09-1302, the 

Boeing Company v. United States.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The proposition that Petitioners are here 

challenging is the one adopted or embraced by the 

Federal Circuit that says that the United States 

Government can declare that certain of its government 

contracting partners have operated in default and, under 

those circumstances, can reach into the government 

contractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion 

of moneys that were spent by the United States, but for 

services that were rendered, without question, pursuant 

to the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the 

United States Government, and that when the contractor 

seeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in 

some kind of default conduct, that the government can 

assert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing,

deprive the contractor of the ability effectively to 

respond to the government's conclusion.

 Under those circumstances, it seems to me 

that the statement in this Court's decision in United 

States v. Reynolds, which is that the government is 

certainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege, 

but when it does so, it has to assume certain 

responsibilities that come from it, at least in the 

circumstances where the United States is the moving 

party.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, when the 

contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first 

aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their 

reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract 

price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.

 At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but 

I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all 

about superior knowledge and the government's obligation 

to share information that it hadn't shared.

 MR. PHILLIPS: There was nothing specific 

with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first time 

the contractors identified the superior knowledge 

problem arose, obviously, when the government took the 

extraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up 

until that point, obviously, the parties are attempting

project, as you would hope any contracting entities 

would, to bring the contract to a happy resolution,

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would expect them 

to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going 

forward on this contract, to at least mention it. And 

to -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, yes, I think you have 

to put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during 

this period of time, obviously, there were consistent 

efforts and requests being made to get access to both 

the B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there 

were discussions that went back and forth, and the 

district court -- or the Court of Federal Claims 

specifically held -- eventually, the information was 

forthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too 

late in order to effectively allow the contract to 

proceed as -- as planned.

 So I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in 

a perfect world, maybe you would have identified this. 

But in this situation, the parties are simply trying to 

come to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides 

to be satisfied by the final -­

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why wasn't the need 

to share that technology a part of this contract or a 

condition to the contract? I've gone through the 

contract -- or, not all of it; enough of it. I haven't 

found anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S. 

to share information with you. Does that have anything 

to do with what due process would require? Meaning -­

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to pose a 

hypothetical. Let's assume the contract required the 

sharing of state secrets, and the government then 

invokes its privilege. Is that a different case than 

this one in terms of due process? Wouldn't the -­

wouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a 

condition of the contract, require a different treatment 

than this situation where the government's just saying, 

if you want to raise a defense that's not part of the 

contract, then you do what every other litigant with a 

privilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked 

against; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's usually what 

happens with other privileges.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And we would have 

been perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we 

had. But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal 

Claims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a 

position to resolve it.

 But I want to answer your more fundamental 

question, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic 

point is, is that the background principle of law, the 

superior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the 

parties when they enter into an agreement. I mean, that 

would have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis 

case and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has 

acknowledged the superior knowledge defense. That's 

been around for a long time. It's a-- it's an 

understood basis on which the parties enter into an 

agreement. That's the first answer.

 The second answer is that you're asking us 

to put into a contract something about information that 

we don't know anything about. We -- I mean, we have 

some sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't 

know anything about the other programs that are 

identified here.

the obligation of the government to tell you build it 

this way using the technology we already have? I 

thought your claim was that you were promised this 

information, and you structured the contract based on 

that promise.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, our claim -- we have 

separate -- we have a series of distinct claims.

 Our first claim is that we never would have 

entered into the contract in the first place if the 

government had provided us with information based on its 

superior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight 

specifics that we were being asked to provide or to 

supply were literally impossible to comply with based on 

what the government already knew. If we had been just 

told that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in 

the situation where we are here -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a factual 

dispute about that. I think somewhere I read that there 

is a claim that they told you your weight estimates 

weren't right.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I mean, that may be a 

factual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to 

litigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point 

where we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of 

our particular defense. But the bottom line here is --

and again to state the proposition as starkly as it -­

as it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court 

from the Federal Circuit: They're saying that the 

government can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars 

against us and tell us that we cannot defend against 

that claim even though the reason why we were unable to 

comply with the contract is because of the fact that the 

government didn't provide us information either at the 

outset or as we went along.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The two questions I'd have 

is, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not 

-- I did have her question, because what that suggests 

is, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in 

this case. And you just read the two circuit court 

opinions here, and you think this is a defense coming 

out of long in the past that doesn't have much substance 

to it. That was her question, I think, as I understood 

it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Can I answer -­

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, it's not 

unfair. But let me give you the other question because, 

sometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that. 

And that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was 

said in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply 

it to government contracting, where sophisticated

contractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their 

own contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench 

into the gears of government contracting; we're throwing 

the whole monkey. That's my second question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't -­

JUSTICE BREYER: One, that this isn't a case 

that calls for it; and, two, the threat to government 

contracting by changing from Reynolds to here is 

overwhelming. Now, I'd like your views on both of 

those.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, it seems to me 

clearly that this is the precise situation where 

Reynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a 

legitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we 

don't know precisely what information we didn't have and 

were never entitled to. So it's very difficult to say 

how strong is our defense under these circumstances.

 What we do know is that the Court of Federal 

Claims judge looked very carefully at this and said that 

we had made an impressive showing without regard to any 

of the confidential or privileged information of a prima 

facie defense in these circumstances. So our position 

is we had a very valid defense. This is not pretextual. 

We're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to 

force the government to assert its state secrets. It's

a fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly, 

not something that I could imagine any circumstance in 

which we would do that.

 Two, I don't see how this throws a monkey 

wrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws 

out the monkey, because -- because the basic 

understanding here is that the government is not 

entitled to force its contractor down along this course. 

If the government has information available to it, then 

it has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming 

with the information with the contractor, either at the 

outset, which would have been the best of all 

circumstances here, or as matters go along.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Petitioners as a 

formal matter were the moving party; isn't that right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, "moving 

party" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept, 

Justice Alito. The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE ALITO: They were the plaintiffs. 

And the review scheme that you outlined was known to 

them beforehand. So why do we need to look beyond that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because the review 

scheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the 

Assurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was 

before this contract was entered into, the Federal

Circuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a 

complaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's 

rule.

 So our understanding at the time we entered 

into this agreement is that if there were a problem with 

the way the contracting officer operated, we would be 

allowed to file a claim and immediately take the 

contracting officer's rule off the table. Under those 

circumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to 

go back to the status quo ante in that situation, which 

means there's no contracting officer decision, there's 

no basis on which the government can make a claim for 

1.35 billion, now $3 billion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that -­

you've referred to it several times now. I thought that 

that was not a progress payment based on completed work. 

The government says that that money was advanced; you 

had not complied with what was necessary to comply with 

to get that 1.35 million. They distinguished the $1.35 

million that you legitimately received as a progress 

payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled 

what you needed to do to get that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, what had not happened 

is that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off 

by the contracting officer approving it and thereby

reducing it to a liquidated claim. But that's a vastly 

different statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have 

an argument that, at least with respect to half of that, 

that it had already effectively been approved through a 

mechanism independent of the contracting officer.

 But the bottom line here is these were 

services rendered, actually rendered. This was not some 

kind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the 

future. That's not the nature of this contract. These 

were -- this was for work we had done, for which we had 

submitted specific claims, and for which the contracting 

officer had pending before him at the time. And so, you 

know, what the government says is that -- is that it was 

a payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes 

that were the ultimate desire of the contract under 

these circumstances, and that's obviously true because 

they terminated the contract a year before the airplanes 

were due to be provided to them.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are here seeking 

to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from 

this contract what you would have gotten if it had been 

successfully completed, including any profit -­

MR. PHILLIPS: No. No, Justice Ginsburg, 

that's not true. All we are asking for is -- are the 

remedies that are fully available if you were to convert

this from a termination for default into a termination 

for convenience. And under those circumstances, what -­

you know, that -- the government has a wonderful 

mechanism there. It protects it against the kinds of 

lost profits damages that might otherwise be available 

in a situation where you have a more traditional breach 

of contract.

 So all we're -- all we're asking for is the 

actual amount of money that we expended, that the -­

frankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found, 

and at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably 

it might be litigable at some point, but that these were 

all reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to 

these -- to this particular contract.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why shouldn't we view 

this as if it were a dispute between two private 

contracting parties? And if we did that, perhaps one 

party would be the moving party with respect to some of 

the claims and the other party would be the moving party 

with respect to the remaining claims.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Alito, I think that 

is precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and 

we'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite 

clear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way 

that -- that you articulate because of -- because of the

way the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the 

government is unquestionably the moving party, the party 

seeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35 

billion -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would -- I think it's 

questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason: You say 

that it's an implied term of this contract that the 

government has a duty to share certain information, and 

you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the 

contract. So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty, 

you are the moving party. You're saying: Court, please 

enforce this implied term of the contract.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, you 

could -- that's one way to articulate it. I think the 

other way to articulate it, which -- which is much more 

consistent with the reality of what's going on here, is 

that the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion 

for which -- on the basis that we did not act in a 

timely fashion. And that's the only basis that exists 

in this litigation anymore, is just the time of the 

actions that we took.

 And our answer to that claim is to say: No, 

we -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did 

not provide us the information or you did not spare us 

the burden of having to go down this path in the first

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but then you go on to 

say: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the 

additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already 

given us -­

MR. PHILLIPS: But -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- plus this additional 

money that we've expended.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that just goes to 

Justice Alito's question about is there some way to 

evaluate those claims separately, and the answer is, 

yes, they should be evaluated separately. And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why shouldn't we? 

mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the 

government has come up with a defense that makes it 

impossible to decide who's in the right here -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why don't we just -- you 

know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be 

to leave the parties where they are. The matter can't 

be litigated. That would mean you would keep your $1.35 

billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the 

additional amount. If -- if you were that worried, you 

should have -- you -- you should have had more frequent 

progress payments or something.

 And then the question simply is, what rights

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned the 1.3 -­

that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was 

also another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on 

top of that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that -- that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that certainly 

wouldn't be leaving you where you were.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. I mean, actually, 

what -- what the $1.2 billion was, was the additional 

amounts of money that were actually expended by the 

contractors that were reasonable, allocable, and 

allowable, by and according to the Court of Federal 

Claims, on this agreement. So, there -- and it would be 

the standard operating procedure. If you have a 

termination for convenience, where the government says, 

look, we've decided we just don't want to have this -­

these -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's 

just call it off, which the government has the right to 

do, then the question is, what are the reasonable costs

of that? And the Court of Federal Claims -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the government didn't 

do that. I mean, you're making it up. The government 

didn't terminate for convenience. The government 

claimed you're in default. Why would -- why should we 

force that down the government's throat when we can no 

more say that the government's wrong than we can say 

that you're wrong?

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you call the 

game off.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the question is, if 

you call the game off, what -- what flows from that? 

And it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the 

government call it a default, I suppose, or you could 

just as easily say -- and obviously the position we 

would take is you say the government cannot call it a 

default because, in order to get some kind of a 

determination along those lines, somebody is going to 

have to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment 

of the -- of the -- of the facts of this case.

 And so, if you say it's not a default 

termination, then there's just a certain amount of --

it automatically converts at that point to a termination 

for convenience. And in a termination for convenience 

situation, then you reallocate the costs in precisely 

the way that the Court of Federal Claims has done this 

at this point.

consequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in 

the contracting context, it creates the possibility of 

debarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than 

allow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is 

the right finding to stay in place and have those

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A termination for 

convenience carries its own automatic consequences that 

appear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation 

of the default termination has been invoked because 

there is a risk to the United States. So, is there a 

reasoned way to do it -­

do this.

contracted around it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure, and so could the 

government. I mean, the reality is that the background 

principle here is United States v. Reynolds. And United 

States v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving 

party, that is the party seeking affirmative relief, 

that's the party who's going to bear the burden to -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, could I ask 

you whether that principle makes any sense in this 

contracting situation, because both parties have argued 

it as though the question of who is the moving party is 

determinative of this case, but in a contract situation 

the question of who's the moving party is very often 

arbitrary or fortuitous.

 If you think about it in a private setting, 

you have one contract -- one contractor who fails to 

perform or -- or provides some deficient product, 

another who decides it's not going to pay, and the 

question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter 

of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what the payment schedule 

has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their 

money back or simply refusing to pay it at all.

 So, why in this contract situation is the

question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving 

party -- why does -- why does that make such a 

difference?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think that 

actually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would 

have envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago, 

used the language "moving party" rather than "plaintiff" 

or "defendant" precisely for that reason, because I 

think what the Court had in mind is the party who was 

seeking affirmative relief. And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was thinking of a 

tort. It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort 

action.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, that -­

that's the specific context, although the Court's 

language is broader than that. It just didn't talk 

about itself as a defendant in a tort action.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But it can't possibly be the 

case that the question is what the payment schedule is. 

If I've paid you already and then I find your product 

deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my 

money back. If I find your product deficient before I 

pay you, then you're going to go to court and say you 

have to pay me.

 So why should that difference make a

difference with respect to the constitutional question 

before us?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because in the one 

situation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services 

that were unquestionably rendered and which, in our 

judgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the 

obligation under this contract.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Both party has a claim here. 

One says you provided deficient performance; the other 

says you were obligated to pay me. The question of who 

has the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it 

can be structured in either way.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't disagree with that, 

Justice Kagan. I think the bottom line, though, is, you 

know, what -- what -- what are -- what do principles of 

fundamental fairness tell you to do in this case?

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my problem, 

because when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold 

anything in your favor. It holds the opposite way. It 

says to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was 

unconscionable for the government both to prosecute and 

not to -- not to tell them a secret, okay? And it says 

such a rationale has no application in a civil forum 

where the government is not the moving party. It 

doesn't say anything about where the government is the

JUSTICE BREYER: And Exhibit A that it is 

not unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of 

the Federal Circuit. I mean -- now, what do you want me

that the court says and limits its ruling to where the 

government is not the moving party -- I mean, if the 

government really -- if the court -­

JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't limit it. It 

said the rationale is unconscionable. Now, I don't even 

have to go that far. I can go to "fundamentally 

unfair." All I want to know is what should I read to 

get over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of 

the two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing 

unfair? Okay?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Two basic things decide this case. First, 

the government is not affirmatively invoking the power 

of the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are. It was 

Mr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the 

Federal court and asked that court to set aside the 

decision of the contracting officer and to award them 

over a billion dollars in damages. The government, by 

contrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal 

lawsuit.

 And, second, Reynolds makes clear that the 

state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at 

most only when the party that is relying on secret 

information is trying to use the Federal court to alter 

the legal status quo. And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- we've 

gotten to this point in the dispute because you say

they're at fault; they say you're at fault. Under the 

state-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question. 

Why don't we call the whole thing off? Nobody's at 

fault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for 

convenience, and that's it.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, for several reasons. 

One is that is the affirmative use of the Federal courts 

to alter the legal status quo. I think the principle of 

Reynolds is that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, only because 

you altered the legal status quo -- the legal status quo 

is they're going along with their contract, and you 

altered it by holding them in default.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I disagree, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I think that the contract itself specifies 

that the contracting officer will decide whether or not 

there's a default termination, and once there is that, 

they owe -- once the contracting officer so decides, 

then they owe the unliquidated payments that have -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't 

that the affirmative step with the contracting officer 

saying there's a default?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's certainly an 

affirmative step under the terms of the contract, but it 

is not an affirmative step of the Federal court. Our

central proposition -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative 

step of the Federal Government. He works for you, and 

he's the one changing the status quo.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Undoubtedly the case, and 

those are the terms under the contract to which they 

agreed. Our central proposition is that in a world in 

which the Federal court doesn't know, as Justice Scalia 

said, who is right and who is wrong on a particular 

claim, it should stay its hand entirely and get out of 

the business altogether. It should follow the 

Hippocratic principle of doing no harm.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct to interpret 

what you've just said to mean that you think this case 

should be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds, 

that the party that seeks the affirmative relief -­

seeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the 

party that bears the burden involving the invocation of 

the state-secrets privilege? You're not asking us to 

adopt a new test applicable in the contracts situation?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I don't think 

we need to go there. I do think that there are special 

arguments available in this case because it is a 

contract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated 

parties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of

coming into court and -- and so on. But here I think 

this is a simple principle that, in a world in which the 

court doesn't know who is right and wrong in the 

superior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to 

the question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr. 

Phillips a moment ago about what did the Court of 

Federal Claims ultimately decide. They didn't decide 

there was a prima facie case. They said at page 245a of 

the 2001 opinion: We can't know one way or the other. 

And so -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I --

I'm interrupting Justice Alito because you answered his 

question very quickly. It's your position that if we 

determine you're the moving party, you lose?

GENERAL KATYAL: No, we -­

government is the moving party, it's an automatic loss. 

I think that's a back-up argument that we have advanced 

in our brief that I think there is no reason whatsoever 

for the Court to give its view -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about "moving 

party." I -- I don't -- I don't know that "moving 

party" means who comes into court first. I would -- I 

would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute, 

I would say the moving party is the party who is trying 

to use principles of law to change the contract, and 

that's the government here. The government -- the 

government is blowing the whistle; it is the government 

which is saying you are in default, and under the law, 

since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we 

can claim the money we've already paid you.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me the moving 

party in the -- in the context of a contract.

it's important to add to your definition "using legal 

principles in a Federal court," because that's I think 

what Reynolds is talking about. There's not some

But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic 

of the matter when applied to a contract situation such 

as this ought to be the party who is blowing the 

whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the 

one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this 

result. And then we say, well, we can't tell whether 

the law requires this result or not. That, it seems to 

me, ought to be the moment of truth.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think, 

Justice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or 

what this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of 

uncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal 

courts is getting at. I think, rather, what all of 

these decisions say together is if you don't know one 

way or another, you should return; you should wind the 

clock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was 

filed. And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted 

a right of the government to have $1.35 billion.

 Now, I understand some of you have 

suggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and 

they get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep -­

and we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion. I suggest 

there's no principled way to do that, which is what I 

think Mr. Phillips's answer -­

right of the government before the lawsuit was filed. 

It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the 

contracting officer was correct that there had been a 

default. If he was wrong about that, it was not the 

right of the government.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me read 

to you the contract to which they agreed. It's at Joint 

Appendix, page 120 to '21: "If the contract is 

terminated under the default clause, the contractor 

shall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of 

unliquidated progress payments."

 And then, what happened, as a result of that 

demand letter that we sent right after the -- after the 

termination for default, was they came to us, hat in 

hand, and said: Please don't take this money from us 

right now, our banks are going to complain, and so on. 

And so we entered into a deferment agreement -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -­

GENERAL KATYAL: -- which is at page -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Do you 

want to give the cite?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Joint Appendix page 342.

process to say that somehow the fact that we agreed to 

their deferment creates some entitlement for them to

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have this -- this 

question about due process: The components of the due 

process analysis, it seems to me, are what is 

reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's 

unconscionable. That it seems to me is just an 

extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know 

why we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the 

Federal common law of contracts. I don't know why we 

need to elevate this to a due process analysis.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I guess I would say two 

things. One is, if you look -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming that we're -- we 

apply Reynolds, which -­

GENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I think if you 

-- if you were to look to that background common law 

contract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds 

but to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think 

makes clear that, at the time they signed their 

contract, they were on notice that highly classified 

information that is the subject of -- of litigation is 

something that generally can't be litigated in the 

Federal court.

with respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily 

assume that the contract itself from highly 

sophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time. 

And so if they were concerned about this situation 

unfolding, they could have written into the contract 

that they should get certain information and that if the 

government invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would 

automatically terminate the contract's default and 

convert a default termination into a termination for 

convenience.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just restates the 

question of what -- what do you do if you apply the 

Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say, 

well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I 

think that's almost a wash.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't think it 

comes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think 

the contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to 

challenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer 

about a default termination, they have to come into 

Federal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative 

judicial relief from the Federal court, to change the 

world. We don't have to do that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I -- am I right that 

this contract did specify certain information that the 

government agreed to give the Petitioner?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. Some of 

that is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips said the 

reason they couldn't specify this information is they 

didn't know what it was.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they didn't know 

what -- it was secret information. They didn't know -­

wouldn't even know what to ask for.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I have to say, it is a very 

odd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar 

contract on the assumption that they're going to get 

some technology that they haven't even specified. I 

mean, this -- we're bidding for their research and 

development. They brought in Lockheed, who -- which had 

built low-technology -- low-observability planes -­

precisely for the reason that they said they'd have the 

technology. At Joint Appendix page 1087, you see their 

bid, their offer, and I don't think anyone held a gun to 

their back to say: Enter into this.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know whether that's 

true or not, and we're never going to know it's true, 

because you came in and blew the whistle and said: 

State-secrets privilege.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Two things. One is that 

impossibility claim was separately litigated before the 

Court of Federal Claims, along with 18 other claims of 

theirs in defense to the 1.35 billion and this rest that 

we've been talking about. They've had massive 

opportunities to litigate almost all of their 

challenges, with the one exception being the superior 

knowledge aspect of this case, and much of that has 

taken place in a highly classified environment. The 

trial has taken place in -­

 GENERAL KATYAL: And then we -- at the 

weight contracted for, we had warned them that it 

wasn't, and then later we relaxed to that weight

one way or the other.

Scalia, is: If you're not sure, as you were saying to

rule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they 

signed the contract. The CDA was on the books. They 

knew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to 

challenge the decision of the contracting officer, they 

would have to come in.

differently. You could have said we -- you know, that 

there would have to be -- that -- that if there were a 

termination for default, it would automatically change 

into a termination for convenience -­

on default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise 

question here. In their rule, if you -- if you follow 

their rule, they're asking the court to proceed 

counterfactually and say that they are entitled to not 

just the 1.35, but the 1.2 billion on top of that, as if 

they had proved their superior knowledge claim. And -­

Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we

only these two things; there's either default 

termination or termination for convenience, and nothing 

in between.

 Do you agree that that's the world that 

we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I do agree that that is -­

that's the way the contract is written. It 

distinguished between those two and distinguished 

between liquidated payments -- as to which the 

government has no right in the event of a default 

termination, and we're not seeking that -- and 

unliquidated payments, as to which the government has an 

absolute right at the moment the contracting officer

we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that 

we're not going to try to apply the contract because we 

can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong, 

it's totally irrelevant what the contract says. You 

just leave the parties where they are.

contract. And -­

GENERAL KATYAL: Well, that -- Justice 

Scalia, I don't think that the Federal court should be

Clause in a contractual situation with parties that can 

protect themselves ex ante very easily. I mean, they

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We can -- we can do it as 

a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts. And 

when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds, 

Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not --

I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really 

definable content in our law. It seems to me it's just 

a question of the burden of persuasion.

At one point, the contractor has to proceed. 

He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the 

government has to go back and forth. And if at some 

point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes 

the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's 

fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of 

contracts.

 GENERAL KATYAL: So even if you followed 

that reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a 

reason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still 

lose, because they still bear the burden of proof and 

persuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse 

that's at issue in this case.

 Now, I don't think that would be the rule, 

that that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy, 

because I think underlying Reynolds is this central 

proposition that a court shouldn't be involved, 

shouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers 

either way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So just to make sure I 

understand your argument, suppose that state secrets had 

prevented you from being able to prove your default 

claim, that you were unable to make that showing because 

of state secrets. What would happen then?

the contracting officer, but by law you can't collect on 

that judgment once they file a complaint. So you can't 

do anything until you get the court to affirm your 

default. You are asking for a legal declaration of 

being right, that they defaulted. That's -- you're the

GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, this is 

a very important question, and I think that that's the 

impression left by their briefs and it's wrong. So the 

filing of their claim -- their claim in the Court of 

Federal Claims they say vacated the contracting 

officer's decision. That's wrong under the statute; 

605(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says 

that a clause can be put into the contract to continue 

it in effect and require performance even if there's an 

appeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that 

provision exists in this very contract. So -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're going 

too fast for me, and I don't think I remember this in 

your reply brief.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it is. It's 

in a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to 

605(b). And our claim is that -- that that provision 

requires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to 

the $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says.

That is what even the deferment agreement says that 

we've entered into.

 So we're not asking, Justice Sotomayor, for 

any affirmative judicial relief at all. We don't need 

-- we want the Court, as it does in state-secret cases 

such as Tenet, to stay out entirely and say -- to deny 

an audience to this case on the merits. And if you do 

what Mr. Phillips says or if you do what Justice Scalia 

suggested, the kind of compromise option, that is 

affirmatively using the power of the Federal court, 

granting him relief on a claim that he has not proven,

have that $1.35 billion. That is what the contract 

says. That is what their own filing in September 16, 

1991, said before the Court of Federal Claims, when they 

called that $1.35 billion, quote, "money presently due 

and owing."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That assumes that the 

contracting officer's termination for default was valid. 

And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want 

to have to inquire whether it was valid. So to say "go 

away" means everybody keeps the money he has.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that seems 

to me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the 

Court to set aside the contracting officer's decision, 

which is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds. And it 

would be an odd rule, because it's basically a 

happenstance. If we had just simply insisted on our 

$1.35 billion at the moment that it was owed to us in 

February of 1991, we wouldn't even be having this 

conversation right now. The only reason we're having it 

is because we acceded to their own request to not take 

the $1.35 billion right away.

GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, I think it would be

government invokes the state-secrets privilege, any 

termination for default automatically becomes a 

termination for convenience. That's one of many.

client would ever agree to something like that?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Do I think the government 

would?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think if they 

don't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem 

with their argument, because they are saying: Read the 

contract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations 

for default and convert them all into terminations for 

convenience when the state-secrets privilege is being 

invoked. And I agree with you. I think that would be a 

very unusual contract for the government to get into.

are other ways. There's the possibility that they may 

demand extra money in exchange for greater risk. There 

may be that there may be some alternative dispute 

resolution mechanisms available. I don't know, but I 

would -- I would -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This wouldn't be a 

problem in an alternative dispute resolution because 

that's not a court?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it might depend on -­

you might have it within the military, you know, the 

equivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might 

have panels like the Helms panel. I'm not sure what the 

precise contractual arrangements would be. I do think 

that the need for this Court to be involved is a lot 

lower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds, 

because the government here is a repeat player with 

these contractors. They're not in the business, as our 

deferment agreement, I think, underscores of trying to 

willy-nilly advance the state-secrets privilege to 

undermine and take their money away.

 Indeed, I think since the 2003 Federal 

Circuit decision, there have only been a couple of 

instances, at most, in which -- that I'm aware of in 

which the government has invoked the state-secrets 

privilege in any sort of contracting action, and nothing

like this superior knowledge thing. And since 2009, the 

government, all together in civil court, has invoked the 

state-secrets privilege a whopping two times, to -- to 

my knowledge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't -- it isn't a 

big practical problem. All right. Let me ask then, I 

was -- misimpression. Would you go back to Justice 

Kennedy's question for a minute? I'm -- I -- I don't 

quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how 

you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because 

the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental 

unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this 

kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends. 

It depends on many things.

 So, would you write this as a matter of 

constitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written 

as a matter of Federal common law of contracts? 

Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior 

knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it? 

And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of 

discovery law, which is what the district judge who 

ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says, 

gee, I don't really know.

 I mean, that's how I read it. How would you 

-- would you speak about this for a minute?

GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. Justice Breyer, I 

think that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this 

contractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just 

can the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to 

other things, but also the whole notion of due process 

in contracts is odd, because the government has waived 

its sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have 

any freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim 

fundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is 

implicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't 

have that right.

 And so, the question becomes, is there some 

extra protection the courts should give here akin to the 

one in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the 

government using state-secrets information? And I think 

the answer to that is "no," because parties can work 

that out themselves ex ante.

 And so, my answer to you is -- I think it 

was option B -- to use the contract as the -- and 

contractual interpretation as the basic rule for a 

decision here. The contract itself specified -- and it 

was done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the 

shadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would 

have to be the moving party. They would have to come in 

and challenge the decision of the contracting officer --

contracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties 

could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't 

need to have rules on that, that the parties could have 

negotiated that. That's not the way the contract law 

works.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that with 

respect to this, in this -- you know, 

thousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that 

this specific set of issues could have been worked out 

in advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance. 

They knew, going in, that they bore the burden of 

walking into court, paying their attorneys, and 

everything else, to challenge the decision of the 

contracting officer. And they also knew at that moment 

the government had an undoubted right to the 

unliquidated progress payments.

 The contract they signed distinguished 

between liquidated progress payments, as to which the 

government has no right, and unliquidated payments, as 

to which default termination automatically gave that to 

the government. And the argument they're advancing here 

is, well, let's collapse those two; let's keep the $1.35 

billion, because the government hasn't given it to us 

yet.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that unliquidated? 

I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35 

unliquidated?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Because the contract 

specified two payment streams. One is the work that 

they had reviewed and understood and said -- the 

government had said this is good work, we're going to 

pay you for it; and other work which are claims that 

they have made but they haven't actually been approved 

by the government. And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't 

think that there's any sort of evidence that -- or 

certainly nothing that the courts below found that says 

that the -- that they had a right to the 

unliquidated progress payments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the other? What's 

the -- what's the other 1.25 billion -­

GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's also asking 

for?

 GENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 billion that he's 

seeking on top of -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 GENERAL KATYAL: -- keeping 1.35 billion, as 

I understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurred 

under the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion

that was in the initial contract.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, do you have the 

citation to that footnote you referred to in the -- the 

605(b)? I can find it later, but -­

GENERAL KATYAL: It's page 32, and I'd also 

refer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page 

19567, which is the page of the contract itself that 

incorporates the provision. The provision is 

FAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates 

performance and compliance with the contract even when 

there -- in the contracting officer's decision, even 

when a decision is under appeal.

 So it is not the case whatsoever that their 

filing of this claim somehow vacated the contracting 

officer's decision. The only way that will happen is if 

this Federal Court reverses the Federal Circuit -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your view is that -­

GENERAL KATYAL: -- and grants them 

affirmative -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the complaint 

did not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision 

required them to pay you -­

GENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the -- the 

unliquidated sums?

GENERAL KATYAL: That's right. At that 

moment they had to pay. They knew that, and they in 

fact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint 

Appendix 329 -- saying please don't do that. And then 

we entered into a deferment agreement, but we have an 

absolute right to that money right now regardless of 

what -- we don't need an affirmative decision from this 

Court in order to get that money. We're asking the 

Court to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic 

principle of doing no harm in a world in which the -­

the Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if you're 

right about that, the government's absolute right, could 

you withhold it from other contracts of these 

contractors?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely right. 

The -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act 

provide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have 

to actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as 

he colorfully called it, "reaching into"; we can just 

offset it against future contracts, and the Federal 

courts would be out of the business altogether about 

that 1.35 billion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get the extra 

money without having to go to court because then they'd

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to your 

question is that this case can properly be decided on 

Federal common law principles, and indeed I would ask 

the Court to apply those same -- those contract 

principles in this context to -- it's just on the Joint 

Appendix on page 209.

 General Katyal focuses on what happens when 

the contracting officer takes some action. What he 

leaves out is the following sentence: The contractor 

shall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause 

from any determination by the contracting officer.

 And while the General spends an awful lot of 

time talking about what do you do in the Article III 

context, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically 

allows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which is 

not an Article III institution. And I guarantee you

that the government would be making exactly the same 

argument if we had taken that particular route.

 It seems to me the case ought not to be 

decided on the basis of this kind of a technical 

assessment. The case ought to be decided on the basis 

of sort of where the rights are and what's the 

fundamental change and who's making the shift in one 

direction or the other.

 And if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg, 

you specifically asked the question, am I asking for all 

or nothing? No. I think there's no question you can 

come up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the 

principle that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to 

say we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold 

the -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore 

we're not going to say there's a default -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -­

MR. PHILLIPS: -- but we're not going to go 

the extra mile and say it's a termination for 

convenience. The Court can certainly do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying there 

is another way? There's a middle way?

 MR. PHILLIPS: There is a middle way. 

There's no question about it. All I was saying in 

response to Justice Scalia's question was, you know --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On what principle of 

law?

 MR. PHILLIPS: On the principle of law that 

if you don't have a contract for default, then there's 

no basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than 

that; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and 

therefore we're not going to enforce the contracting 

officer's decision, or we're not going to do anything 

more than this. We're going to leave the status quo 

ante, which means before the contracting officer 

declared that there was a default under these 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the "go away" 

principle of our jurisprudence, right?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I actually get that a lot, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, I understood 

your papers as making only a constitutional claim.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I don't read that, 

Justice Kagan. I mean, we -- we certainly have a due 

process argument in there, but embedded in there as well 

is -- are a number of references to Federal common law 

principles as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutional 

basis on which to rule in our favor.

And I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to 

be informed in -- in making its determination about how 

to interpret the contracting arrangement by the question 

of whether this is fundamentally unfair and 

unconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do 

that as a matter of Federal common law principles in 

trying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or 

not.

 At the end of the day, Your Honors, this has 

been fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the 

Court to reverse.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Phillips, General.

 The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
