 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

Whitfield against the United States and Hall against the 

United States. 

Ms. Samek.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. SAMEK: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 1956(h) for the sole 

purpose of increasing the penalties for money laundering 

conspiracies. 

Congress did not intend to abandon the overt act 

requirement from money laundering conspiracies and for 

good reason. The list of specified unlawful activities 

under 1956 is vast. 

Anytime two or more people conspire or reach an 

agreement to commit a crime that generates economic 

proceeds, invariably the discussion will lead to what 

they're going to do with the money get -- that gets 

generated, how they're going to spend the money, which is 

a potential 1957 offense, or how they're going to hide the 

money, a potential 1956 offense. The Government would 

charge these agreements as money laundering conspiracies

without there even being a single overt act to demonstrate 

that criminal intent had crystallized, that a money 

laundering conspiracy was really afoot, and that steps 

were being taken to launder money, oftentimes triggering 

substantially higher penalties for the underlying offense, 

and subverting -- subverting the overt act requirement for 

conspiracy to commit the underlying offense. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you just clarify one 

thing for me? Did they have to prove an overt act in order 

to establish venue? 

MS. SAMEK: Excuse me? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does the Government have to 

prove an overt act in order to establish venue?

 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue 

provision in 1956(h) for a money laundering conspiracies 

requires that they establish an overt act and that venue 

would lie --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, your -- you say the --

the statute requires. I'm just asking if it independently 

of the conspiracy statute -- of the -- the substantive 

statute itself, how do they establish venue. Do they have 

to prove an overt act just for the purpose of getting a 

venue established --

MS. SAMEK: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- as they do --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the only basis for 

venue? I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just 

one of the bases for venue.

 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that the venue 

provision in 1956, 1956(i), is the exclusive venue 

provision for money laundering. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but read it. What does 

it say? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are we talking about section 

1956(i)?

 MS. SAMEK: Section 1956(i) is the venue 

provision. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And doesn't it allow it to be 

brought where venue would lie if the completed money 

laundering offense that's the object of the conspiracy has 

been accomplished or anywhere an overt act was committed? 

Isn't it an either/or?

 MS. SAMEK: Yes. Our position is that when you 

read the venue --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So you don't have to read it 

as requiring venue. It's just requiring an overt act. If 

there is an overt act, then venue will lie, but it also 

will lie where the completed offense would have occurred.

 MS. SAMEK: Certainly, but where the completed 

offense occurs, there certainly would be overt acts. You

know, it's inherent in completing the money laundering 

transaction that there would be overt acts as part of 

the financial transaction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would they state it in 

the alternative if -- why would they state it in the 

alternative if the overt act were always required? That's 

the --

MS. SAMEK: I agree that it's -- it's somewhat 

confusing, Your Honor, but we would submit that the 

Government's interpretation of subclause (2) is that if 

two people conspired in -- if two people in Florida 

conspired to commit a money laundering offense in 

California, absent any overt act whatsoever, conspiracy 

would lay in California. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that doesn't respond to 

the venue question. Venue, as written in this statute and 

in most statutes, is permissive. It gives you a choice of 

forum. It doesn't limit. In -- in the times when venue 

is exclusive, Congress is explicit in telling you that, 

but ordinarily a venue provision, as this one, either/or, 

is permissive. It would be extraordinary to make a venue 

provision exclusive. 

MS. SAMEK: Well, this Court has made venue 

provisions exclusive in the patent infringement context 

and in the Banking Act precisely using the --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court has no 

authority to make a venue provision either exclusive or 

permissive. Congress decides that.

 MS. SAMEK: And our position is that Congress 

made this venue provision the exclusive venue provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I mean, one can understand 

that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may 

be brought in any -- in -- let's see -- may be brought in 

the district where venue would lie for the completed -- if 

it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act 

in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place, 

then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive 

venue or not. 

But I don't see how there is even an argument 

that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a 

provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in 

the district where the -- where venue would lie for the 

completed offense or in any other district where an act in 

furtherance took place. How can you possibly read that to 

say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in 

furtherance took place?

 MS. SAMEK: Our position is that those are the 

two alternatives for where venue would lie for a 

conspiracy case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay, but -- but then --

then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act 

took place is not the exclusive venue.

 MS. SAMEK: Our argument is that the first 

clause of that provision contemplates the existence of an 

overt act. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the rule provision 

for venue, which has not been excluded by the statute? 

The ordinary provision for venue. 

MS. SAMEK: The ordinary provision for venue 

would be that venue lies in the district where the crime 

occurs. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MS. SAMEK: That would be -- in the money 

laundering context, under our interpretation of 1956(h), 

that would be where the overt act occurs. So it would be 

consistent with it. Our --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the crime is the 

conspiracy. The overt act may be an additional 

requirement. 

MS. SAMEK: The overt act is part of -- it's our 

position that the overt act is required, and there needs 

to be an agreement --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you will -- you will 

concede that there are many Federal crimes, conspiracy 

crimes, in which an overt act is not required. The

Shabani case requires you to recognize that.

 MS. SAMEK: Correct. And in those cases where 

all that's required is an agreement, then venue would lie 

where the agreement occurs, but in this case, because the 

-- the offense requires an agreement plus an overt act, 

it's our position that that's where venue would lie.

 As a practical matter, if there is -- if -- if 

this Court construes 1956(h) as requiring overt act, as a 

practical matter, anytime two people agree to commit a 

money laundering conspiracy in one district and commit 

overt acts in another district in furtherance of that, it 

would be highly unlikely that there would not be some 

overt act in the district where they agreed to commit the 

offense. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that it 

doesn't mean very much because an overt act wouldn't be 

hard to prove. 

MS. SAMEK: As a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are -- I mean, the 

difference between statutes that say overt act is required 

and those that just say conspiracy -- there are many, many 

such statutes, and we dealt with one in Shabani. But of 

all the statutes that include no express overt act 

requirement, have any of them been read to implicitly 

include one, which is the argument you're making that we

should adopt here?

 MS. SAMEK: That's correct. And no. There --

we have not found any cases where the Court has heretofore 

read an overt act requirement into a conspiracy provision.

 But this statute is unique. The money 

laundering statute is unique. If you look at the statute 

and we lay it out -- the statute in total -- in our reply 

brief, starting at 1a -- the structure of 1956 strongly 

supports our position that all Congress was doing, when 

they enacted 1956(h), was increasing the penalty for money 

laundering conspiracies. As this Court is well aware, 

when Congress typically writes a complex statute, the 

statute begins by setting forth all of the offense 

elements. Here, that would be set forth in (a)(1), 

(a)(2), and (a)(3). The statute then goes on in 

subsection (b) to set forth the civil penalty provisions. 

Subsection (c) then defines the various terms used in the 

act. Subsection (d) then talks about relationships with 

other laws. Subsection (e) identifies those Federal 

agencies that can investigate money laundering offenses. 

Subsection (f) talks about circumstances under which there 

would be extraterritorial jurisdiction. Subsection (g) 

then talks about recording -- reporting requirements, and 

then you get to subsection (h), which we say, when you 

read the statute as a whole, clearly intends simply that

the penalty for money laundering conspiracies would be 

increased to the same penalties as those prescribed for 

the offense provision. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that there are other 

statutes that -- that read this way, which we have held to 

-- to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the 

penalty for it.

 MS. SAMEK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it -- it could do that. 

Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in 

this section shall be subject to the same penalties as 

those prescribed for the offense. And that could be 

deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the 

penalty for it.

 MS. SAMEK: It could be construed as a 

freestanding offense provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And there are other such 

provisions, aren't there?

 MS. SAMEK: There are not any other offense --

conspiracy provisions that this Court has interpreted that 

had the same structural ambiguity as 1956(h). 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Shabani comes pretty 

close, doesn't it?

 MS. SAMEK: Shabani is a separate, distinct 

statute. 846 was a separate, distinct, discrete offense

statute.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- like this it seems to me 

contains no express requirement of an overt act, and we've 

said, indeed, none is required and that at common law it 

wasn't required. 

MS. SAMEK: That's true. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So why would we read it in 

here?

 MS. SAMEK: Because text -- as this Court has 

said on multiple occasions, in order to understand what 

the words mean in a statute, you have to look at context. 

So you have to look at where the provision is placed and 

what Congress meant by that provision and look at the 

statute as a whole.

 If anyone -- if we look --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you look at this statute 

as a whole, you don't find the overt act requirement in 

it anywhere, do you? 

MS. SAMEK: You don't find the overt act 

explicitly in the statute. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that you 

described it as a long, detailed statute it seems to me 

cuts against you. 

MS. SAMEK: No, because our position is that 

placing it in subsection (h) evidences that Congress'

intent and sole focus when they enacted this was the 

purpose of increasing the penalty for money laundering. 

The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's get --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And they were making it 

unnecessary to rely on the general conspiracy statute in 

18-371 or whatever it was. 

MS. SAMEK: It's our position that they're 

incorporating the overt act requirement, the act in 

furtherance requirement, from 371 as evidenced by the 

legislative history. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's so -- if that's so, 

then why does the venue provision which you were just 

alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph 

(2), a prosecution for an offense under this section. An 

offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought 

in -- and then it says -- (2) a prosecution for an attempt 

or a conspiracy offense under this section. Not under 

section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a 

conspiracy offense under this section. 

MS. SAMEK: And it would be an offense under 

this section because certainly the jury would need to find 

that the object of the conspiracy was money laundering. 

So it would be an offense in that respect. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I think that language

really cuts very hard against you. A conspiracy offense 

under this section. It -- it is reading as though that's 

the section that defines the offense, not just the section 

that provides the penalty.

 MS. SAMEK: I can see how you would read it that 

way, Your Honor, but the offense --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only because I'm a reasonable 

man. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. SAMEK: The offense provisions set forth in 

1956 are clearly set out and enumerated in subsection 

(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).

 In 1988 -- when the statute was originally 

enacted, (a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth the offense 

provisions. When the statute was amended in 1988 and 

Congress intended to create another offense provision, 

they set forth (a)(1) -- the third sting provision which 

is (a)(1)(iii). If Congress intended to create an offense 

provision when they enacted 1956(h), they would have set 

it forth as (a)(1)(iv), or alternatively, they would have 

added or conspires to each of the predecessor offenses.

 Notably, the offense provision at issue here 

does not include attempts, which 846 did, and which the 

overwhelming majority of conspiracy subsections include --

attempts are included with offenses. The fact that

Congress did not include attempts in this provision again 

reflects the fact that they were solely focused on 371, a 

conspiracy offense, and all they were trying to do was 

increase the penalty. 

The placement of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you would expect at 

least a cross reference to 371 for defining the 

conspiracy, but there's nothing here.

 MS. SAMEK: That's true, and it clearly would --

it certainly would be clearer had they done so. But if 

you take the language originally, this provision was 

proposed by Representative Annunzio to be an amendment to 

371, and we lay out in our -- in the blue brief at page 12 

what that amendment would have looked like, virtually 

identical language to 1956(h). 

Certainly if you read it in subsection 371 -- if 

you take the identical language and put it in section 371, 

there wouldn't be much of an argument, we would submit, 

that Congress surely intended to include the overt act, 

act in furtherance language and they were just talking 

about increasing the penalty for money laundering. That 

makes our point that you look at the language, and 

depending on where it's placed in a statute, it can have 

different meanings. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have given a few examples

of a word may mean different things in different contexts, 

but you haven't given any example -- and I don't know that 

there is one -- where the entire string of words is 

identical in two statutes, both dealing with conspiracies, 

and you read an overt act requirement into one and not the 

other. I mean, you have a much harder argument to make 

when you're talking about an entire provision where the 

wording is almost identical than when you're talking about 

one word used in different contexts. 

MS. SAMEK: That's true, Your Honor, but as this 

Court said in Shabani, absent contrary indications, the 

Court will presume that Congress intends to incorporate 

the common law concept of the terms that it uses. In 

Shabani, the defendant did not argue any contrary 

indications. They argued that at common law conspiracy 

required the commission of an overt act. That is not our 

position. 

But our position is that here there are contrary 

indications, and because the statute is ambiguous based on 

the placement and structure of 1956(h), you have to look 

to see if there are other indications. And clearly in the 

legislative history --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's nothing in 

the text of the statute that's ambiguous, is there?

 MS. SAMEK: No, but that is not dispositive

Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Reading the whole text. 

MS. SAMEK: Reading the whole text of the 

statute, it looks to me it reads that the offenses are set 

off -- set forth at the beginning, followed by the civil 

penalties, then procedural aspects, including this penalty 

provision for increasing conspiracies. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: None of which mentions an 

overt act.

 MS. SAMEK: No, it doesn't mention an overt act, 

but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So I don't find anything 

ambiguous in what you describe.

 MS. SAMEK: Well, we believe that 1956(h) 

clearly reflects Congress' intent to solely increase the 

penalty. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps that's all they

thought of, but maybe they did a little more than they 

thought they were doing. 

MS. SAMEK: Well, if Congress inadvertently 

omitted the overt act requirement, this Court has on prior 

occasions read into congressional silence terms, 

definitions that Congress may have inadvertently left out. 

So in United States v. Taylor, for example, the question 

was whether or not Congress intended to revert back to the 

common law definition of burglary in the Career Criminals 

Amendment Act, and in 1984, the Career Criminals Amendment 

Act had language that talked about a generic burglary, 

breaking and entering into a dwelling. In 1986, when they 

amended the act, they removed that language. 

The question before the Court then came up what 

does -- you know, what does burglary mean. Congress had 

omitted those words, but the Court found that that wasn't 

Congress' intent. They clearly didn't intend to revert 

back to the common law, and it was probably an error of 

drafting and this Court found that generic burglary was 

the standard. So this Court has done that before.

 In the -- in the Perrin case, United States v. 

Perrin, the same thing. There -- words were missing from 

the statute and the Court did not find that in Perrin --

it was a bribery case, and what was at issue was whether 

or not the -- the statute covered bribery of private

persons or only the common law definition where it would 

only incorporate bribery of public -- public persons, 

public officials. And the Court said even though there 

are other statutes that have private person language in 

it, similar to this case, even though there are other 

statutes that have overt act requirements in it, we are 

not going to assume that Congress intended to revert back 

to the common law and interpret bribery as only applying 

to public officials. 

So this Court can look at the legislative 

history. The purpose is clear. The Government admits 

that the purpose of the act was to increase the penalty. 

Prior to 1956(h), money laundering conspiracies were 

prosecuted pursuant to 371, which required the commission 

of an overt act. Congress clearly intended to increase 

the penalty from 5 years to a potential 10 or 20 years, 

based on what the object of the conspiracy was. The 

legislative history all reflects that fact, and the 

Government admits that. 

The -- as contrasted with 846, which -- in which 

the public law described 846 in a section labeled offenses 

and provision in the money laundering context, the public 

law described 1956(h) as a penalty to increase the -- as a 

money laundering conspiracy for increasing the penalty.

make of subsection (d) of -- of this provision which says 

that violations of this section may be investigated by 

such components of the Department of Justice as the 

Attorney General may direct and by such components of the 

Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the 

Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to 

offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction, 

by the Postal Service? 

Apparently there was some turf war going on as 

to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and -- and 

this was meant to -- to solve the turf war, but it reads 

violations of this section. 

Now, does that allocation of authority among 

Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to 

the conspiracy offenses under section 371? Because that's 

not a violation of this section.

 MS. SAMEK: I'm not sure I understand your 

point. I would think that if it's a conspiracy to commit 

-- if the specified unlawful activity is one of the postal 

offenses or one of the customs offenses, both of which 

carry --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The offense is never completed. 

there's nothing -- nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and 

you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this 

section. This section sets forth the penalty -- that's

your argument -- but it does not establish the offense. 

The offense is established by 371. If that's the case, 

this allocation of responsibility among the various 

divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy 

prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.

 MS. SAMEK: It's our position that when Congress 

enacted this, they were trying to enact a penalty-

enhancing statute. 1956(h) then incorporates or impliedly 

recognizes the overt act requirement from 371. Congress 

was not intending to change the way money laundering 

conspiracies were prosecuted. They would have done so 

under 371, requiring the act in furtherance, and a jury or 

a judge would find that money laundering was the object of 

the conspiracy. That's how Congress envisioned this act 

as -- as being applied, and so I would assume Congress 

would envision that if it was a conspiracy to violate one 

of the postal offenses, that the postal authority would 

have had authority to investigate that offense.

 Interesting --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- excuse me. What 

-- what do you make of -- of this argument? Let's start 

with the premise that Congress wasn't thinking about overt 

acts at all. Start with the premise that you argue from 

that what Congress was concerned with here was primarily 

penalty. However, Congress did this in a context in which

there are two recognized kinds of statutes, two recognized 

kinds of -- of conspiracy formulations. And if one has 

the magic words in it referring to an overt act, you got 

to prove an overt act. In the other variety, there's no 

reference to overt acts, and as a general rule, you don't 

have to prove overt acts. 

Why isn't it a sensible interpretive rule to 

say, look, when there are recognized models and Congress, 

in fact, chooses one rather than another, we're not going 

to get into the question of did Congress really mean to 

make a change when it picked one model rather than the 

other? It simply picked one model, and the -- the 

clearest way to have a coherent system of conspiracy law 

is to apply the model. If it didn't talk about overt act, 

there's no overt act requirement. Why isn't that a 

sensible way to -- to work our way through these thickets?

 MS. SAMEK: I -- I think that would be a 

sensible way to work your way through thickets of statutes 

that were enacted after Shabani when this Court created 

that formulary. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But Shabani rested on -- on the 

existence of these prior models. Shabani didn't create 

them.

 MS. SAMEK: That's correct, but there is nothing 

in the legislative history to suggest that Nash and

Singer, the cases that Shabani relied on, were ever 

discussed or contemplated by Congress. If Congress was 

going to make such a fundamental change in how they were 

going to prosecute money laundering conspiracies, they 

would have said so. We're not talking about a backdrop of 

not requiring an overt act and should Congress read an 

overt act into Congress' silence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are about -- there are 

over 50, I think, in title 18 alone conspiracy provisions 

with no overt act requirement, no explicit overt act 

requirement. The -- the argument you're making, I 

suppose, would require this Court to go by -- one by one 

through those 50-odd statutes, and there would be contests 

of every one because the absence of those words is not 

dispositive, as you see it. So you would be generating a 

controversy about 50-odd statutes that would be gone, that 

just wouldn't be there if you agreed with Justice Souter's 

approach.

 MS. SAMEK: Well, we don't -- we don't believe 

that's the case because if you look at all of those 

subsections in title 18, none of them have the structural 

ambiguity that 1956(h) has, combined with a venue 

provision --

 MS. SAMEK: I've -- I've looked through the 

entire statute, and I have not found -- title 18. I have 

not found any that have both an anomaly, a structural 

anomaly, and a venue provision that turns on the existence 

of an overt act. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we've already dealt 

with venue where I think your argument is exceedingly weak 

since the statute phrases it as a permissive not a 

requirement. 

MS. SAMEK: Well, first of all, we would submit, 

just briefly on -- on the venue point, if Congress wanted 

this to be a permissive venue provision, they could have 

said venue would lie where and in the circumstances or as 

otherwise required by statute, in which case they could 

have shown that they were applying to other statutory 

bases for venue, as well as what Congress was establishing 

here. They didn't do that. 

The venue provision was enacted in response to 

this Court's decision in Cabrales, which dealt with the 

money laundering -- the substantive offense of money 

laundering, and this Court's suggestion that money 

laundering could be considered a continuing violation for

purposes of 18 U.S.C. 3237, the continuing offense venue

principle and trying to address the issue in Cabrales, 

they would have just dealt with substantive money 

laundering in the venue provision. They would not have 

also included a provision in the venue section dealing 

with conspiracy. The fact that they did and the fact that 

they used language that this Court has previously found 

to --

prosecutor more choices of where to bring suit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MARCUS: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 The money laundering conspiracy statute does not 

require proof of an overt act for three reasons. First, 

the text of the statute contains no such requirement. 

Second, the statute is modeled on the drug conspiracy

statute which this Court unanimously held in the Shabani 

case does not require proof of an overt act. Third, the 

statute was enacted against the background rule of 

statutory construction that -- that a conspiracy 

provision, whose text conditions liability on the act of 

conspiring only, will be construed to follow the common 

law, where proof of an overt act was not required for 

conviction.

 This Court should adhere to its bright line rule 

in this case because it provides clear guidance to 

Congress and to the lower courts.

 Petitioners seek to avoid application of the 

bright line rule on a variety of grounds, none of which 

has -- none of which has merit. I will address a few of 

those grounds here. 

First, the money laundering conspiracy statute, 

section 1956(h), is not a penalty provision for the 

general conspiracy statute, section 371. Section 1956(h) 

does not contain any reference to section 371, and 

petitioners are unable to cite any provision in the United 

States Code that provides a penalty for an offense defined 

elsewhere, without also referencing where that offense is 

defined. Under petitioners' theory, if section 371 were 

repealed tomorrow, section 1956(h) would also no longer be 

valid. But there is --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if 371 were repealed, 

would it affect the actual practice in the Justice 

Department? I -- I think I recall reading in the briefs 

for the other side that -- that the -- the United States 

has continued to charge conspiracies in money laundering 

cases under 371. Is that correct?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, my understanding is on -- on 

occasion that is done in a multi-object conspiracy case. 

Where there are several objects to the conspiracy 

sometimes for purpose of simplification, the Government 

will just -- will charge a 371 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But not in exclusively 

laundering cases. 

MR. MARCUS: Generally, no. There might be --

there might be an occasional example where it may have 

been an oversight where a prosecutor may have overlooked 

section 1956(h), maybe soon after 1956(h) was enacted, but 

generally speaking no. The money laundering conspiracy 

prosecutions were done under 1956(h). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when you say when there 

are multiple objects, you're not getting the money --

money laundering just under 371. You'd surely charge both 

under 371 and under -- under -- what is it? 1956.

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice Scalia. 

You could. You could prosecute -- you could prosecute

them as -- as separate offenses, but sometimes the 

Government for -- just for purpose of simplification will 

just charge one -- one agreement with multiple objects, 

and one of those objects might be a money laundering 

object. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were just money 

laundering, could you charge under 371?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes, you could charge under 371. 

There's nothing that prevents the Government from doing 

so. This Court has -- has held before, for example, in 

the Batchelder case that there can be multiple provisions 

that essentially cover the same conduct, and the 

Government has discretion to choose which one to use. 

Generally speaking, the money laundering conspiracy 

statute contains higher penalties. So the practice today 

is -- is to prosecute those offenses under section 

1956(h).

 Another -- another reading there -- another 

reason they're reading that it's a penalty provision 

should be rejected is that Congress modeled section 

1956(h) on the drug conspiracy statute that's virtually 

identically worded to section 1956(h), and no one disputes 

that the drug conspiracy statute establishes a 

freestanding criminal offense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is 846.

 MR. MARCUS: 846, yes, in title 21.

 Petitioners also argue that because prior to 

enactment of section 1956(h), the Government had to 

prosecute money laundering conspiracies for 6 years under 

section 371, that this Court should presume that Congress 

intended to perpetuate the overt act requirement of 

section 371 into the money laundering conspiracy offense.

 But this Court looks, first, to the text of the 

statute to discern Congress' intent, and had Congress 

wanted to perpetuate section 371's overt act requirement, 

it could have easily modeled the text of section 1956(h) 

on the language from 371 or on the language from any of 

the other numerous conspiracy provisions in the code that 

contained express overt act requirements. 

Congress chose a different model, the drug 

conspiracy statute, which as I said before, this Court 

held in Shabani does not contain an overt act requirement. 

By choosing that model, Congress manifested its intent not 

to require proof of an overt act because at the time it --

because at the time it acted, the background rule of 

statutory construction provided that a conspiracy statute 

that conditions liability solely on the act of conspiring 

would be construed to follow the common law. 

Petitioners point to silence in the legislative 

history, but the silence in the legislative history on the

overt act requirement is not the kind of compelling 

evidence of -- of contrary intent that would justify 

departing from the text of the statute and this Court's 

bright line rule. 

Finally, petitioners rely on a venue provision 

for money laundering cases, section 1956(i), which was 

enacted 9 years after the money laundering conspiracy 

statute at issue here. That venue provision reflects 

Congress' intent to identify a variety of districts in 

which money laundering cases can be brought. It does not 

reflect an intent to redefine the -- the elements of the 

substantive money laundering conspiracy offense. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you make of the -- the 

argument that I think occurs in the yellow brief, that --

the reference to any other district where an act in 

furtherance, et cetera, took place implies that in the 

clause preceding, they were referring to a district in 

which an act in furtherance took place?

 MR. MARCUS: Justice Souter, I think what --

what that terminology was -- was referring to was 

district. The other is meant to modify district. In 

other words, the first -- the first clause there provides 

a venue where the case can be brought. And if it's not 

brought in that -- if it doesn't fall within that venue, 

then you can bring it in -- in a different district, an

other district. I think that's the -- the best way to 

read the -- the statute. I mean, otherwise, it could have 

-- as it was pointed out during petitioners' argument, 

otherwise they could have just had one. They wouldn't 

need separate clauses. They could have just had one 

clause that said, and the case -- the conspiracy case can 

be brought in any district where an overt act was 

committed.

 Petitioners seize on the fact that the venue 

provision permits venue to be laid in any district in 

which an overt act was committed. But the rule in 

conspiracy cases has always been that an overt -- that 

venue can be laid where an overt act was committed 

regardless of whether an overt act was an element of the 

offense. At common law, as I said before, conspiracies --

a conspiracy conviction did not rely -- depend on proof of 

an overt act, and yet venue could always be laid at common 

law where an overt act was committed. 

The common law venue rule has been applied 

consistently to modern Federal conspiracy statutes, such 

as the drug conspiracy statute, which likewise does not 

require proof of an overt act as an element of the 

offense.

 Congress' codification in the money laundering 

statute of -- of this -- of this venue principle cannot be

read to presuppose an overt act element when the very 

venue rule it was codifying did not presuppose one.

 If this Court -- if this Court has no further 

questions --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I had just one other question, 

just out of curiosity, about how important this case is. 

How many prosecutions under this statute does the 

Government bring without proving an overt act?

 MR. MARCUS: I'm -- I'm not aware of -- I'm not 

aware of a number, Justice Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any?

 MR. MARCUS: I -- I don't know. I mean, it's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me quite unlikely.

 MR. MARCUS: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering. It seems 

to me sort of a tempest in a teapot, this whole case to 

me.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. I think it's true in the vast 

majority of cases, the Government does have proof of an 

overt act. And, of course, overt acts help establish the 

-- establish the agreement and -- and to convince the jury 

beyond a reasonable doubt there was an agreement. 

If the Court has no further questions --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I do have one and it's 

not on the money laundering conspiracy issue, but in this

particular case, would it be consistent with the position 

that the Solicitor General has been taking for us to hold 

the final disposition of this case pending Booker and 

Fanfan? Wasn't there a sentencing question? 

MR. MARCUS: Well, it's our position that it 

wasn't -- they didn't raise that issue in -- in the court 

of appeals. They didn't raise the Sixth Amendment issue 

in the court of appeals. They didn't raise that issue in 

their cert petition here, and so it's -- it's not covered 

by the -- by the question presented. So it is the 

position that we've -- that we've set out in the brief 

that it should not be -- it should not be held pending 

that -- that disposition in Booker and Fanfan. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's consistent with 

the position that the Government has been taking routinely 

in cases where Booker -- where the sentencing guidelines 

are an issue?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think in the -- I think 

that that position is based on petitions that have raised 

the question, I believe. 

If -- if the Court has no further questions, it 

should reaffirm the conspiracy statutes that do not 

contain an overt act requirement should not be read to 

include one. Thank you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Marcus.

 Ms. Samek, you have about 3 and a half minutes 

left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON C. SAMEK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. SAMEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:

 Justice Ginsburg, you had inquired about the 

number of subsection -- conspiracy subsections, and I 

didn't get a chance to answer your question. Even if you 

don't find the statute is unique because of the venue 

provision, as my review of the conspiracy subsections in 

title 18, there were only about two others out of the 50-

some-odd cases that have the same structural anomaly that 

1956(h) does. So this would not be opening up a can of 

worms to say that in this case an overt act clearly was 

intended by Congress and that we need to look at 

congressional intent. So it wouldn't be -- require -- a 

holding in this case consistent with congressional purpose 

would not require the Court to then have to review every 

single title 18 conspiracy subsection.

 As the Government pointed out, money laundering 

cases are not typically prosecuted without the commission 

of an overt act because overt acts are relatively simple 

to prove. There's no reason why Congress would have 

intentionally eliminated the overt act requirement from

money laundering conspiracies when, on the one hand, it's 

easy to prove, but on the other hand, it placed such a 

critical value in money laundering conspiracies because 

it's not just that it shows that criminal intent has 

crystallized and that money laundering is actually afoot, 

but you're talking about taking offenses, like we say in 

our brief, where someone pledges a -- a cow for collateral 

for a loan and then they talk with a friend about whether 

or not they should sell the cow, and they decide not to 

sell the cow. Under the Government's theory, they 

couldn't be prosecuted for defrauding the Government 

because, in fact, they never sold the cow. They couldn't 

be prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud the Government 

because they didn't commit an overt act in furtherance of 

defrauding the Government. They couldn't be convicted or 

prosecuted for money laundering because they never sold 

the cow, so there were never any proceeds to generate. 

But they could be convicted, under the Government's 

theory, of conspiracy to commit money laundering based on 

the sale of a cow and their sentence would increase from a 

potential 5 years to a potential 20 years. There's 

absolutely no indication in the Congressional Record that 

Congress ever intended such dramatic triggering of 

substantially higher penalties without the commission of 

an overt act, which is not difficult to prove.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government has said that 

-- that you have essentially waived their sentencing 

guidelines issue that you asked us in footnote 6 of your 

brief to consider. 

MS. SAMEK: In the district court, there were 

issues raised as to all defendants as far as various 

sentencing enhancements. In front of the Eleventh 

Circuit, one of those enhancements was argued and it was 

rejected. As to Mr. Hall, one of the sentencing 

enhancements were argued and was reversed on that 

sentencing enhancement. But there is still a sentencing 

enhancement that was raised in the Eleventh Circuit, but 

it was not raised in this petition. It was not the issue 

that this Court granted cert on, but we would argue that 

it's still a valid -- a valid claim and that this Court 

should hold this decision in abeyance until its decision 

in Booker and Fanfan. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the argument below that --

-- that imposing the sentencing enhancement was 

unconstitutional, or was the argument just that the facts 

didn't support it?

 MS. SAMEK: The argument was that the facts 

didn't support it.

 Finally, Your Honor, we would -- Your Honors, we 

would just again say that Congress did not intend to cause

a dramatic change in the way money laundering conspiracies 

were prosecuted. This Court has said in other cases that 

when Congress intends dramatic changes, that you would 

expect to find something in the legislative history. The 

Court has said that in the Lewis case having to do with 

interstate gambling and -- I see my time is up. Thank 

you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 10:49 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
