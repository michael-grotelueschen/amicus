 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 07-665, Pleasant Grove City 

v. Summum.

 Mr. Sekulow.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SEKULOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that 

the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant 

Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private 

party's donated, unattended, permanent monument.

 The decision suffers from two constitutional 

defects: First, the court's conclusion that a donated 

Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech 

rather than Government speech is wrong. Here each of 

the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been 

selected by the Government, are owned by the Government, 

controlled by the Government, and are displayed on 

Government property. When the Government is speaking, 

it is free from the traditional free speech constraints 

of the First Amendment.

 Second, the court compounded its error by

further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional 

public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended 

monuments by private parties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow, you're 

really just picking your poison, aren't you? I mean, 

the more you say that the monument is Government speech 

to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech 

Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a 

trap under the Establishment Clause. If it's Government 

speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but 

what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the 

Ten Commandments?

 MR. SEKULOW: Well, the Ten Commandments 

here was displayed in Pioneer Park, as the mayor said, 

Mayor Cook, in 1971, to show the pioneer heritage of the 

community. This was a community of pioneers on a quest 

for religious liberty. That's why this town was 

established. There is no Establishment Clause claim, 

Mr. Chief Justice, here. It would be inconsistent with 

the relief that the Respondents are really seeking.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

MR. SEKULOW: And I think that -- yes, 

Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't want to 

interrupt your answer to the Chief Justice because I

think it's critical, critical to your argument. As a 

procedural matter, I thought that the Establishment 

Clause issue was raised in the initial complaint. Are 

you taking the position it's now waived or something?

 MR. SEKULOW: Well, there was no Federal 

Establishment Clause complaint at all. There was a 

State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was under the State?

 MR. SEKULOW: It was under the State of 

Utah's Establishment Clause. It was raised in the 

complaint. It was not the basis upon which the 

injunction was sought, and the Tenth Circuit noted that 

it was waived.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail, the action 

should be dismissed, as far as you're concerned?

 MR. SEKULOW: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

 MR. SEKULOW: Just let me --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then getting back to the 

Chief Justice's point, it does seem to me that if you 

say it's Government speech that in later cases, 

including the case of the existing monument, you're 

going to say it's Government speech and you have an 

Establishment Clause problem. I don't know if -- I'm 

not saying it would necessarily be resolved one way or

the other, but it certainly raises --

MR. SEKULOW: Well, I think from an --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an Establishment Clause 

problem.

 MR. SEKULOW: If there was an Establishment 

Clause claim, Justice Kennedy, which is not here, Van 

Orden forecloses it. This monument is very similar to 

what was at play in Van Orden. And here the city stated 

the reason that they accepted and erected this monument, 

accepted the donation from the Fraternal Order of 

Eagles, was to show something and to represent their 

pioneer heritage, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it depends on 

what the Government speech consists of, what it is the 

Government is saying about the Ten Commandments. If the 

Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word 

of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying 

the Ten Commandments are an important part of our 

national heritage, that's something else.

 MR. SEKULOW: That's -- and precisely, 

Justice Scalia, that's exactly what Mayor Cook in fact, 

at the unveiling ceremony, stated that this will serve 

to remind citizens of their pioneer heritage and the 

founding of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have to --

 MR. SEKULOW: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or am I -- is that the --

MR. SEKULOW: No. You're correct. Those 

were speech selection cases. It think it clearly --

that the actions here of the Government, of the City 

Council, falls neatly within Forbes, Finley, and the 

plurality in American Library Association. The 

Government --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before we get -- before 

we get away from the Government, the Establishment 

Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did 

it? Because you don't have here a 40-year history of 

this monument being there, and nobody seems to be 

troubled by it.

 MR. SEKULOW: There is a 36-year history 

here. This monument has been on display since 1971. So 

this monument has been there a long time, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think 38 is the cut-off 

point.

 MR. SEKULOW: Is that the cut-off?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. SEKULOW: Perhaps I miscounted. It may

be 38.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sekulow --

MR. SEKULOW: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you come 

upon this, if somebody comes upon this monument in the 

park, how are they supposed to tell whether it's 

Government speech or private speech?

 MR. SEKULOW: Well, of course the face of 

it, Mr. Chief Justice, states on the face of the 

monument that it's presented to Pleasant Grove City in 

Utah County by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. As far as 

a Government speech as far as ownership and control goes 

under a Johanns analysis, different from Finley and 

Forbes and that context, here the Government exercised 

control. After all, they allowed it, accepted it, and 

allowed it to be erected on their property. Under Utah 

law, all right, title, and interest to that property 

transferred.

 But I would say with regard to the 

endorsement, if you will, or the Establishment Clause 

issue, really the context here, as this Court has 

consistently stated within the Establishment Clause 

cases matter -- this Court has a depiction of Moses 

holding the Ten Commandment in the frieze of the 

courtroom with the words written in Hebrew. That's not

an endorsement of the religion or of the commandments. 

It's representative of the history.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the context of all 

other lawgivers. This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments 

and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere "I am the 

Lord thy God." That's not shown.

 MR. SEKULOW: No, the words on the Court's 

frieze are "steal," "murder," "adultery" in Hebrew.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. SEKULOW: Very different in that 

context. But as far as the actual language of what's 

going on within the park itself, Justice Ginsburg, this 

is not a monument standing alone. There are 15 other 

displays in this Pioneer Park. It's called --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a challenge to the 

Ten Commandments monument?

 MR. SEKULOW: It's not. This is not an 

Establishment Clause case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought this case did not 

involve an Establishment Clause challenge. Why are we 

MR. SEKULOW: There is no Establishment 

Clause. It's not a basis upon which the injunction was 

sought, and the Tenth Circuit specifically held it was 

waived.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sekulow, can I just 

ask: At what point in the litigation did you first 

raise the Government speech argument?

 MR. SEKULOW: At the Tenth Circuit. The 

Tenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in 

the Summum line of cases mandated a private speech 

determination, even if the speech was controlled or 

known by the Government, if it originated with a third 

party. As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth 

Circuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district 

court and on the panel.

 But even in the panel brief, we raise the 

issue of Government speech and the Court addressed it 

both as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your 

point -- both as to Government speech and to the speech 

selection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library 

Association. And I think that those cases as well point 

to what's at issue here. Governments in the business of 

governing and determining the parks and the landscape of 

the parks make these kind of decisions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the tough -- isn't 

the tough issue here not so much whether there is 

Government speech. I will assume and I do indeed assume 

that there is. Isn't the tough issue here the claim 

that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both

Government and private. And the argument for its 

continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the 

Eagles identification with the presentation and their 

espousal of what the monument says. How -- how do you 

think we ought to deal with the mixture issue.

 MR. SEKULOW: Well, I think the fact that it 

originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles 

as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the 

fact that in this particular case, and in most cases 

involving donated monuments, which, as the United States 

would point to, most of the monuments in parks are 

donated by or originated with third parties --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They probably are, but most 

of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here. But I 

don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain 

as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument 

itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the 

gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z, 

whereas this monument does.

 MR. SEKULOW: Most of them, Justice Souter, 

do actually have statements. In fact, a perfect example 

would be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number 

of those monuments, most of them, are donated by or 

originated by third parties. They'll often say "Donated 

by," for instance, "the Father Corby --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We may have more cases 

coming.

 MR. SEKULOW: I hope not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But tell me, what is the 

criterion that we should use to decide what the 

significance of the private identification is?

 MR. SEKULOW: I think the key should be, as 

this Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control, 

who controls the message ultimately here. And the fact 

is the Statue of Liberty originated by the 

Franco-American Union -- was originated by a third 

party. The United States by resolution accepted it. At 

that point title transfer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if we accept 

that there is Government speech, I think Justice 

Souter's question is isn't this really the Government 

endorsement of the Eagles' message? I mean, the Eagles 

are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle, 

and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their 

monument. Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in 

the district court there, wasn't the statement, well, 

this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work 

that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to 

prevent juvenile delinquency.

 MR. SEKULOW: Right. And I think that

actually points to why that once it's controlled and 

owned by the Government the fact that it originated in 

the third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation 

for ownership and control to the Government.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it does, it 

changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating 

the private aspect of the speech. So that your real 

answer to me is it's not a mixture.

 MR. SEKULOW: It's not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And there ceases to be a 

mixture the moment the Government accepts it.

 MR. SEKULOW: Once -- right, title, and 

interest vest under Utah law in the Pleasant Grove City 

upon acceptance and at that point it is owned and 

controlled by the city. And the fact that it was 

originally created -- and Justice Ginsburg, you're 

correct, the district court and also the court of 

appeals in Van Orden stated that it was originated as a 

moral guidance for youth. That was the reason that the 

Fraternal Order of Eagles developed. The State of Texas 

said: We're going to honor the Eagles. That was their 

reason, as well as showing the role of the Ten 

Commandments and the rule of law. And then the Third --

excuse me, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you question

that's kind of in the background of the case?

 MR. SEKULOW: Sure.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Assume you didn't have the 

policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that 

the city decided not to put up this monument because it 

disagreed with the message of the monument. Whether you 

call it Government speech or private speech, would that 

be permissible?

 MR. SEKULOW: It wouldn't be a First 

Amendment free speech claim. It might raise an 

establishment clause, an equal protection kind of clause 

analysis case, but not under the basis upon which 

Respondents have sought here. I think that's important 

to point out. The basis upon which they sought access, 

in you will, is a species of an equal access claim. But 

of course our position is the Government hasn't 

established anything by accepting the monument.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, Justice Stevens's 

question is important, maybe not for your case but for 

other cases. We are deciding this for other cases to 

arise, and why isn't he correct that if you don't like 

the message then that raises a content-based claim?

 MR. SEKULOW: Because if the Government is 

speaking, if it's the Government's message, they're of 

course allowed to engage in content-based statements.

The Statute of Liberty was a statement of liberty 

enlightening the world. I could give a list of 

monuments that do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that.

 MR. SEKULOW: That's what they did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it doesn't seem to me 

that you have to make the Government speech argument for 

you to make the argument that you just made.

 MR. SEKULOW: No, not necessarily, because 

even under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's 

correct -- Governments make determinations of what they 

are going to put in their parks to communicate a 

message. That's very different from a situation I think 

where the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and 

Respondents are incorrect: They confuse the issue of 

the Government actually creating a forum or a venue for 

speech -- and a perfect example of that would be here, 

with ownership and control vesting in the city. Very 

different in that situation than the typical equal 

access case, where the Government merely opens up its 

facilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens, 

and then cannot engage in content-based or 

viewpoint-based --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So the city, in effect, if 

the city says, we are going to have a designated

ten-acre field in which anybody can put up a monument, 

but you can't because we don't like your message, 

there's a First Amendment problem. But if the city 

hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll --

we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept 

monuments from people who want to place them on our 

property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable 

historical connection or a connection with people with 

long association with the community, as long as they 

have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select 

any way they want to?

 MR. SEKULOW: Justice Souter, there is a 

fundamental difference between opening up a forum, 

taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go 

in, and another situation where the Government is 

clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason. And 

I think the evidence in these cases, in these series of 

cases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what 

does it mean for future cases, here it is 

uncontroverted: The basis upon which the preliminary 

injunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit 

disregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of 

the park administrator, who had been involved in city 

government since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found 

on pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that

it's been the practice of Pleasant Grove City for three 

decades to accept displays only in their particular case 

related to the history of the community, its pioneer 

history. -

JUSTICE SCALIA: It goes to the same thing, 

doesn't it? I mean, whether it's the Government stating 

the message or whether it's the Government creating a 

limited public forum for the presentation of only those 

messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the 

same thing, doesn't it?

 MR. SEKULOW: Well, it depends on -- if it's 

a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums 

can be based on subject matter and speaker identity. 

This Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius 

and Perry. So in that context, and now that limited 

public forum appears to be more of a non-public forum 

type of analysis, certainly. Even in the designated 

public forum, it could be limited in that regard.

 I think that points to the confusion of what 

took place here. The Court in our view conflated those 

two issues, the issue of forum and Government speech. 

And while they're both separate basis upon which we 

believe the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and 

vacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is 

that in this particular case once title passed and

control vested in Pleasant Grove City they were the 

owner and effectively controlled. And, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that does not mean that they violate the 

Establishment Clause simply because they own and control 

a monument.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question 

to make sure I understand your position. It would have 

been permissible for the city to say, our park it filled 

with monuments and we are only going to let those in who 

convey messages that we agree with?

 MR. SEKULOW: If the policy is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If that's a policy.

 MR. SEKULOW: If the policy is that we're 

only going -- that the Government's controlling those 

messages, it's not individual private expression, of 

course. If it's individual private -- if the 

Government, on the other hand, were to say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But really, in this case 

sort of the debate as to whether the policy 

justifications for the monument are a sham are not are 

really irrelevant?

 MR. SEKULOW: From a legal standpoint on 

Government speech, it's irrelevant. On the factual --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's a Government 

forum for private speech, I think it's the same thing.

You're defining -- you define the forum to include only 

those -- the forum is putting up monuments. You just 

put up those monuments that agree with the message.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the same question 

Justice Stevens had, just to tack onto his question 

here, your answer was: Oh, well, the Government owns 

it. Suppose the Government says: We will accept 

ownership only if we agree with the message. That just 

puts his question. I think the ownership argument is --

is not an answer to the Justice's question.

 MR. SEKULOW: It's not ownership, Justice 

Kennedy, in and of itself. Ownership is an indicator, a 

factor for control, but it is control of the message. 

When the Government implanted that monument donated by 

the Fraternal Order of Eagles, they were sending a 

message. It was not a message of "I am the lord thy 

God" --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing could be a more 

obvious control of the message than the criterion that 

says we will decide in -- in determining to accept it or 

not, we will decide on the basis of whether we agree 

with the message. That is control with a vengeance.

 MR. SEKULOW: The difference is -- the 

difference between each of those cases and the case here 

is the Fraternal Order of Eagles surrendered control of

their message and their speech. In the typical equal 

access case, Justice Stevens, they do not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they -- they do in 

the example Justice Kennedy just raised and the example 

that I just raised. The Eagles come along say: Here's 

the monument; take it; it's all yours.

 MR. SEKULOW: Which happened here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- the Government 

says: Okay, we'll take the Eagles monument. We will 

not on identical terms take the Summum monument because 

we disagree with the message. At the point they make 

the decision they don't own anything. What they are 

doing is controlling, in your words, and they are 

controlling on the basis of agreement with the message. 

Why isn't that a First Amendment violation?

 MR. SEKULOW: It's not a First Amendment 

violation because the Government takes ownership and 

control at the time it's displayed, and there is no 

dispute at the time it's displayed that the Government 

is conveying a message.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we've got -- we've got 

to shut our eyes to the period prior to the moment title 

passes.

been a policy in existence for three decades. And the 

fact of the matter is under that analysis --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean if we engage 

in viewpoint discrimination for three decades, we are 

home free?

 MR. SEKULOW: If the Government is the 

speaker, they are certainly entitled to do that. If 

they are not, that would be a very different scenario.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't be a speaker on 

your view until it takes control of the monument.

 MR. SEKULOW: But the Government -- the 

speech selection itself is an independent basis under 

Forbes, Finley, and American Library Association to 

bring these kind of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But those are cases in 

which, to begin with, the Government is engaging in -- a 

process of, in effect, sponsoring speech. And here we 

-- we have not, I think, reached the point in which the 

public park is to be analogized either with a 

publication or a magazine or -- or grants to -- to the 

arts.

 MR. SEKULOW: I think, when it comes to the 

issue of selecting monuments for its park, it's very 

similar to a museum curator or the arts.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Of course the Government can select the 

content and viewpoint of monuments on the National Mall 

and in other public parks across the country. The 

Vietnam Veterans Memorial did not open us up to a Viet 

Cong memorial. When the Martin Luther King Memorial is 

completed on the mall, it will not have to be offset by 

a monument to the man who shot Dr. King.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't there be a situation 

where the Government does create a monument that is a --

a limited public forum? Let's take the example that you 

just gave, the Vietnam War Memorial. I presume the 

Government could not refuse to have the names of certain 

deceased soldiers on that monument because it disagreed 

with certain ideas that they had espoused at one point 

or another.

MR. JOSEFFER: Well, if -- when it is 

Government speech -- for example, we can have a -- a 

Washington Monument and a Jefferson Memorial without an 

Adams one. I mean, we do get to decide who we want to 

memorialize on the mall because it's Government speech.

 But there are also -- there are two legal 

theories here. The first is that this is Government 

speech. The second is that this -- even if it was 

private speech, this would be one of those unusual 

contexts like public broadcasting, museums, libraries, 

where normal forum principles do not apply because the 

Government is acting as a curator and value judgments 

are, therefore, both inevitable and appropriate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the answer to 

Justice Alito's question?

 MR. JOSEFFER: I mean, if we wanted --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, supposing the 

Government in the Vietnam Memorial decided not to put up 

the names of any homosexual soldiers. Would that be 

permissible?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. When the -- when the 

Government is speaking, it can choose who to memorialize 

and who not --

JUSTICE BREYER: That seems to be the 

problem here. And what I have in this is the -- the

problem I have is that we seem to be applying these 

subcategories in a very absolute way. Why can't we call 

this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with 

Government decisionmaking -- and ask the question, as we 

do in election cases, is the restriction proportionate 

to a legitimate objective? I know how you're going to 

answer that question. You're going to say: Of course, 

it is.

 But what's interesting me is, are we bound 

in these cases to apply what I think of as an artificial 

kind of conceptual framework or are we free to ask what 

seems to me to be at the heart of the matter? The 

answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetically is: Of 

course the Government can't do that because it's 

disproportionate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't get the answer. 

Did you --

MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, the Government can 

choose to memorialize who it wants on the mall. When 

the Government is -- now, to be clear, that's under the 

Free Speech Clause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the answer to 

the -- what is the answer to Justice Stevens's 

hypothetical? What is the answer to the homosexual 

hypothetical? What is the answer?

MR. JOSEFFER: The only question --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because that tests the 

theory.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, as a matter of the Free 

Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's 

ability to speak freely. Under the Equal Protection 

Clause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due 

Process Clause, there might be thought to be independent 

checks on the Government's speech. But the Free Speech 

Clause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the 

Government from speaking freely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me the 

Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could 

disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of 

other things that in -- in many States people are free 

to do. The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?

 MR. JOSEFFER: The Government would be 

powerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate 

and then express its own viewpoints.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the answer to 

the -- the question? Why isn't the answer to the 

question that monuments generally are not -- the 

erection of monuments generally are not a forum? There 

is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner 

in the park where anybody can speak and a permanent

monument that takes up space, presumably limited public 

space.

 And if you have the unusual situation where 

you are have a monument that is really analogous to a 

forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable. But 

to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or 

the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.

 MR. JOSEFFER: When the -- when the 

Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier. 

When the Government is acting as a curator as in the 

museum context, normal forum principles do not apply.

 In Forbes, for example, this Court held that 

when the Government acts as a public broadcaster it 

normally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside 

of an exception for candidate debates. And the -- and 

the same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a 

combination of three reasons.

 First, the Government has an overwhelming 

interest as a property owner in not being saddled with 

structures it does not want; second, the limits on the 

availability of public space you refer to; and, third, 

the Government's sovereign interest in using monuments 

on its own property to tell its own story, as the 

Federal Government has done here on the Mall.

 It's similar to, for example, a sculpture

garden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the 

Government can choose what sculptures to put in the 

sculpture garden without necessarily having some 

overriding theme or overriding reason.

 If I could give two examples of that, in 

Meridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th 

and 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and 

place a variety of privately donated structures that 

have no evident connection to one another. They cover 

people as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan --

JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose they only 

accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all 

the Republicans?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. As a matter of policy 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what in the First 

Amendment -- are you saying the First Amendment would 

not stop that?

 MR. JOSEFFER: The Free Speech Clause on its 

own force does not prevent the Government from speaking 

freely. But as a matter of rational basis review under 

the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see 

how the Government would have a legitimate governmental 

interest in pure partisan activity.

 But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is

that it -- it limits the extent to which the Government 

can regulate other people's speech.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the Equal 

Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal 

Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's 

content-based. That's the First Amendment.

 MR. JOSEFFER: If it's Government speech, 

though --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't think that 

can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other 

amendments of the Constitution might apply. The heart 

of the question is whether the Government may 

discriminate based on content, and that's a First 

Amendment question.

 MR. JOSEFFER: But when the Government is 

speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator 

as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or 

here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both 

content and viewpoint-based distinctions. Otherwise, 

you get the absurd result --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not only absolutely 

entitled, it has to do so. It -- it has no choice, does 

it?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. If we -- if we 

couldn't formulate and express viewpoints, I would be

here today in support of neither party. And the 

Government, frankly, would be prevented from doing much 

of anything.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't run a museum if 

you have to accept everything, right?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Now, yes -- I mean --

yes, if it's just the simple point that we can do 

content and viewpoint discrimination in this context. 

And Forbes recognized that when the Government -- even 

if it's private speech, Forbes recognizes that as a 

curator we can do this. An example, though, of the 

question --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the law always 

require us to adopt an all-or-nothing position? Aren't 

there some extreme cases indicated by the hypothetical 

where the First Amendment does enter in? Do we have to 

decide this case that it's all or nothing?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Of course, the Court could 

put limits on its holding if it so desired.

 But if I could address the, sort of the 

hybrid speech which seems to worry some people. The 

Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a great example. People 

are permitted there to put private objects next to the 

wall. That's clearly authorized speech. It's 

authorized public speech. But at the end of the day,

the Government comes around, takes it away, puts the 

nonperishable objects in a Government warehouse, and 

then decides which of them to display in the 

Smithsonian's American History Museum.

 So what starts off as public speech -- or as 

private speech, clearly becomes Government speech when 

the Government assumes control over it. It's the same 

as the Government putting a painting --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It would be -- the 

trouble --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- in a Government museum.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I see your point, but the 

trouble with that as an argument here is the private 

part of the speech is just as much chiseled in stone as 

the public part. So it's not going to go away at the 

end of the day, and there isn't any way that the 

Government in effect can engage in the gesture of saying 

all private speech is treated the same way, whatever way 

that might be. So we've got a -- we've got a -- we've 

got a more difficult problem here.

 MR. JOSEFFER: But if the Government -- take 

a museum. The Government could choose or not choose to 

put, say, a Gilbert Stuart painting that has a favorable 

portrayal of a former president on display. The 

Government didn't paint it. It has Gilbert Stuart's

name all over it. But when the Government chooses to 

put that in a -- in a display, it's the Government that 

is speaking, and the Government, therefore, has an 

absolute right to decide its own speech. That should 

become --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What you are, in effect, 

saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this 

is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in 

effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of 

Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a 

private identification consistent with it, but the only 

appropriate analysis is the analysis for government 

speech. You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick 

one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government 

aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes. 

That, I take it, is your answer?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And when we are talking 

about physical objects that constitute the speech, 

that's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture 

gardens, parks across the country. So, frankly, there 

is -- there is nothing even unusual about it. And the 

reason is that all the free speech clause does --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There is nothing unusual 

about it, but we haven't had this kind of a challenge 

before. So, I -- I guess it still rests on you to say

why should we submerge the private part to the 

Government part. There may be a very good reason, but I 

want to know what your reason is.

 MR. JOSEFFER: It's simply that once the 

Government is speaking, it is the one -- it turns on 

control, right? So once the Government takes control of 

something, says this is our speech, then it's the 

Government speaking. And here, I mean, it does --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe they can't do 

it in museums, either. I mean, yes, we've been doing 

this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been 

wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run 

museums. It's possible, right? It's a brave new world.

 MR. JOSEFFER: And frankly, public parks are 

no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public 

parks for probably at least as long as well. And in 

fact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments 

and sculptures in public parks across the country, and I 

suspect a great many of them don't have some formal 

disclaimer on them saying "I am the United States and I 

approve this message." That's not the way that 

Government speech has ever been thought to work.

 The question, though, with Government speech 

turning on control, this is the easy case because we

and then it can do whatever it wants with it. It can 

move it, modify it, destroy it, drop it to the bottom of

not subject to the free speech clause.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. HARRIS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The city here gave the Eagles access to its 

public park for s display about the Ten Commandments and 

it denied Summum access for a display about the tenets 

of its faith. That's a violation of the core free 

speech principle that the Government may not favor one 

message over another in a public forum. The Eagles 

display here is not Government speech. The city had 

nothing to do with the Ten Commandments Monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say in a public forum. 

I mean, that sort of begs the question. I mean, that --

that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your

answer. Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put 

up a monument there willy-nilly?

 I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can 

have praise in the park, we can have protest. Anybody 

can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not 

interfering with some other group. That's a public 

forum. Has this city said anybody can put up a monument 

in this park?

 MS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, there is a very 

serious factual question in this case about whether the 

city ever had a bona fide selection policy for this 

park. But putting that to one side for a moment, a 

public park is a public forum. A monument in a park may 

be a mode of communication for that forum --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a public forum for 

some things. Is it a public forum for everything? It 

may be a public forum for processions, for parades. But 

it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody 

constructing a monument?

 MS. HARRIS: If you look at the question 

that way, Justice Scalia, it might be said that a public 

park is not a forum for sound trucks, it's not a forum 

for sleep-ins, it's not a forum for news racks.

 What that means is that there is no 

unfettered right to engage in those forms of

communication. But if the Government allows it all --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Those are time, place, and 

manner regulations, with which we are all familiar. But 

my concern is that this -- this case is an example of 

the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels. Because it's 

a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for 

parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, 

it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all 

of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something 

that will last 30 years for which there is only limited 

space. It just doesn't make common sense.

 MS. HARRIS: And that is exactly why, 

Justice Kennedy, the city, any city, is permitted to 

make a decision that it will close its public parks to 

all unattended displays. The Court said that in 

Pinette. It said that earlier in Vincent. But Because 

there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far do you push 

that? I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other 

side? I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have 

to have a statue of despotism? Or do we have to put any 

president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore? How do you 

answer those?

 MS. HARRIS: Of course not, is how I answer 

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

Any city has available to it two very 

straightforward options for dealing with this question 

if by some happenstance they do have a monument on 

public land that is not now a Government monument. The 

first thing they can do is adopt any existing monuments 

as Government speech converts them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How do they do that? What 

is the -- you mentioned that frequently in your brief, 

and I'm not sure what formality you have in mind when 

you say adopt.

ways, Justice Souter. The way the national Government 

does it under the Antiquities Act of 1906 is they 

formally designate pre-existing structures as a monument 

of the United States or a memorial of the United States.

 And that, by the way, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

the response to the Statue of Liberty problem. In 1924 

it was so designated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's frozen into 

time. Everything up until now is okay, but anything 

going forward is not?

 MS. HARRIS: I'm not sure I understand.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you 

said the Government can accept what's there and say 

that's our speech. But you're challenging the ability

to do that going forward.

 MS. HARRIS: No. No, Your Honor. If the 

Government accepts what's there -- what is there now and 

says that's ours, then they can say we are not taking --

we have closed this forum to private speech, these parks 

are available only to Governmental displays.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that 

some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War 

battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.

 MS. HARRIS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- Mr. Sekulow says 

that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil 

War battlefields, do show who the donors are.

 Now is that Government speech or private 

speech?

 MS. HARRIS: It depends if they were 

privately formulated and handed off to the Government as 

a completed object, they are only Government speech if 

the Government has since then converted them --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So they have to go?

 MS. HARRIS: -- by adopting them. They 

don't have to go.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now that the Government 

converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we 

adopt this?

MS. HARRIS: That has happened.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it enough that the 

Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the 

Government's property? Isn't that a manifestation of 

the Government's adoption of it?

 MS. HARRIS: Let me answer both of your 

questions, Justice Scalia. The way it does that even if 

they -- even if a monument makes clear that it was 

privately formulated, a Government can still adopt it as 

its own speech. It can put --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So this case -- your claim 

would disappear if this town in Utah had passed an 

ordinance saying we adopt the Ten Commandments Monument?

 MS. HARRIS: It would, Justice Souter. We 

would no longer have an equal access right going 

forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's -- I mean, if 

that's all that's involved here, we're engaging in kind 

of a -- almost a silly exercise in formality.

 MS. HARRIS: Absolutely not, Justice Souter. 

And the reason we know it's not a formality is because 

the city here refuses to do it. If it were just a 

formality, they would check the box. They won't do 

it --

got to take the monument down if they don't do it, don't 

you think they are going to pass that pretty quick?

 MS. HARRIS: I don't think they are, Justice 

Souter. And I think it would be partly a concern about 

establishment clause exposure, which we already heard 

about today.

 I think that there are substantive reasons 

why they might not want to adopt one version of the Ten 

Commandments as the city's own speech. As it happens, 

the version of the Ten Commandments on the Eagles 

monument isn't even the Mormon version of the Ten 

Commandments. That might raise sensitivities in this 

town. And whenever the Government adopts one version of 

the exodus account, that is not legally sensitive but 

politically sensitive as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean 

by adopting one version. If it's adopting the version 

by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God, 

that's one thing. If it's adopting it by just saying 

this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a 

very significant place in the history of the American 

people.

 MS. HARRIS: I think that those are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't care what 

version it was if that's all they're doing.

MS. HARRIS: Those are very different --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor would the Mormons in 

Utah, I think.

 MS. HARRIS: Well, those are very different 

for establishment clause purposes, Justice Scalia. But 

the only way the Government can be adopting anything in 

this context is by saying through the act of selection 

we have adopted it. And the problem with that is that 

the Government is not allowed to select which private 

speech it wishes to present to the public in a public 

park.

 It can do that. It can do that in museums. 

It can do it in libraries. It can do it --

JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this 

example. Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk 

in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was 

a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says 

right on there donated by a private neighborhood 

association to commemorate a number of people who were 

killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. And now if I 

searched the town records or the county record and I 

don't find any resolution saying they adopted this 

monument as their monument, does that mean that if I 

would like to put up a monument in the park to 

commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I

respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?

 MS. HARRIS: No, Your Honor, and really for 

three separate reasons. First of the all, it may be 

that the Government -- even privately donated monuments 

often involve a great deal of Government involvement at 

the front end, when they are created. Government often 

works in partnership with private donors to create the 

content of that monument.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well what if the situation 

is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said 

we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or 

the town says fine, go ahead and do it?

 MS. HARRIS: Even under those more usual 

circumstances there would be two things the city could 

do to keep you out of their park. As I said, they could 

adopt the monument that is there. The other thing any 

city can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban, 

or a content-neutral limit, on the number of private 

displays it wants to have in its park.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Harris, we -- we need a 

clear rule here. We -- we can't expect the courts or 

the cities for that matter to investigate in every case 

what the degree of the Government's involvement in 

the -- and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent, 

36 years? I mean, we are going to make up a percentage?

That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional 

questions ought to be resolved or resolvable. We need a 

clear rule that the cities can rely on.

 MS. HARRIS: I agree that we need a clear 

rule, and if clarity is important here the easiest way 

for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a 

privately formulated message as its own is to adopt it 

clearly and publicly. It can put up a plaque; it can 

designate it a city monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there an historical 

basis for that, or you just made it up? You think it 

would be a good idea? I mean, if that had been the 

practice over the past 200 years for all of these 

monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the 

landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the 

difference is.

 But I'm not aware that there is any such --

such requirement and any such practice on the part of 

Government. You're -- you're creating a new world.

 MS. HARRIS: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a very nice world 

but it happens not to be the world under which our 

Constitution has subjected this country.

 MS. HARRIS: If this is uncommon, that is 

because usually the Government does reserve monuments

for governmental speech, monuments that it helps to 

create or monuments that it is happy to endorse after 

the fact. If this case is unusual, it's because 

Pleasant Grove has done an unusual thing here by 

allowing a private party to erect a permanent monument 

in its park, even though it is not willing to endorse 

the content of that monument.

 And I do want to say that although clear 

rules are necessary, whatever the particular details of 

how a monument came to be on public land, there are 

these two clear safe harbors for any city facing that 

problem. Adopt it now or enact a content-neutral limit 

on the number of monuments in the park; and we think the 

city could do that on a going-forward basis. It could 

say we have room -- for aesthetic reasons, for space 

constraint reasons, We would like --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that's all right, the 

first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up, 

okay? It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or 

whatever else, is that it? First 95?

 MS. HARRIS: Sure. A city could say we 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a practical 

solution to the problem?

confronting this problem now can look at its park and 

say we have four monuments --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying the last 

generation had much more freedom than the present one?

 MS. HARRIS: I'm saying that as long as it 

does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is 

genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints, 

clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit 

on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of 

grandfathering in existing displays --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to -- your 

basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all 

instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area, 

demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks 

have been places where people can speak their minds. 

But I don't know of any tradition that says people can 

come to the park with monuments and put them up if they 

will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place 

and manner.

 So you're making an assumption that from 

time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be 

presented by anyone who wants to.

 MS. HARRIS: No, Justice Ginsburg. 

Monuments are different from speeches and because 

monuments are different, the Court has held that unlike

oratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely 

to all private unattended displays. It could not say, 

"We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches." It can 

say no private --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that -- it that is so, 

what is the point of using the public forum analysis at 

all?

 MS. HARRIS: Because here the city has not 

done that. The city has not closed -- it has not made 

the decision that it will bar all private unattended 

displays.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that may mean that 

you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination 

argument --

MS. HARRIS: That --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but that would not be 

the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional 

public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases 

have used the term.

 MS. HARRIS: Oh, I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it seems to me that your 

use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy 

here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or 

would help us if we used it as criterion for decision.

Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking 

about a public forum, we know that access cannot be 

limited on a content basis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- you can 

stick with it as long as you want; that's what the --

the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say 

that we were unconvinced by the comparison between 

speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on 

the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy. 

Would that be the end of your case?

 MS. HARRIS: Oh, no, Justice Kennedy. Even 

outside a public forum, in any context -- even in a 

museum or library -- in any context in which the 

Government is regulating private speech, it may not act 

in a way that is designed to suppress one particularly 

disfavored message or view; and we think that's what 

happened here. As I said earlier --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it does 

all the time. The -- you don't get equal time -- the 

cigarette companies don't get equal time because the 

Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is 

bad for your health. It always suppresses alternative 

viewpoints.

for itself, then the Government does have a right to

prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city 

has consistently refused to adopt the content of this 

monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming 

endorsement of that monument. The city here -- the 

justification for that Government speech exception is 

that sometimes, as the United States has said, the 

Government is entitled to speak in its own voice to 

promote its own messages, its own policies. But it says 

it's not doing that here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You will say just the 

opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten 

Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause 

grounds. You will say something like this: Anybody who 

comes into this park and seeing this monument owned by 

the Government, on Government land, will think that the 

Government is endorsing this message.

 That's what you will say now.

 MS. HARRIS: Um --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now why would it be true 

there, but it's not true here? Would anybody think that 

on public land owned by the Government the Government 

disagrees with this message?

 MS. HARRIS: Justice Scalia, for one thing, 

if this case were being litigated under the 

Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether

the monument were actually Government speech, because 

the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the 

Government's interaction with private speech as well. 

That said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who 

came across this monument would know that the Government 

is speaking.

 The monument says it is presented by the 

Eagles. It has the Eagles emblem. The mayor himself 

testified in his deposition that he thought the monument 

was owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not 

the -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is 

the Eagles and not the city that maintains that 

monument.

 I think there is a very real question about 

what people would think here and if those perceptions 

are important the easy way to clarify it is for the city 

to step up and adopt the monument as Government speech, 

which it won't do here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't merely allowing the 

monument to be built on public property sufficient 

acceptance? If somebody came up to you and said I'd 

like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you 

said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting 

that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?

different from a public park, and that matters because 

when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead, 

put your monument in our park, that's all the Government 

ever does when it administers access to a public forum. 

If it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem. 

The Government --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it doesn't -- it 

doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner 

restrictions for access to a public forum if it really 

is a public forum. There is something more involved 

here.

 This is closer to the case of the individual 

who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn. No 

one is going to doubt that the person whose house is 

there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me 

we are in the same situation with the monument in the 

city.

 MS. HARRIS: Again, I think because it's a 

public park and because public forums are always used 

for the expression of -- of ideas that the Government 

does not necessarily agree with --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but when you get the 

monument --

MS. HARRIS: -- the perceptions will not be 

clear.

JUSTICE SOUTER: We do not -- there is no 

pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would 

have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants 

to display a message in granite in a public park can put 

it there. No one assumes that. Everyone assumes that, 

if the granite monument is there, the city or whatever 

has said, yes, we approve it, put it there.

 MS. HARRIS: The city in this case --

everybody may assume that, and they would be right. The 

city in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument 

and not that one. So you can put yours up, and you 

can't. That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem. 

That is the First Amendment problem that the Government 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It may create the First 

Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to 

Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a 

clear adoption of the monument.

 MS. HARRIS: If all we have, I think, 

Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one 

private speaker to erect a monument, there is no 

constitutional or judicially manageable line between 

that and just the ordinary thing the Government always 

does when it grants preferred access to a public forum, 

which is to say you're in, you're out. If that's enough

for adoption, then there are no more First Amendment 

violations through lack of equal access.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but even on your own 

criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we 

adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced 

with precisely the content discrimination problem that 

you're arguing about here.

 MS. HARRIS: But because it's adopted it as 

its own message, then we think the Government is 

speaking. And when the Government is speaking, as the 

United States, said it is entitled to make content and 

viewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has 

to step up and speak itself. That's the justification 

for the Government speech doctrine.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're basically just 

arguing for a clear statement rule. I mean, Justice 

Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the 

fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some 

indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put 

the monument here. And what you're arguing for is, 

well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say, 

yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart. And 

that seems to be the difference between your position 

and the -- and the position that acceptance of the 

monument is enough.

MS. HARRIS: I would formulate it only 

slightly differently, which is not so much a clear 

statement but that those are really two different 

things, approving it for access and adopting the message 

as the Government's own. And that the differences --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can --

MS. HARRIS: -- that would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can make that 

distinction. There's no -- I understand the distinction 

you're making, but because I don't see that that's a 

distinction that a reasonable member of the public would 

understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be --

to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't 

know why it's a distinction that should be significant 

for First Amendment purposes.

 MS. HARRIS: If what matters is the public 

perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an 

unclear situation like this, where have you a monument 

that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the 

Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it 

in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a 

reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear. 

The Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and 

that's for the Government to adopt it.

it, can it at that time specify what it understands the 

statement to be?

 MS. HARRIS: I think it can, Justice Alito. 

It can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this 

is the Government's own message, and it can tailor its 

adoption to make clear what message it's adopting.

 And in answer to some of Justice Scalia's 

questions, I think the Government here could put up a 

plaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says 

"Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to 

the role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law." 

It can do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the resolution of 

adoption by the City Council just says, "The City 

Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle 

Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's 

attention."

 MS. HARRIS: I think the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that enough?

 MS. HARRIS: No. I think that the ordinance 

-- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is 

to -- which is to say, "This is a monument of the City 

of Pleasant Grove, we adopt the content of the 

monument," not just "we approve it." "We are giving it 

preferential access, and here is why."

JUSTICE SOUTER: You want a signing 

statement as well as a signature?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. HARRIS: Like that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it depend on --

given the focus on public perception, does it depend on 

the content of the speech? In other words, if you came 

across a monument and it said, "The Eagles are a lot 

better than every other organization, you should give 

money to the Eagles," someone is going to walk by that 

and say, "Well, that's probably not the City, that's 

probably the Eagles." But the Eagles, you know, for all 

the good they do, did not come up with the Ten 

Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and 

say, "That's probably the City." They are not going to 

look at that and immediately say, "That's what the 

Eagles believe."

 MS. HARRIS: Well, I think it's actually 

trickier than that, more complicated than that, Your 

Honor. Again, given this monument, I think there will 

be questions about whether this is the speech of the 

Eagles. And I actually think that, given all the legal 

sensitivities around a Ten Commandments monument, your 

average citizen, when they see a religious monument in a 

park, may well think that may be private speech because

the Government usually can't endorse or at least 

sometimes can't endorse religious speech. So I actually 

think these questions are very complicated.

 And, again, if you want to be clear about 

who's speaking, there's an easy way to do that, which is 

for the Government straightforwardly and clearly to 

adopt this speech as its own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it's just a statue 

of George Washington? What kind of a resolution does 

the city council adopt? "We endorse everything George 

Washington ever said"?

 MS. HARRIS: No. No. Again, and in my 

answer to Justice Alito, they can adopt any resolution 

they want so long as they adopt that statue as a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if --

MS. HARRIS: -- city memorial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, and I think 

they would adopt a resolution that says, "We think 

George Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on 

the part of our citizens."

 MS. HARRIS: And so long as that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it could say that, why 

couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten 

Commandments? "We think the Ten Commandments are worthy 

of respect and" -- and I wouldn't say "emulation"; I

would say "respect and reverence by our citizens."

 MS. HARRIS: So long as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that be enough?

 MS. HARRIS: So long as it is preceded by a 

statement that the city actually adopts the memorial as 

its own, that this is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that 

means.

 MS. HARRIS: -- a Pleasant Grove memorial or 

a Pleasant Grove monument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It has acquired the 

memorial. The City has acquired property in this 

memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed 

in the city park. Period. "We believe that the Ten 

Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are 

worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove" --

is that enough?

 MS. HARRIS: It may be that if the 

Government goes on long enough, it will have connoted 

what is very important here, which is that it is 

prepared to adopt the content of that monument as its 

own.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what that 

means. You keep saying it, and I don't know what it 

means.

MS. HARRIS: It means --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought 

adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the 

content of the monument insofar as the monument says the 

Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of 

Pleasant Grove. Is that enough?

 MS. HARRIS: If the City says --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or it has to say, "We 

believe in the Ten Commandments"?

 MS. HARRIS: No. No. I understand your 

question, Justice Scalia. If the City says what you 

just said, "We are adopting this monument insofar" and 

however it wants to finish that sentence, that is fine.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that's 

fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in 

Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City 

Council has allowed it to be constructed there? Don't 

you think that's implicit?

 MS. HARRIS: No, I don't, Your Honor. I 

think that all that implies is that Pleasant Grove has 

decided this speech is worthy of display in this public 

park based on its content. And that is the decision the 

City can't make. If it were just a formality, if it 

were simple, and it's all the same, who cares?, then I 

think that Pleasant Grove would be here saying something

different, which is, "We adopt. We adopt. We'll check 

that box." There are substantive reasons why it doesn't 

-- it may be a fine line --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the City doesn't know 

MS. HARRIS: -- but the City doesn't want to 

cross it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- know what you mean by 

"We adopt," just as I don't know what you mean by "We 

adopt."

 MS. HARRIS: Well, whether or not the City 

knows what we mean, what we know from the City's brief 

is that what it's saying is -- and this is on page 33 of 

its brief -- the Government speech here is only in the 

act of selection. Selection. It's not about the 

content of that monument. That's not enough to make a 

Government speech, and the City is not permitted to 

speak through selection, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do we do -- is this 

monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas? And 

so if the history is the same, you would know that there 

was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille 

trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments. So 

he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten 

Commandments all over because it would be good for the

morality of people, and also it would help promote the 

movie. All right? Is that true -- is that the actual 

description here?

 MS. HARRIS: This is part of the same Eagles 

project --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MS. HARRIS: -- that was --

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if that's the 

history of it, what does that mean? I mean, where do we 

go with that? Then this is in fact partly an attempt to 

promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly 

an attempt to promote a movie. So, what do we do with 

that?

 MS. HARRIS: It's all a private message, and 

it may be a private message that has many different 

elements, but nothing about that suggests Government 

speech. And even if all the Government is doing in its 

public part is promoting one version of the Cecile 

DeMille movie, it can't do that on a content basis.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Why not? Why --

suppose that there -- there are certain messages that 

private people had like "eat vitamins" --

MS. HARRIS: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and so they say -- you 

know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along

with a totally different content, "ride the roller 

coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed 

to get healthy children, not put children at risk. So 

therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't 

want messages, "ride the roller coaster." This is all 

private. It's the -- you know -- now what?

 MS. HARRIS: The problem is that it's a 

public park, and content --

JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, they --

the --

MS. HARRIS: Eating vitamins and roller 

coasters are not --

JUSTICE BREYER: They can't do either.

 MS. HARRIS: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any case that says 

-- can they have playgrounds in the park?

 MS. HARRIS: They can have playgrounds, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so we have right in 

the playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your --

clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don't 

throw food at your brother," okay?

 So -- I mean --

MS. HARRIS: Those are private messages.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- whatever. So -- so 

what's wrong with that? Where does the First Amendment 

forbid that? You promote -- they want in this corner, 

promoting in the playground good things that they like 

and not bad ones. Where does it permit it? What's the 

case that says that the Government couldn't do that?

Government can't do it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Give one and I'll read it. 

Give me three; I'll read them.

 MS. HARRIS: I'll give you Pinette. The 

Government can't make content based decisions in a 

public forum. And there is not a limit --

JUSTICE BREYER: But the children's 

playground isn't the public forum.

 MS. HARRIS: Oh, but the Government -- a 

public park is a public forum. If the Government wants 

to set aside part of that park -- change the physical 

characteristics, change the principal use and bear the 

attendant cost, it can definitely do that. That is in

fact the answer to the sculpture garden; that's what 

happened there. The Government waived part of what it 

been a public forum; it put up fences; it changed the 

principal use; it limited the public access. It is no 

longer a park. It is now a museum.

 I'm sorry. I misunderstood. The Government 

can --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see where you're going. 

Thank you.

 MS. HARRIS: Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you taking this line 

because you say if the city council votes for it, then 

the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten 

Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to 

vote them out? Is that -- what underlies this notion 

that it isn't good enough for them to approve the 

placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of 

formal declaration?

 MS. HARRIS: What underlies it is that the 

Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is 

an exception to normal First Amendment, and very 

important First Amendment constraints. And what 

underlies the distinction is that that exception is 

justified only when the Government is speaking for 

itself. The Government needs to be able to promote its

own messages, its own ideas. But if it's not doing 

that, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument, 

saying those are not our own ideas, those are not our 

own messages, then there is just no justification for 

allowing it to prefer one form of private speech over 

another. The justification for allowing that exception 

is missing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not disclaiming it 

here. The Government isn't disclaiming it. And the 

difference it seems to me between you and your friends 

on the other side is you want this clear statement. You 

want a statement -- for example if you took Justice 

Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would 

also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause. 

Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me. I 

don't see that as an illegitimate object. I was a Van 

Orden dissenter -- I mean, but isn't that what is 

driving this?

 MS. HARRIS: Well, I do think that the --

the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it 

wants to have it both ways. It wants to be able to say 

this speech is governmental for purposes of blocking 

equal access rights; but not so governmental at that 

it's a big Establishment Clause problem. So yes, I 

think there is a dilemma here for the city.

Thank you, Your Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Sekulow, you have two minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SEKULOW: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 With regard to the hypothetical about the 

Senator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there is 

another factor that's important here; and that is those 

signs are created by those -- usually by the campaigns. 

So the fact that it's created by a third party doesn't 

in any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual 

who has put that sign in their home. Also with regard 

to the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt 

monuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments. 

That's the way it worked here; that's the way it works 

in most municipalities. That's this -- the trigger of 

allowing the monument to be displayed. Here there are 

two. The city -- it was approached and made a formal 

acceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as 

well, so in two different places.

 With regard to the adoption of the speech 

problem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not 

hypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about, 

under the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in

Respondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers 

could come in and say we want to erect a monument 

praising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's 

a compelling governmental interest, there would be no 

basis on which to deny it. That's why the whole public 

forum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely 

incorrect.

 And finally on the adopt a speech, there are 

monuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of 

message, including Holocaust memorials, and they will 

often have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from 

the Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards 

Jews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments 

and the displays. They are not adopting the message of 

the Nazis; they are showing the history of what took 

place during an era. That's very, very different.

 The Statute of Liberty, which was donated to 

the United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a 

private organization. The United States -- and it's 

found in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically 

accepted the monument, authorized the president to 

accept and they erected the pedestal. All privately 

funded in that regard, and it was originated by a third 

party. The Government was speaking when they erected 

that monument; the fact that the Antiquities Act came

into play, which just means you cannot harm those 

monuments, it's no different than Pioneer Park, which is 

a national historic treasure.

 And last point, Mr. Chief Justice, if I man, 

is the reliance on Pinette is misplaced because as this 

Court said, Pinette is an Establishment Clause case, and 

the reliance here by the Respondent has been on the Free 

Speech Clause. We think the Tenth Circuit is wrong, 

both under the Government speech analysis and under the 

forum approach, and for that reason should be vacated.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
