 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 07-8521, Harbison v. 

Bell.

 Ms. Chavis.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANA C. HANSEN CHAVIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CHAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 This case is about a logical reading of the 

statute's plain language, and section 3599(a)(2) that's 

printed on page 1 of the blue brief provides that when a 

state death row inmate seeks 2254 relief he shall be 

represented by counsel, he shall be appointed counsel by 

the federal court. And that representation is governed 

by subsection (e). Subsection (e) that is on page 2a of 

our blue brief defines the scope of counsel's 

representation and also divides that representation by 

two clauses that begin with the word "shall."

 This case is controlled by the second 

"shall" clause, which appears about four lines up from 

the bottom of subsection (e). And that clause says 

that: "Counsel shall also represent the defendant in 

proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be

available to him."

 We know that this means state clemency 

proceedings because of the words "available" and the 

words "or other." For a 2254 petitioner or defendant 

like Mr. Harbison, the only type of clemency that is 

available to him is state clemency, and in order to give 

effect to the words "or other" that were used by 

Congress we know that that must refer to state clemency 

because the only type of clemency that the Federal 

Government provides is executive clemency.

 Now, not only is the interpretation of this 

statute controlled by the plain language, but this 

interpretation makes sense, and it makes sense that 

Congress would provide for continuous representation for 

a capital defendant in that it fills a need, a gap in 

representation, it's efficient, and it also helps to 

improve the reliability of the death penalty as it's 

administered in this country.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your interpretation 

would make all of the provisions of subsection (e) 

applicable in state proceedings, so long as there's been 

a 2254 petition filed?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. And if I may, 

I would like to discuss the structure of subsection (e). 

And I believe your question would go to the very first

"shall" clause, which begins at line 3 of subsection 

(e), and that would -- in that counsel that is appointed 

under (a)(2) "shall represent the defendant in 

subsequent stages of judicial proceedings." And for the 

(a)(2) lawyer, the lawyer appointed under subsection 

(a)(2), that stage of proceeding that the representation 

begins with is described in (e) as "all available 

post-conviction process." And then it goes on for the 

remainder of the statute, together with the applications 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where 

are you reading, the first part, "available 

post-conviction process"?

 MS. CHAVIS: Right. It begins at the "and," 

which is eight lines down or about seven lines up, right 

in the middle of subsection (e).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't 

modify what comes before it, does it? New trial, 

appeals? In other words, if at the end of the habeas 

proceeding things start all over then presumably the 

appointed counsel represents the defendant throughout 

all those new proceedings?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. With respect 

to the habeas attorney the representation would begin 

with the "all available post-conviction process." If

that attorney did obtain relief for the defendant or the 

federal court granted relief for the capital defendant 

and that case were to return to state court, then of 

course we're not talking about continued representation 

of the federal habeas counsel because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? Why not?

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, because, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be a subsequent 

-- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, 

his retrial in state courts.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, the retrial and the 

trial proceedings that's referred to in subsection (e), 

those are duties of counsel appointed under (a)(1) of 

the statute, which is on page 1a, which would be trial 

counsel for those defendants charged with a federal 

capital crime.

 We would not -- a habeas lawyer would not 

participate in a retrial because -- for a few reasons. 

The first reason is because of the statute and the 

structure of the statute, which sets out the ordinary 

course of the capital case, so that there's nothing 

subsequent, no duties listed here that are a subsequent 

stage for habeas counsel.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see how that's 

possible a plain reading of the statutory language. You

started out by saying you're relying on the plain 

meaning of the statutory language.

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you get that out of 

the statutory language at (e)?

 MS. CHAVIS: It's in context with the whole 

of the statute. With respect, we look at (a)(1) and 

(a)(2) for that context for subsection (e). So --

JUSTICE ALITO: So now you're out of the 

plain language of the (e) and you're looking at the 

context of the whole statute.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I would submit that 

looking at the context of the whole statute is in 

accordance with also looking at the plain language used 

by Congress. And we do look at the statute as a whole 

in order to inform our --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's your answer to the 

plain language of (e)? That was your prime -- that was 

the argument you started out with, that this fell under 

the plain language of (e).

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you explain under the 

plain language of (e) why -- how you avoid the result 

that once habeas counsel is appointed in federal court, 

the counsel has to appear in all of these other

proceedings?

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes --

JUSTICE ALITO: New trial in state court, 

etcetera.

 MS. CHAVIS: "In all subsequent stages of 

judicial proceedings" is exactly what subsection (e) 

states.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are including 

then -- suppose that the result of the federal habeas is 

that the State -- that relief is granted unless the 

State retries the defendant in X number of days. And 

your reading I think would be the appointed counsel on 

federal habeas would be responsible for representation 

in all available post-conviction process, and that would 

be an available post-conviction process.

 MS. CHAVIS: Respectfully, Your Honor, the 

State retrial would be an entirely new case that would 

not fall under "all available post-conviction process."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would? Tell me, 

what would fall under "all available post-conviction 

process" in addition to clemency and competency 

proceedings?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, "all available 

post-conviction process" I submit would be defined by 

the 2254 or 2255 proceeding, now these together with

appropriate applications for stays and appropriate 

motions and procedures. Now, that is a part of this 

first clause in subsection (e) that, under appropriate 

circumstances, may permit the federally appointed lawyer 

to return to state court if deemed appropriate by the 

federal court. If the federal court found that an issue 

in the federal habeas case needed to be exhausted in 

order to aid that judge's determination of the habeas 

petition, then it would be appropriate for the federal 

judge to say: Counsel, please return to state court and 

exhaust the issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but he couldn't find 

it inappropriate, could he? If you're again talking 

about the plain language of the statute, I don't see 

there's much room for the district judge to say: Well, 

now, I'm not going to say that you have to participate 

in further state post-conviction proceedings, the 

unexhausted claim. It seems to me under your reading of 

the statute the appointed counsel, say in an unexhausted 

claim instance, would have to under the statute 

represent the defendant in further State collateral 

post-conviction proceedings.

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, again the key 

here is that Congress used the word "appropriate" and 

that's an easy legal standard for the federal judge to

determine. The statute does not say State 

post-conviction process or State post-conviction case. 

It indicates "appropriate motions or procedures." So 

that would be for the federal judge --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure 

I'm missing something here, because the statute does say 

"all available post-conviction process."

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor, and I submit 

that that is a reference to, if we look at (a)(2), where 

it says, the very first line, "post-conviction 

proceedings under 2254 and '55." So that describes all 

available post-conviction process, describes the 2254 or 

2255 proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're just 

saying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not 

post-conviction process?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor, not by a plain 

definition of that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, if you 

look up earlier in the statute, it says "shall represent 

the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of 

available judicial proceeding."

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't it fall 

under that?

MS. CHAVIS: Yes. Well, that's the key, 

"subsequent stage." And a retrial would not be a 

subsequent stage. That would be an entirely new case 

back in the state court.

 There's also a second reason why federal 

habeas counsel would not represent the defendant in many 

retrials or resentencings, and that would be --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it not be a 

subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?

 MS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it not a "subsequent 

stage of available judicial proceeding"?

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, under the structure of 

the statute there's nothing subsequent --

JUSTICE ALITO: Without using the word 

"structure of the statute," because there I think you 

get into lots of trouble -- and you started out by 

saying the plain language of (e) and I'm still 

struggling to understand what you're doing with the 

plain language of (e).

 MS. CHAVIS: Okay. Well, there is another 

reason why federal habeas counsel would not do a State 

retrial, and that's because under (a)(2), the clause or 

the part of the statute that does provide for the 

appointment of counsel, if there is already counsel

available then that appointment clause would not be 

triggered.

 If we look at (a)(2), which is on page 1a, 

the trigger for the appointment of counsel is that we 

have an indigent defendant. It says "a defendant who 

is" -- four lines down -- "a defendant who is or becomes 

financially unable to obtain adequate representation 

shall be appointed a lawyer."

 In a retrial, the State must provide trial 

counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. That 

doesn't work. The language you just quoted is simply to 

say when you get somebody appointed.

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are financially 

unable so you get somebody appointed. Then you go back 

and say that person shall represent you through every 

subsequent stage. It doesn't say that, oh, if you 

suddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you 

can -- then he doesn't have that obligation.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I would submit that 

these circumstances that trigger the appointment do 

carry through the appointment process in that, if you 

look at the language used by Congress, it says "any 

defendant who is or becomes financially unable." So

Congress was --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the remand is for 

State post-conviction review, and there is no attorney 

available under State law for State post-conviction 

review?

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor, then we would 

be looking again at the first clause of subsection (e), 

and we would be looking at the language used by Congress 

-- "any appropriate motions and procedures."

 And again, appropriateness is an easy legal 

standard applied by the courts. The federal judge 

overseeing the case could determine whether to --

whether returning for that State post-conviction process 

is appropriate. It would be just like a federal judge 

determining that in order to aid its decision-making 

process, it needs to certify a question back to the 

State courts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I have lost 

you. Where is the "appropriate"? I don't see any 

"appropriate."

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, "appropriate" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says "shall represent 

the defendant throughout every subsequent" -- every 

subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, and then it describes

those stages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, right.

 MS. CHAVIS: And then we are at four lines 

up from the bottom.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry. Five lines up from 

the bottom.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it says "and all" --

MS. CHAVIS: And other appropriate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. CHAVIS: -- motions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: "Other appropriate," but as 

far as what's covered by the first clause is concerned, 

"appropriate" doesn't apply to that.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Represent throughout every 

subsequent stage of available proceedings, including 

pretrial, trial, sentencing, motions for a new trial, 

appeals, applications for writ of certiorari. There is 

no "appropriate" in any of that.

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, sir. But, Your Honor, 

that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "And shall also represent" 

-- and "other appropriate motions and procedures," but 

that doesn't cover the earlier stuff.

MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, if we were looking 

at the possibility of exhausting a claim in State court, 

then we wouldn't be -- none of this first part of (e) 

would apply. That wouldn't be a pretrial proceeding. 

That wouldn't be a trial. That wouldn't be a 

sentencing. What that would come under would be after 

"and all available post-conviction process," that would 

be described as "other appropriate motions and 

procedures."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you would interpret 

"all available post-conviction process" as meaning 

federal?

 MS. CHAVIS: The habeas proceeding. Yes, 

Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why don't 

we interpret the clemency provision the same way, as 

being limited to Federal?

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, because, Your Honor, 

Congress doesn't use the word "Federal" here, and if we 

were to interpret it as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the use of 

"Federal" -- we were just talking about.

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor; however, when we look at post-conviction process 

in (e), we have the context of (a)(2), that talks about

post-conviction proceeding under section 2254 and 2255.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know why you 

just didn't take the position and say, yes, it applies 

to all these provisions. That doesn't seem to me a --

to doom your position at all. Once have you somebody 

appointed who helps you on the Federal habeas --

presumably they do a lot of work, they get up to speed 

on everything -- they ought to represent you through the 

next stage of available proceedings.

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, and that's 

true. The interpretation of this first clause of 

subsection (e) doesn't impact the second -- the 

interpretation of the second clause, which says 

specifically counsel shall represent the defendant in 

those clemency proceedings that are available to him.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you see why --

I mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly 

only federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue 

that the second part is not also implicitly only 

federal.

 MS. CHAVIS: Respectfully, Your Honor, I 

would disagree, and that's because the words are 

different, used by Congress. Congress is very explicit 

in stating other clemency as may be available to the 

defendant. There is no way that that could be

interpreted as federal clemency. There is no other 

federal clemency --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make clear 

what your position is. Federal determination on habeas 

corpus, that there are unexhausted claims, ordered to 

return to the State court: Is the appointed counsel 

required under the statute to represent the defendant in 

the State court in further post-conviction proceedings?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, and for two reasons: One 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have to take that 

position? But that is your --

MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I don't have to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is your position?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, that is my 

position. However, of course, again, the interpretation 

of this first part of this statute is separate from an 

interpretation of the clemency clause, but for two 

reasons the answer would be no to that question, because 

this statute -- number one, (e) does not specifically 

set that out as a subsequent stage of judicial 

proceedings, okay? What it does instead is it states 

"appropriate motions or procedures." So it would be 

discretionary. On a case-by-case basis, the district 

judge could determine whether he believed it was

appropriate, non-abusive, to return to State court to 

exhaust a claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but, you know, 

it mentions trial proceedings, trial, motion for a new 

trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari. 

And then, in the next clause it just says "and all 

available post-conviction process." Now, you would 

acknowledge that going back to exhaust claims that had 

not been exhausted before the State courts would be 

post-conviction process or not?

 MS. CHAVIS: Not with respect to subsection 

(e). I mean, ordinarily an exhaustion proceeding is not 

a subsequent stage. Ordinarily, if that is what this 

statute contemplates, is the ordinary course --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Subsequent stage" does not 

apply to this clause. I'm reading the clause "and all 

available post- conviction process."

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MS. CHAVIS: The very beginning of (w) 

indicates "each attorney so appointed shall represent 

the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of 

available judicial proceedings including" -- and then it 

recites all of those stages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

remedies? I'm a little unclear why you think it does 

not include necessary proceedings -- proceedings 

necessary to exhaust State remedies.

 MS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor, if I 

wasn't clear. It may include. It does not require. It 

may include going back to State court to exhaust.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why doesn't the word 

"shall" require it?

 MS. CHAVIS: Because, Your Honor, we're --

when we're talking about an exhaustion proceeding or 

returning to State court, it can only fit under this 

part of (e) that says that it would be an appropriate 

motion or procedure. That's the only thing that you 

could define a State proceeding under in this statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you step back and 

look at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your 

interpretation would be correct. It seems to me that it 

would be more likely that Congress wanted this counsel 

to continue on in State proceedings, trials.

 The clemency thing seems a little bit more 

removed. It's a different argument -- you know, we're 

guilty, but show us mercy -- than what may well be the

same sort of argument on the subsequent State proceeding 

as was raised in the Federal habeas. I mean, if I were 

writing this, I would want them to continue in the 

subsequent State proceedings before I would want them to 

continue -- before I would want to have them represent 

the defendant in clemency.

 MS. CHAVIS: And I understand that, Your 

Honor, but I think also, if we look at the 

representation as it does occur in the real world, we 

have the AEDPA, we have this Court's decisions that 

structure the -- the capital litigation so that State 

court exhaustion normally comes before the Federal 

habeas process.

 But, again, there are these two separate 

clauses. The first goes to judicial proceedings; the 

second clause goes to -- to nonjudicial proceedings, 

including competency, because the Court in Ford v. 

Wainwright indicated that we need not have a judicial 

proceeding, a judicial determination of competency so 

Congress has separated out competency and separated out 

clemency, knowing that those are stages of a capital 

case that come at the very end of Federal habeas, that 

the Federal habeas counsel would be in the best position 

to represent that defendant at that --

earlier question: So what else fits under "all 

available post-conviction process" other than competency 

and clemency? What else?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, competency and 

clemency are in their own "shall" clause, mandatory 

clause, in and of themselves. They are not included in 

the -- the post-conviction process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. But what would be 

included?

 MS. CHAVIS: The post-conviction process 

would refer to anything in the 2254 to 2255. For 

example, it could be the discovery motions; it could 

be -- it could be notions in aid of an evidentiary 

hearing; it could be motions in aid of an appeal. So, 

that's the descriptor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But only things in Federal 

court?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, that is it my 

reading of "all available post-conviction process," as 

referring to the 2254, 2255.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that seem reasonable 

that Congress would have -- suppose you had a real 

complicated case with five or six issues in it, and they 

find out one issue is not exhausted. The capital case 

has been around for two or three years. Does Congress

think, well, you've got to go on your own when you go 

back to the State court and try and exhaust that one 

claim?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. I don't think 

Congress contemplated that, and that's why I think they 

included this language "appropriate motions and 

procedures," to encompass a return to State court where 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, where is that 

language again, "appropriate motions" --

MS. CHAVIS: It's four lines up -- five 

lines up from the bottom, the end of that line --

"appropriate" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's in the next 

clause.

 MS. CHAVIS: That's in the first "subsequent 

stage" clause.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why does that limit the 

interpretation that -- of the words "subsequent stage" 

-- "throughout every subsequent stage of available 

judicial proceedings"? And doesn't the State collateral 

proceeding which is necessary to exhaust a remedy fall 

right within that language?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, it may.

MS. CHAVIS: It may. However, in our -- my 

reading of the statute, when we look at the subsequent 

stage, exhaustion ordinarily comes before Federal 

habeas. It would be, you know, an unordinary situation 

where you would have to go back and exhaust. But I 

believe the statute contemplates that with "appropriate 

motions and procedures."

 But of course, Congress could have 

contemplated that the Federal lawyer continue to 

represent the defendant in exhaustion proceedings. Back 

when the statute was created, Congress was looking at 

the States and looking at the fact that States were not 

providing counsel for capital defendants in these cases. 

And Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought it was your 

position that it didn't apply in that situation.

 MS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was your 

position that it did not apply in that situation.

 MS. CHAVIS: That it wasn't mandatory. It 

doesn't require. As is appropriate --

JUSTICE ALITO: So you think it's 

discretionary.

 MS. CHAVIS: Yes.

of discretion, can order the counsel who is appointed to 

represent the Petitioner in the habeas to go back and 

handle the exhaustion of a claim in State court"?

 MS. CHAVIS: Absolutely, Your Honor, just 

like this Court in Rhines v. Webber said it's 

discretionary as to whether this -- as to whether the 

Federal judge is going to determine that we are going to 

hold this case in abeyance, we are going to stay this 

case while we -- while counsel goes back to exhaust some 

claims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Chavis, what do you do 

about(a)(1)? That also is not limited by its terms --

MS. CHAVIS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to federal prisoners. 

Would you argue that it says "in every criminal action, 

which defendant is charged with a crime that is 

punishable by death."

 MS. CHAVIS: It does, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even in the original 

State trial, he is entitled to a federal defendant; is 

that right?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. For --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? It doesn't limit 

it to Federal trials.

in (a)(1), we would -- because (a)(1) sets out the 

factors that trigger the appointment of counsel, we have 

to have a defendant who is charged with a capital crime, 

who is indigent, and who otherwise doesn't have a 

lawyer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. It says he "shall 

be entitled to the appointment of one or more 

attorneys."

 MS. CHAVIS: That's correct, but, Your 

Honor, for a State capital trial, for a State capital 

direct appeal, the States do provide counsel, and 

Congress would know that States have to provide counsel 

under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So what? I mean, it still 

is -- is unqualified.

 MS. CHAVIS: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And part of your argument, 

not your only argument but a large part of your 

argument, is since it is unqualified in (E), the last 

clause, it has to include State. Well, you could say 

the same about (a)(1).

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, certainly last 

clause of (e) is unqualified and unambiguous; however, 

(a)(1) there is a qualifier in that it says "unable to 

obtain adequate representation."

doesn't provide counsel, the Federal Government will 

provide it, and the States can recede from their 

obligation to provide counsel, right.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I think this Court 

would have problems under Gideon -- if the States cannot 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why? So long as he 

has counsel, we don't care who pays for it.

 MS. CHAVIS: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "adequate 

representation." And then later on it says the lawyers 

we appoint here has to have five years of experience, 

three years experience in felony trials. I think that 

is a lot better than most of the attorneys who are going 

to be appointed under the State system. So I would say: 

Look, this statute itself recognizes that this person 

you have appointed under the State system is not 

adequate. They say you have got to have five 

years/three years, so I want one of those.

answer to that question under (a)(1) is that you would 

not get federally appointed counsel when you have 

counsel available to you otherwise. And that simply is 

the fact, that the States do provide for counsel.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about expert 

services? I think most States don't provide for that.

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government will 

provide expert -- compensation for the use of experts 

when the States won't?

 MS. CHAVIS: That is -- that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Under (a)(1)?

 MS. CHAVIS: That is part of (a)(1), and 

it's part of (a)(2). However, you still have to have --

you still have to have those -- those three 

circumstances present.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.

 MS. CHAVIS: And I believe that that -- that 

still would not -- the States, if they provide any sort 

of resources at all, and if they provide a lawyer, then 

certainly the trigger for appointment isn't -- isn't 

available under (a)(1).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems -- it seems to me, 

counsel, that the mere fact that it doesn't mention 

"federal" explicitly is -- is not a very strong argument

unless you are going to take the position that even 

(a)(1) applies to federal and state. And -- and really 

what you are -- the only strong strength to your bow is 

that it says "executive or other clemency." And -- and 

there -- there seems to be no federal clemency except 

executive clemency, I guess. I guess.

 Can Congress declare something that has been 

a crime no longer a crime and set the guy loose?  I 

don't know. Is that "clemency"?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, it's the 

Constitution that determines the -- the federal 

authority for clemency. So Congress cannot effect that. 

There is -- the -- only --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says here the President 

can. It doesn't say Congress can't. Does it say 

Congress can't?

 MS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor, it does not say 

that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You put a lot of 

weight on -- I mean, the problem arises because Congress 

did not specify whether it was limited to federal or 

state. And yet you are saying they were -- what they 

clearly meant to do when they said "executive or other 

clemency" was to signal implicitly that it must cover 

state because there is no other kind of clemency. It's

point, isn't it?

 MS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor --

to sit there and say, oh, we put "other" in because we 

know that in the federal system it's only executive, but 

in the State system there might be others.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That guy wouldn't 

suddenly say, well, maybe we should say this is meant to 

cover the State system.

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, these are the words 

that Congress used. They know that the -- that the 

States provide for forms of clemency other than 

executive clemency. We know that -- that Congress 

specifically stated they wanted the defendant to be 

represented in that clemency proceeding that is 

available to him. And in -- in these cases --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we know that they read 

this text carefully before they voted for it, right?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 3599 authorizes federally funded 

representation only in the three categories of 

proceedings specified in subsection (e). At least three 

distinct aspects of the statute's text and structure 

show that the only proceedings included are federal 

proceedings before a federal officer.

 First, as Justice Scalia pointed out during 

the previous argument, the word "federal" does not 

appear anywhere in the statute, including in (a)(1). 

Several other terms in the statute, including the phrase 

"every criminal proceeding," plainly refer to federal 

proceedings and federal proceedings only. Congress 

plainly saw no need to include the modifier "federal" to

make that limitation manifest.

 Second, the statute requires that appointed 

attorneys have federal qualifications based on 

experience practicing in federal court and it requires 

that federal judges exercise significant oversight of 

the attorney's representation. Both these federal 

requirements for qualifications and federal requirements 

for oversight make sense only if the proceedings that 

the qualifications and oversight pertain to are federal 

ones. Third, if Petitioner were right that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make sure I 

understand your position. Does (a)(2) authorize the --

the federal judge to appoint counsel for a -- a person 

on death row under a state death conviction under 2254 

or 2255?

 MR. JAY: For that -- for that habeas -- for 

that person's federal habeas petition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. JAY: -- it requires the appointment of 

-- of a federal habeas attorney qualified to practice in 

federal court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So he is -- he is entitled 

to a lawyer in the -- in the federal collateral review 

of a State death penalty case?

 MR. JAY: In the federal review, that's

correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And what in the statute 

limits the scope of that review?

 MR. JAY: Well, subsection (e) limits the 

scope of that review, Justice Stevens. It specifies the 

types of proceedings that the attorney is -- is 

permitted to -- permitted and, indeed, required to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you agree that (e) 

applies to State prisoners?

 MR. JAY: We agree that (e) sets out the 

scope of services to be provided by the appointed 

attorney during the 2254 proceeding.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In the -- for a State 

prisoner in a federal collateral proceeding?

 MR. JAY: We agree -- we agree with that, 

Your Honor, because we think that term "proceeding" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What, then, in that 

proceeding does the word "clemency" refer to? Is that 

clemency by the President of the United States?

 MR. JAY: We think, Your Honor, that a -- a 

habeas petitioner who is coming to federal court under 

section 2254 has available to him no proceedings for 

clemency because the term "proceedings" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though the statute 

says so in so many words?

MR. JAY: Well, it's -- I -- it's -- the 

menu of services, if you will, set out in subsection (e) 

applies both to lawyers who are appointed under (a)(1) 

who are doing work in federal court for federal 

defendants facing a federal capital charge and also for 

attorneys appointed under (a)(2) who are representing 

habeas petitioners under section 2254.

 Because the term "proceedings" -- it is our 

position -- each time it appears in subsection (e) 

refers to federal proceedings before a federal officer, 

a 2254 petitioner has available to him no proceedings 

for executive or other clemency. That person can obtain 

the services that are -- that are available to him under 

subsection (e), which includes representation throughout 

the 2254 proceedings.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, supposing on the eve 

of execution he wanted to apply for a stay of execution. 

He'd be entitled to representation before a federal 

judge, right?

 MR. JAY: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the federal 

judge says, you have to -- under our practice you can't 

get a federal stay without first exhausting your attempt 

to get a State stay. Could he represent the defendant 

applying for -- in the State court for a stay of

execution in that situation?

 MR. JAY: Subsection (e) would not authorize 

that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So he would have to get a 

separate counsel to -- to go to the State court because 

-- even though the federal judge required him as a 

normal matter of practice to exhaust the State remedy 

under the very limited situation of a stay on the eve of 

execution?

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, State courts 

also appoint counsel --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that, but he 

would have no right to have his federal lawyer get paid 

for doing that work?

 MR. JAY: Would not get paid by the Federal 

Government for litigating a matter in State court that 

may have no connection to federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just for this, for the 

stay application on the eve of execution?

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, I -- it would 

not be a federal judicial proceeding, and, therefore, it 

would not be covered under subsection (a)(2).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It comes in with the --

the general language "other appropriate motions and 

procedures," and so forth. That's got to be tailored

back to mean other appropriate motions and procedures in 

a federal tribunal?

 MR. JAY: We -- we think that the federal 

limitation applies throughout the section --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think that is 

perfectly clear from the text of the statute?

 MR. JAY: I am sorry, Justice Stevens?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that is 

perfectly clear from the text of the statute?

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, I think that the 

federal limitation is apparent from a number of aspects 

of the statute, including the fact that Congress didn't 

use the "federal" modifier anywhere else in the statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It could have used the 

"federal" modifier very easily just by inserting the 

word "federal" in places.

 MR. JAY: Well, if it had inserted the word 

"federal" in some places and left it out in others, that 

might be probative intent -- probative evidence that 

Congress intended the -- the other instances to be 

federal and State as well. But we don't have that here. 

We have -- we have terms that are clearly indicated to 

be federal only in nature such as every criminal 

proceeding in (a)(1).

the scenario Justice Stevens hypothesized that the 

federal defender would in fact represent the person 

before the State court. You are in an emergency stay 

situation. He's -- he's allowed to go to federal court. 

He does so. The federal judge says, you got to go back 

to State court. There's 12 hours left. He's not going 

to say, you know, get another lawyer. He's going to 

represent the person before the state court. And I 

gather he can do that; he's just not going to get paid 

for that.

 MR. JAY: But the -- subsection (e) doesn't 

bar the lawyer from doing that. And two points on that: 

There might be other sources of funding available; and 

indeed, the same lawyer who need not be a federal 

defender -- he may be a panel attorney appointed -- who 

is in private practice appointed from the district 

court's panel of available attorneys who meet the 

federal qualifications.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he presumably --

MR. JAY: He may be appointed as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he presumably is 

spending a huge amount of time and resources on this --

in the nature of these proceedings, and you want to go 

back and say, all right, on this day you spent six hours 

redoing your papers that were filed before the Federal

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he goes back and 

says: Look, you don't get that; you know, you get the 

$15,000 you spent on the last ten days on this but you 

don't get the $810. That -- does it seem reasonable to 

impose that burden on the public defender?

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since you know as a 

practical matter, because of professional responsibility 

that person is going to represent the defendant in the 

State court proceedings.

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, the limitations 

in subsection (e) are there for a reason, and it's 

precisely because the State -- the State post-conviction 

process that would become available under Petitioner's 

reading of the statute is certainly not limited to a few 

hours spent on the eve of execution in State court. It 

potentially could include returning to State court for 

any form of post-conviction process at any time after 

the Federal habeas application is filed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Would we have to reach that

question here? I mean, I don't understand three things 

that you've said. You said it says Federal; I don't see 

any place it says Federal. It doesn't use that word.

 Then you say it doesn't say Federal and State; in my 

copy it does say Federal and State. It talks about 2254 

and 2255. So if I just read this in English, it says 

that once you appoint the person, and it's either State 

or Federal, 2254 or 2255, that person shall also 

represent the defendant in such competency proceedings 

and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may 

be available to the defendant. QED, end of the case.

 All right, now why isn't it?

 MR. JAY: I think it isn't, Justice Breyer, 

because 2254 is not a reference to proceedings in State 

court. A 2254 proceeding is in Federal court, it 

involves Federal constitutional issues and a Federal 

constitutional challenge to the legitimacy of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. That's 

right, because they are referring to people who are 

under State death penalty or Federal death penalty, and 

what it says is that they shall get a person to 

represent them in these later habeas proceedings. And 

then it adds that that person -- and no point quoting it 

again; you heard what I just said -- it adds that that 

person will represent them in clemency proceedings.

Now, is there any reason for thinking that 

Congress ---and contrary to some things mentioned, I 

believe that probably Congressman Conyers did read what 

he wrote. He certainly referred to it enough in 

speeches, and those speeches make very clear to me that 

that is what he had in mind, what it says. Now other 

people can read it differently, but I -- I mean, I've 

read it. I read the language. What's the answer?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought this was a 

Federal law. Is this a Conyers law; is that what it is 

here?

 JUSTICE BREYER: He happens to be the person 

who wrote it, and it's referred to in the Solicitor 

General's brief, and on page 21, I took what you said, I 

went back and looked it up, just as you might have 

suggested I would by putting in the relevant citations, 

okay?

 So having looked it up, as implicitly you 

suggested, I think Conyers knew what he said. I think 

he did mean those words to say what it says, but you can 

convince me to the contrary. That's why I raised it.

 MR. JAY: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did his colleagues know 

what he said?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they did.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Counsel,

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We direct our 

questions to counsel.

 JUSTICE BREYER: My experience in Congress 

is that the members of Congress do know the kinds of 

things that they are voting on; maybe others have 

different experience.

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, let me answer 

your point about Congressman Conyers first, because I 

think that the suggestion in Petitioner's brief is that 

Congressman Conyers was -- had misinterpreted the text 

of his own amendment, and as we have shown, the text of 

the amendment proposed by Congressman Conyers in the 

House and the text of the amendment proposed by Senator 

Levin in the Senate using the same -- using virtually 

the identical language, each of them provided no funding 

for --

JUSTICE BREYER: I think you are wrong about 

that. The reason I think you are wrong about that is 

that that language to which you refer is language that 

Congressman Conyers himself introduced in response to a 

bill by Representative Gekus, and in Representative 

Gekus's bill he referred, just like this one, to both

State defendants and to the Federal defendants. And the 

purpose of Conyers' amendment, which was to substitute 

for the Gekus amendment, was to extend, not to limit, 

what Gekus has done. And he introduced lots of 

information, all of which referred almost uniquely to 

State defendants.

 That's then picked up in the Senate, and the 

Senate, which is Levin, is trying to do precisely what 

Conyers was trying to do in the House, which we know 

from the fact that he said it.

 Now, I can't find anything in that 

legislative history that supports the statement that you 

made on page 21 that this initially was meant to refer 

only to people under Federal sentence of death.

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, the text of 

Congressman Conyers' amendment wiped out the Gekus 

amendment. It replaced subsections (q)(1) through 

(q)(4) of the Gekus amendment. Subsection (q)(4) is 

what you are referring to, referring to 2254 

petitioners. Congressman Conyers replaced that with a 

lengthy piece of legislation that is the predecessor of 

what appears in the statute today, and it made no 

provision whatsoever for 2254 petitioners, even those 

appearing in Federal court.

 Now, your previous question to me, which I

didn't get -- which I would like to come back to, is 

about the 2254 representation. When a State prisoner 

comes to Federal court raising a constitutional 

challenge to his conviction in a 2254 proceeding, there 

is a direct Federal interest and his Federal rights are 

at stake, and it makes sense that Congress was providing 

counsel for the vindication of those Federal rights. 

That is not so with the clemency proceedings before a 

State governor, which are a matter of grace, they don't 

turn on Federal issues, and they don't deal with an 

inmate under a Federal sentence of death.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with 

"other"? I mean, there is no "other" clemency for 

Federal defendants, right? It's just executive 

clemency?

 MR. JAY: We think, Your Honor, that the 

purpose of that phrase, which was added, as I tried to 

explain in my previous answer, was added at a time when 

there was no -- there was no funding available for a 

2254 petitioner. We think the purpose of that language 

is to be as capacious as possible when a Federal 

defendant seeks clemency, and that the -- recognizing 

that the proceedings for clemency in which counsel might 

be helpful might include proceedings that don't take 

place before the Chief Executive himself, and there are

a couple of examples.

 Throughout history presidents have enlisted 

the assistance of various people, including individuals 

who don't work for the Executive Branch.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that, but it's 

still executive clemency.

 MR. JAY: We agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: When a clemency decision is 

made, it's not being made by these other people who are 

helping out the president. It's being made by the 

executive.

 MR. JAY: We don't disagree with that at 

all, Justice Souter, but we think that the phrase "or 

other" was simply Congress' attempt to make sure that 

proceedings before these other officers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Should the Constitution be 

amended it would cover that, right?

 MR. JAY: Should the Constitution be amended 

to permit -- to permit legislative clemency, I think 

that that -- I think that that is right. But at any 

rate, the phrase "or other," we don't think that it's a 

sub silentio or at least a very subtle way of indicating 

State clemency, because as we pointed out in our brief, 

the existence of non-executive clemency in the States 

is -- in every State that has the death penalty,

clemency is a matter -- is a decision made by the 

governor or his appointees or other executive officials.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Jay, would you comment 

on this general reaction I had when I read the statute? 

I had the impression that most lawyers appointed under 

this statute would be to represent defendants in State 

execution cases, and there are a few cases where there 

are Federal death penalty cases, but not very many 

across the whole spectrum. Am I right about that?

 MR. JAY: In terms of the numbers of 

clients, yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're primarily 

dealing with the representation of State defendants in 

capital proceedings, and the number of cases in Federal 

proceedings where at the last minute there is a plea for 

executive clemency is very rare. And you think this 

particular provision we are debating here was really 

intended just to take care of the rare case where a 

Federal defendant is on death row seeking executive 

clemency, and not even to consider all the cases in 

which -- in State -- before -- that originate in State 

trials, where there is a lot of applications for 

executive clemency. You think it was intended to focus 

on that very narrow category?

 MR. JAY: Well, we think the entire statute

is intended to focus on when Federal rights and Federal 

interests are at stake in the administration of the 

death penalty. And in the clemency context, because 

clemency does not actually -- does not involve the 

vindication of a Federal right -- or a constitutional 

right at all, the number of instances where the clemency 

process actually involves such a Federal case is a 

limited --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There are occasionally 

Federal constitutional question and sometimes arguments 

made in Federal clemency -- I mean, in State clemency 

proceedings and Federal clemency proceedings.

 MR. JAY: There are sometimes such arguments 

made but there is no such thing as a Federal 

constitutional right to clemency, and indeed the 

governor is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But arguably there is 

Federal right or constitutional right to a fair 

proceeding in a clemency application?

 MR. JAY: Well, there is a -- in a capital 

clemency proceeding, the Court has recognized a limited 

due process right, but that is not the sort of right 

that would be vindicated in a habeas proceeding at all.

conduct the trial in a capital case, would not have very 

much application either, would it?

 MR. JAY: That's right, Your Honor, (a)(1) 

applies only in federal proceedings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only in federal capital 

cases, of which there are very, very few.

 MR. JAY: That's correct, Your Honor. So 

many of the -- many of the provisions -- even on 

Petitioner's reading, which places great reliance on the 

subsequent stage language -- many of these provisions 

such as pretrial proceedings, trial sentencing, would 

apply only to the limited number of federal death 

penalty defendants.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government's principal 

concern in this case is the possibility to potential, 

assuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of 

counsel in State post conviction collateral proceedings, 

i.e., when there are unexhausted claims. Apparently the 

Sixth Circuit in bank addressed this, and in your brief 

you indicated there is a number of additional claims. 

Is that the principle thrust of your concern rather than 

clemency?

 MR. JAY: It is the principle thrust of our 

concern, I think that's fair to say, Justice Kennedy. 

And that's because the word "proceedings," which appears

three times in subsection E, we think that either that 

is limited to federal proceedings each time it appears 

or it's not each time it appears.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think there is no way 

to interpret that the statute so that it could include 

state clemency proceedings but only federal post 

conviction review proceedings in judicial -- before 

judicial tribunals?

 MR. JAY: We don't see a way to have a 

federal limitation before judicial proceedings and not 

have it before --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, you could. You 

could put all I don't remember weight on the other 

executive or other -- and you could say that's the only 

provision where it's apparently clear from the text that 

State proceedings were included.

 Assuming you are wrong, that there are 

non-executive State clemency proceedings, you are sure 

that there aren't?

 MR. JAY: Well, our position, Your Honor, is 

that in every State with the death penalty, the clemency 

decision is made either by -- in most cases, by the 

governor or gubernatorial appointees or by other 

executive officials. And the Petitioner has suggested 

that gubernatorial appointees for that purpose might be

"other." But, there is -- there are no -- we have been 

able to find no instances of, for example, legislative 

clemency in the capital case. That is limited.

 The constitutional provisions that the Tenth 

Circuit relied on that there is such an institution of 

legislative clemency, that's limited to treason against 

the State, a noncapital felony or mostly noncapital 

felony that we can't find a treason against the State 

prosecution since the 1940's.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course, it would have 

made sense for Congress to use to other -- as a way of 

referring to the states simply because it would have 

been a matter of indifference to Congress whether a 

State process was executive or was other in some way, in 

effect, just leaving the issue open as an irrelevance.

 MR. JAY: I think if your premise, 

Justice Souter, were right, that Congress intended to 

fund proceedings on both levels, then I suspect that 

that is right, that it would be a matter of indifference 

to Congress which form the State clemency process took. 

But we think that Congress intended to fund only those 

proceedings in which there are federal rights or federal 

interests at stake, and State clemency proceedings do 

not meet that qualification.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That still leaves you with

the question that the -- what the words "or other" can 

possibly refer to, given the present state of federal 

law and federal constitutional law, unless they refer to 

State proceedings.

 MR. JAY: Well, the phrase is -- the phrase 

is ambiguous. We turn to legislative history to 

partially resolve that ambiguity, because as we have set 

out in our brief and I alluded to earlier, they were 

added -- they were added at a time when funding wasn't 

contemplated for 2254 proceedings at all.

 Even if that -- even if that weren't the 

case, we would think that because of the impact on the 

federal-State balance that would result from funding the 

State proceedings, that that's not the kind of clear 

statement that would qualify. So I mentioned before, 

one of the two possibilities that we see for what "or 

other" might mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what do you mean 

by the federal-State balance? Because this is funding 

somebody to argue against the interests of the State, 

isn't it?

 MR. JAY: It is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, assuming the state 

has convicted somebody, you are arguing against the 

State.

MR. JAY: That's true, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the federal government 

is funding that.

 MR. JAY: The federal government would be 

funding that.

 We see another instance in which there is an 

impact on the federal-State balance, which is the fact 

that if, on Petitioner's reading, the attorney must 

return -- must go to State court or go into State 

proceedings and continue the representation there, they 

still answer to the federal judge who supervises their 

appointment, supervises their qualifications, and 

determines whether and to what extent they will be paid. 

And of critical importance, the federal judge determines 

when the attorney will be permitted to withdraw. And 

the federal judge may not permit such a withdrawal, 

unless and until the federal judge can find another 

attorney who meets the same qualifications for a federal 

appointment.

 So you would have, on Petitioner's reading, 

an attorney appointed by federal court who would go into 

State judicial proceedings and would be unable to ask 

the State tribunal before whom he or she was appearing 

for permission to withdraw from the engagement. He or 

she would have to return to the federal court for that

permission. We see that as a direct -- direct 

infringement on the State tribunal process.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be clear on one 

thing on your position, Mr. Jay? Is it your view that 

the federal judge may not allow the lawyer to do 

anything in an unexhausted claim, or does he have some 

discretion?

 MR. JAY: Well, I think -- this statute, 

Your Honor, doesn't deal with discretion. It deals with 

shall. And -- so we don't think it is possible under 

this statute. It is possible.

 Now, there is another provision in federal 

court to the appointment of counsel, the Criminal 

Justice Act 18 U.S.C. 3006 capital A, which was in 

existence long before this statute, used to permit 

discretionary appointment of counsel in 2254 cases. It 

does contain a provision for some ancillary 

representation. It is possible that an attorney might 

be able to invoke that provision which has its own 

legislative --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the government's 

position on that issue?

 MR. JAY: I don't -- I don't think we have 

a -- have a position on that issue, because it --

would arise more often than the issue we are fighting 

about in this case.

 MR. JAY: It -- it might, Your Honor, 

because the Criminal Justice Act applies to noncapital 

cases as well. But I have not seen it litigated. And 

so, I don't think we have taken a position on it. But 

that is -- that is a potential source for discretionary 

funding.

 But the suggestion that subsection E permits 

some exercise of discretion because of the inclusion of 

"and other appropriate motions and procedures," I don't 

think that works in this case to cabin the necessary 

implications of Petitioner's reading, because the three 

categories of proceedings are judicial proceedings, 

competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or 

other clemency, and each of the examples from pretrial 

proceedings down through applications for stays of 

execution and other appropriate motions and procedures 

fall into the category of judicial proceedings.

 It is our position that those are to be 

federal proceedings, not proceedings in State court. 

Anything that is on that list, from -- again from 

pretrial proceedings down through -- at least to all 

available post conviction process, that is not 

discretionary, and we don't think that the district

court could decide that even though something were 

available post conviction process, it was not to be 

funded because the district court deemed it not to be 

appropriate.

 And many of the filings that a habeas 

counsel might wish to make in State court, if the 

Petitioner's reading were adopted, would fall under the 

category of available post conviction process, a 

successive writ of habeas corpus or a writ of coram 

nobis, such as the one that Petitioner litigated in the 

Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals while its federal 

habeas proceedings was pending.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all this is dependent 

upon the defendant is showing that he is financially 

unable to obtained adequate representation. And if he 

is in the State court, then that's the answer to it. 

It's the only when he isn't. And I thought in the 

clemency cases, particularly, there was no funds in 

State court.

 MR. JAY: There are some funds on the State 

level, and I would like to come back to how Tennessee 

handles that in a moment. But as a general answer to 

your question, the statute does not make clear that if 

Petitioner can obtain counsel at no cost to himself, 

that he is no longer eligible for federal counsel under

this provision, because he, after all, would still be 

indigent. And I think the situation that occurred here 

in the Tennessee courts highlights the difficulty that 

would be raised by creating a -- by permitting funding 

for State proceedings.

 The Tennessee post conviction defender is 

authorized by statute to represent inmates under a 

sentence of death in post conviction and clemency 

proceedings in State court, and he has discretion over 

the clemency portion.

 The post conviction defender in this case 

declined to use his -- to use his resources to represent 

Petitioner in the clemency proceedings, because he 

determined that he didn't have the resources and he was 

focusing on other cases. So, there -- at least as a 

matter of Tennessee law that that option was available 

to him but it's not been suggested that he was not 

himself financially unable to obtain counsel.

 So, in any instance like that in which there 

is -- there are, in some circumstances, State-funded 

counsel available, I think he would set up -- you would 

create a powerful incentive for the State to say it 

wishes to go second that allow federal -- allow federal 

funding to come first and state funding to come second, 

and for the federal government to respond in like

measure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the government's 

position, under this provision, even if -- even if State 

funding -- well, as you say State isn't covered anyway.

 MR. JAY: Right. Our position, 

Justice Scalia, is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming State funding is 

covered, assuming representation in the State is 

covered, it does seem to be the case that the test of 

whether you get some Federal lawyer appointed is not 

whether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather 

whether you can pay for counsel, right?

 MR. JAY: Whether you as a personal 

matter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can pay.

 MR. JAY: -- are financially unable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's strange.

 MR. JAY: And the ultimate test for 

appointment is also based on when the defend -- at the 

time the defendant is or becomes financially unable, 

there is no reference in the statute to when -- to the 

defendant becoming financially able again. It has been 

interpreted in some instances to permit revisiting that 

financial ability decision, but in circumstances unlike 

what we are discussing here, where the State provides

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't 

really think the fact that this provision was recodified 

helps your argument at all, do you?

 MR. JAY: Well, it doesn't hurt, Your Honor, 

and we do think that it helps because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I see that 

argument, particularly in a gray brief, that strikes me 

as tantamount to a confession of error.

 MR. JAY: Well, I am certainly not here to 

confess to error, Your Honor. We do think that it helps 

our argument because to the extent that there is any 

ambiguity or there is any doubt left in the Court's 

mind, I think the fact that Congress chose to use the 

same words again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were earlier 

resisting the notion that the particular legislative 

history here showed anything because of how broadly it 

may have been familiar, but there is no evidence at all 

that when Congress recodified this language it was in 

fact aware of the different court of appeals decisions 

you cite, right?

 MR. JAY: Other than the general presumption 

that this Court apply ins these ratification cases, 

that's right, Your Honor; we can't -- we can't point to

any particular report or colloquy. The term proceeding 

has to be given a consistent construction across section 

3599(e). Clemency proceedings, judicial proceedings and 

clemency proceedings, we submit, are made clear by the 

text and structure of the statute to refer only to 

Federal proceedings. Adopting Petitioner's reading, 

even if -- even though in this case it refers only to a 

clemency proceeding, would inevitably lead to Federal 

funding for any proceeding on the State level that meets 

one of the descriptions set out in subsection (e). 

Clemency would be a particularly poor candidate for such 

funding because a clemency decision before a State 

governor, which may indeed be initiated before the --

before the inmate comes to Federal court for habeas 

petition, implicates no Federal rights and implicates 

indicates no Federal interests. For those reasons we 

submit judgment of the Court of Appeals should be 

affirmed. Thank you all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay. 

MS. CHAVIS, you have a minute left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANA C. HANSEN CHAVIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CHAVIS: Thank you, Your Honor.

 The word proceedings in subsection (e) is 

given meaning by Congress by the words that Congress

used, and when it says proceedings for clemency, it 

means proceedings for that clemency that is available to 

the defendant. Subsection (a)(2) put 2254 defendants 

and 2255 defendants on the same footing, and if we don't 

give affect to the "or other" language or the available 

language in the clemency clause, then we are rendering 

those words meaningless. We're -- and we are saying 

that Congress somehow sub silentio read out 2454 

defendants from the clemency clause.

 In addition, Your Honor, I just would like 

to point out that giving a lawyer for an -- giving an 

attorney for a person on death row to present a case for 

clemency before the clemency decisionmaker is not an 

intrusion on the States. If it were we would see the 

States lined up here in opposition to our interpretation 

of the case, and they have not done that. In particular 

in this case, the State of Tennessee takes no position, 

and at least four other times this statute has been 

litigated, other death penalty States have taken no 

position. So there simply is no intrusion in providing 

a person a lawyer, and we have heard from 11 governors 

representing seven other death penalty States that say 

it's very important for them to be fully informed when 

they make this life or death decision when they are 

presented with these capital clemency petitions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How often has 

clemency been granted in Tennessee?

 MS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, clemency has been 

granted one time since Furman, that I am aware of, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One time in the last 

how many decades?

 MS. CHAVIS: That would be the last 20 or 

30, Your Honor. We just recently started having 

executions.

 If I -- if I might may just add one other 

factor. Clemency was granted four times in 2008 

throughout the country.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
