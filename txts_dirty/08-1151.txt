CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-1151, Stop the Beach 

Renourishment v. The Florida Department of Environmental 

Protection. 

Mr. Safriet. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. KENT SAFRIET 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SAFRIET: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Today we ask this Court to expressly 

recognize that a State court decision, unpredictable in 

terms of relevant precedents, which redefines 

century-old property rights to no longer exist, violates 

the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. 

The Florida Supreme Court suddenly and 

dramatically redefined littoral property rights, 

converting oceanfront property into oceanview property 

to avoid the finding of a taking. It did so in the 

context of a beach restoration project which could have 

been accomplished without taking any private property at 

all. Given this Court's jurisprudence that a State's 

legislative and executive branches cannot violate the 

Fifth Amendment, we see no reason why the judicial

branch should be treated any differently. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your basic 

position in the litigation in Florida was that the 

Florida legislation violated the takings protection, and 

so it's kind of strange to switch your target from the 

legislature, which enacted this measure, and then say, 

because the judiciary upheld it, the judiciary somehow 

is complicit in this violation by the legislature 

implemented by the administrative offices. 

MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 

Below, the case was litigated as one of a taking by the 

legislature when it passed the Act. 

When it passed the Beach and Shore 

Preservation Act, it contained a provision within 

section 161.141, which is a savings clause, that said to 

the extent the beach restoration cannot be accomplished 

without taking property rights, the requesting 

authorities have to use eminent domain proceedings to 

take those rights. 

At the First District Court of Appeal, they 

agreed with us that the littoral rights were being taken 

by the Act of the legislature and that those had to be 

compensated for. When we arrived at the Florida Supreme 

Court, again, all of the parties were arguing those 

issues, whether there was a physical taking of these

rights or a regulatory taking of these rights by the Act 

and whether the savings clause would apply. 

To everybody's shock, the Florida Supreme 

Court said: We're going to go back to step one and 

decide you don't have any littoral rights. The 

legislature didn't eliminate any protected littoral 

rights that you thought you once had for over a hundred 

years as the relevant precedents in common law indicate. 

So it was that decision of the Florida Supreme Court, 

that said you have -- no longer have property, that 

gives rise to the issue before this Court is, can the 

Florida Supreme Court redefine those 100-year-old rights 

to no longer exist? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Applied in a new 

situation. It was never the kind of situation 

involved here with the beach restoration project. The 

-- the precedent did not involve the kind of situation 

that this case presents. 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor. There is no 

precedent with respect to the Beach and Shore 

Preservation Act as it has ever been applied. We do 

concede that. 

However, there are two fundamental 

principles of Florida law that have existed for more 

than a hundred years, and those are property that must

–- property that borders the mean high-water line and 

must remain in contact with the mean high-water line to 

possess common law littoral rights. If that connection 

is not there, there are no common law littoral rights. 

Common law littoral rights are constitutionally 

protected and cannot be taken without due process and 

just compensation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they're -- they're 

eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the 

water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right? 

When there's -- when there's avulsion, even 

at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen 

that some land between the property owner and -- and the 

water will be owned by the State. 

MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 

Under the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why wasn't this an 

avulsion? 

MR. SAFRIET: Well, because the avulsion in 

this case, Your Honor, was the hurricanes that the State 

cites as the reason for the beaches being washed away, 

and -- and it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, well, well, well. 

There were -- there were two avulsions. One was the 

avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the

-- the rapid replacement of sand. That -- that is not a 

natural, gradual phenomenon. 

MR. SAFRIET: That is right, Your Honor, but 

the -- there is no case law in Florida or no principle 

that says avulsion can occur by artificial means. So 

there is -- the beach restoration, where they placed 

sand on the beach, is not avulsion. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If there’s no case law, it 

seems to me you've lost your case. 

MR. SAFRIET: No, the case law specifically 

says that avulsion is a result of natural occurrences, 

by the action of the wind and the water. That's what 

avulsion is in Florida and has been -- you know, for at 

least 50 years, I believe. It's --

JUSTICE BREYER: They have a new situation. 

It's sort of like an avulsion. It's sort of like an 

accretion. The only precedent of -- you keep talking 

about a hundred years -- it seemed to me some dictum in 

a case called Sand Key, which does say that the upland 

property owner has the right to touch the water. 

So in this case, the Florida Supreme Court 

says the purpose of that was to make certain that the 

upland property owner could go to the water. And so 

here we have a case that assures he can go to the water, 

and they have a new situation, which, as I think

Justice Scalia said, looks an awful lot like an 

avulsion, though of course there are differences. 

So it sounds like a typical common law 

situation. A new situation arises. You try to apply 

old precedent, and they reached the result they did. 

Now, what's your response to that? Because that's the 

argument the other side makes. 

MR. SAFRIET: The response to that, Your 

Honor, is the doctrine of avulsion -- as part of the 

doctrine of avulsion is the doctrine -- or the right to 

reclaim what was lost by the landowner. So when an 

avulsion event occurs, the landowner that has lost 

property has a right under common law to reclaim what 

they lost. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't lose any. 

It just went out the front door there. The land ended 

here, and the new avulsion comes in and extends it 

further. You didn't lose one inch. All you lost was 

the right to touch the water. But the court here says 

you in effect have that right because you can walk right 

over it and get to the water. 

MR. SAFRIET: What -- what was lost in this 

case, Your Honor, is the right to contact the mean high-

water line, and I think there's a distinction between 

the right to contact the mean high-water line and the

water's edge. The Florida Supreme Court didn't address 

the former issue, contact with the mean high-water line. 

That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you have a right to 

walk across and put your boat in the water and swim, and 

nobody can stop you? 

MR. SAFRIET: Right. Across the foreshore, 

yes, Your Honor. And also, as part of the common law 

rights of access --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now you have that right. 

They didn't take that away from you. The statute gives 

it to you. 

MR. SAFRIET: That's correct. We have that 

right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody wanted 

to put up a hot dog stand on this new land, would you 

have the right to tell them they can't? 

MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely not, Your Honor, 

and that's the point I was getting to. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You say “absolutely not.” 

I thought there was a provision in this law that said 

they cannot put anything on that strip which destroys 

your right of enjoyment of the upland right. Now, if 

they put a noisy hot dog stand that keeps you up at 

night, doesn't that violate the statute?

change this definition of property. They can define 

property in the State of Florida as to whatever they 

want it to be, but if they do so and take property, they 

must pay for it under the just compensation clause. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, before this 

legislation, in the seaward side of the land that 

belonged to the State, from the mean high-water mark, a 

hot dog stand could have sat in the water, correct? 

MR. SAFRIET: If somebody wanted to put one 

in the water, yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And someone could have 

stood there, a boat could have docked there, assuming 

that it -- it was a shallow boat. 

You had no control over anyone placing 

anything on the seaside submerged lands that belonged to 

the State, outside of whatever regulations the State 

decided it wanted to impose? 

MR. SAFRIET: We had no exclusive right to 

exclude them from that property. But they could not 

unnecessarily interfere with our right to view or our --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The ECL that has been 

created by this legislation -- you gave up any challenge 

to it -- it was established at that mean water mark,

abandon a challenge to the ECL. What we abandoned was 

any challenge as to where the ECL was placed in relation 

to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, right now, we just 

have to assume that it was -- that it -- it has 

established the line at a point where the State owns all 

the land seaward of the ECL, correct? 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So after this project 

finishes, that hot water -- that hot dog vendor will be 

on stateside land, correct? 

MR. SAFRIET: That is correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No different than what 

exists today, before the legislation, which is if the 

hot dog vendor wanted to sit in a foot of water, it 

could have? 

MR. SAFRIET: It certainly could sit in a 

foot of water.

your actual use rights, pleasure rights, or anything 

else has been changed. What you're arguing is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, such -- such 

boats floating in -- in the water below the mean high­

water mark are available with respect to all littoral 

properties. Isn't that right? 

MR. SAFRIET: That is right, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But what can't happen with 

other littoral property is that folks can't come in and 

lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so 

that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your 

house?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you -- can you 

explain something that's unclear to me from the briefs 

and the records? That is, there -- this -- what is 

referred to as “the foreshore,” was that wet all the 

time? I thought the suggestion was that that was in 

effect beach, public beach, that people could walk on, 

not swim in. 

MR. SAFRIET: The foreshore, Your Honor, is 

typically the land area between the mean high-water line 

and the low high-water line, and depending on the tide 

cycles of the day, some of that foreshore is dry, and 

then at other times --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the public 

-- what -- what was the situation here? Was there a 

strip of dry land that the public has been using? 

MR. SAFRIET: There's -- the foreshore, Your 

Honor, which is periodically dry on any given day and 

periodically wet -- the public can use that, and they 

have always been able to use that. That is State-owned 

land, and they can use that to traverse up and down the 

beach. But, again, because it's wet every day, you 

don't have hot dog vendors putting hot dog stands in the

water. You don't have people laying their blankets in 

the water to enjoy that beach. 

And what we're talking about here is the 

exclusive right to use the dry sand area that stays dry 

all of the time in our case, which in our case was a 

200-foot stretch of beach before this project began, and 

we had 200 feet of beach, and we had the right to 

exclude commercial vendors or anybody else from that 

property. 

Now what we have after that, according to 

this project, is another 80 feet to 100 feet of dry sand 

beach owned by the State where the landowners have no 

ability to exclude commercial vendors or any other 

obnoxious uses of that property. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who owns that land? I 

mean, when it was submerged it belonged to the State. 

And is it your position that the owners in your 

organization, that they have title to that land that was 

once owned by the State? 

MR. SAFRIET: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

It's our position that the State, as a matter of public 

use under the Takings Clause, can condemn that property 

and make a public beach in front of a private one. They 

absolutely can do that.

without condemning it, you say the title is held by the 

private owners even though the title was held by the 

State when the land was submerged. 

MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I'm not saying 

that the landowners own that new 80-foot stretch of 

beach now, as it currently exists. What we argue is we 

own to the erosion control line, which is the property 

boundary that the State created in this case. And the 

State, by operation of the Act, claims title to the new 

80-foot strip of beach. And what we're trying to obtain 

here is the State to go through eminent domain 

proceedings to pay us compensation for the loss of 

littoral rights that they're taking by creating this 

public strip of beach. 

Now, the State may at the end of the day 

say, well, we're not going to claim title to that; we're 

going to reinstate your boundary as the mean high-water 

line -- that would be 80 feet further out -- and no 

compensation, in that case, would be due. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be -- what 

would your position be, assuming you still have title, 

you still have the right of littoral title, contact with 

the water? Would you concede that the State has 

different regulatory interests with respect to that new 

strip of land versus the old strip of land?

It's still your property. The State can

their authority to regulate be greater with respect to 

the new area? 

MR. SAFRIET: As the owner of the property, 

Your Honor? If the State owned that property? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Your -- you 

would still have the title to the property. 

MR. SAFRIET: Okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's still your 

property. You know, the State regulates property all 

the time, in zoning -- would their authority be broader 

with respect to that new land than with respect to the 

old? 

MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

so. The State already has broad authority to regulate 

property already, and then would -- I wouldn't see any 

need for them to have any broader authority for that new 

strip of beach if our members owned it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sometimes -- and I 

don't actually know what the law is on this. Sometimes 

the State builds, you know, sidewalks in front of 

people. Maybe they do it on their own land, and they 

say: We're putting this easement, and people can walk

across it. Would this be in the same category of public 

project? They say, well, it's your land because you 

have a right to the mean high-water land, but we built 

it so we have greater rights with respect to regulation 

than we might have with respect to the natural beach. 

MR. SAFRIET: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

they would have any greater rights to that. I mean, if 

-- if the landowners are the fee-simple title owner, 

then the State has its basic police powers to regulate 

as it would any other land, absent some type of easement 

or reservation of our agreement with the landowners that 

give them greater rights and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The State gave you some 

quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is 

projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, 

because your -- your property is being eroded, which is 

the reason the State went into this. And what the State 

has given you in exchange is that if and when there is

common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line 

would recede to the new mean high-water mark. So, you

compensation. You know, if you go in and ask for 

compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given 

them -- given them this property right in exchange, and 

the difference between that and what they have now is 

two dollars. 

MR. SAFRIET: That -- that may well be the 

case, Your Honor, but, again, they haven't provided us 

the opportunity to go to that trial, that jury trial, to 

argue that these -- the value of this new 75-foot 

stretch of beach on top of the 200-foot stretch of beach 

provides value above and beyond the taking of the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this 

question on Florida valuation. Assume you prevail, 

there's a cause of action for a taking. You have a 

beachfront area, beachfront home, in which there's a 

hurricane and there's a loss of the beach and a sudden 

drop, so that it's now a 60-foot -- a 60-foot drop. The 

State comes in and says the only way we can fix this 

is to extend the beach and make it a larger beach on 

what was formerly our submerged land. And it does that 

that. Under -- and it -- and it has the same rule. 

Under your view, is the State required to 

pay you for the loss of your right of contact to the 

beach, your littoral right, because there's let's say

another 100 foot of new beach? Are they entitled to 

offset that against the enhanced value to your property 

by reason of the fact that they've saved it from further 

erosion and have given you a beach where there was none 

before? 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor, they are able 

to offset that, and the -- the statute provides for that 

offsetting such that in an eminent domain proceedings 

whatever value the landowners lost as a result of their 

-- losing their contact with the mean high-water line, 

that any benefit provided by the additional sand would 

be offset --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the enhancement from 

the post-project benefit is a credit to the State in the 

takings action? 

MR. SAFRIET: That -- that is according to 

the statute that was passed, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did any of these beachfront 

owners think this was a good deal, that the State has 

prevented further erosion of their land and, you know, 

the price they pay for that is that they have this 

60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and 

that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're 

lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back?

if it's all covered by water.

was a good deal? Everybody thought that they had been 

done out of something?

hurricanes constantly, you know, I -- I'm not sure 

whether I wouldn't -- wouldn’t want to have the sand 

replaced, even at the -- at the cost of having a 60-foot 

stretch that the State owns. 

MR. SAFRIET: I think that's the fundamental 

misunderstanding in this case. The beach was not 

eroding. It was not lapping under these houses. There 

was 200 feet of dry beach, and the beach is accreting, 

meaning it grows gradually, day by day or week by week.

hurricanes. But hurricanes are, again, avulsive events 

that don't change the property boundary line. We talked 

about the right to reclaim earlier. So this is an a 

accreting beach, 200-foot accreting beach. These 

property owners did not view that they were gaining 

anything.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the State sell 

this new land to somebody else? 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes. There's no reason they 

couldn't, because they own the fee-simple title to it, 

as well as they could send the sovereign submerged lands 

in front of the property. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it would be subject to 

the easement that the State acknowledges you have, which 

is the easement of access?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. As I understand 

the supreme court's opinions, you have several special

law littoral rights: right to have access, right to 

reasonable use of the water, right to accretion and

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the hypothetical is 

the State says that the property owner, the upland 

owner, has these rights. The Chief Justice asked you, 

could this property be sold? I think the answer would 

be yes, but it would be subject to the continuance of 

that easement in the dominant estate. That has to be 

the answer under the supreme court's opinion. Now, you 

may not agree with that. 

MR. SAFRIET: Under the supreme court's 

opinion, yes, because it purports to reserve common law 

rights across this new stretch of State-owned beach. 

It's our contention that all common law rights have been 

lost when we lose connection to the mean high-water 

line. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. That gets to

thing as a judicial takings, what is the standard by 

which we decide when the Federal courts can and must

to characterize it as a taking when the State has said 

that it is not? Would we just find all sorts of 

adjectives -- it’s sudden, unexpected, unfounded -- we 

just have a string of adjectives, sort of like an 

adequate independent State ground rule or something? 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Your Honor, that would be 

the test that we would suggest, as Justice Stewart noted 

in his concurring opinion in Hughes. And the test we 

would propose is that a judicial taking occurs when a 

State court effects a sudden and dramatic change in 

State law, unpredictable in terms of relevant 

precedents, that have no fair or substantial support in 

well-established background principles of State law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, I'm familiar with 

that opinion. Now, in this case, number one, it seems 

to me that in order to do that, we have to become real 

experts in Florida law. 

Number two, once we do that it seems to me 

that this opinion really addresses something that's --

that's new, and it's -- it’s grounded in common law 

doctrines. It's a close case. It might have gone 

either way. Let's assume that. Does there have to be 

some finding that the State decision is clearly 

unreasonable? I mean, if it's a close case, does the 

State win under your test?

MR. SAFRIET: Your Honor, I think the test ­

- again, the fair and substantial support -- provides 

adequate deference to the State court. And in 

objectively reviewing the precedents, this Court doesn't 

have to become an expert in State law. It merely has to 

review those precedents to make sure that the Florida 

Supreme Court in fact relied on background principles of 

law rather than creating nonexistent rules of State 

substantive law --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that, 

reading the opinion, I -- I can get there. There was 

some talk about the Belvedere case as helping you. I 

thought it did not at all. That was a very odd case 

where the easement is wholly separated from the 

dominant. It's the reverse. They take the main 

property and leave the easement, rather than vice versa. 

So I just thought that was irrelevant. 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, the case law, Your Honor, 

and the incremental changes that we are dealing with 

here that would be part of your test is the government 

or the State can gradually change these property rights 

or property laws so long as they leave the owner with 

the rights. And in this case what the Florida Supreme 

Court has done is said: We're not just gradually 

changing them and leaving you with these common law

Let me go ahead and address some issues that 

have come up about Florida law. Number one, this idea 

of artificial avulsion that was discussed earlier, the 

Bryant v. Peppe case, which cites the Martin -- that was 

discussed in the Martin case, talks about when the State 

comes in on its own property and either lowers the water 

or, in this case, puts sand on the -- on the State side 

of the property line, that that's an artificial 

avulsion, the State retains title to its State lands, 

the upland owner, the private property owner retains 

ownership of their land. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it depends 

on -- or maybe not -- how quickly it all happens. I 

mean, if the State project is such that they add a foot 

a year, is that an avulsion or accretion? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, it would be an avulsion. 

It would still be the State adding sand to its side of 

the line. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is your view 

whenever the State does it, it's an avulsion? 

MR. MAKAR: If it's on -- if it's on its 

property, that's absolutely the case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I thought 

avulsion by definition is a sudden change. 

MR. MAKAR: No, no. Under, Florida Law the

Bryant v. Peppe case, which was an avulsion case that 

arose out of a hurricane, where there was land that 

was previously submerged, it came up, it was over State 

property, the private owners wanted to get the -- get 

it, and they asserted that it was theirs in accretion, 

and the court said no, and it cited to Martin. There’s 

no right to having contact with the water. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- you're -- we're 

wandering off the point. Why wasn't it an avulsion? It 

was an avulsion in that case, wasn't it, because it was 

sudden? 

MR. MAKAR: But it was done by the State. 

I'm sorry, maybe I'm confusing cases. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is --

MR. MAKAR: Martin --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a case for the 

proposition that an -- what would otherwise be an 

avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State? 

MR. MAKAR: Oh, no, no, no. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or vice versa. What would 

otherwise be an accretion is an avulsion if done by the 

State? 

MR. MAKAR: No, no, no. An -- an accretion 

would have to be a sudden, imperceptible change in the

of accretion and avulsion to things that are done by the 

State? If someone owns beachfront property, they 

accept -- they -- they understand the risk that a 

hurricane may cause avulsion, a hurricane may knock down

knock down the house and say this is an artificial

applied it to things that are produced by the State. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, there's no question under 

Florida law that the State has the right on its 

sovereignty lands to control those lands and use those for 

the public trust. And what the Florida legislature did 

40 years ago -- keeping in mind this has been on the 

books 40 years, 200 miles of beaches have been restored 

over those years, and no one has complained that this is 

a taking of property. That -- it's a reasoned response 

for the Florida Supreme Court to come in and say, okay, 

they're challenging the Act. They say it denies 

them two things: the right to future accretion and the 

right to have contact with the water. 

Martin v. Busch and Bryant v. Peppe say, 

look, if -- you don't have a right of contact with the 

water, if you have avulsion or if you have it in -- in 

Martin, it was a State drainage project. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I can -- we're 

arguing about the application of a doctrine to this 

case. I’d like to step back if I can and talk about 

the doctrine through a hypothetical, if that's all 

right.

beachfront property is now where the sand starts, and 

not the mean high-water mark but the mean high-sand 

mark. All right? And -- and then -- so that's sued. 

You -- you sue under that, and the court says: Yes, of 

course, that's a taking; our precedents have always said 

it's the mean high-water line and nothing else. 

Florida has judicial elections. Say, 

somebody runs for election for the Florida Supreme Court 

and says: I'm going to change that law. I'm going to 

say that it is not a taking. I think people should be 

able to walk right up to the land. 

And that person is elected, and the law is 

changed. Now, is -- is that a judicial taking? 

MR. MAKAR: I think under the scenario 

you're posing that's a possibility. That's where the –-

or is it a clear case? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I think it would -- if 

it -- if it’s -- it sounds like this is the Cannon Beach 

situation, where the court judicially said, okay, you 

don't own to the mean high-water line; now you own up --

only up to the vegetation line. Or something along 

those lines where it was an ouster. Here there’s no 

ouster of property rights.

MR. MAKAR: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand you 

have a different view about here. But under my 

hypothetical, would you agree that the action of the 

Florida Supreme Court is a taking? 

MR. MAKAR: Yes, I would -- I would 

countenance that -- that here we have a far different 

situation, which we have an act of the legislature that 

draws this line, and that the two attributes that they 

are claiming have no basis whatsoever in background 

principles of Florida law. There is no case they can 

point to, to say that we have a right of contact --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they say is the 

following -- this is what they say, I think: They point 

to a case called Sand Key, and in Sand Key it says 

littoral property rights include the following vested 

rights: One, the right of access to the water, 

including the right to have the property's contact with 

the water remain intact. That's what the court said. 

And in the court's opinion what it says 

about that is it says, in this case, the Act expressly 

protects the right of access to the water, which is the 

sole justification for the subsidiary right of contact.

Key, and that's what they come up with. 

Now, after this sentence I just read you, 

there is no citation. So I want you to add anything you 

would like to say why this is, that sentence I read you,

MR. MAKAR: Oh, sure. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm right, and 

if I am right, that that is meant to be the answer, 

justify it, if you can. 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. What they're citing to is 

some dicta in Sand Key that had nothing to do with the 

holding of that case, and if you try to go back and look 

at the citations to the cases that Sand Key cites for 

that proposition of contact with the water, none of them

have to do with contact with water. 

Instead, the most important point is to look 

at Martin v. Busch, which was a case where the State 

lowered the water in a lake, the upland owners at -- the 

property line was determined not to have moved, they 

didn't have any contact with the water any longer, and 

the submerged sovereignty lands became the State's 

property. There's no right of contact there. It’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sand Key's statement 

strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think 

that's -- that's the view of the common law. I -- I 

don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida. I 

think it would be very strange to have a principle that 

all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to 

access the water and not the right to be on the water, 

to have his property on the water. 

I think -- I think in every State, 

beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that 

that's the case. 

So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key 

was just expressing what -- what was the common law. 

And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the 

contact with the water is so that you can have access, 

that is -- is that not silly? 

MR. MAKAR: No. Well, two points here I

would like to make. Number one, let's assume there was 

an avulsive event that added sand on the State's 

property along the beach line, so now we have the 

property line not changing, it's exactly where it was 

before, but now we have, say, 75 feet of sand, new sand 

seaward, over the State's property. That's the State's 

property --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the 

question. I mean, you just said that, let's assume the 

-- assuming the property line doesn't change. The other 

side is saying the property line is the mean high-water 

line, and so if you -- whoever adds sand, the State, 

mother nature, you dumping it -- I guess you can't do 

that, but whoever adds it, the property line is the mean 

high-water line. 

MR. MAKAR: But -- but -- well -- but under 

this avulsive event where there is sand added seaward, 

the contact by the upland owner with the water no longer 

exists, and that's been on the books in Florida for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's 

because you think the property line is the ECL rather 

than the MHWL. 

MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

at common law in Florida. If the sand is added through

avulsive events, the upland owner has no contact with 

the water any longer. They certainly have access. And 

the Florida Act is so solicitous of protecting the 

property rights of riparian ownership. You go through 

the statute, and you see they preserve common law 

littoral -- littoral rights. They have a section --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that person still be 

considered a littoral owner? 

MR. MAKAR: That was my second point. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: After there has been the 

avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60 

feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a 

riparian owner? I thought --

MR. MAKAR: Absolutely, absolutely. And 

that's a major misnomer in this case, is that the upland 

owner here, even after the beach restoration project, 

has riparian littoral property. That's what the Florida 

Supreme Court has held, that's what the Florida 

legislation says. There’s --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's not 

-- it's not the same as the property right he held 

before, right?

MR. MAKAR: But it's not his -- it's not 

their property. It's the State's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, that's what 

the case is about. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I -- I agree that's what 

they have tried to make it about. What they've said is 

the State now has this swath of sand. It's a barrier to 

protect against erosion. It's no wider than this 

courtroom. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose that --

suppose that a city decided that it wanted to attract 

more students who are going to the beach in Florida for 

spring break, and so therefore it decided it was going 

to create a huge beach in front of -- of privately owned 

homes. Under the decision of the Florida Supreme Court, 

I don't see anything that would stop the city from doing 

that. So you could have -- you could have televised 

spring break beach parties in front of -- of somebody's 

house. Now, in -- as a practical matter, doesn't that 

have a real effect on the value of the property? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Alito, in 

response, what I’d say here is keep in mind this is the 

Beach and Shore Preservation Act. It isn't designed to 

create some recreational playground for spring breakers.

consist of would permit this to happen, if not under

were some other act where the legislature passes a 

law --

Spring Break Act of 2010, okay?

case? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, they -- they would, but 

the point being is that they would have to preserve the 

littoral rights of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why do we have to say 

that? I mean, they're writing a -- a -- an opinion here 

against a background of an act, and as I read that 

opinion -- you can add something to this if you want --

I make a list of what they say in effect provides, not 

perfectly, but provides, roughly, the same kind of 

protection that the Sand Key statement provided. 

One, you can go to the water; two, you have 

a right of ingress and egress, if that's any different 

from the first. I'm not positive. Three, you have a 

right under the Act that nobody can put anything on that 

strip which is injurious to the upland owner. All 

right? 

So those are at least three things, and I 

think there's a fourth. Yes, the fourth is that nobody 

can build anything there that is harmful, except if it's 

to do with the environment; that's not harmful, that's 

helpful to the beach owner. It's supposed to be 

helpful. And, five, you get your beach guaranteed. 

So all of those things are things you get 

under this Act in an intermediate case where it's a

little like an avulsion and a little not like an 

avulsion. Now, do I add anything to my list? And do 

you have to go beyond that? 

MR. MAKAR: No, well, there's -- there's 

even more, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, that's what I wanted 

to know. What more? 

MR. MAKAR: What the legislature in Florida 

did as well is to say that when they do the survey, as 

you see in the document attached in the joint appendix, 

they have to set out what the width of the berm will be, 

the sacrificial sand that's there to erode away over 

time. They put the width in there. And in this 

particular instance, it's about 75 feet. And it's going 

to erode away. That cannot be increased without the 

consent of the owners. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why doesn't --

why don't you take your list and Justice Breyer's list 

and submit that in the just compensation hearing? When 

the landowner comes in and says, look, you have taken my 

property and it is worth $100,000, and you come in and 

say oh, no, no; it's not worth $100,000; look at all 

these things we saved and gave you. It's only -- what 

you have lost is only worth $20,000. And a court will 

review that and say yes, no, whatever, and that's what

MR. MAKAR: Well, because, Mr. Chief 

Justice, under background principles of Florida law, 

they have no right to contact with the water, and this 

accretion right is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, that is what 

the whole case is about, whether they have a right to 

contact the water or not. It seems to me if your only 

answer to every question is they don't have the right, 

you're just completely begging the question. 

MR. MAKAR: But under -- with due respect, 

under Florida law, they don't. And the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, isn't the question 

here that the reason they don't under Florida law is in 

a situation where the law isn't clear, we draw the 

Florida law this way rather than that way, and that is a 

reasonable common law decision because of the six points 

that we've listed on the list? 

MR. MAKAR: Absolutely. Given this --

JUSTICE BREYER: So it's not that it's a

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know the answer to 

the question that was asked of your colleague? That is, 

here we have an organization representing several 

landowners. Is there any indication about how these 

beachfront owners in these communities -- what their 

view is, that they are benefited, that they are harmed? 

Is there any indication of that? 

MR. MAKAR: Other than these Petitioners, 

Justice Ginsburg, no one has complained about this and 

said that -- and brought an action or -- or otherwise. 

This is a very beneficial program. It's basically a 

beachfront property protection act, so it's sort of 

anomalous that anyone would complain. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the problem with the 

argument that I'm having is that in the last colloquy 

with Justice Breyer, we heard how reasonable this act 

was. That's one thing. But you have taken the position 

that it's your property and you can do with it what you 

want anyway. Now, maybe in this case it won't make a

-- the spring fling, the spring break --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- hypothetical, or a 

permanent oceanography museum? 

MR. MAKAR: Sure, Justice Kennedy. We have 

cases in Florida, for example, where a bridge was built 

entirely across the view of the -- of the river, and the 

upland owner in that situation had a total impairment of 

their right to view, and that's compensable. So -- so

law if enjoyment of the view and access is substantially

impairment. There's cases that say that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So on behalf of the 

State, you concede if any of this list -- these -- the 

list of good things that the land owner gets, if the 

legislature next year takes them away, that would be a 

taking? 

MR. MAKAR: Sure, if they took away the --

the swath of littoral rights or a substantial portion, 

that would be highly problematic and likely be a taking. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that either 

all of the time or some of the time a public beach 

would -- that intervenes between the upland and the 

water would be a substantial impairment of the upland 

owner's rights? 

MR. MAKAR: No, no, no. The -- the State 

owns the beach, and let me make this analogy. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that's exactly my 

point. You say that the State owns the beach, and it's 

okay because there's a protection against unreasonable 

use. And I'm asking whether or not a State beach with, 

what do you call them, port-a-johns and hot dog stands 

and so forth, isn't a substantial impairment of the 

upland owner's use? And you say, well, the State owns 

it --

your earlier argument that we don't need to worry 

because there can be no interference with substantial 

enjoyment. And it seems to me that Justice Alito's 

question has still not been answered in your argument. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I believe the answer is 

that this is a facial challenge. There could be an 

as-applied challenge. Keep in mind, the association 

here owns no property. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to talk to me 

about what the constitutional law ought to be in this 

case as a general matter. We'll figure out facial and 

-- and as-applied later. I still see that your argument 

leaves open this question in my mind raised by the 

concerns that Justice Alito has expressed. 

MR. MAKAR: Well -- and the Florida Supreme 

Court was very careful in narrowing its decision and 

saying that the actual property owners may pursue, if 

they feel -- beyond this opinion, they may pursue an 

as-applied claim, where they -- this has no takings 

record before this Court whatsoever, and that would have 

to be developed, keeping in mind that much –-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But when they do, they're 

going to be met by you when you're in the trial court 

and you say the State owns the property.

From the outset, this case has been a

that is the way I think it is most useful for this Court 

to approach it. Rather than seizing on particular 

statements in the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court 

and regarding the Florida Supreme Court's judicial act 

as itself a taking, it's best to focus on the Act 

itself. 

And with respect to the Act itself, what --

what has happened here is the State has exercised, not 

just sovereign regulatory rights; it has exercised 

critical sovereign proprietary rights. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, that's 

a clever ploy. We're talking about judicial takings and 

you say, don't look at what the court did; look at what 

the legislature did. That changes the whole ball game. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but -- but, in 

fairness, first of all, that's how this case originated, 

was a challenge --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no choice. 

If their argument is what the court did constituted the 

taking, they couldn't have raised that earlier --

MR. KNEEDLER: No. My --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and said, oh, we 

think we know that the court is going to change things.

It is that what -- what is -- what is being objected to 

here is a -- is a -- this was not a judicial 

declaration, for example, that somebody who has littoral 

property can walk up to the edge of the water and can't 

touch it. There was no abstract declaration on littoral 

rights. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Judicial -- judicial 

taking if that were the case? 

MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that would be more 

like Hughes. I'm not sure that I would analyze it as a 

judicial taking. I think another way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- to come at this --

and this may even be suggested in -- in Justice Scalia's 

dissent in the Cannon Beach case -- is that the -- the 

usual principle that where State law is interposed in a 

way that would -- would defeat a Federal constitutional 

right, a court can look to see whether there is a fair 

and substantial basis for it. 

That's not really a -- there's no need to 

fashion a new judicial taking doctrine when you have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? Because --

because what they said is: We have a right to touch the 

water, and you've taken it. That's what they said this 

Act does.

MR. KNEEDLER: Right, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: The court said: You've 

never had that right. And it's just like a person who 

owns 40 acres in the middle of Vermont, and the State 

wants to build a nuclear power plant, and they say, you 

have to pay us. No, says the State. And the court of 

the State upholds it on the ground there is an implicit 

easement under Blackstone to take land for power plants 

without paying for it; it's called the power plant 

easement. Okay? 

Now, in such a case, it would be the 

judicial taking because their ground is not -- whatever 

you normally have, but their ground is you never had

Now, how -- if that ever were to happen --

and that probably, perhaps, is not this case, but if 

that ever were to happen, wouldn't there have to be a 

remedy under the Constitution for it? 

MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and maybe so, but --

but, again, I think it -- it would be possible to -- to 

review it under the general principle about whether a 

State interpretation of State law that would defeat a 

claim to Federal right would be without any fair or 

substantial basis, without -- without saying that the 

supreme court itself has committed an unconstitutional

act. It -- it could be looked at that way. 

But if I -- but if I could turn to the --

the operation of this statute, what -- what has happened 

here is -- as this Court has recognized in numerous 

cases, the authority of the State over its submerged 

lands is a critical aspect of sovereignty. It is held 

in trust for the public and for public uses, and what 

has happened here is the State, with respect to its own 

sovereign lands, has filled that land. That does not 

change the ownership of the sovereign lands. 

They remain sovereign lands, and the State 

has done it for a critical public purpose, to protect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Accretion --

accretion, of course, would change. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Accretion --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would take 

submerged State land and give it to the landowner. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Accretion would, but -- but 

avulsion or rapid change would not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a foot -- I'll 

get back to what I raised earlier. A foot a year, if 

the State does it and it's a foot a year, does the 

property owner get the foot, or does the State get the 

foot?

but I think it depends. The -- the Florida Supreme 

Court's decision in Sand Key was a situation where the 

State had -- had erected a jetty or an offshore 

structure that caused sand to accrete on the -- on the 

property, and the Florida Supreme Court said that 

belongs to the littoral property owner under the 

doctrine of -- of accretion. 

On the other hand, if the State came along 

once a year, on one day, and added a foot, that would 

not be gradual and imperceptible, but would be quite 

perceptible because the State would have added a foot of 

property. And even though it's a small avulsion, I 

think it -- I think it would still count as an avulsion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it makes a 

difference whether it's done in a day or done in a 

month? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the difference 

between accretion and avulsion is whether it's gradual 

and imperceptible or whether it’s -- whether it’s 

dramatic or --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What authority is there in 

Florida law or in general law to say that the act of 

an -- an artificial person is an accretion or avulsion, 

instead of just an act of nature? What -- what case do 

I read or authority do I read?

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Florida Supreme 

Court's decision in the -- in the Peppe case relied on 

Martin v. Busch, which -- I agree with Justice Scalia, 

it's very critical here, where there was State action in 

draining the lake, which exposed the surface -- the --

the formerly submerged land, and the Florida Supreme 

Court said that land belongs to the State, it was action 

by the State in a dramatic way. 

And Florida --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but did they call 

it an avulsion? 

MR. KNEEDLER: They -- they did not there, 

but in -- but in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that -- so that 

doesn't answer my question. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, but my point was, in 

Peppe, where -- where there was actually an avulsion, 

the court characterized what happened in Martin v. Busch 

as an avulsive act. But you don't need to label 

avulsion, because there's a separate doctrine that when 

the State fills its own land, it remains its own land. 

And I’d like to point out -- this is not 

a unique doctrine --

I agree, Martin v. Busch seems to be the case that's 

most -- provides the greatest support for what the 

Florida Supreme Court did here. But what do we do about 

the fact that the Florida Supreme Court didn't rely on it?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think it is 

surprising, although the Florida Supreme Court did 

discuss avulsion, but if -- if I could just make one 

point. This is not a -- a unique notion in Florida law. 

This Court's decision in 

Hughes v. Washington, which dealt with accretion, 

responded to the -- to the point that was -- that was 

made there and said, well, the -- the littoral property 

right is vulnerable anyway because the owner of the 

adjacent submerged lands can always take action on his 

own lands that could affect what the upland property 

owner did. 

And this -- and this Court said, yes, that's 

right, but we're talking, here, about natural causes. 

And in -- in Hughes, the Court cited two cases, one in 

Washington State, for example, where the -- where there 

was an absolute right to fill the submerged lands even 

if that completely cut off access. 

It also pointed out another case, from New 

Jersey, where -- where the -- a case of this -- from 

this Court, where the Court said, you have a right to

MR. KNEEDLER: But once the land --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What --

what is your view on the hypothetical I posed to your --

to your friend? The legislature moves it to the 

vegetation line. The State supreme court says that's a 

taking. Somebody runs for election to the State supreme 

court, saying, I'm going to change that. He's elected. 

He changes the law. 

Is that a judicial taking? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Again, I think I would 

analyze it under the fair and substantial basis. But, 

yes, if there -- if there is no justification in 

background law, if it's basically pretextual in the 

same way that -- that any --

it's not pretextual.

I mean, if -- if there's just -- if there's 

just -- if it's just ipse dixit. But there -- but 

there -- but that’s by no means true here. And it's 

important that Martin v. Busch was cited in the two --

and distinguished in the two principal cases on which 

the Petitioner relies here. 

In Sand Key, the court distinguished Martin 

v. Busch on the ground that in Sand Key it was an 

accretion, but -- and it distinguished Martin v. Busch 

on the -- on the ground that there it was a -- it was a 

sudden, dramatic action by the State, and the -- and the 

same thing was also true in the Florida National case, 

where the -- the court again distinguished --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- Martin v. Busch on that 

ground. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you have 

answered Justice Scalia's question that there's a 

common -- a generally understood common law right, 

littoral right, to contact with the water? Would you 

say there is not?

access, as long as the littoral property owner remains 

adjacent to the water. 

But what you have here is a neighboring 

property owner, the sovereign, exercising critical 

sovereign rights over its property, which has its own 

property interests, and if under Florida law the -- the 

State is permitted to put sand on the beach -- this is 

-- this is not filling for an amusement park. This is 

adding something that is very germane to the maintenance 

of the beach, for critical public purposes, the very 

reasons --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It could be -- it 

could be adding an amusement park, though, under your 

theory, right? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, it -- I don't think 

there's any universal theory of this. As I -- as I said

in Hughes, where the State had the -- you're balancing 

the rights of adjacent property owners, just like --

just like 

nuisance or other principles do. In Washington State, 

apparently, you could completely fill the submerged land 

and the upland owner had no rights. 

In Florida -- Florida is actually more 

protective than that. It has limited rights. You have 

a -- you maintain a right of view, a right against 

unreasonable interference. So there's no one 

constitutionally based rule. It's a question of Florida 

property law. And the background principles of Florida 

property law under Martin v. Busch and the fact that the 

State owns the adjacent land, I think, not only is there 

-- there is more than a fair and substantial basis here. 

There is a -- it's very solidly grounded in State law.

the principles that the Respondents suggest they do. 

The court in Sand Key said, and in -- and in 

distinguishing the Martin v. Busch case, and I quote, 

"Our subsequent decisions show there was no intent to 

change common law principles regarding the right to 

accretion and relictions in Martin v. Busch." 

And even if it did stand for that principle, 

the Martin v. Busch case didn't discuss whether the 

landowner was entitled to compensation for the severance 

of their waterfront property as a result of the lowering 

of the water. 

What also must be noted here is the State 

is changing the deeds. They're changing the legal 

description and the deeds of the Petitioner’s members. 

These Petitioner’s members own to the mean high-water 

line. They have a right, not only under Florida common 

law to own to the mean high-water line; under their 

deeds, that's what they purchased. And there has been a 

lot of discussion and, I think, maybe some confusion 

about this right to contact the water. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They wouldn't own to the 

mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if --

right? If --

beach had been put in, then their deed would be 

changed, wouldn't it? 

MR. SAFRIET: Temporarily, Your Honor, 

because under the doctrine of reclamation, they can 

reclaim the boundary line that they lost, just as if in 

a case where the hurricane washes sand away, the 

landowner, under common law, the doctrine of 

reclamation, can bring in sand where the water is to 

reconnect to that mean high-water line that would be 

underwater following a hurricane. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, how does that work? I 

mean, I have a beachfront property; I wake up one 

morning and there's a little half-mile island attached 

to half of it, and there we are. Mean high-water mark 

is half a mile away. You say I can reclaim that under 

Florida law? What's that mean? 

MR. SAFRIET: Yes, Florida law allows, under 

the doctrine of reclamation, which is what the Florida 

Supreme Court relied on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which is -- how does it 

work? 

MR. SAFRIET: You'd have to remove the sand. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You shovel away the sand.

his land out to the mean high-water mark. Am I right or 

wrong?

Honor. Under the doctrine of reclamation --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Because? 

MR. SAFRIET: Under the doctrine of 

reclamation, they can reclaim the boundary line. If 

that's by depositing new sand where the water is to 

reach the mean high-water line, where it was prior to 

the hurricane. They can do that. 

Conversely, if sand is washed up as a result 

of a hurricane, they can remove the sand to bring the

water line back to them. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They can go on the State 

land to do that? Because that sand is sitting on State 

land. 

MR. SAFRIET: That wouldn't be State -- they 

can -- the common law allows them to reclaim what 

they're lost -- what they lost, Your Honor. And the 

Florida Supreme Court tries to rely on this doctrine of 

reclamation in this case. It asserts that the State is 

only doing what it was allowed under common law, 

reclaiming the land that it lost. 

But in this case, the Florida Supreme Court 

-- or the State of Florida didn't ever possess any dry 

sand land, so they can't reclaim any dry sand land. The 

only thing they have ever owned was the foreshore and 

the sovereign submerged lands. So that's the only thing 

they can reclaim. 

I think there was another question about the 

support for this case. There is more than five 

landowners that don't support this case. In the lower 

courts, there was another group, Save Our Beaches, that 

had, I believe, roughly 150 members that opposed this 

project as well in the City of Destin. 

In this case, we're also dealing with a 

physical taking.

by the Respondent’s members -- the Petitioner's members 

in this case are now possessed by the State. It's a 

wholesale transfer of these rights, along with the 

transfer of the deed -- or the description of the deed. 

We're not asking this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand why 

isn't it -- it is equally an addition to the private 

property owners' rights when they had a narrow beach and 

now they're claiming that -- that it's all theirs, the 

full 75 feet. 

MR. SAFRIET: I'm sorry, Your Honor, I 

didn't hear your question. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They have, under your 

theory, much more property than they had before. They 

have a wider beach that's theirs, so they have gained 

property, but that doesn't count? 

MR. SAFRIET: Well, they haven't gained
