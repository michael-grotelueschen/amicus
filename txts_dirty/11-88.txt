CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 11-88, Mohamad v. The Palestinian 

Authority. 

Mr. Fisher. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Unlike the previous case, this case does not 

involve the need to formulate Federal common law or to 

survey customary international law. Here Congress has 

expressly created the cause of action at issue in a 

statute. And we know that in every single other Federal 

tort statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has 

provided for organizational liability. As, 

Justice Kennedy, I think you put it earlier, it's a 

simple concept in our country. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We usually like --

MR. FISHER: Of course, the question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We usually like to 

begin with the language of the statute. 

MR. FISHER: That was my next sentence, Your 

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then go ahead. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FISHER: Thank you. But, of course, the 

question arises in this case why did Congress use the 

word "individual"? And we think the answer comes from 

the Tel-Oren case, which is the case, of course, from 

the D.C. Circuit that gave rise to the TVPA. And in 

that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence 

where he again and again used the word "individual 

liability" and "individual" to describe the PLO, which 

was the very defendant in that case, against the 

backdrop of international law, which uses the term 

"individual" to differentiate anyone from the state. 

After Nuremberg, starting with the 

discussions were recited most prominently in our reply 

brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others 

discussed whether international law applies simply 

against states or whether it applies to, quote, 

"individuals." And the word "individual" was used again 

and again to mean anyone but the state. And as 

Professor Jessup and many others said, it includes 

organizations and juridical persons. 

And this is the usage that Judge Edwards 

used in his opinion in Tel-Oren. He uses the word 

"individual" 43 times in that opinion. And if you look

at nothing else --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Justice --

Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated 

terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute. 

MR. FISHER: No. What Judge Edwards 

concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that, as he understood 

the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop 

of international law, that any private actor acting 

under color of law could be held liable. And what Judge 

Edwards decided in that particular case is that the PLO 

as it then existed was not a state actor. But the rule 

that Judge Edwards prescribed -- and this is at page 

793, I believe, of his concurrence -- was that 

individuals acting under color of law should be held 

liable. That's the precise language that the TVPA uses. 

So, if you want to know where Congress got 

the word "individual" and what it probably thought it 

meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion. 

Now, what --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn’t the place --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Really? Congress got it 

from Judge Edwards? Gee, I -- my goodness.

them -- none of them even read that opinion. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think Judge -- Judge 

Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the 

Congress then. It's cited throughout the legislative 

history in the Senate Report, in the House Report, again 

and again in the hearings. 

And this Court -- I think in Skilling, a 

couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute 

before us dealing with honest services. And what did 

Congress mean when it used particular language? Well, 

it probably meant what lower court judges had used that 

language to mean, that it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is a strange phrase, 

"honest services," as -- you know, as a crime, 

deprivation of honest services. But the word 

"individual" is not a strange --

MR. FISHER: Well, it's a strange --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- word at all. It's used 

all the time. 

MR. FISHER: No, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It means an individual. 

MR. FISHER: I think it's a strange -- it's 

a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute 

because we know that Congress always provides for 

organizational liability, and it has never used, to our

knowledge, the word "individual" in a tort statute. So, 

it is odd that it appears here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that better 

for you or worse for you? 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think it's better for 

us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss. 

And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is 

going on. 

Now, what my opponents want this Court to do 

is to look at other places in the U.S. Code where the 

word "individual" is used outside of international law, 

outside of tort regimes. And we concede --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem --

MR. FISHER: -- often the word 

"individual" --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem is I don't 

even look there. I look to the TVPA, section 2(a)(2), 

which uses the word "person." So, it wasn't as if in 

writing the statute Congress forgot the word "person." 

MR. FISHER: No, it didn't. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They appear to be 

using "person" in the organizational way that "person" 

is defined in the Dictionary Act and elsewhere. So, 

isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word 

"individual" in a different sense?

MR. FISHER: No, Justice Sotomayor, for two 

reasons: One is because, for reasons I'll explain, the 

word "person" as it appears in the TVPA actually only 

applies to natural persons. Well, let me start with 

that. The argument the other side has is that the 

word --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Individuals, legal 

representative, or to any person who may be a claimant 

in an action for wrongful death. I'm not quite sure. 

Legal representative is often -- can be a person but can 

often also be a -- a corporate entity. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think the -- I think 

the argument is that the word "person" somehow contrasts 

with "individual." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

MR. FISHER: And, as we've shown in our 

brief, only natural people can bring wrongful death 

actions. They -- they claim -- in the D.C. Circuit 

argued that an estate could. As we've shown in our 

brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural 

people acting as administrator or executor of a -- of an 

estate can bring an action. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher --

MR. FISHER: So, the word "person" refers to 

natural person.

JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, it's obvious that 

"individual" doesn't usually mean what you want it to 

mean. Now, you have a theory that they all just read 

Judge Edwards, and they came in and used "individual." 

But it seems actually that we know where "individual" 

came from in this statute. The statute started out by 

saying "person," and then there was this moment where 

one Congressman said I don't want this to apply to 

corporations, and the staff member said I have a great 

idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations; 

let's change the word "person" to "individual." So, 

that's the way "individual" got into the statute, and it 

got in specifically to address this question. 

MR. FISHER: We don't disagree with that's 

how the word gets into the statute, but the question, as 

this Court has always looked to legislative history, is 

what does that -- what light does that shed on 

Congress's understanding of the law it ultimately 

passed? So, two Congresses later, 4 years later, 

Congress passed the statute with the word "individual." 

And the problem with that --

JUSTICE KAGAN: And "individual" means what 

it means. 

MR. FISHER: And the problem with that 

theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by

the committee reports contemporaneous with the statute 

that say we're using the word "individual" to make 

crystal clear that foreign states and their entities 

cannot be sued. And that's the reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, what else should I look 

at? Because I've looked at the -- I did really -- I 

know I have to go through legislative history. I've 

said it's meaningful, and so I do it. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: And, so far -- so far, I 

think I have to say that you're on a weak wicket. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the word "persons" 

-- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances 

and by people in the civil -- international civil rights 

community who are testifying, where I look at what they 

say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the 

person won't often be in the United States. Well, the 

PLO had a presence in the United States. The person 

won't be in the United States very often. I know, but 

sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take 

a -- make a symbolic step. And not a word could I find, 

when they're talking even about the word "person," that 

suggested they meant even the PLO at that time. In 

fact, they thought, well, it would be a nice thing, but,

but, but, but.... 

MR. FISHER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's the tenor of 

what I seem to have found so far. So, I mention that 

because you will point out to me the things that I have 

accidentally skipped. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FISHER: Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our 

blue brief, Justice Breyer. There are numerous 

references to the word "organization," "group." "It" is 

a word used. 

And, I think, Justice Kagan, this is also 

responsive to your question. Two years after the change 

you described was made, there was a hearing held before 

the Senate Judiciary Committee where both bills were 

being considered. The one bill from the House that used 

the word "individual" and the word -- and the Senate 

bill which used the word "person." 

And one would expect that if people thought 

the word "individual" meant something different and 

limited the class of defendants, that that would have 

come up or somebody would have expressed some awareness 

of it. But to the contrary --

of the House or of the Senate, and I'm not a member of

the committee that engages in all of this legislative 

history. And I -- I see the word "individual" in this 

statute, and that's the basis on which I vote for or 

against a statute. Why should I be saddled with 

whatever sayings by members of the committee or by 

experts testifying before the committee occurred? It 

was out of my hearing. I voted for "individual." 

And "individual" -- well -- if Congress 

wanted "individual" to mean what you say it doesn't 

mean, what word would they have used instead? I mean, 

if "individual" is a code word for person, what's the 

code word for individual? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FISHER: Natural person, Justice Scalia. 

And -- and we've cited many statutes in our blue brief 

that use the word "natural person" in the U.S. Code. 

And this goes to the question -- I think 

this is also responsive to Justice Sotomayor: Why did 

they use the word "individual," instead of "person"? 

Why did they say in the committee reports that the word 

"individual" made it crystal clear that states and their 

entities could not be sued? 

And the reason why is because "person" would 

have left some residual ambiguity as to whether 

something like a foreign city or a foreign county --

think of a foreign county jail that tortured somebody. 

Under section 1983 law, which uses the word "person," 

counties and cities are liable. However, under the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and under established 

international law sovereign immunities principles, 

they're not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, they did this 

to --

MR. FISHER: The word "individual" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They chose that word 

to avoid any residual ambiguity. But they thought there 

was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term 

"individual" meant natural persons or organizational 

entities? 

MR. FISHER: Well, I -- I respectfully 

submit they didn't think about that question, which is 

why I'm standing here today. What they were really 

concerned with was avoiding sweeping in foreign states 

and their -- and their -- and their entities. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were --

MR. FISHER: And they just didn't think. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were witnesses who 

testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA 

would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the 

torturer shows up physically -- those were the words

that were used -- the torturer comes into the state, 

into the United States, is physically present in the 

United States. That was the model that at least those 

witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite 

distinguished witnesses. 

MR. FISHER: There are statements to that 

effect. And, of course, the TVPA does cover natural 

persons if they happen to be in the United States. But 

the comment that Justice Kagan pointed out is the only 

comment that the other side can find anywhere in the 

legislative history. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But let's suppose that is 

true, Mr. Fisher. Let's suppose that aside from 

Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question. 

But we know what the normal meaning of "individual" is, 

and you're suggesting -- let's suppose that they just --

the -- the question of individual versus corporate 

liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word 

that means something. And you're suggesting that we 

should resort to background norms that -- you know, what 

Congress generally does when it imposes liability, 

rather than the words in the statute that they passed. 

And why should we do that? 

MR. FISHER: Well, if the word "individual" 

could only mean natural person, I agree. The case would

be over. But we've cited many dictionary definitions, 

many usages in the U.S. Code, and many holdings from 

this Court and others that have actually found that a 

secondary meaning of the term is singularity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you found no tort --

MR. FISHER: A single unit or entity. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no tort statute uses 

the "individual" to include organizations. 

MR. FISHER: Right. No tort statute uses it 

one way or the other, Justice Ginsburg, which we think, 

if anything, gets you back to the background norms and 

the secondary meaning. And let me say two things 

about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have the --

you have the additional problem, though, that your 

reading gives a different meaning to "individual" in two 

sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same 

sentence: an "individual" who does the torturing, 

subjects an "individual" to torture. 

Now, I understand your argument that you can 

Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but 

how do you subject an organization to torture? 

MR. FISHER: You don't. 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, "individual" in 

the one clause you say means "organization"; 

"individual" in the other necessarily does not. 

MR. FISHER: I don't think it's that they 

have different meanings, but you're certainly correct 

that they refer to different things. But that's no 

different than numerous other statutes we cite at page 

28 and 29 of our brief that use the word "person" to 

mean a plaintiff when it can be just -- be a natural 

person and a defendant when it can be an entity. And, 

indeed, I think, if I don't get ahead of my --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the same sentence? 

In the same sentence? 

MR. FISHER: Yes. Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those statutes you --

MR. FISHER: Yes. Go to page 28 and 29 of 

the blue brief. And, indeed, their whole argument --

and, Justice Kagan, this goes back to your point. Their 

whole argument is when the word "person" was used 

throughout the statute, then it -- then it changed 

meanings in the same way, that it covered organizational 

entities, but -- so, if the word "person" can do the 

same work, the word "individual" can certainly do the 

same work. 

So, the question is why -- I think the

question that you end up with is, given that 

"individual" does have this secondary meaning, does have 

this customary usage that Congress may well have been 

aware of, at least that as this Court often says that if 

there's a customary usage of a term, we'll assume 

Congress was aware of it, why would Congress have done 

what it did and limit this act, unlike any other Federal 

tort statute in the U.S. Code, to natural persons? And 

we submit there is no good reason. 

Justice Ginsburg, you talked about 

statements in legislative history to the effect that 

individual people who are torturers may be found in the 

United States, and that's true. But the TVPA is a tort 

statute. Congress already had on the books immigration 

laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such 

people. 

The only purpose of the TVPA is to provide 

compensation. And in every tort regime of which we are 

aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to 

anything to the contrary in State law or in 

international law -- the way that you get compensation 

in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold 

corporations liable for the acts of their agents. It's 

absolutely understood. And there's no good reason -- if 

you think of the three things that a tort statute is

supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence, and 

accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA 

utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and 

this is the perfect case that shows you how that is. 

Just to start with remedies --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe organizations opposed 

it. 

MR. FISHER: Not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe organizations opposed 

the extension of the legislation to themselves. Is that 

conceivable? 

MR. FISHER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And is Congress ever 

influenced by -- by such lobbying?

perhaps, but you don't find anything in this legislative 

history suggesting that organizations were --

MR. FISHER: But if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I can imagine that 

corporations would have been quite upset by this notion. 

MR. FISHER: Justice Scalia, one would 

expect to have found, over the 4 years this was debated 

and the hundreds of pages of legislative history, some 

clue that that's -- that that's what Congress was 

reacting to and thinking about. This would -- this 

would be an extraordinarily unusual statute, and you'd 

think that one person in the Congress that voted for it 

or in the committee reports that are contemporaneous 

would mention that. 

The House -- the Senate Report has a section 

called "Who can be sued." And what it says -- I quoted 

it to you earlier. One would expect to find in that 

section that, unlike every other tort statute, we're 

restricting the people that can be sued, but they said 

instead --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is the dog that did 

not bark, right? Legislation cannot mean what it says 

unless the legislative history says that it means what 

it says. Right? 

MR. FISHER: No, Justice Scalia, I agree 

that if the word "individual" can have no other meaning 

than that which my opponent suggests, that I lose. But

I'm suggesting to you, and we've cited plenty of 

authority, that there's a secondary meaning both 

accepted in the U.S. Code and in cases, and in – and in 

international law. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But Congress -- as 

you've indicated, Congress focused on the very question 

of whether organizations would be covered or not in the 

context of whether a state would be covered. It seems 

to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against 

you, putting even aside Congressman Leach. The issue 

was there. And if they meant to say, well, let's find a 

term that leaves some types of organizations out, 

states, but not others, we'll just say "individual," and 

people will understand, oh, we don't mean a state, but 

they'll also know but we do mean another type of 

organization, a corporation. 

MR. FISHER: I think, Chief Justice, that 

that's exactly the thought process that Congress went 

through. And I can't do any better than to point you to 

pages --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but it's at 

least ambiguous, and you're saying, well, we want a term 

that's going to include individual persons and 

organizations but not state organizations. And the only 

term that fits perfectly is "individual."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you've been 

saying all along "individual" has a secondary meaning. 

MR. FISHER: It does. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why would they 

have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than 

try --

MR. FISHER: Because it's more precise word 

in international law discourse than the word "person" 

for the reason I described before. If you look Judge 

Edwards' opinion --

JUSTICE KAGAN: How about non-state actors? 


MR. FISHER: Pardon me? 


JUSTICE KAGAN: Non-state actors.

Judge Edwards did it and the way that international law 

scholars and people having this conversation about 

whether people other than states ought to be liable 

under international law was the term that they always 

used. And it's not just -- you don't just -- you know, 

we're not running a West Law search looking for wherever 

we can find it. There in the titles of the articles is 

whether individuals are subject to liability. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, you -- it seems 

to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist 

that "individual" has to have only that meaning. That's 

not what our jurisprudence says. We say that we give 

words their usual meaning, their common meaning. Even 

though they may sometimes be used in a different 

fashion, it's the usual or common meaning that we apply. 

MR. FISHER: There are obviously cases to 

that effect, but I'm --

Justice Scalia, of the jurisprudence where I had an 

argument in this Court. It's about the second or 

successive petition rule under habeas law. And this 

Court has said "second" -- even though where "second" 

has an obvious ordinary meaning, it doesn't actually 

mean that. It has a specialized usage that accumulated 

in the law; and when Congress used that term, we 

incorporate that usage. 

And so, there is case after case where this 

Court has said -- the Morissette principle as a backdrop 

against common law, where this Court has said that you 

do look to usage in prior opinions, prior case law, 

prior discourse, as a way of infusing statutes with 

meaning. 

And if I could just go back to the question 

that I posed, which is why would Congress have done this 

when it -- it just doesn't have an answer for why 

Congress would do this in this particular statute. Now, 

the other side has given a few reasons why Congress 

might have --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But it doesn't really need 

an answer. Suppose we think there is no answer to that 

question because Congress didn't think about it, other 

than Congressman Leach who appears to have thought about 

it and --

MR. FISHER: Well, if you find the statute 

at least somewhat ambiguous for the reasons I've 

described, then what Meyer and other cases say is you 

assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they 

wanted ordinary tort and agency principles, in the --

the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has 

said, of course, Congress doesn't think about all these 

things; and when they don't, and absent evidence to the 

contrary --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe they did. You see, I 

might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the 

Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking. 

It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the 

hearing, "I think it would be best to stay with that and 

just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related 

groups." And then Michael Posner testifies, it says, 

the Government, to the same effect. 

So, there the great advocates of this thing 

are sitting there saying we don't think it should cover 

the PLO; let's not take that step at this time.

MR. FISHER: The question that Father Drinan 

was responding to was whether or not the TVPA ought to 

be extended to private entities that do not act under 

color of law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but he's taking 

that --

MR. FISHER: And at the time --

JUSTICE BREYER: He's taking that -- oh, go 

ahead. 

MR. FISHER: Yes. If you look at that 

quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo 

Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state 

actor. So, what he's saying, if you look at the quote 

in context, Justice Breyer, is that the TVPA shouldn't 

be drawn to sweep in groups that don't act under color 

of law. 

And that issue is not before this Court 

today. We've argued that the PLO now does act under 

color of law, and that's a question for remand. But 

that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I find it hard enough 

to parse the statute without having to parse Father 

Drinan's testimony. I mean --

MR. FISHER: Well, of course, I was just 

responding to Justice Breyer's question as to that 

context. 

But -- but if you go even beyond 

compensation, you know, for compensation you have to 

identify somebody, you have to bring him into a court, 

and you have to enforce a judgment. That's virtually 

impossible against only natural people. Of course, 

Congress would have expected the ordinary rule of 

organizational liability. For deterrence, the 

Respondents' argument is that even if Pirates, Inc. --

and for this case we'll make it Torturers, Inc. -- were 

created for a policy of torturing people abroad, 

torturing American citizens who travel abroad, their 

argument is you could not hold that corporation liable, 

even under its express policy and purpose. 

There's no good reason under deterrence 

grounds why you'd let corporations or other 

organizations cycle individual actors in and out with 

impunity. 

And, finally, in terms of accountability, 

just think about the backdrop, again, with which this 

statute was created. There are some pretty horrible 

groups in the world that actually claim credit and

responsibility in the world stage for torturing or 

killing American citizens; and the idea that Congress 

would have passed a statute that these organizations can 

stand proud in their view and say we've done this, and 

that our statute in the U.S. Code would -- would somehow 

only get their agent, and not the organization or entity 

itself, we submit it just doesn't make any sense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the TVPA is an 

extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and 

it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress 

would want to proceed carefully before establishing a 

situation where the use of the American tribunal is as 

broad as it is under this situation. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I don't -- I don't 

disagree that it's an unusual statute. It's not unheard 

of; just that we've cited in our briefs many other U.S. 

statutes that apply extraterritorially. But remember 

that all the arguments for and against foreign policy 

friction that you heard in the first case don't apply 

here. Congress expressly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, the obvious thing which again 

they said is, look, just -- this is going to bring in 

suits against the Palestinian Authority. That's a very 

touchy issue in foreign affairs, and we don't want to 

have to go that far. And some of the things that are

pulling --

MR. FISHER: With respect, Justice Breyer, I 

would just say if you look back at the legislative 

history, the only conversation that was had is should we 

reach non-state actors. That was the only conversation 

that was had, and that's the conversation you referred 

to earlier. Nobody suggested that if you apply this 

extraterritorially if you enacted this statute, that you 

somehow ought to shirk from the ordinary rules of -- of 

organizational liability. Nobody suggested that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher, one case that 

you seem to have on your side -- you don't have very 

many, but you have this one -- is Clinton, which --

which does read "individual" in the way that you say and 

does it in order to avoid an absurd result, what the 

Court thought of as an absurd result. Do you think that 

this statute is absurd if not read your way? 

MR. FISHER: I don't think -- if I could beg 

your indulgence for one moment, I don't think I need to 

argue that because I think that for all the reasons I've 

given, there's enough ambiguity and there's good enough 

reasons why we would assume Congress meant the ordinary 

rule. But if I had to make that argument, I think I 

could because the only arguments that have been advanced

in the papers are reasons for not having this 

extraterritorial statute in the first place. There's no 

good reason once you have it not to apply it to 

organizational actors. 

And, Justice Breyer, this goes back to your 

comment. It's still a mystery to me how it's more 

problematic in international relations to hold an 

organization accountable -- to not -- to hold 

organization accountable than to hold its -- its board 

of directors on a personal basis or to hold, indeed, a 

high official of a foreign government. Nobody's made 

that argument. 

And if I could say one thing and I'll 

reserve my time, take a good look at the United States' 

two briefs. Their -- the only argument they provide in 

of the Kiobel case is that there's no good reason --

that's -- that's the United States' terms -- why 

Congress would want to have a statute that applies only 

to judgment-proof individual actors and not to agents on 

whom they're acting on behalf of. And we think that's 

exactly right, and that's why Congress wouldn't have 

wanted that here. 

If I could reserve the remainder.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA G. FERGUSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. FERGUSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Congress enacted the Torture Victim 

Protection Act to create a cause of action against 

individuals who commit acts of torture or extrajudicial 

killing under color of law against other individuals. 

Petitioners attempt to inject ambiguity into what is a 

very unambiguous term in U.S. legal usage by referring 

in their reply brief to a supposed subtle definition of 

"individual" in international law. But "individual" is 

not a term of art that has a specialized meaning in 

international law different from its ordinary meaning in 

-- in U.S. legal usage. 

Petitioners' reply brief cites two secondary 

sources spanning a 60-year period, while other 

international law sources, including the Restatement, 

international conventions, and other scholars, emphasize 

the distinction between individuals and private 

organizations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. -- Mr. Fisher 

ended by saying there's no reason Congress would draw 

this line. Why would they want to hold the individual 

controlling officers of an organization liable for

torture, but not the organization itself? 

MS. FERGUSON: Congress was proceeding very 

cautiously and incrementally in enacting a statute with 

extraordinary territorial reach over executive branch 

opposition. It decided to focus on the personally 

responsible wrongdoers who subject victims to torture or 

extrajudicial killing, and it did not go beyond that to 

reach another class of organizations that could be held 

secondarily liable. Congress --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice's 

question was why did Congress do that? What were the 

reasons for that? 

MS. FERGUSON: Congress was focused very 

much on the Filartiga case, where the Second Circuit had 

found that there was a norm prohibiting public officials 

from engaging in torture or extrajudicial killing; and 

Congress wanted to avoid the scenario where you have a 

torturer who comes to our shores; and Congress agreed 

with the Second Circuit in Filartiga that if the 

torturer comes here, he should not be able to escape 

accountability from his victim. If his victim finds him 

in our -- in our country, there should be a cause of 

action. 

But Congress had every reason to proceed 

very cautiously and incrementally. It put its toe in

the -- in the extraterritorial waters when it extended 

universal civil jurisdiction to violations of certain 

international law norms. It did not dive in. As we 

heard this morning in the Kiobel argument, this is a 

very complex area as to what norms are actionable under 

international law and --

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't understand that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many judgments 

under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Filartiga 

-- that -- that pattern, where the individual torturer 

is found in a U.S. jurisdiction? 

MS. FERGUSON: There have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been many 

judgments; how many have collected? 

MS. FERGUSON: Petitioners identified one 

case, the Jean v. Dorelien case -- excuse me -- where 

there was a collection. There may be other cases where 

there ultimately is a satisfaction of the judgment. But 

it's inherent in a statute that reaches foreign 

defendants that often they do not have assets in the 

United States. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wouldn't -- if 

Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it 

include entity liability? The corporation is likely to 

have more money than -- than an individual torturer.

MS. FERGUSON: The -- the situation Congress 

had in mind in enacting the TVPA was adjusting the norm 

against state-sponsored torture and extrajudicial 

killing, where the agent is -- is almost invariably 

acting on behalf of the state; and yet, it didn't create 

an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for 

state sponsors of torture and extrajudicial killing. 

It was concerned with this Filartiga 

scenario, where the U.S. wanted to take a position: We 

will not give torturers a safe haven in our country. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

point that the immigration law takes care of that? They 

wouldn't be able to get into the country. 

MS. FERGUSON: The immigration laws were not 

as robust in 1991 as they perhaps are now. We -- we 

know that the TVPA is premised on the fact that the 

torturer is, in fact, found in the United States 

because, otherwise, the United States couldn't assert 

personal jurisdiction over the torturer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that the 

immigration officials conduct a thorough investigation. 

I mean, is there a box on the immigration form, you 

know -- have you tortured people? Yes/No.

MS. FERGUSON: It's not a -- it's not a 

perfect screen because, of course, torturers don't 

announce themselves at the border as a torturer. So, in 

fact, that's why we have situations where we've had 

these gross human rights violators that end up in the 

United States, even -- in one of the cases we heard, won 

the Florida lottery. So -- so, they do find their way 

to our country. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand 

your explanation of the reason why Congress would draw a 

distinction between an individual and an organization. 

You keep saying that the -- in the case of the 

individual, the individual was here. But the 

organization can be here, too. 

MS. FERGUSON: The organization that 

Congress had foremost in mind was the state. This is 

state-sponsored torture, state-sponsored extrajudicial 

killing. The -- the problem it described regarding 

torture and extrajudicial killing was one of states. 

The legislative history talks about how one-third of the 

states are -- have been engaged in sponsoring torture 

and extrajudicial killing. So those were the

organizations they had foremost in their mind; and yet, 

the statute doesn't impose liability on those 

organizations. It's addressed to the very personal 

wrong of a torturer avoiding accountability to their 

victims in their home country and coming to our country 

and seeking safe haven.

out individuals who subject others to torture, but 

corporations -- we want their money so they should

to protect them from liability to -- for people that 

they torture. 

MS. FERGUSON: I think -- I think the 

question is whether there was a plausible reason why 

Congress would have taken this incremental approach and 

focused first on those personally responsible versus 

extending liability more broadly under secondary 

liability theories. And because the statute is so clear 

on its face because "individual" carries its ordinary 

meaning and the surrounding statutory text confirm that 

Congress was using "individual" in its ordinary sense, 

Clinton sets a very high bar for the Court to depart

shouldn't we have another definition for including 

organizations like the PLO? He responds, "I think that 

we should exclude non-governmental organizations."

MS. FERGUSON: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: "I think it would be best 

to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems 

about the PLO and related groups." 

Now -- but you heard the response to that, 

which really was, if I look at the context, I'll see 

that's less relevant than I think -- than I did think. 

So, what do you think? 

MS. FERGUSON: I think that even the human 

rights supporters who were strong advocates of getting 

this legislation enacted understood that this was an 

incremental approach, that where there was some 

certainty within international law within this area of 

official torture carried out by public officials under 

color of state law, and it provided a cause of action 

for this Filartiga scenario, and even the human rights 

supporters understood that it was important to proceed 

cautiously and incrementally. 

This -- the United States does not tread 

lightly when imposing its jurisdiction over the acts of 

foreign defendants for foreign conduct under color of 

foreign law. That's an intrusion on other nations' 

jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Ferguson --

MS. FERGUSON: And we don't do that lightly.

JUSTICE KAGAN: Your story makes it sound as 

though everybody was really focused on this question and 

made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to 

include corporations. And isn't it, if you -- if you 

look at what happened here, more likely that other than 

Congressman Lynch -- Leach -- in fact, nobody was 

focused on this question. But because of Congressman 

Leach's intervention, the words changed, and the word 

was continued throughout the legislative process, and 

that's the word that was voted on. 

MS. FERGUSON: Well, Representative Yatron 

was the sponsor of both the bill that was marked up 

where "person" was changed to "individual," and then was also 

the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted. 

So, he was certainly aware that "individual" was 

selected for this reason of excluding corporations. 

But, more importantly, "individual" almost 

invariably carries the meaning of "natural person." If 

Congress had wanted the statute to reach nonsovereign 

organizations, it very easily could have used the term 

"person," as section 1983 does. And the notion that 

they couldn't use "person" because it would encompass 

foreign states is not the case when you're dealing with 

"person" to describe a potential class of defendants 

because we presume that Congress does not intend to

abrogate the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. 

And the Dictionary Act tells us that 

"person" is the term Congress uses when it wants to 

refer to natural persons and artificial persons, but not 

sovereigns. So, if the Congress wanted to do what the 

Petitioners claim, they had a very useful term that 

Congress uses all the time to reach that category, and 

it's the term "person." But, instead, they used 

"individual," and elsewhere in the same sentence, they 

used "individual" to refer to who shall be liable. They 

used "individual" four more times in a way that can only 

mean a human being. 

Now, granted, there are exceptions to this 

canon of consistent usage, but they have no fair 

application here. Those canons apply when you have a 

term that has more than one ordinary meaning, and you 

can use them interchangeably without being confusing. 

Here, the ordinary meaning of "individual" is to exclude 

organizations. We regularly use "individual" to mean 

we're not talking about corporations; we're not talking 

about organizations. 

So, in -- so, in the same sentence of the 

statute, to use "individual" to mean -- oh, let's assume 

we know it normally means corporations, and then 

immediately just switch and -- and use it to refer to

human beings would be very confusing. 

And yet, we see Congress very deliberately 

and carefully then switch to the broader term "person" 

when it wanted to sweep in a broader class of potential 

plaintiffs. They wanted to make sure they were sweeping 

as broadly as possible to allow persons who have 

wrongful death claims to be able to bring a suit where 

the victim has died. So, they use the term "person." 

And Petitioners' interpretation gives no 

separate meaning to "individual" and "person," but we 

assume that when Congress uses those terms distinctly, 

they intend to give them different meanings. 

I would just return to the plain text of the 

statute. It's very clear. The only situation in which 

the Court has found that "individual" should be 

interpreted inconsistent with its ordinary meaning is 

upon a showing of absurd results. And here, there 

simply is no absurd result. Congress had every reason 

to proceed cautiously and incrementally in extending 

U.S. jurisdiction over conduct that has no nexus to the 

United States. And it proceeded by focusing on this 

Filartiga scenario, ensuring that the U.S. would not 

become a safe haven for torturers. 

I would ask that the Court give the statute 

its plain-text meaning and affirm the court of appeals.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Gannon. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. GANNON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

By using the term "individual" when 

describing who shall be liable for damages under the 

Torture Victim Protection Act, Congress chose to limit 

the statute's scope to natural persons. That's the 

ordinary meaning of the term "individual," especially in 

legal usage. And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 

this statute uses the term "person" in addition to the 

term "individual." 

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Gannon, suppose two 

people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never 

been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the 

other is a U.S. citizen. 

The position of the United States is that 

the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't? 

MR. GANNON: The position of the United 

States is that the alien may be able to sue. And I 

think that that's going to depend ultimately on this 

Court's construction of the ATS. There are always going

to be differences in application between the ATS and the 

TVPA so long as the ATS is still on the books and has 

any vitality. 

That, of course, wasn't clear to Congress 

when it enacted the TVPA in 1992. It wasn't sure 

whether the ATS was going to be a going concern in light 

of Judge Bork's opinion in Tel-Oren. But rather than 

amend the ATS, Congress in the TVPA decided to create a 

separate statute which provided an express right of 

action both to aliens and to U.S. citizens for two 

specific norms. 

It's broader than the ATS in several ways, 

but it's narrower that the ATS in several ways. So, if 

your hypothetical involved piracy, two victims of 

piracy, then it's quite clear after this Court's 

decision in Sosa --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but two victims of 

torture -- you don't find that to be an incongruous 

result? 

MR. GANNON: Well, I think that is 

ultimately going to depend upon what happens under this 

Court's ATS jurisprudence. And so, it does seem that 

the Court --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm asking about your 

position, the position of the United States; not how --

MR. GANNON: The position of the United 

States in the other case today is that the ATS does not 

include a categorical bar on corporate liability and 

that that -- that has no regard for the theory of 

liability, the locus of the acts, the citizenship of the 

parties, and the character of the international law norm 

at issue. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Mr. Rahim had never been 

naturalized. I guess that was a mistake. 

MR. GANNON: Well, in -- in this instance 

then -- then that would present a different question 

that this Court has not yet been presented with under 

the ATS; and, ultimately, maybe an alien will be able to 

bring a suit under the ATS that he can't bring -- that a 

U.S. citizen could not bring under the TVPA, but that is 

a product of the fact that there are still two different 

statutes. 

The Alien Tort Statute will always give more 

rights to aliens than to U.S. citizens because by 

definition it is only available to aliens. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's the good 

reason --

MR. GANNON: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- for the U.S. to have 

limited liability to natural persons in the TVPA but not

in the ATS context? 

MR. GANNON: Well, I think that there are 

several reasons that Congress could have had in mind, 

although I think that if you read the legislative 

record, that Justice Kagan is probably correct, that 

most members of the Congress weren't thinking precisely 

about this question. Representative Leach appears to 

have been. I think that in the other passage cited on 

page 25 of the United States' brief involving Father 

Drinan that Justice Breyer was looking at before, 

there's an earlier passage that we cite where Father 

Drinan seems to indicate that there may be a distinction 

between the two bills that are pending before the Senate 

at that point because one refers to persons and one 

refers to individuals. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they were thinking 

about that in 1797. I mean, you're saying in the later 

statute --

MR. GANNON: No, I think that in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They were a much more 

perceptive Congress in 17 --

MR. GANNON: No, I think the difference is 

that the ATS has not even attempted to speak to this 

question, whereas the TVPA does. As this Court noted in 

Amerada Hess, the ATS does not define a class of

defendants. Here Congress did define a class of 

defendants, and I think that there are several reasons 

why they ended up with this result, the chief of which 

is that all of the cases that they were thinking about 

at that time had involved natural persons. The 

Filartiga case was -- was the flagship case --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's why they're thinking 

of it. His argument the other way, which I see now, is 

that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are 

not talking about individual versus person; they're 

talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of 

law of a foreign state. And so, they're not thinking of 

that question. 

MR. GANNON: It's true --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if -- and if, in fact, 

it does fall under color of law there, they don't care 

about whether it's individual or person. They've never 

really thought about that. 

MR. GANNON: Well, but the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In fact, the only one who 

thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was 

four bills earlier. And --

MR. GANNON: No, but the reason that they're 

not thinking about it is because the paradigm that they 

were thinking about was the -- the torturer who is found

in the United States who is -- who is walking on the 

streets. There's an individual moral accountability 

that -- that everybody understood needed to -- to happen 

there. 

To the extent that the legislative history 

is referring to groups -- my friend Mr. Fisher referred 

to references in the legislative history to groups and 

organizations. They basically are references to things 

like death squads. And, as a practical matter, even 

today, none of the cases in the Eleventh Circuit that 

are being brought under the TVPA are being brought 

against death squads. They -- the case that Petitioners 

cite in their reply brief, the Drummond case, was not a 

case where the Colombian paramilitary was a defendant. 

The defendants there were actually two corporations and 

a CEO. 

And so, I think as a -- as a practical 

matter, although it is natural for us to think that if 

an individual is liable, then so too is the -- is the 

organization that it may have been acting -- he may have 

been acting on behalf of; but it is not natural to think 

that these type of clandestine shadowy organizations 

that would claim responsibility for such acts, such 

heinous acts, overseas would have a jurisdictional 

presence in the United States.

And I think if you -- as Respondents' 

counsel already noted, because the TVPA requires state 

action, the organizational entity here is usually going 

to be the state, but Petitioners acknowledge that no 

state entity is going to be liable here. 

And, indeed, the result here is not that 

dissimilar to some of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence. 

Petitioners mentioned the question of whether Congress 

was concerned that the term "person" might pull in 

something like municipalities because it could be read 

to bring in sovereigns, but in -- in the context of 

municipalities, under Monell this Court has concluded 

that there's no respondeat superior liability and that 

superiors or supervisors are not liable for the torts of 

their agents; they're only liable for their own 

individual wrongs. 

And so, I do think that there are policy 

reasons why Congress could have said something different 

here, but -- and they may well be encouraged to do that 

by 20 years of ATS precedent that has now, for the first 

time since the TVPA was enacted, started to raise the 

question of whether corporations should be held liable 

under the other statute. 

If Congress wants to disagree with the types 

of policy concerns that were behind this Court's Monell

decision, Congress could reach a different result, but 

we don't -- we don't think that that's a decision that 

ought to be reached through statutory construction. 

Here, Congress used the term "individual." 

It spoke about an individual who subjects an individual 

to torture or extrajudicial killing. It separately 

referred to "person." And Petitioners' reading of the 

-- of the statute actually gets the relationship between 

person and individual, which is quite clear as an 

ordinary question of Federal statutory construction in 

the Dictionary Act, precisely backwards because under 

their reading, "individual" means any nonsovereign 

natural or artificial person, but "person" can mean only 

natural person. 

And so, we think that that is -- is a 

particularly odd reading of the statute in light of the 

Dictionary Act and the statutory structure. 

If there are no further questions, I'd urge 

the Court to affirm.

may, Your Honor. 

First, when asked again and again why 

Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was 

that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach. 

And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to 

have moral accountability. 

Well, an incremental approach doesn't make 

any sense. Yes, Congress did so in the context of 

requiring exhaustion and a limitations period. And so, 

it treaded softly there. But there are numerous Federal 

statutes -- RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism 

Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways --

that apply to events abroad. And they all apply to 

organizations. So, if Congress was going to do this, 

there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do 

it. 

Ms. Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as 

the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment 

was able to be enforced. And the only reason why that 

was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to 

win the Florida lottery. He had hidden all of his other 

assets abroad and won the Florida lottery. 

And is that the statute that Congress meant 

to pass? We don't think so. Moral accountability was 

already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code.

There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code 

that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad. And 

we've cited that in our briefs. 

I know some of you are going to look at the 

legislative history. So, let me say two quick things 

about the legislative history. 

First, Justice Kagan, with respect to 

Representative Leach's comment, if anyone after that 

hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the 

change it had made meant and what the bill meant, it 

would have looked at its report. And if we've cited --

we've cited the committee reports from the Foreign 

Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows 

liability for any person that commits torture. It uses 

the word "person" utterly interchangeably with the word 

"individual." So, that -- whatever -- whatever moment 

happened 4 years before the enactment was long since 

lost. 

And the reason it used ultimately the word 

"individual" and not "person," as I've described before, 

was to steer clear, I think, of any possibility of state 

entities. 

Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell 

favors us. Monell holds that organizations can be 

liable. Now, there's a separate question that you

talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what 

the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be 

according to a policy or practice or whether it would be 

pure respondeat superior. But Monell is on our side in 

this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint 

in this case. 

Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word 

"individual" is used, it obviously means natural persons 

lots of times. But when it does, it almost always uses 

the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity 

or organization. 

And so, in discourse, when you say 

"individuals" or "corporations," yes, you mean a natural 

person. But as the United States points out in footnote 

3 of its own brief, the word "individual" when it's used 

alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise 

to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've 

described before. 

And then, finally, let me say -- the 

questions were asked about the relationship between this 

case and the Kiobel case. And I think it's absolutely 

clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's 

questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the 

Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by 

Mr. Rahim, someone who is tortured, that is, bring a

cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to 

imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute 

saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're 

out of luck; but if you happen to be lucky enough to be 

an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this 

country, go ahead and bring a case in our courts. We 

think that would be absurd. 

So, with those points, if the Court has any 

further questions around the submissions I've made -- I 

guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr. 

Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between 

the word "individual" and "person" in the briefs, and I 

can assure you from have having worked on this during 

the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or 

not estates are people and all the ways that that works. 

But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's 

quite clear, that there is no disjoint between the word 

"individual" and "person." If you look at our brief, it 

will explain why. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

counsel. 

The case is submitted.
