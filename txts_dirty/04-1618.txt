(11:07 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 04-1618, Northern Insurance Company of New 

York v. Chatham County, Georgia. 

Mr. Estrada. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In this admiralty case, the Eleventh Circuit 

held that Chatham County, a political subdivision of 

the State of Georgia, is entitled to sovereign immunity 

in Federal court. That is wrong for at least two 

reasons. First, for well over a century, this Court 

consistently has held that counties and other political 

subdivisions are not entitled to sovereign immunity. 

And second, in the specific context of in personam 

admiralty cases, the same rule has been recognized for 

over 100 years. 

To go to my first point, in Lincoln County v. 

Luning, decided in 1890, this Court squarely held that 

counties and other political subdivisions are not 

entitled to sovereign immunity. There are three, or at 

least three, significant aspects of Lincoln County that

bear emphasis. 

The first one is that even by 1890, the Court 

was able to say that in its own cases it could see 

decades of case law where counties had been a defendant 

without any objection being raised. 

The second was that an important aspect of 

the Court's reasoning was the recognition that when a 

county is sued, the State is not a real party in 

interest, not the real party in interest, which is 

another way of saying that the county is not an arm of 

the State, the issue before here today. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a county be an arm of 

the State for some things? 

MR. ESTRADA: I am not aware of any county 

that has been organized so as to meet the requirements 

that this Court set forth in Hess and other cases for 

an arm of the State. This is, of course, not a 

question of labeling. It is possible that the -- that 

a -- that a particular State would associate so closely 

with a county, so closely control its -- its acts, and 

be on the hook for its liabilities, that under this 

Court's cases it could be an arm of the State, but that 

is not the case here. In fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume it's -- I 

assume it's sort of a -- a case-by-case inquiry. In

other words, the county could be an arm of the State 

for some purposes but not others. 

MR. ESTRADA: That is -- that is a 

possibility, Mr. Chief Justice. I'm not aware that this 

county would meet that inquiry with respect to what we 

have here. 

What we have in this case is essentially two 

propositions. One is that the county, like every other 

county in the country, exercises a slice of State 

power, and that was something that was found 

unremarkable by this Court in Lake Country Estates. 

And the second one is that this county, like many other 

organs of government, may get funding, even substantial 

funding, from the State, and again, that was found 

unremarkable in Mt. Healthy by this Court. 

What is controlling here is that the county, 

like most counties or maybe all counties, enjoys a 

significant amount of autonomy, has the power under the 

State law to raise its own revenues through taxes and 

bonds, and that the State is ultimately not liable for 

its debts. And under -- under those factors, the 

county is unable to meet any definition of arm of the 

State that has ever been articulated by this Court's 

cases.

extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a 

State just a historical relic? It depends on 

semantics. Or is there some normative or good 

government policy that dictates the distinction? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, I think as a -- as a 

fundamental feature of the Federal system and -- and 

the plan of the Convention, that the States came 

together as sovereigns to form a new country, and under 

this Court's cases, the immunity that they retain is 

called residual because it is recognized that insofar 

as they did not relinquish it to the National 

Government, they kept it. There is no historical 

record of the founding that contemplates that counties 

came to the Convention as sovereigns. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's just a -- it's 

just a close textual reading of the Eleventh Amendment. 

Right? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says a State. It 

doesn't say county. 

MR. ESTRADA: That might be the end of the 

case, in fairness, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Eleventh 

Amendment were the source of the sovereign immunity 

that this Court has recognized, but we know from cases 

like Alden v. Maine that the Eleventh Amendment is

merely an example of the structural immunity that is 

implicit in the structure of the Constitution. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's -- it's a matter of 

respecting the dignity of the States because they 

participated in the Convention, the plan of Convention? 

MR. ESTRADA: And because they came to the 

Convention as sovereigns. Let me say that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- I -- I guess, in --

in going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were 

appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that 

existed at the time of the framing. 

MR. ESTRADA: Exactly right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And at the time of the 

framing, counties in England did not enjoy the -- the 

sovereign immunity of the king, did they? 

MR. ESTRADA: I do not believe that counties 

anywhere at the time of the founding enjoyed the 

sovereign immunity that was -- that has been recognized 

by this Court's cases. 

And you're right, Justice Scalia, that this 

has been reflected in -- in the Federalist Papers, 81, 

by Hamilton. It was clear, at least to some of the 

Founders, that this was a feature that need not be 

stated in the Constitution in order to recognized. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's a historical relic

based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one 

case, and of corresponding lack of dignity of the 

entities on the other? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, it is -- it is what the 

history was and what the plan of the Convention was, 

and it's also a recognition, even functionally, that 

we're talking about sovereign immunity. And I think 

most common sense understandings of what a sovereign is 

would imply at least the ability to prescribe law for 

the government of others without having to draw your 

authority for that from a higher source and without 

being accountable to a higher source. A State within 

the respective sphere would meet that requirement, but 

that would not be true of counties. 

I will point out, as my third point with 

respect to the Lincoln County case, is that the -- the 

case came down March 3rd, 1890, which was the same day 

that the Court handed down Hans v. Louisiana. And that 

is significant because, as the Court is aware, the 

holding of Hans has been the subject of significant 

disagreement over the years since by members of past 

and current courts, and many members of the courts have 

viewed Hans as an unwarranted extension of sovereign 

immunity.

immunity to counties on the day that it ruled on Hans, 

it seems hard to see why it would do it now. And in 

fact, the history of this Court's cases since then 

reflects an almost inflexible understanding, again and 

again, that counties and political subdivisions are not 

entitled to the State's immunity. 

With respect to my second point --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you say 

thoughtful rather than inflexible? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ESTRADA: I will settle for thoughtful, 

but I'm hoping for inflexible. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ESTRADA: With respect to my second 

point, Mr. Chief Justice, Workman v. City of New York 

squarely dealt with the question whether a political 

subdivision, a -- a municipality made up of four 

counties in that case, was entitled to immunity in an 

admiralty suit in personam, and the Court concluded 

that the answer was no. 

Now, the only argument I have heard for why 

Workman is not controlling in this case has been that 

somehow in Ex parte New York No. 1, this Court cast 

doubt on that holding. But if you look at the portion 

that is being relied on, all that the Court said in Ex

parte New York was it cited one of the distinctions 

between the New York case and Workman, when it could 

have cited two. That's not enough to override what the 

case actually says. 

And one of the reasons that I started with 

the Luning County is that even if there were any doubt 

on the question or even if Ex parte New York had cast 

enough doubt under Workman, despite the uniform 

understanding since Workman that that's what the rule 

is, the fact that this Court in every other context of 

sovereign immunity has consistently held that counties 

are not entitled to sovereign immunity ought to be 

dispositive of the question there as well. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do you agree that 

-- that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign 

immunity in admiralty where -- where the same entity 

would -- would not have it elsewhere? 

MR. ESTRADA: No --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I find that discussion quite 

perplexing. 

MR. ESTRADA: I do not believe that is 

possible, and with respect to the argument to that 

effect that is being advanced by Respondent, a close 

reading of the cases being cited will disclose that 

they're not, in fact, unique to admiralty. They are

common law cases about what the -- what the power --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They're talking about 

immunity in most of the cases, not necessarily --

MR. ESTRADA: Sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not necessarily sovereign 

immunity. 

MR. ESTRADA: That's right. 

And -- and another important distinction, 

Justice Scalia, is that even if one could unearth a --

a body of case law that recognized municipal immunity 

at the time of the founding, it would not become 

sovereign immunity, and that's the only issue that is 

-- that is in contention here. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but there is a 

textual basis for drawing a distinction between 

admiralty and law and equity. The Eleventh Amendment 

doesn't extend to -- to admiralty. 

MR. ESTRADA: That is right, Justice Stevens. 

And if this Court had held that the Eleventh Amendment 

were the source or even the sole source of sovereign 

immunity, that would be a compelling argument. The 

main holding of the Ex parte New York No. 1 case is, 

indeed, that that limitation does not apply because, as 

understood by Hans, which had been ruled on some 31 

years earlier, the sovereign immunity really comes from

the structure of the Constitution. 

And the state of this -- this Court's 

doctrine is that the Eleventh Amendment's sole purpose 

was to overrule the holding in Chisholm, and that but 

for the fact that Chisholm came down, the Eleventh 

Amendment never -- if the Eleventh -- if the Eleventh 

Amendment had never been enacted, every sovereign 

immunity case would come out the same way. That is the 

current understanding by the Court about how the 

doctrine works. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Alden tells us what the 

understanding of the Founders was. Of course, it's the 

understanding of some of the Founders. It did not 

include those who were in the majority in Chisholm. 

MR. ESTRADA: That is -- that is true, though 

with respect to Chisholm and the issue in this case, 

Justice -- Justice Stevens, it is very instructive that 

both sides of the argument in the Chisholm case 

understood that the issue was whether States may get 

sovereign immunity. Both sides conceded that political 

subdivisions didn't. 

Chief Justice Jay for the majority argued 

that it made no sense to extend sovereign immunity when 

a -- where -- where a city like the size of 

Philadelphia was the same size and had as many

inhabitants as the State of Delaware, and that's what he 

argued. 

And Justice Iredell, whose views have come to 

command a majority of the Court, saw it to his argument 

to distinguish political subdivisions from States, so 

that even though this Court's first holding was not 

until 1890, it was embedded in the understanding at the 

founding, as -- as shown even by Chisholm, that 

political subdivisions were not entitled to sovereign 

immunity. 

I would like to reserve the remainder of my 

time, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Himmelfarb. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

States enjoy a constitutionally protected 

immunity from suit, but cities and counties do not. 

That principle has been established by an unbroken line 

of precedent dating back to the 19th century and was 

applied to an admiralty suit more than 100 years ago in 

Workman v. City of New York.

 Both Workman and the principle it applied 

answered the question presented in this case. Workman 

held that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty, 

a political subdivision is not entitled to immunity 

from suit. In the course of deciding that question, 

the Court explained that if the government entity 

defendant in an admiralty suit were a sovereign, it 

would be entitled to immunity, not as a matter of 

admiralty law, but as a matter of the law of sovereign 

immunity, in which case the Court would be without 

jurisdiction. 

The Court went on to say, however -- and this 

is at page 570 of the opinion -- the municipal 

corporation of the City of New York unlike a sovereign 

was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court. 

Workman's holdings resolved the issue in the case. 

But the result would be the same even if 

Workman had never been decided. From the Lincoln 

County case in 1890 through the Richland County case in 

2003, this Court has repeatedly held that States, but 

not cities or counties, are sovereign and that States, 

but not cities or counties, are therefore entitled to 

sovereign immunity. A city or county is no more a 

sovereign in an admiralty case than it is in any other 

type of case.

 The theory on which the court of appeals 

apparently relied was that not only States but what it 

called political subdivisions of States are entitled to 

sovereign immunity, at least when the -- the political 

subdivision is exercising a power delegated by the 

State. 

But that's no different from saying that 

cities and counties are, after all, entitled to 

sovereign immunity because every city or county is a 

political subdivision of a State and every city or 

county exercises power delegated by the State, what 

this Court has called a slice of State power. So the 

apparent rationale of the court of appeals is just 

flatly inconsistent with more than a century of this 

Court's precedent. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't doubt that 

a county could have sovereign immunity if it qualified 

as an arm of the State in a particular instance. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Of course, as this case comes to 

the Court, all agree that Chatham County is not an arm 

of the State for purposes of this Court's 

constitutional sovereign immunity doctrine. So the 

only issue in this case is whether there is some other 

ground on which the county would be entitled to

immunity, and there's none. 

Respondent's theory is that there are two 

distinct notions of sovereign immunity, what it calls 

Eleventh Amendment immunity and what it calls residual 

sovereign immunity. A fundamental flaw in that theory 

is that there is only one doctrine of -- of 

constitutional sovereign immunity. What Respondent 

calls residual sovereign immunity and what this Court 

has sometimes identified as the immunity associated 

with the residuary sovereignty that comes from 

Federalist 39 is the doctrine of constitutional 

sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Hans -- Hans is residual 

sovereign immunity. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right, 

Justice Scalia, and every case that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Some -- some of our brethren 

don't -- don't agree with it. They don't like the 

residue and would limit it to the Eleventh Amendment. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you're going to have a 

residue, Hans is it I suppose. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, Justice Scalia. 

The -- the theory of residual immunity is 

that before the Constitution was established, States

were sovereign. When they entered the Union, they 

surrendered some aspects of their sovereignty and 

retained other aspects of it. One aspect that they 

retained was an immunity from suit. A city or county 

is not entitled to sovereign immunity because it wasn't 

a sovereign at the time of the founding and thus had no 

immunity -- no sovereignty either to surrender or to 

retain. From that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your friend 

in the -- in the red brief, though, reviews a lot of 

old cases, suggesting at the time of the founding, that 

counties were not subject to suit. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I don't think the 

cases that Respondent cites do, in fact, stand for that 

proposition. In fact, the principal authority on 

which Respondent relies, the Men of Devon case, which 

is an English case, so far as I can tell, was neither 

an admiralty case nor a case that accorded immunity to 

the county. The case, as far as I can tell, was a 

straightforward negligence case, and the holding of the 

case was that inhabitants of the county, as distinct 

from the corporate entity, the county itself, cannot be 

held liable in a negligence suit. So I don't think 

that that case provides any support for Respondent's 

theory.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Nor could charities. They 

were immune as well. But it -- it certainly wasn't 

sovereign immunity. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely right, 

Justice Scalia. At the time of the founding, various 

entities, including sub-State governmental entities, 

were entitled to some forms of immunity. This Court 

traces the history of municipal immunity at some length 

in the Owen v. City of Independence case. But as -- as 

you just pointed out, Justice Scalia, whatever immunity 

that was, it was not sovereign immunity, and there's no 

basis for constitutionalizing it in the context of this 

Court's constitutional sovereign immunity doctrine any 

more than there's a basis for constitutionalizing the 

immunity that a private entity or an even an individual 

might have enjoyed at the time of the founding. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this? 

Supposing a State passed a statute that said that the 

following counties shall hereby be designated arms of 

the State and be entitled to immunity, period. Would 

that provide an adequate defense, do you think? 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That in and of itself, 

Justice Stevens, would not. This Court's cases make 

clear that in deciding whether an entity is an arm of 

the State, there are three principal considerations to

take into account. You've identified one of them, 

which is the classification of the entity under State 

law. The other two, which are probably more important, 

are whether the State would ultimately be liable for a 

judgment against the political entity and also the 

extent of control exercised by the State over the 

entity. 

It's important to point out, with respect to 

the latter of those two considerations, that control in 

this context doesn't mean simply that the county has 

been delegated authority by the States since, after 

all, all counties are -- are delegated authority by the 

State. It means that there's more of a day-to-day 

control, for example, that it is the Governor who 

appoints the members of the commission that governs the 

particular entity, the Governor who has the power to 

remove them. The Governor may have veto power. That's 

the sort of considerations that courts have taken into 

account in deciding whether the control element of the 

arm of the State inquiry is satisfied. 

There is no basis for any notion of 

constitutional sovereign immunity beyond the one 

identified by this Court. Consequently, there's no 

basis for any arm of the State test other than that 

applied by the Court in its cases involving the one

doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity. 

The only other possibility that would entitle 

Respondent to prevail in this case would be some notion 

of non-constitutional immunity unique to admiralty. 

But, of course, whatever else Workman held -- and 

Respondent takes the position that Workman did not 

decide the constitutional issue. We think it did, for 

the reasons I've already stated. But whatever else it 

held, it clearly held that, as a matter of the Federal 

law of admiralty, political subdivisions are not 

entitled to immunity from suit. So the Court could not 

adopt a non-constitutional rule of immunity limited to 

the admiralty context without overruling Workman. 

Respondent does not ask the Court to do that. And 

indeed, so far as I can tell from reading Respondent's 

brief, it does not even advocate a non-constitutional 

rule of immunity for admiralty cases. 

So there's no non-constitutional basis for 

immunity. The only constitutional basis for immunity 

is when the political entity is an arm of the State. 

As this case comes to the Court, all agree that Chatham 

County is not. It necessarily follows, therefore, that 

Chatham County was not entitled to immunity and that 

the judgment of the court of appeals should be 

reversed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The question presented is --

is only sovereign immunity, isn't it? It's -- we don't 

have to decide whether there might be some other type 

of immunity. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. That's right, 

Justice Scalia. To the extent that sovereign immunity 

is understood to mean constitutional immunity, as 

distinct from some judge-made or statutory immunity, 

that's right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Himmelfarb. 

Mr. Hart. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. JONATHAN HART 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. HART: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

The county that has been expressly delegated 

the core sovereign function by the State, unique or 

sovereign function, such as navigable waters, is 

entitled to residual sovereign immunity in an in 

personam admiralty action. 

Justice Ginsburg just asked a question about 

counties in cases. I know of no case where a State has 

delegated a core sovereign function, cloaked the entity 

with immunity, in which this Court has ruled it's not the

arm of the State. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who pays judgments? Who 

pays judgments against the county? 

MR. HART: Who pays judgments against the 

county is initially probably the county, but under 

Georgia law, the department of DOT -- Department of 

Transportation has a fund in which they can contribute 

towards that. And if you've looked in -- and I think 

funding matters less here than -- than the fact that 

these big projects are generally a collage of funding 

issues. You have State and Federal money usually mixed 

in. So you're in a situation where, you know, if you 

went back 50 years ago and looked at funding, it might 

be very definitive. In these days and times, if you 

look at projects, you know, you got money coming from 

all sources, and if you start tracing the -- the money, 

you can go in six different directions. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hart --

MR. HART: And I think the dignity interest 

-- excuse me. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was one of 

the main indicia of whether an entity had been set up 

as an arm of the State, that is, the State would be 

directly liable.

 MR. HART: Well, I think the Hess case says 

that -- that it -- that it's one of the default issues, 

and then you go to the dignity interest and the funding 

interest. But if you go back and look at the 

California Regents case v. John Doe, in that case, it 

shows and explains why funding becomes not a whole lot 

in the way of meaningful factor because if you looked at --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, core -- core 

government functions isn't -- isn't the test either. I 

mean --

MR. HART: I understand that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you know, the Federal 

Government and I think some States gave -- gave 

railroads the power to condemn land. Did that make 

railroads sovereigns entitled to sovereign immunity? 

don't think so. 

I 

MR. HART: No, sir, I wouldn't argue that either. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that --

that your county is exercising some, quote, core 

government functions, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't 

get you there. 

MR. HART: Well, I think you look at the --

the history, you look at the dignity of the State, and 

you look at the functional realities of State 

management. And if you look at the history, counties

were immune at common law in England. Counties were 

immune at the time of the framing. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- in many 

of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the 

duties they were performing they were performing pro 

bono publico. 

MR. HART: Sure. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the doctrine 

extended immunity to them on that basis, not -- not as 

sovereigns. 

MR. HART: Well, it extended -- it extended 

to them as part of an overall sovereignty -- sovereign 

immunity picture. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't sovereign 

immunity. It was -- charities had immunity until very 

recently. Some States still had it when I was in law 

school. You couldn't sue a charity for tort. 

MR. HART: I still think if you go back and 

look at these core functions and if you -- if you 

define that as something that's being delegated by the 

State where the State says we want you to have 

sovereign immunity, then that's something that should 

be respected as part of the dignity of the State. 

In this particular case, Georgia is extremely 

strong on that point. It's in the constitution that --

that counties can handle bridges. It's in the 

constitution that they're immune. You can only waive 

it by an act of the legislature. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What -- what other sorts of 

torts would this apply to, as applied to Chatham 

County? If Chatham County --

MR. HART: Torts? 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- were sued, yes -- if 

Chatham County were sued for something done by a law 

enforcement officer, would your theory apply? 

MR. HART: I think the -- I think -- no, sir, 

I don't think under -- like a 1983 action or a 

Fourteenth Amendment exception under section 5, I don't 

think the immunity would reach that far. I think the 

county would still be exposed to the liability there 

under that case law. I don't think you have to do away 

with what you have under the Fourteenth Amendment --

excuse me -- under the Eleventh Amendment or the case 

laws thereunder. But I don't think that those -- those 

cases under there define the whole of sovereign immunity 

of the general principles of sovereign --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, has the Eleventh 

Circuit or did the old Fifth Circuit ever apply this 

doctrine in any area outside of admiralty? 

MR. HART: Not that I am aware of.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What are you relying on in 

the Georgia constitution? It doesn't mention counties, 

does it? It just says except as specifically provided 

in this paragraph, sovereign immunity extends to the 

State and all of its departments and agencies. 

MR. HART: Yes, sir. And there's strong case 

law, the Millwood case, that says basically counties 

are part of the sovereign of the State. And as 

recently as last year, in a lawsuit against the 

Department of Corrections, the -- the Attorney General 

of the State argued that the county was a sovereign of 

the State, part of the State, took the position it 

couldn't be sued because a sovereign can't sue itself. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There can be no -- no --

well, I assume you have a -- a tort -- tort claims act 

that waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances. 

MR. HART: Yes, sir. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But apart from that, you 

can't sue counties in tort. 

MR. HART: You can -- generally in the -- in 

-- as a county -- as a State law claim, no, unless 

there's a waiver. Now, the legislature has waived --

there's been quite a few waivers in the last year. 

They just waived in automobile insurance cases, for 

example. And -- and that's a matter of the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: To what -- what other area 

would this apply? If the county has sovereign 

immunity, how about the county school board? 

MR. HART: We would contend that the core 

sovereign function has to truly be a core sovereign 

function and it has to be supported by some type of 

history, some type of -- of State dignity there and --

and some reality --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And education would not --

MR. HART: And we would not put education in 

that class. If you go back and look at the history at 

the time of framing, you would have to start looking at 

what government did do and didn't do. Now, you could do a 

historical analysis, and maybe I would be wrong and the 

history would show that education was important. But 

my understanding is education at that time was probably 

a pretty local matter. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the sanitation 

department? 

MR. HART: That would get sort of iffy there 

from the standpoint that public health, quarantines, 

those type of services for disease were handled by the 

State and were handled in a -- in a manner that you 

might be able to define it as a core function, but that 

would probably be a stretch.

 This is a narrow exception and we think it 

deserves that insofar as the navigable waters. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure 

that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a 

core sovereign function. 

MR. HART: Well, it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are an awful 

lot of private bridges. 

MR. HART: Yes, sir. 

The -- the exception, though, was at common 

law, counties could not be liable for the operation and 

maintenance of bridges, and that was adopted by Georgia 

prior to the time of the framing and that was the law 

of the State. And we would take the position that that 

survived under this residual sovereign immunity theory. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's bridge 

immunity, not sovereign immunity. I mean --

MR. HART: Well, we're -- we're focusing that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it doesn't come -- it 

doesn't come within the Federal Constitution. 

MR. HART: Well, neither does Federal 

sovereign immunity come textually within the 

Constitution. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, I'm not talking 

about textually. I'm talking about in structure.

There's nothing in the structure that has anything to 

do with bridges. 

MR. HART: The answer to that question is 

that if you look at the -- the function of -- of State 

government and you look at what they define as being 

important -- and in this case, Georgia has defined that 

as one of the functions under its constitution and 

under its statutes -- then there's a dignity interest 

there that ought to be respected insofar as outside 

that realm. 

One of the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this? Are you 

suggesting that a county could be an arm of the State 

for some purposes but not for others? 

MR. HART: Yes, sir, I believe that. We 

don't concede that we might not fit in the -- that we 

could -- could not fit in within the arm of the State. 

The Court chose in the question presented not to 

address that issue and asked us to address the issue 

outside -- assuming we were not an -- we were a non-arm 

of the State. And our brief does make some mention of 

-- of the arm of the State analysis within it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- the court 

of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you 

were an arm of the State.

 MR. HART: Well, we were asserting that we 

were -- we were immune under residual sovereign 

immunity and we conceded for -- that the county has not 

generally been recognized under the Eleventh Amendment 

as being sovereign -- as sovereign -- having sovereign 

immunity. That is not to -- and -- and we needed some 

way to distinguish that from the immunity that we're 

arguing, the immunity retained by the States. And we 

feel that that's something that could -- could have 

broader parameters than -- than the current arm of the 

State test. 

And the focus ought to be on these core 

functions, history and dignity, and the functionality of 

the State. That takes you away from your Eleventh 

Amendment analysis where you're dealing with sovereign 

immunity all the time in -- in that context, and you're 

now moving to discussing general principles of 

sovereign immunity outside the context of the Eleventh 

Amendment in defining those contours, and we feel like 

this might give you a mechanism by which to do that. 

And it's a very narrow exception, and it 

would be something that the Court could rule on or the 

Court could simply rule that counties were immune in in 

personam admiralty actions, if you wanted to make it 

even a more narrow ruling.

 One of the things that has been argued by the 

Solicitor General is that there's a single sovereign 

immunity, that there's this unified sovereign immunity. 

And it's -- and to the extent that we're talking about 

general principles of sovereign immunity, we agree with 

that. We do not agree with the part that says that 

when we deal with Eleventh Amendment arm of the State, 

that that part defines the whole. 

And when you get into a situation of -- of 

how do you define the sovereign -- sovereign immunity, 

you have sovereign immunity at the Federal Government 

level, and if it's a single sovereign immunity that you 

accept and as argued by the -- by -- by the Solicitor 

General's office, then the question becomes, is there a 

reciprocal sovereign immunity that's coextensive with 

Federal sovereign immunity? And that's an argument 

that -- that certainly could be made. It -- and it was 

addressed somewhat or raised somewhat in Alden where 

they discussed we're not ready to say if the Federal 

Government is raising sovereign immunity, which they do 

on a regular basis, that perhaps the States might not 

have that. 

Now, we're not arguing that the county in any 

way would have sovereign immunity to the extent of the 

Federal Government. We're saying that insofar as these

functions that have a history at common law at the time 

of the framing and has been consistently recognized by 

the Supreme Court, navigable waters and the soils 

thereunder have always been considered to be a 

sovereign interest of the State by this Court. 

If you go back and look at the St. Anthony 

Falls case, at that time they were dealing with 

riparian rights, and -- and there was a deference to 

the State in regard to that. You also had the Coeur 

D'Alene Indian Tribe dealing with submerged lands, and 

you recognized the sovereign interests of the State in 

those situations, and in the Seminole Tribe case, said 

there's no exceptions in regard to carving out an 

exception to an admiralty immunity. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All that establishes 

is simply that if the State were operating this bridge 

and if the State were on the hook for any judgments and 

if the State had control over the people who were 

making the decisions, that there might be an issue of 

State sovereign immunity. 

MR. HART: Yes, sir. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole problem is 

that it's the county that's doing all that. 

MR. HART: We understand that, but we're 

acting on behalf of the State and acting as the State

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State doesn't

MR. HART: The State has the potential to pay 

damages there through -- through the DOT, the 

Department of Transportation funds. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it wishes. If it wishes. 

MR. HART: If it wishes. I have to concede 

that point. 

But from the -- from the standpoint, if you 

go back to California Regents case, there wasn't a 

whole lot of potential liability there. Theoretically 

they may have, but they had a contract. The State had 

a contract there in which it was indemnified by -- by 

the Federal Government. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The State can pay my damages 

if it wishes. It just doesn't happen to have a statute 

to that effect right now. But I mean, that -- surely, 

that doesn't -- doesn't --

MR. HART: Well, we take the position that 

the funding issue and the control issue ought to be 

less -- outside of the Eleventh Amendment analysis, arm

of the State ought to be something that matters less. 

The dignity interest ought to matter more. 

The funding issue is something that in every 

major project, you've got a collage of funding, and it 

comes from all different sources. And to some extent, 

who pays the bill and how they pay the bill depends on 

the structure of the deal. And I don't think it's very 

enlightening, as it was once 50 years ago when things 

were much simpler. We're also talking about, in bridge 

cases or most building road projects, you have the 

situation where a lot of times the State comes to one 

of its entities and says, we'll give you the money, 

build a bridge. We'll build -- build the road. Quite 

frequently that happens all the time in larger 

counties. If the county does the function that it's 

doing for the State --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a 

different question. The immunity looks to where the 

money is going to come from to satisfy a judgment. I 

don't think it looks to where the funding came from in 

the first instance. 

MR. HART: Well, the -- the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the claim on the 

treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign 

immunity issues.

 MR. HART: Insofar as this case goes, there 

is the potential for payment by the State, and -- and 

that's about all we can say there. We'll have to -- we 

-- as Justice Scalia said, is -- is there a absolute 

duty for them to pay it? But -- but the practicality 

of it is usually when they delegate you the function 

and the State arms you with sovereign immunity and 

tells you to go out and do that, they will step up to 

the batter's box at the time something like that would 

occur because they have sort of delegated that core 

function to you to do. 

The control issue we feel is something that 

the dignity issue ought to take precedence over. The 

control issue is something that the State decides 

during the delegation, and if you wish to place an 

emphasis on the control, then you're asking -- asking 

basically, do you require the State to make a certain 

kind of delegation? 

Earlier we had a question that -- that 

followed up on the issue of if there -- if we just did 

a single function alone, built a bridge without 

anything else, would that alone create a responsibility 

on the part of the county? And I think in -- in regard 

to that, the core function here is the county accepting 

the responsibility of the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the South 

Carolina Supreme Court's opinion in the Hines case 

which seems to run counter to your argument? 

MR. HART: Yes, ma'am. The Hines case was an 

Eleventh Amendment case, number one. Number two, it --

it did state, in the front end of the case, that they 

would apply the substantive law of admiralty 

irrespectively of the forum. But the residual 

sovereign immunity issue was never argued by either 

side in the case. That case went up on -- as a result 

of the granting of a motion to dismiss on a fairly 

skimpy record there, and the funding issue was never 

really -- really analyzed there. So we see that as a 

-- a case that typically is Eleventh Amendment case 

and there has not been any ruling whatsoever in -- in 

the context of whether there would be residual 

sovereign immunity. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hart, may I ask this 

question? In the -- I noticed the opinion is a per 

curiam opinion of the Eleventh Circuit. Was the case 

argued orally in the Eleventh Circuit or was it 

submitted? 

MR. HART: No, sir, it was not. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It was submitted. 

MR. HART: Just submitted.

 The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Eleventh 

Circuit had a prior decision, didn't they? 

MR. HART: Yes. Yes, ma'am. There had been 

a similar case arising out of Chatham County, and it 

went up and was affirmed per curiam, and then there was 

a short opinion the second time the case went -- went 

-- the second case went up, and there was a very short 

opinion in regard to that, taking deference to their 

decision in the -- in the first opinion and talking a 

little bit about the residual sovereign immunity issue 

that we had here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That was an old Fifth 

Circuit case --

MR. HART: Yes. There was a Wickman case 

that -- that was several years ago that is still good 

in the Fifth, and our circuit adopted that when they 

put in the new circuit. 

What we're asking here today is basically a 

very narrow holding. We're asking that there be 

limited sovereign immunity -- there -- excuse me --

that there be -- in unique circumstances where core 

functions of the State are delegated to the county, 

that the county would have sovereign immunity, and that 

a State can cloak a county with sovereign immunity. It

seems that that is an issue that the State ought to be 

able to do out of its delegation -- out of its dignity 

function. They ought to have the right to run the 

State and -- and delegate those functions as they see 

fit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not unusual that 

counties maintain and run bridges in your State, is it? 

I mean, that's --

MR. HART: Yes, sir, that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the normal --

MR. HART: I don't know if I'd go so far as 

normal, but for larger communities, yes, sir. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then -- then how do 

we know it's a core dignity function of the State if 

they're -- the normal rule is somebody else does it? 

MR. HART: Well, it's a function that 

historically in the Constitution was recognized would 

be a function on behalf of the State with the counties. 

And -- and it has traditionally historically been a 

function of the States to build roads and run bridges. 

And in regard to that, you're talking about navigable 

waters, and the State has an interest in its own 

navigable waters. They're delegating a function of the 

government to build a bridge over their navigable 

waters and the soils thereunder. So we would take the

position there that -- that that is a core sovereign 

function, that the navigable waters are a sovereign 

interest of the State, and that should have the dignity 

and respect of that. 

The design of the Constitution was that there 

would be dual sovereignty created both in federalism 

and under State sovereignty. There's not a single case 

you all are going to have that's going to be able to 

define all the principles of general sovereign 

immunity, but we think this is a situation in which the 

Court, by making a holding in in personam actions, can 

recognize the State's residual immunity, not so much 

focus on the Eleventh Amendment and the cases 

thereunder, but try to come up with a set of principles 

that you can begin talking about the whole of general 

sovereign immunity. 

And we do not necessarily agree that the --

the State -- the arm of the State test has to apply in 

all situations. We think this is an exception. It's a 

narrow exception. Core sovereign functions are going 

to be narrowly defined, especially when a county is 

acting. You're going to have to support it with some 

history. You're going to have to support it with some 

State dignity where the State has given a clear 

indication through their State laws that it's a

function that the county ought to do, and -- and that 

needs to be respected from the standpoints that States 

are given wide latitude in the way that they set up and 

run their government. 

And we respectfully request that you make a 

finding that we have the right to have sovereign 

immunity in this particular narrow set of circumstances 

involving navigable waters as -- as it stands. Thank 

you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Hart. 

Mr. Estrada, you have 8 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. ESTRADA: Mr. Chief Justice, just a few 

points. 

On the issue that was raised by Justice 

Alito, the -- this doctrine comes from the Wickman case 

from the old Fifth Circuit. That case relied primarily 

on a -- on a case called Kegan from the Supreme Court 

of Florida, which was, indeed, a bridge case, but it 

was not an admiralty case. It was a case in which 

someone who was crossing a bridge with a heavy truck 

fell through the bridge because the -- the bridge was 

structurally unsafe. The old Fifth Circuit sort of 

took it as a bridge case and took over that doctrine.

 If that fact -- scenario were to come up 

in Chatham County and the plaintiffs and the defendants 

were diverse, there is no question that -- that the 

county would be entitled to plead its State law 

immunity under Erie. 

I will point out incidentally that even 

though in this case there is a diversity of citizenship 

and admiralty jurisdiction, this Court held in 1953 in 

a case called Pope & Talbot v. Hawn that in that 

circumstance, any defense that is available solely on 

the diversity side under Erie gets trumped by the 

uniform application of the maritime law. So that would 

not be an issue here. 

With respect to the question that was raised 

by Justice Ginsburg, Hines was an admiralty case in 

State court. Under no stretch of construction could 

that be viewed as an Eleventh Amendment case since it 

was not a case in law or equity and it was not in 

Federal court. 

And number three, the proprietary 

governmental distinction has been rejected in the 

Workman case itself where it was raised in the specific 

context of admiralty. I will point out it has never 

been part of this Court's sovereign immunity doctrine, 

and with respect, other areas of federalism law tend to

indicate that it should not be adopted now. 

You may recall that such a distinction 

between core and non-core governmental functions was at 

the core of the -- of this -- this Court's cases under 

National League of Cities v. Usery, and in the Garcia 

case, the Court overruled National League of Cities 

primarily on the point that the distinction between 

core and non-core governmental functions had proven to 

be unworkable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're -- are you 

suggesting that the -- the State would enjoy sovereign 

immunity in proprietary activities? 

MR. ESTRADA: I am suggesting that if you 

named the State on the wrong side of the caption on the 

V in Federal court, it does enjoy sovereign immunity, 

irrespective of what your cause of action is. Yes, Mr. 

Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I would have 

thought, particularly when we're talking about the arm 

of the State doctrine, that the -- the nature of the 

activity is one of the key questions we look at. 

MR. ESTRADA: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maintaining bridges 

is one thing. You know, operating a for-profit 

activity would be something else.

 MR. ESTRADA: I think it's -- it's sort of 

inherent in all of the cases that have been ruled upon, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that what tends to be delegated are 

those that are the normal functions of government, but 

I don't think this Court has ever held that it is the 

function of sovereign immunity doctrine to tell the 

States what are the appropriate functions of 

government. So I don't think there would be a 

distinction that would be supported by the cases. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought the 

governmental proprietary distinction really came up in 

State law cases involving municipal liability. That's 

principally where it --

MR. ESTRADA: It did early on, and that was 

-- that was one of the issues that was put forth in the 

Workman case, Justice Scalia. With respect to the 

admiralty jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, this Court 

said in 1901 that it carried no weight. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have nothing 

further. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
