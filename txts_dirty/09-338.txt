 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-338, 

Renico v. Lett.

 Mr. McGormley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McGORMLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Because this is a habeas case arising from a 

murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the 

threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any 

clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the 

Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied 

in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had 

abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due 

to deadlock.

 The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas, 

ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad 

discretion, due the trial court determination. Here 

there was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations 

received early on in the second day of deliberations, 

followed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after 

approximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of

deliberations.

 The trial court at that time engaged the 

foreperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which 

the foreperson not only confirmed the content of the 

first note, but also confirmed the existence of a 

deadlock.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. The content 

of the first note was a query of the court. And that 

query was: "What happens if we can't reach a verdict?" 

Isn't that substantially different? Doesn't that 

suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are 

the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a 

consensus is possible?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, Justice Sotomayor, the 

first note was the note regarding our raised voices 

disturbing other proceedings. The second note 

regards -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. How long 

before that last note was that?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the Michigan Supreme 

Court refers to that as early on in the second day of 

deliberations. And then there is approximately 3 hours 

and 15 more minutes of deliberations, because after the 

second note -­

voices?

 MR. McGORMLEY: The record doesn't disclose, 

doesn't disclose that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show 

that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our 

earlier Perez case, the very first in this area, 

"deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously" in 

declaring a mistrial. What in the facts you have 

recited -­

MR. McGORMLEY: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- show that activity?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Justice Sotomayor, the first 

point I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas 

review, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made 

factual findings here that would be due deference.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the factual 

finding that you think we have to give deference to? I 

know the facts you've recited. There don't appear to be 

any of the facts with respect to what occurred during 

the activity. So what factual finding do we have to 

give deference to?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the factual finding by 

the Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared 

to be acrimonious deliberations. That's a factual

finding due deference under (e)(1).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm not sure how 

that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that 

the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not 

precipitously.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Going back to this Court's 

opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment, 

discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we 

have to look at the totality of the circumstances in 

that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a 

note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious 

deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably 

construed as a deadlock.

 And then the trial court did not declare a 

mistrial at that point. Rather, the trial court brings 

the jury out and engages in a colloquy. And in that 

colloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's 

answer at her word. And that is: "Are you going to be 

able to reach unanimous verdict?" The answer being: 

"No." And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who 

second-guessed in this case by saying: You can't place 

that much weight on that statement by the foreperson.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the foreperson at 

first hesitated. When the court asked the question, 

"Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,"

then there's no response. And then the court says, "Yes 

or no?" And only at that second point does the 

foreperson say "no." So it was a reluctant "no."

 MR. McGORMLEY: I don't necessarily believe 

it was a reluctant no.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: She might have been 

sneezing. I mean, we don't know what caused the pause, 

do we?

 MR. McGORMLEY: That's correct, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's another factor 

in this. We have the transcript. Are you urging that, 

because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw 

the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something 

that deserves a special measure of respect?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely, 

Justice Ginsburg. And this Court has qualified that as 

broad discretion and special respect due the trial court 

determination, after the trial court is the one viewing 

the jury in real time. So absolutely. And in fact, 

this -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by 

this Court in Arizona v. Washington.

 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you another 

question about what happened?

 After the foreperson said: No, Judge, we

are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge 

says: All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury 

is dismissed. And then the next entry in the transcript 

that we have is: Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we 

could set a new trial date. Now, Mr. Gordon was defense 

-- was the defense attorney?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So when did he leave? Do we 

know when he left? He was present when the judge said 

that she was going to declare a mistrial?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. But I don't know 

that minute or so gap. I don't know when Mr. Gordon 

snuck out.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, along the 

line of -- the same line of questioning, I understand 

about AEDPA. I understand about deference, the 

jurisdictions. Just tell me a little bit about how this 

often works in State courts and in Federal courts?

 Would it be good practice, in your view -­

and that may not control your case, but would it be good 

practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this 

colloquy and then say: The jurors are dismissed while I 

talk with counsel. And you say: Counsel, in light of 

this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial. Do 

you have any comment?

Is that good practice?

 MR. McGORMLEY: It may be good practice, but 

the question becomes whether it's constitutionally 

required.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking -- I'm asking 

if it's good practice as a general practice.

 MR. McGORMLEY: I would say -- well, in this 

Court -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- because that 

will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue. I 

understand deference. I understand that all intendments 

are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found. I'm 

just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in 

the real world?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I believe that 

discussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the 

consideration. I don't dispute that. But this Court 

has never held that it's a requirement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if, in fact, there 

isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not 

declare a mistrial? Can the judge go ahead and declare 

a mistrial?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Absolutely. And here -- and 

here's why.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a very big fact.

MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it's important in the 

coercion context, because certainly the trial court has 

an independent obligation to ensure a just judgment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That independent 

obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views 

just as a matter of good practice?

 MR. McGORMLEY: It may be. It may be 

reinforced in certain circumstances, but again, we are 

looking at the totality of the circumstances when we 

have a note indicating acrimony, a note indicating 

deadlock, and then the colloquy in which there's an 

unequivocal -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, certainly it's good 

practice. If both counsel agree that there is manifest 

necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a 

double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. Under Dennis, if 

the defendant consents, then there is no double 

jeopardy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was there an objection here 

by counsel for the defendant?

 MR. McGORMLEY: No. No, there wasn't. But, 

you know, the colloquy is relatively short. But no, I 

believe the defendant's counsel could have objected.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there was a ruling

by the court: I hereby declare a mistrial. I suppose 

you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the 

jury was present when the judge said: I hereby declare 

the mistrial.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it would be rather 

awkward for the counsel at that is point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no -- there was 

no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and 

the court then said immediately afterward: The jury is 

dismissed. So there was no interval for an objection?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it -- it would be 

difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I 

still think counsel could have made a record immediately 

at that point.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would it have been 

difficult? Why would it be difficult for counsel to 

say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't 

think that there should be a mistrial, I think you 

should ask the jury to deliberate further?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, that is possible and 

that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial 

court -- this is a circuit court -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you make of the 

fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor

acknowledged that the judge made a mistake?

 MR. McGORMLEY: In Michigan confessions of 

error are controlled by court rule as a procedural 

matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to 

accept statements that could be qualified as a 

confession of error or not. Here the Michigan Supreme 

Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying 

double jeopardy merits. In much the same way, it did 

not address potential waiver or consent issues by the 

defendant. So we have a merits opinion here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There are thousands and 

thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are 

not all that unusual. So in this case we have testimony 

going on for 4 days, 10 hours total. And we have jury 

deliberation of 4-1/2 hours, and we have really very 

little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the 

jury was deadlocked. There are some things for, some 

against, only a couple.

 And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all 

right. Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases 

that must be there over the decades, you probably looked 

through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar 

members. How many have you found where you would say 

that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on 

your side? In other words, there are going to be

millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of 

them will support the defense. Maybe many support you. 

But I haven't seen any here that say they support you. 

So how many do? And what do you want me to read to see 

that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse 

of the judge's discretion? How many did you find which 

will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the 

norm?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, the difficult part in 

answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has 

indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. That's why I am 

asking the question. What they've said is, is it an 

abuse of discretion? And they've also said the judge 

has to be careful. Okay, so we have like an abuse of 

discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the 

abuse of discretion side. I think anyone would admit. 

But what cases will show to me that it's on your side, 

not quite an abuse of discretion? Or is this the most 

extreme case in history?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I don't believe it is, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you don't believe 

it. All I want you to do is to give me some evidence, 

like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how

you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of 

this case, but looking on the scale.

 MR. McGORMLEY: I reach that conclusion by 

looking at this Court's other language, for instance -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to look at 

this Court. We don't have a case where we said what was 

an abuse of discretion. I want you to tell me -- and 

I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your 

answer you found no case supporting it. You have found 

no case in the history of the United States that was 

more extreme than this -­

MR. McGORMLEY: I have not -­

JUSTICE BREYER: -- where they said it 

wasn't an abuse of discretion. That's what I'm judging 

from your answer.

 MR. McGORMLEY: I have not found a case on 

these facts with a note indicating acrimonious 

deliberations, that is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There is no note 

indicating. There are five, there are notes they sent 

out, and at 9:30 in the morning they said: Judge, we 

have a concern about our voice levels, disturbing. 

That's what they said. Then they asked to see the 

evidence and they said: Explain Count 2.

 Then they said: Are we allowed to break?

And then they said: What if we can't agree? Mistrial, 

retrial, what? And at 12:27, the same time, they said: 

What about lunch?

 Then he brought them out and he says to the 

juror: All right, do you believe it's hopelessly 

deadlocked? And the foreperson said: The majority of 

us don't believe that. And he said: Don't say what 

you're going to say. And then he doesn't have the 

lawyer there.

 Okay, that's fairly extreme. So that's why 

I ask the question.

 MR. McGORMLEY: But the reference there 

about don't say what you're going to say is likely a 

reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, is it your 

burden to answer that question? Given AEDPA, is it up 

to you to show that this case is within the mainstream 

or is it up to the other side to show rather 

conclusively that it is not in the mainstream? I 

thought that's what AEDPA required.

 MR. McGORMLEY: It is Petitioner's burden.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is Petitioner's burden 

to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to 

show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no 

discharge of the jury. And I'm not aware that they have

carried that burden. But we will ask when they come up. 

It is their burden, however.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly but I'm drawing 

some conclusions from your silence. You haven't found a 

case supporting it?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I haven't found a case on 

these facts, but that's consistent -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have you found any case 

where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring 

with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Actually, there's one out of 

the Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very 

circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a 

deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort 

of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted 

it up, and the trial court -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well you can't read from 

that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was 

held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of 

improper prejudicial actions during the trial.

 MR. McGORMLEY: But that's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are different 

questions.

 MR. McGORMLEY: But it's still a manifest 

necessity determination. In fact, this Court has

indicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked 

jury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- yes, but 

that doesn't mean none.

 What -- other than we have cases where 

judges have declared mistrials because they are going on 

vacation. Those are easy, okay?

 But somewhere the word "abuse of discretion" 

means that someone has discretion, but is improperly 

exercising it. What facts would it take for you to 

believe that that would have been the case? What do you 

have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -­

that would have been an abuse of discretion? What 

point? If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that 

would be enough, right? Or would it?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, to best answer Your 

Honor's question, I would point out again that in 

Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of 

abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned 

are when the trial court acts irrationally, 

irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons. And in our 

yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say 

the Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion -­

the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary 

indication. The jury in the Starling case indicated

that, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15 

more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares 

a mistrial.

 Your Honor's example then with the Gordy 

case would be the imminent travel plans and docket 

considerations.

 We also have where the court acts sua 

sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the 

trial court -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that this one, 

meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked, 

hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict. It 

asks: What happens if we don't? And the foreperson 

hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or 

not as a group they believe they are hopelessly 

deadlocked. Why isn't this precipitous action?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, again, as I -- as I 

mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that 

it is indicative of acrimony. It's a reasonable view of 

the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But again, that's --that's

determination of a factual issue made by a State court 

shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall 

have the burden of rebutting the presumption of 

correctness by clear and convincing evidence."

 Now, what is the factual 

determination that has been made here? I assume it's 

the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.

 MR. McGORMLEY: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that has to be rebutted 

by clear and convincing evidence, correct?

 MR. McGORMLEY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you answer that 

to those questions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the status of 

the -- the Allen charge in Michigan? Has Michigan taken 

a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible 

thing for a trial court to do?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, a -- Michigan has 

adopted the ABA standard. Michigan has the Instruction 

3.12. It's not what we would call the traditional Allen 

dynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to 

give credence to the majority's opinion. So there is a 

deadlocked jury instruction in Michigan. It's not the 

traditional Allen dynamite charge.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, that was not -- that

understanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered 

deference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial 

court being -- having broad discretion to make this 

determination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I 

mean, it -- it may tell the -- the trial court may have 

felt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony 

may be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't 

matter and that they may have to submit to the majority 

opinion.

 So I believe it was -- it was reasonable for 

the Michigan Supreme Court here, applying AEDPA to -- to 

conclude that the -- the trial court acted in 

conformance with this -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you as a matter 

of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have 

interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and 

asked them what they thought about whether there was a 

deadlock?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I believe that is 

permissible, though not constitutionally required.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any reason -- do 

you suppose there is any reason why he didn't do that?

does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona 

that -- that acrimony is a concern. It's a 

countervailing concern to balancing the interest of the 

defendant having his case decided by a single tribunal 

and fair and just judgments, as well as society having

one fair opportunity to vindicate its laws. So I think 

it's very much an appropriate consideration.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McGormley, what 

evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not 

deadlocked?

 MR. McGORMLEY: None.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is presumably what 

the other side has to prove by clear and convincing 

evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the 

State court.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct. That's why it's 

imperative to view this case in the habeas box that it 

resides. And that is the Michigan Supreme Court made 

reasonable factual determinations and did not 

objectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent. 

And the fact that we may look at these notes and go one 

way or the other means that the State wins. The State 

should prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation 

of those notes. If one person may say, I don't know 

that that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan 

Supreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable 

determination, then deference should apply and the State 

should prevail.

 MR. McGORMLEY: How long in terms of serving 

on the bench?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. McGORMLEY: My recollection is that this 

was an experienced trial judge who then went to either 

civil arena from recorder's court or retired. So I 

believe this was an experienced trial. I don't have the 

exact years.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Acrimony, I recognize we 

have talked about it in Arizona, but it -- I mean, it 

could be that the jurors had all agreed on the murder 

count and they were just quarrelling over whether they 

should add the firearms count, or the other way around.

be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony 

might indicate.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, it gets back to the 

fundamental principle that the trial court should be 

able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the 

initial layer of deference -- that the trial court 

should be able to take the foreperson at her word when 

she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is

deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of 

these -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't say, can you, 

that every time the jury records that it can't reach a 

verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that 

that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I do not assert that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So obviously the word 

"deadlock," and as I read the judge's questions, he 

defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict. 

And later he uses "hopelessly deadlocked," but changes 

the question when he asks the foreperson to respond.

 Isn't there a difference between hopelessly, 

i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a 

verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I guess I don't quite 

see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I 

think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher 

standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That isn't what the judge 

said just before she got the response. She said: Are 

you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Right. It's a bifurcated 

question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And the foreperson said:

No, judge.

 MR. McGORMLEY: It's a bifurcated question, 

correct. I mean, the -- the first one was regarding 

confirming the nature of their note, and then, even with 

the interruption, there are -- twice the court 

approaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict.

 So again, here, what is paramount is that 

it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively 

unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established 

precedent. There -- there is no case that flatly 

controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard. 

In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own 

three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when 

they said that there are three considerations that 

determine.

 So when you take that three-part test, which 

is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well 

as the second-guessing of those predicate factual 

determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't 

have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries 

often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as 

much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's 

contrary to these dual layers of deference.

 And if there are no further questions, may I 

reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R. McCOWAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. McCOWAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Habeas relief was properly granted. I would 

like to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy 

question for me. Judge Brown was sworn into service on 

January 1st of 1991. At the time of this trial she had 

been on the bench approximately 6-1/2 years. We are not 

disputing her experience as a trial judge.

 I do disagree with my friend's contention 

that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test. 

What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some 

considerations or some guidelines, including the first 

of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions 

of the parties. And that does go a long way, Justice 

Kennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising 

sound discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what would 

be gained from that? I -- the parties, one says -­

let's say one says yes and the other says no. You ought 

to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, at the very least, it

evidences that the trial judge at least considered that 

there were -- that there competing interests and -- and 

debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an 

extraordinarily drastic remedy.

 And instead, our position is that there 

really is no down side to talking with counsel. You 

would be able to have the benefit of the parties' 

arguments.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do people usually -­

in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown 

between prosecution and defense on a question like this? 

My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if 

they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to 

continue, because all they need is, you` know, one 

holdout.

 MS. McCOWAN: My -- my experience -- there 

is a range of things that are going on. I'm sorry, I 

can't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a 

variety of the circumstances. But yes, I think that the 

case law generally presumes that the defendant does want 

the first jury to deliberate to verdict.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are 

-- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the 

only question for us is whether it was an abuse of 

discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge

 That would certainly be the case if this is 

coming up through the Federal system and we had a 

Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but 

it is not. It -- it is coming up from a State court and 

Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to 

reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with 

State justice. And that statute says specifically that 

where there has been a factual finding by the State 

court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal 

courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing 

evidence.

 Now, what clear and convincing evidence is 

there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, first, I am not sure 

that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with 

the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by 

the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked. 

The judge acquired or extracted the "no" answer and then 

immediately declared a mistrial. The ruling that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what was the basis 

for that declaration of mistrial?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, presumably on these 

facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that 

the jury was deadlocked.

to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?

believe so. But in -­

JUSTICE ALITO: The Michigan Supreme Court 

cited four factors in support of its decision: the 

length of the deliberations in relation to the 

complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the 

jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson 

said that the jury would not be able to reach a 

unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no 

objection by defense counsel.

 Is there any decision in this Court that 

says that under -- that in a case in which those four 

factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant 

a mistrial?

 MS. McCOWAN: No, there are no specific 

requirements.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And is there -- could you 

give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding 

that in a case where those four factors are present, a 

trial judge may not grant a mistrial?

four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to 

establish that the judge was exercising sound 

discretion? Unless there is a decision of this Court or 

perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying 

that, no, even when those four factors are present you 

may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the 

conclusion that you are asking us to draw?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I under -- I think 

I understand the question. I do -- I do recognize that 

there are no specific requirements, and that in the 

absence of that, that there is nothing specific that the 

trial judge was required to do beyond the exercise of 

sound discretion. And in this case the judge -- the 

record does not support that the judge did exercise 

sound discretion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So can -- what -- what 

is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the 

question I asked your colleague on the other side, if 

you can remember it? I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on 

the scale. I mean, this is a fairly simple case.

 MS. McCOWAN: Right.

 Now, imagine that in front of you. You -­

it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for 

him, because you want to find reversals, and all you 

have to do is you look and you try to see when the State 

courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest 

necessity.

 So I have some time. I will read some 

cases. Which ones do you want me to read? And I don't 

need to read the standard. I have the standard. And I 

don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation 

of the statute; you have the burden. And the question 

is we have a record of those two pages, and does it 

clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said

are no cases? Are reversals very, very rare for

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I -- I did 

undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I 

did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find 

anything that looks even remotely as bad as this. 

Now -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, that's good. Now, tell 

me then what did you find? When you say "remotely as 

bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was 

rejected, or where contention -- what did you find? 

What did you find by way of cases where they said on 

facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there 

was no manifest necessity?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I guess the short answer 

is that --- that there was nothing exactly on point. I 

mean, there were -- there were cases where the judge 

acted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases 

where the judge did consider the -- the options of the 

parties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the 

proposition that what happened here is an abuse of 

discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, 

right?

has to be established at -- at a granular level. This 

Court does require still that the -- that the trial 

judge exercise sound discretion in making the 

determination that there was manifest necessity. And 

the case law -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have 

anything like this case that says this would be an abuse 

of discretion?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I do believe that 

this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a 

plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge 

acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to 

the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a 

mistrial; was acting irrationality, irresponsibly -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that 

it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly 

established by the decisions of this Court.

 MS. McCOWAN: But in Arizona v. Washington 

this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the 

trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and 

precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling 

will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion 

requires that the trial judge act carefully and 

deliberately.

have required much -- much more than that, much more 

than referring to a generalized standard that our 

opinions have set forth. They have required proving 

that the application of that standard in our opinions 

comports with the provision of the statute that requires 

you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that 

was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application 

of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by 

the Supreme Court of the United States.

 Now, our cases don't show that you can 

simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of 

discretion standard, that was clearly established by the 

Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I 

have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion. I 

don't think so. I think our cases show you have to show 

that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover 

your situation. And you don't have any cases like that.

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I do understand -- well, 

I guess the best answer that I have for that is that, 

why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I 

don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or 

theorized is that I think that for the most part trial 

courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation 

that they must exercise sound discretion. And for the 

most part for 186 years this has pretty much worked.

there is no question about that statement of the law. 

It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up 

until now we have been talking about this, including 

Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that 

is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it quite correct 

to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock? 

Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest 

necessity to take the action? Isn't that the test?

 MS. McCOWAN: Precisely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the argument is that 

there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though

there was disagreement about whether there was a 

deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike.

 MS. McCOWAN: Precisely.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Some people think one -­

there is one holdout, that means it's a deadlock. Some 

people think it -- it might be more. I don't think the 

test is deadlock. The test is manifest necessity.

 MS. McCOWAN: I agree.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you 

answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm 

-- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although 

I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue 

did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, 

because if there is deadlock then there is manifest 

necessity.

 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. I though that, 

when I answered that question, that you were asking if 

typically, if the jury is genuinely deadlocked, does 

that constitute an example of manifest necessity? I'm 

sorry for the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the case 

comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine 

deadlock, right?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, no, I believe that the 

case ultimately comes down to -- I am sorry if I

misspoke before. I believe that the case ultimately 

comes down to whether the Michigan Supreme Court 

unreasonably applied this Court's precedent in finding 

that the trial judge exercised -- that there was 

manifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge 

exercising sound discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With the layers -­

with the two layers of deference worked into your 

formulation. It's not simply whether the trial court 

erred in the determination that there was a deadlock 

that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not 

there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial 

judge to so determine that we review under an additional 

abuse of discretion standard.

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, my understanding of 2254 

is that it does take into consideration the contours of 

the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is 

our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not 

exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be 

objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 

to have found that, that that is necessarily 

contemplated by 2254.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't our law 

clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears 

the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if

there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, 

hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer 

to the case?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, that certainly sounds 

fair. I don't want to quibble, but I think that the -­

my understanding of the law is that when -- when there 

is an objection by the defense, then the burden is on 

the prosecution. In this case, there was no opportunity 

to object. So I'm not sure that -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that -- why is 

that so? If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was 

11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been 

reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the 

granting of a mistrial?

 MS. McCOWAN: I think, yes, practically -­

practically speaking, I think he probably would have 

been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a 

Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released 

them for the day.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does he have to lose 

at that point? She has made the ruling and that's that 

there is going to be a mistrial. The lawyer at that 

point can say: Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I 

would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen 

charge. Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.

MS. McCOWAN: Well, I think just as a 

practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense 

does not want the jury to leave, the potential for 

prejudice would be tremendous. And as a practical 

matter, I think that the parties would have been 

reluctant to do that. And I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you really saying that? 

You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a 

client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1 

for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to 

have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the 

window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say: 

Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar 

and object to the granting of a mistrial?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure how we 

-- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to­

1 for acquittal.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not suggesting 

that they were or they weren't. I'm just asking about 

what defense counsel would do in that situation. Maybe 

they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm 

familiar with. I would think that they would not be 

hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was 

going to prejudice the client.

 MS. McCOWAN: I certainly would hope so as

well. But here I think that it was all just done just 

so fast and without warning and truly without any 

opportunity to object. And so for that reason, I -- I 

think that the lack of objection really doesn't do 

anything to fortify the conclusion that there was 

manifest necessity in these facts. Instead -­

explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too

on the jury?

the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that 

point and they were no longer -- I think that -­

dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we 

being too loud?

they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and 

they want to make sure that they are not being

their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage 

in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be.

 I don't think that there is -- I mean, I 

suppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is 

that I don't think we can do anything other than just 

take that note at face value. They send out a note 

saying: We have a concern that our voice levels may be

it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be. And you

we are bound to accept the factual determination of the 

State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing 

evidence that that's wrong.

 MS. McCOWAN: I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe

opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your time. I 

will look for it.

 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't waste your argument 

time. I will look for it.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is no 

case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly 

identical facts, so this is not under the "contrary to" 

prong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1).

 So it has to be under the "unreasonable 

application." Particularly for me, what Supreme Court 

precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and 

explain how and why?

 MS. McCOWAN: I think Arizona v. Washington 

clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must 

exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest 

necessity. And in this case, on these facts, it was 

objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court 

to have found that there was manifest necessity in the 

absence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by 

the trial judge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in that case, one of 

the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the

judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?

 MS. McCOWAN: In this case, that he -- that 

the trial judge failed?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in Arizona.

 MS. McCOWAN: Oh, right. In -- right, 

exactly. In Arizona v. Washington, what this Court had 

found is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion; 

that was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the 

parties an opportunity to weigh in on it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a little shaky as 

precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said: The 

trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new 

trial. But in passing, to get there, the Court said: 

Well, this case didn't involve that. But the Court 

isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in 

that case didn't violate defendant's right.

 MS. McCOWAN: But I thought that this Court 

did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial 

judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion, 

and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in 

accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact 

exercise sound discretion in finding that there was 

manifest necessity.

 And I think that this case looks different 

from Washington and may be similar to what was going on

in Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without 

any opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the 

matter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court 

found to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous. 

And we -­

JUSTICE ALITO: So are you suggesting that 

whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in 

granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA? 

It is clearly established that whenever there is an 

abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA. 

It is an unreasonable application of our precedent?

 MS. McCOWAN: I'm sorry. Just to clarify. 

You are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact 

abuses his discretion?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Right.

 MS. McCOWAN: Yes. I think that if the 

Michigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme 

Court to have found that there -- that there was 

manifest necessity in the absence of the judge 

exercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in 

fact, an unreasonable application of this Court's 

precedent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the standard of review 

for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme 

Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for

reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court 

of appeals despite AEDPA? We simply look and see 

whether there has been an abuse of discretion. If there 

has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?

 MS. McCOWAN: No, I'm sorry. To clarify, it 

still has to be whether -- we are looking at the 

Michigan Supreme Court's decision here. We are in -- on 

habeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State 

court's opinion.

 And if the State supreme court -- the last 

reasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively 

unreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly 

established precedent then relief will be warranted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's objectively 

unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse 

of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, if the trial judge does 

not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts 

irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I 

believe that relief would be warranted, even under 

habeas review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just abuse of 

discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something 

else? Plus what?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, it's -- it's whether the

Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review, 

whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination 

of this Court's precedent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you -- you do 

agree that there could be situations where a Federal 

court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, 

and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that 

that has to stand?

 MS. McCOWAN: Yes. And I want to clarify. 

I think my understanding is that it's not just whether 

this Court disagrees. It does still has to be an 

objectively unreasonable determination. So it's not 

just simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas 

court reviewing it would come to a different conclusion. 

It still has to be objectively unreasonable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there are a 

category of cases where a Federal court could look at it 

and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same 

court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not 

entitled to relief under AEDPA?

 MS. McCOWAN: I think that that is right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But "objectively 

unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of 

abuse of discretion. You don't abuse your discretion if 

what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the

ballpark. It seems to me you are doubling up here. 

I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, our argument is that the 

trial court was not in the ballpark here. The trial 

court in this case did not exercise any discretion 

whatsoever, let alone sound discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say 

that? I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, 

but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was 

going to be a mistrial. He exercised discretion. He 

looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are 

you hopelessly deadlocked? Are you going to be able to 

reach a unanimous verdict?

 And he was able to rely on the fact that 

they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being 

too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in 

which there were 10 hours of testimony.

 I mean, I understand your argument that he 

abused his discretion, but I don't understand the 

argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, my -- my argument is 

that the judge was not exercising sound discretion 

because she was not responsibly gathering the facts. 

She reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely 

deadlocked before she even asked a single question. She

 MS. McCOWAN: But if I could just back up a 

couple lines, she received the note saying: What if we 

can't agree. And she said: I have to conclude from 

that, that that is your situation at this time.

 So she had already reached the conclusion 

that they were deadlocked before even asking a single 

question. And then from there she -- she misdefines, 

for lack of a better description -- she conflated mere 

disagreement with deadlock, never corrected that -­

that -- that erroneous definition. And she corralled

read down further. She says: "Are you going to reach a 

unanimous verdict or not?" And the foreperson says 

"No."

 MS. McCOWAN: But in the absence of an 

expression of deadlock from the entire jury, on these 

facts in this case, it was unreasonable for the Michigan 

Supreme Court to find that that satisfied the trial 

judge's obligation to exercise sound discretion. At a 

minimum, the trial judge is required to responsively 

gather the facts.

 In this case, she -- she acted hastily and 

precipitously and without regard for my client's right 

to have this first jury deliberate to a verdict. She 

declared a mistrial at the very first sign of 

disagreement and did not give anybody an opportunity to 

weigh in on that before she declared -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- with 

respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement. 

Reasonably interpreting, a note saying "Are we being too 

loud" is a sign of disagreement. And there is another 

note that comes out: "What happens if we can't agree?" 

You are making it sound more precipitous than it was.

mistake? There's a -­

could the court be concerned that the person was about 

to say, and again with deference to the court, "The 

majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that 

the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent. 

Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?

 MS. McCOWAN: Well, it may be correct to 

stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure 

out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain. 

And if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us 

think we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent 

upon the trial judge to -- to do more.

yes or no. And the foreperson answered for herself but 

not necessarily for the jury when she said no.

real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact. It 

perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the 

holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the 

holdouts. I'm not aware that that's a requirement.

 MS. McCOWAN: It's certainly not a 

requirement and we were not saying that it is a 

requirement. But on these facts when the jury has 

simply sent the foreperson out to gather more 

information, the trial judge was required to, in some 

way, either -- either assure itself that the -- that the 

jury as a whole did agree with the foreperson's 

expression -­

 MS. McCOWAN: No, I don't think that that 

necessarily means that there is substantial 

disagreement. They might have been having trouble.

Ms. McCowan.

 Mr. McGormley, you have three minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McGORMLEY: Thank you. Two brief 

points. It is a Petitioner's burden to establish -­

clearly establish precedent here that was objectively -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean Respondent, 

right?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I'm sorry?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are -- you are 

the Petitioner.

 MR. McGORMLEY: I'm sorry, it -- it -- I'm 

sorry, Mr. Lett -- Mr. Lett's burden to demonstrate that 

there is clearly established precedent that was 

objectively and unreasonably applied.

 To Justice Breyer, your question although 

not exact fact patterns and that is what I was 

struggling with, I would point in our blue brief to

Hernandez-Guardado and Lindsay v. Smith, two cases in 

which -- circuit cases, granted, but two cases in which 

involved jury deadlocks and counsel was not asked a 

question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And those are the ones -­

so as I'm seeing this case, it isn't that complicated. 

You know, it's pretty clear what the standard is. The 

standard is, was the decision of the -- of the State 

court reasonable in deciding that there was a sound -­

sound -- the words come from nine wheat, that's -­

that's, you know, like 100 years ago or something.

 MR. McGORMLEY: 186.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 186 years ago when it was 

something like "sound, careful, exercise patience" -- or 

whatever, "the sound, careful exercise of discretion." 

They said there was. And the question for us is, was 

that reasonable? Okay? I guess if the judge had said, 

"Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and 

the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get 

there -- dismissed," that would be unreasonable.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Objectively unreasonable. 

So come as close as you can to that, where they held 

reasonable, and what case is it?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McGormley, you have 

stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question 

that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have 

emphasized the two screens. This comes to us after we 

have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme 

Court ruling. So the case isn't all that easy, without 

making the judgment as though it were coming up in the 

Federal system.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Correct, Justice Ginsburg, 

this is not a very easy -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, do you 

think the most relevant precedent from this Court -­

would you agree that the most relevant precedent from 

this Court is Arizona v. Washington?

 MR. McGORMLEY: I would not. And I -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?

 MR. McGORMLEY: The reason why, Justice 

Stevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked 

jury case. And there is language that helps flesh out 

what an abuse of discretion would be.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think the most 

relevant precedent from this Court is?

 MR. McGORMLEY: Perez.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have an 

answer to Justice Breyer's question? It was sometime

ago, but -­

(Laughter. )

 MR. McGORMLEY: My best answer, Justice 

Breyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are 

those -- are those two, because this -- this Court has 

never overruled a manifest necessity determination due 

to a deadlocked jury.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that 

you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision 

before we could declare that something was 

unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably 

applied?

 MR. McGORMLEY: No, my point is that -- is 

in the 186 years since Perez it's never happened. It 

does not happen. And that is consistent with the broad 

discretion and special respect -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that could also be 

consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough 

that judges have to act slowly and --and with thought, 

and that lower courts are catching those when they are 

not. I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm 

saying.

 MR. McGORMLEY: Well, I -- I think it is 

indicative of the fact that this has never happened -­

this has never happened before.
