 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-329, Chase Bank v. McCoy.

 Mr. Waxman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question presented is how to interpret a 

since-amended version of Regulation Z. In amicus briefs 

filed, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court, 

the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long 

interpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the 

rest of the regulated credit card industry understood.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Kagan?

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you about the 

deference that we should give to the briefs that have 

been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief 

in this case?

 Auer deference seems pretty four-square with 

this. It's a brief that was filed to interpret an 

agency regulation. But I'm wondering whether Auer 

continues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead.

In Christensen, the Court held -- and I quote -­

"Interpretations such as those in opinion letters -­

like interpretations contained in policy statements, 

agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which 

lack the force of law -- do not warrant Chevron-style 

deference." And Mead said pretty much the same thing.

 So it seems to me that there are three 

possibilities for why Auer remains good law. One is 

that briefs are somehow different from all those other 

things that we talked about in Christensen.

 Another is that an agency gets more 

deference when interpreting regulations than when 

interpreting its own statutes -- something that I think 

I just don't quite understand, but maybe you could 

convince me of it.

 And a third is, well, look, they're just 

basically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer, and we don't 

feel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got 

it right in Christensen and Mead anyway.

 So, which is it?

 MR. WAXMAN: A lot of the above.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. WAXMAN: First of all, Auer has been 

applied in the context of amicus briefs since 

Christensen and Mead, both -- unanimously both in

Kennedy and in Long Island Care at Home. And I must 

say, in both of those cases, the deference was to a 

brief that acknowledged a change in the agency's 

position, which is quite unlike what's going on here.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Absolutely right, Mr. 

Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a 

sentence or two. We never really addressed the possible 

conflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead.

 MR. WAXMAN: Nonetheless, I think those 

cases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and 

well. And, in any event, as your question pointed out, 

both Mead and Christensen and the passage in Christensen 

that you're referring to dealt with the question of 

Chevron deference to informal letters from the -- from, 

you know, a -- somebody who was employed by an 

administrative agency.

 And the question in the case, the 

interpretive question in the case, in the Chevron 

context, is: What confidence can we have that Congress 

has, in fact, delegated to the agency interpretive or 

rulemaking authority in this context? And so, for 

example, in Mead, the Court distinguished between 

notice-and-comment regulations that Customs put out, as 

opposed to the kind of determinations that were made by 

46 different offices at the rate of something like

15,000 letters a year.

 In the -- when Christensen dealt with the 

Auer question, because it did involve a -- an informal 

opinion of the Wage and Hour Administrator both 

interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act and a 

regulation, when it came to interpreting the regulation 

what this Court said is: Our deference doesn't apply 

here because we read the regulation as clear. And Auer, 

of course, made clear that deference is due to an agency 

brief unless it is plainly erroneous or the regulation 

is clear.

 Now, here we have a situation in which it is 

not an agency staff or whatever that is applied. The 

First Circuit asked the government for -- solicited the 

Federal Reserve Board itself to explain the meaning of 

its own regulation. And the brief that was filed 

represented that it was the longstanding and consistent 

interpretation of the Federal Reserve Board -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, I take it 

from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that 

this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some 

ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much 

deference we owe to the agency.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. We think that 

the Federal Reserve Board's reading of the two

regulatory provisions is the better reading, but we 

acknowledge, as every court I think that has -- that has 

addressed this, that there is some ambiguity, just 

looking at the regulations.

 But I think it's important to understand 

also that the views expressed in the amicus brief 

solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court are 

entirely consistent with explanations that the Board, as 

a Board, provided in the course of a 4-year rulemaking 

process about what these provisions mean.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you think the same 

deference is owed to ANPRs as to the amicus briefs? 

What is your position on that?

 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I think that if it weren't 

for the amicus briefs in this case, which are later in 

time and address the very specific question that is 

presented in this case, our deference would be 

appropriate.

 And it's not just an ANPR. There was the 

Federal Reserve explanation accompanying the ANPR, a 

functionally identical explanation accompanying the 

proposed rule, and one also accompanying the final rule. 

And those explanations of the Board are entitled to Auer 

deference.

involving the construction of Regulation Z, this Court 

acknowledged that deference was due to a proposed -- the 

commentary accompanying a proposed change in Regulation 

Z which had not in fact even been implemented. So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Judge Cudahy in dissent 

relied very much on the advance notice of proposed 

rulemaking.

 MR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry? Judge -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Judge Cudahy in dissent

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. And in fact, 

Justice Kennedy, I would say that both the majority and 

the dissent below referred to the ANPR when -- both when 

they were referring to the commentary to the ANPR and 

the commentary to the actual proposed rule in 2007.

 Now, of course, Judge Cudahy was deciding 

this before the First Circuit had solicited the views. 

On rehearing, we urged the Ninth Circuit to solicit the 

views of the Federal Reserve Board if there were any 

doubt, because a split had been created, but it declined 

to do so. And -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose, having done it 

twice before, we could in this case apply Auer without 

explaining why it is that Auer is not inconsistent with

plenary review in this case. And I do -- I just want to

JUSTICE BREYER: Why "to be sure"?

 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not trying to be flip here. 

I don't think that there is any inconsistency between 

Auer and Mead. Mead involved the question of whether or 

not there was -- the Court could be confident that 

Congress had delegated some sort of lawmaking function 

to these letters that were written by Customs officers 

across the country to individual importers, when the 

letters themselves made clear that they couldn't be 

relied on by anybody other than that particular importer 

and only unless and until the Customs officer changed 

her mind.

JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mead did put a lot of 

emphasis on procedural formality. So, you know, 

Justice Scalia sort of snidely, but I think accurately, 

described Mead as saying: "Only when agencies act 

through 'adjudication[,] notice-and-comment rulemaking, 

or...some other [procedure] indicat[ing] comparable 

congressional intent [whatever that means]' is Chevron 

deference applicable." So, you know -­

MR. WAXMAN: I don't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: This is -- this is not an 

adjudication. It's not a notice-and-comment rulemaking, 

and it's hard to see why there is some procedure here 

indicating comparable congressional intent, as Mead was 

-- would require.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan, with respect to 

the Mead question, which is a Chevron question, the -­

the Board's explanation in -- published in the Federal 

Register in 2004, and again in 2007, and again in 2009, 

is a formal explication of the Board's rules pursuant to 

its very, very broad rulemaking authority under the 

Truth in Lending Act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can also 

read Mead and decide what it says. Being in the 

majority, I thought the dissent's characterization was 

not what it said. I mean, the dissent -­

debate, but -­

sorry. You're an informed reader, and I -- I thought 

Mead definitely did not say that. That was the 

dissent's characterization of what it said.

weight, I had understood both the majority and the 

dissent to explain that notice -- the existence of 

formal notice-and-comment rulemaking is an important 

indicator -­

indications that Congress delegated this authority to

 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And I think, 

you know, to the extent that there's anything more 

that's needed, it seems to me the icing on the cake here 

is that the rulemaking that I've been discussing during 

which over the course of several years the Board engaged 

in consumer testing, in surveys, in comments, and 

decided to change its regulation -- it produced as what 

it called a, quote, "major change," an entirely new 

section of Regulation Z, 226.9, that establishes as a 

new requirement what the Respondent in this case 

erroneously ascribes to the previously unamended text. 

And that is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I do think -- I do 

think, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to 

be the way you describe it. The difference between 

either contemporary notice and/or 15-day notice versus 

45 is a significant change.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct, and it's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so it doesn't need 

to have been precipitated solely by a decision that the 

old rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't 

exist.

Sotomayor, that that -- that one of the two changes that 

the Board made could be characterized and was, in fact, 

a major change. But if the Court will take note of the 

pages, the Federal Register record cites that we've 

provided on page 29, note 7, of our blue brief, and that 

the Federal Reserve Board's amicus brief in the First 

Circuit provided at page 12a of the Government's brief, 

I think you will see that what the Board -- the Board in 

2009 was very careful to explain, as it did in 2007, 

that it was making in this respect two major changes.

 One is that in those instances in which the 

contract was being changed, that is a term of the 

contract was being changed, advance notice of 45 days 

would be required regardless of what kind of change it 

was, but that when there was an -- a rate increase, 

quote, "due to delinquency, deficiency, or penalty, not 

due to a change in contractual terms of the consumer's 

account," reference should be made to new subsection 

(g). And the Federal Reserve Board was very, very clear 

that it was making two different changes: one to extend 

the advance notice period with respect to changes in 

terms from what the original disclosure provided; and 

another to provide that if you are increasing the rate, 

even if it is entirely consistent with the initial 

disclosures, you are required by this new subsection to

provide advance notice.

 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you a question 

about how the contract works in the situation in which a 

cardholder is found by -- was found by Chase to have 

defaulted by failing to make some payment other than 

payment on the Chase credit card? So you determine, I 

guess from information obtained from a credit agency, 

that the cardholder has failed to make payments to 

someone else on time, you conclude that the cardholder 

is in default, you increase the -- the interest rate.

 How is the -- the cardholder, knowing, 

thinking that he or she has made all Chase payments on 

time, is not going to be alerted to the fact that there 

may be an increase in the rate. So how is that 

cardholder going to realize what has happened, just by 

scrutinizing the monthly statement and seeing that the 

little interest figure is different from what it was the 

last time?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. And now, of course, we're 

talking about a rule that's -- it had been amended -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I saw that.

 MR. WAXMAN: -- amended 2 years ago, but 

under the old regime the cardholder was on notice -- I 

mean, there had to be -- and the Reg Z commentary was 

clear that in order for it to be a default rate, it had

triggering event, that is, what constitutes a default -­

and here there's no doubt that it was specified that 

what constitutes a default is a default or failure to 

make a payment to any creditor -- and there also has to 

be a specification of the maximum rate that could be 

applied as a result.

 Now, in this case, as the Board explained, 

the -- the consumer would be notified in the next 

monthly statement -- and it is pretty prominent -- that 

the interest rate applied to all balances for that month 

was as follows.

 May I save the balance of my time?

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 During the relevant time period, the Federal 

Reserve Board's Regulation Z did not require provision 

of a change-in-terms notice when a credit card issuer 

merely implemented a contractual penalty rate provision 

that had already been disclosed. This is clear from the 

staff commentary to the rule, from the Board's own 

statements in the Federal Register when discussing 

changes to this very rule, and finally from the amicus 

briefs filed by the Board in the First Circuit and in 

this Court.

 I think it's important to put the particular 

regulatory provisions here in a larger context because 

the policy question at issue here, whether there should 

be advance notice under these circumstances, is not new. 

It did not arise with this litigation. It has been the 

subject of intense regulatory focus at the Board since 

2004. It has been the subject of two rounds of 

notice-and-comment rulemaking, of consumer testing, and 

finally of an amendment to the rule to provide notice 

under these circumstances, notice that in the court of 

appeals' view had always been required, unbeknownst to

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it, apart 

from the amendment to the rule, you think those 

circumstances provide for Chevron/Auer deference.

 MR. PALMORE: I do. This is, of course, not 

a Chevron case. There's no provision in the Truth in 

Lending Act that deals with subsequent disclosure. The 

subsequent disclosure -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our Long Island 

health care case?

 MR. PALMORE: It's an -- it's an Auer case, 

and we believe that all of these provisions, certainly 

the staff commentary deserves deference, and that was 

the holding of this Court in Milhollin, in the Milhollin 

case. But also the Board's own authoritative statements 

in rulemaking proceedings about what its old rules meant 

certainly deserve deference, and we believe the amicus 

briefs do as well.

 In 2004, it was -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, we don't -­

we don't do that with Congress. When -- when a later 

Congress says what a statute enacted by an earlier

well, that must be what it meant. Are there other 

examples of where the Board says what a prior rule meant

that we deferred on?

 MR. PALMORE: Well, this Board -- this 

Court, of course, in Long Island Care at Home deferred 

to an internal advisory memorandum that was -- that was 

provided after the court of appeals decision that was at 

issue. That was an after-the-fact reading, and it was a 

change in policy.

 In the context of Auer deference, when 

you're looking to the author of the agency's regulation 

to elucidate what that regulation has meant -- means, 

the Court has looked at a broad range of material 

because it understands that, when Congress delegates 

rulemaking authority to an agency, that it also as an 

adjunct to that delegates authority to interpret those 

rules.

 So, in 2004, the Board launched a proceeding 

because it was concerned with the very issue that 

underlies this litigation. And then, in 2007, it issued 

rules to address this situation. And in that rulemaking 

notice -- and this is at page 12 of the blue brief -­

the Board described what the old rules required. And it 

did so in a way that's irreconcilable with the court of 

appeals' view of what the old rules required. The Board 

noted that staff comment 9(c)-1 did not require 

provision of a change-in-terms notice when a specific

change had been previously disclosed.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, what would the 

Board's position be on the following hypothetical: That 

a card issuer says when any of 50 different things 

happen, so 50 different triggering events, the -- the 

issuer can raise the rate anywhere up to 300 percent, so 

has complete discretion if any of a quite large number 

of triggering events occurs. And then one of those 50 

triggering events occurs, and the card issuer says, 

okay, we'll raise the interest rate to 42 percent. 

Would there need to be notice for that?

 MR. PALMORE: Under the old rule, no.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Under the old rule?

 MR. PALMORE: Under the old rule, no. 

There's a specific staff comment, 6(a)(2)-11, which 

deals with the initial disclosure of penalty rate 

provisions, and it said there are two requirements of 

specificity. The specific maximum rate that may be 

applied must be disclosed, and the specific event or 

events that could lead to imposition of that specific 

maximum rate must be disclosed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, suppose 

there was no triggering event, but in the initial 

statement the company said: We reserve the right to 

raise the interest to X amount. No triggering event,

just a reservation of the right to raise the interest. 

Would that have to be -- and then it implements that 

later on. Would the cardholder have to have notice of 

that under the old reg?

 MR. PALMORE: Yes. Under staff comment 

9(c)-1, the staff makes clear that if there's a general 

-- exercise of a change in rates pursuant to a general 

reservation of rights clause that's not specific with 

respect to the maximum rate that could apply or the 

specific triggering events that could lead to imposition 

of the maximum rate, that advance notice is required.

 But the staff contrasted that to the 

situation we have here, when the specific change is 

previously disclosed, and it provided some examples, the 

third of which is quite analogous here. It's a 

situation where the cardholder has agreed to maintain a 

certain balance in a savings account at the risk of 

having his rate go up if he -- if he goes below that 

balance.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when was that staff 

comment made?

 MR. PALMORE: That was in -- that's been 

there since 1981, Justice Kennedy.

 But going back to the 2007 notice of 

proposed rulemaking, the Court specifically -- sorry -­

the Board specifically addressed this situation. It 

said: "Some credit card account agreements permit the 

card issuer to increase the periodic rate if the 

consumer makes a late payment. Because the 

circumstances of the increase are specified in advance 

in the account agreement, the creditor currently need 

not provide a change-in-terms notice; under current 

226.7(d), the new rate will appear on the periodic 

statement for the cycle in which the increase occurs."

 This statement by the Board authoritatively 

interpreting its rules is inconsistent with the court of 

appeals' view of those rules.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you address 

your friend's contention that because the notice doesn't 

occur -- the notice that the increase has gone into 

effect doesn't occur until the end of a billing cycle, 

it's a retroactive increase without notice.

 MR. PALMORE: It's a retroactive increase 

without notice that was specifically disclosed 

initially. So, if you look to the cardholder agreement 

here on page 20a of the petition appendix, Chase was up 

front that that's what would happen, that the change 

would be -- the increase in rates would be applied to 

existing balances and that -- and that consistent with 

the statement from the notice of proposed rulemaking,

that the consumer would find out about that when he 

received his next periodic statement. That's a 

backward-looking statement.

 That's inconsistent with the court of 

appeals' view that advance notice had always been 

required. The court of appeals tried to dismiss this 

statement and others like it as incidental descriptions 

of current law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is correct to 

characterize what's being allowed under your 

interpretation as an increase in rates without notice?

 MR. PALMORE: Without advance notice. There 

are actually two kinds of notice under the old rule. 

Now there are three.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, advance notice 

MR. PALMORE: First, you have to be -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Advance notice is 

notice, right?

 MR. PALMORE: Right. It has to be -- it has 

to be disclosed initially. It had to be disclosed 

initially, and if the cardholder didn't like the term, 

he didn't have to sign up for that card. And then it 

had to be disclosed subsequently on the periodic 

statement immediately following the rate increase, which

 Now, the Board now believes that there 

should be a third form of notice -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what would have to be 

disclosed, just the increase in rate?

 MR. PALMORE: The new rate, right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not the reason for the -­

MR. PALMORE: Not the reason. Under the new 

rule, a general reason has to be given.

 So, when the court of appeals described this 

as an incidental description of current law, it was 

correct that this is a description of current law, but 

it wasn't at all incidental. It was inherent in the 

rulemaking proceeding. The agency needed to explain 

what its old rules required while it was -- so the 

readers could make sense of what it was proposing to do 

to those rules.

 And then, as Mr. Waxman said, when the -­

when the Board then adopted amendments, it did two 

different things. It changed 226.9(c), the provision at 

issue here, to extend the notice period to 45 days. But 

then it did something additional. It adopted a new 

subsection, 226.9(g), to provide for notice in 

situations where there was no change in terms, where, by 

contrast, the card issuer was simply implementing terms

that had previously been disclosed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Did the Board think that 

this -- that requiring the card-issuing company to 

provide immediate notice would be very burdensome? And 

if not, what's the -- what was its reason for 

interpreting the Regulation Z the way it did?

 MR. PALMORE: I think it's important to note 

that in 1981, as we discussed earlier, there was no 

provision in the Truth in Lending Act requiring 

subsequent disclosure at all. And the focus in the 

statute at that time and in the Board at that time was 

on the importance of initial disclosure. And it was 

thought that initial disclosure was the key tool that 

consumers could use to comparison shop for credit. And 

the Board wasn't as focused on things that happened 

later in that credit arrangement. And it thought that 

the initial disclosure and the subsequent disclosure was 

sufficient, in the same way that, in a variable rate 

plan, there's initial disclosure of the variable rate 

and there's subsequent disclosure on the periodic 

statement after the rate adjusts.

 There was no requirement and there still is 

no requirement that there be advance notice when a 

variable rate increases. The consumer finds out about 

it on the periodic statement within a matter of weeks of

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. BECK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether a bank 

must provide notice of a change in terms when, after 

prominently disclosing a specific purchase rate in the 

cardholder agreement, the bank then changes that rate -­

then changes that rate based on a reservation of 

discretion in the fine print of the cardholder 

agreement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Changes the rate in the 

cardholder's favor?

 MR. BECK: Changes the rate -- the rules, 

the regulations, as they -- as they exist as relevant to 

this case, provide that you do not need to provide 

notice if the interest rate is reduced. Is that your 

question, Justice Ginsburg?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but would you -­

would it be in the greater interest of your client if

the initial notice said we're going to raise it to the 

top, no discretion?

 MR. BECK: It -- there -- Justice Ginsburg, 

there would still be discretion. And we're not -- and 

nothing we say would take away discretion or discourage 

discretion. We're simply saying that either the -- the 

credit card company has to decide specifically what rate 

will apply beforehand and put it in the cardholder 

agreement, or it can specify a range of possible rates, 

reserve that discretion, and then when it decides which 

rate it wants to apply, it would then inform the 

borrower what that rate is.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it says: We 

prefer one notice to two. So, sorry, we can't give our 

cardholders that benefit. We'll say this is the rate, 

this is going to be it. Then we will spare ourselves a 

second notice.

 MR. BECK: Right. And -- and there's -- but 

there has been no showing that the -- this notice cost 

would be -- would be a significant burden on the credit 

card companies. And the important thing is that, if you 

don't know, if you don't get that notice and all you 

know is that the credit card company has discretion to 

raise the rate, then you never know for sure whether 

your rate has even gone up or not, much less how much

it's gone up. So you never have that opportunity to go

You might not -- you might miss an opportunity to avoid 

making a purchase that would -- that would be at a rate 

higher than you expected, and the lack of that -- that 

ability to shop between loans is really the central 

motivating -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you know the 

highest rate, because that's stated in the original 

notice, and you could shop on the basis of that.

rate is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. BECK: But it will not tell you that the 

rate has changed, and it won't tell you how much it has 

changed. So you'd have to figure that out by yourself. 

So it's not notice of a change in that sense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's to figure out? I 

mean -­

MR. BECK: Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: If he had been paying, 

what, 10 percent and it's now 25 percent, it would seem 

evident on the face. But that doesn't solve the problem 

of the purchases that you have made before you got that 

statement.

 MR. BECK: Well, that's right -- that's 

correct, Your Honor. It still doesn't solve that 

problem. And when the rate is applied retroactively 

back to the beginning of the cycle, so this would go 

back to the first of the month even before the default 

occurred, as happens in this case, then the problem is 

exacerbated even more.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, just to clarify 

your position, if the initial agreement said your rate 

is 10 percent, but if you're delinquent, your rate will 

be 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent,

it's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case, 

would notice -- would subsequent notice be required?

 MR. BECK: I think if the disclosure was 

specific and -- and prominent, as required by the 

initial disclosures, and it wasn't retroactive, then I 

think the best reading of the rules would be you would 

not need to disclose that.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So if you don't need to 

disclose this -- and I think that this is the import of 

Justice Ginsburg's question -­

MR. BECK: Right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what's the difference 

between going, okay, we'll do the initial agreement, 10 

percent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate 

without providing notice; we'll go back down to 

12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate. What's 

the difference between doing that and, on the other 

hand, doing what the card issuer said here, which is if 

you're delinquent, we have the discretion to go up to 20 

percent, but, you know, we could also go to 12?

 MR. BECK: Well, the easy answer to that 

question is that it -- it's different because the 

language of the regulation specifies a different result 

in each case. Section 226.9(c)(2) says that no notice 

is required when any component of the finance charge

decreases or is changed in the customer's favor. So 

there would be under the plain language of the 

regulation no need to -- to provide notice there.

 But I think the intent of the question is, 

is Chase's argument about there's no practical 

difference between the two, that is, there's basically 

no harm from -- from not telling people that the -­

about their rate change. And we disagree with that as 

well, first of all because, as I was saying to Justice 

Ginsburg, you need to have the notice that there has 

been a change at all in order to -- to realize that you 

might want to avoid making extra purchases or 

consider -- not throw away the low APR offer that comes 

in the mail, for example.

 And also, aside from that, we think that 

when you have only a -- a maximum rate, that's basically 

the equivalent of a range of possible rates between the 

initial rate and the maximum rate. And that undercuts 

the ability to compare loans at the time of the 

cardholder agreement, even before the whole default 

comes into play, because at that point you have to 

compare two loans with two possible ranges of rates, and 

the key factor between the two, the value of the two 

loans, is how the credit card company will issue -- will 

use its discretion in -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just 

saying that the problem that Justice Ginsburg is 

concerned with isn't likely to come up, because a credit 

card issuer realizes he's not going to get chosen by a 

consumer if he says your rate is going to be somewhere 

between 5 and 20 percent. No one's going to sign up for 

that card.

 MR. BECK: Well, that's -- that's part of 

the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, because the point of -­

the central motivating purpose of TILA is to provide 

clear and up-front and specific disclosures, and that -­

that would put the burden on the consumer to -- to look 

into the fine print to figure out the conditions, and 

after judging all the applicability of those conditions, 

to figure out how it would apply and compare with other 

loans.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's fine to say 

then, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you 

had and that you explained a number of times was a bad 

one; you should change it, which they did. But you are 

up against a regulation that both sides say has some 

ambiguity, but that the Board has said what it meant a 

number of times. So is -- is the Court free to say the 

new rule is much better so we're going to say that 

that's what the old rule was as well, in the face of

interpret its own rules, and if it has authority to make

different. Why not? Where -- where in the law does it

varying levels of authority, and -- and those different 

methods of statement make a difference in how much 

deference will go towards those statements. And what we 

have here is the official staff commentary which the 

Board has designated as the official source of -- of 

interpretation of the rules, and we're asking the Court

well, is this what the Board now thinks? And what in 

the law prevents the Board, which is in charge of its 

own regulations, from telling us what it thinks, if it's 

in good faith and isn't making up some kind of ex-post 

rationalization? That's the word used, you know, in the 

brief case.

 MR. BECK: I think that the Board itself 

made that law when it decided that it would issue 

official staff commentary through a notice-and-comment 

process and interpret the rules in that way.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem with that 

is in the Ninth Circuit split about the official 

statements, and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent 

explanation of why the majority just is dead wrong in 

how it read those official comments. So you're relying 

on what two judges have said the official interpretation 

was, against the dissenting opinion and the Board itself 

saying that's what we meant in our official comments, in 

our official comments.

 MR. BECK: Well, we -- we think that Justice 

Cudahy's analysis made the same mistake that other 

courts have made in examining the regulations, which is 

to defer to the -- the unofficial statements of the 

Board, the Board or the Board's staff, before coming to 

a conclusion about the plain meaning of the official

regulations, the official interpretation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what about the 

invited brief in the First Circuit?

 MR. BECK: Well, there's no question that 

the invited brief is against our position, and we 

certainly wouldn't argue otherwise. But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You talk about the plain 

meaning or -- I thought you agreed that the -- that the 

regulation is ambiguous.

 MR. BECK: No, we don't agree that the 

regulation is ambiguous.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you did.

 MR. BECK: And I'd like to talk about that. 

Section 226.9 is the relevant change-of-terms provision, 

and it states that notice is required, quote, "whenever 

any term required to be disclosed under section 226 is 

changed." And section 226.6 in turn states that -- that 

there is a required disclosure when -- "of each periodic 

rate that may be used to compute the finance charge."

 And so those two sections working together 

say that you have to -- you have to disclose when 

there's a change of terms and -- and that one of the 

terms that has to be disclosed is the interest rate. 

And, in fact, the interest rate is the most important 

disclosure -­

hadn't been changed. You want to change it to "the 

rates that are charged."

 MR. BECK: But even -- even the Board and 

even Chase does not argue that you do not have to 

disclose the actual -- the actual purchase rate at the 

beginning of the agreement. Everybody agrees that that 

has to be disclosed, and that has to be disclosed with 

specificity. So the word "may" has to include the -­

both rates that might be applied and rates that are 

applied.

 And the reason the word "may" has to be 

there is because it's quite possible that a -- that a 

rate may never come into play. For example, if you have

an initial rate that changes at the end of 6 months and 

you leave the credit card before the 6 months are up, 

then that new rate will never come into play. But that 

doesn't mean you don't also have to disclose the rate 

that happened at the beginning of the credit card 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's at least 

a horse race, and that brings us back to how much 

deference you give to the -- to the Board.

 MR. BECK: Uh-huh. And I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to make the 

argument that it's clear. The fact that it says "may be 

charged" alone makes it unclear, it seems to me.

 MR. BECK: Well, I would say that even the 

Government doesn't -- doesn't agree with that, that 

"may" means that. Because that would -- the Government 

doesn't argue initial disclosures don't have to be 

specific and don't have to be -- don't have to be made.

 The Government's argument is a little bit 

different. What they're saying is that the word "term" 

in section 226.9 means contractual terms rather than 

credit terms. And that's a different argument because 

it doesn't -- it wouldn't -- it wouldn't affect the 

initial disclosures. It would only -- it would only 

mean that you don't have to give subsequent notice if

you haven't changed the contract in the first instance.

 And so these are actually somewhat -­

somewhat different theories. And under the Government's 

theory, there would be no role for section 226.9 to play 

because you would -- the only times it would come into 

play is when there's a change in the contract. And any 

time there's a change in the contract, under the basic 

contract law of every State, you have to provide notice 

at least to the other party to the contract. So the 

only time notice would be required under section 226.9 

would be when the -- when contract law requires that 

notice to be given anyway.

 And even worse than that, it would -- it 

would actually cut back on the required notice that 

would be available under contract law, because, for 

example, Delaware says you have to give 15 days' advance 

notice of a change in terms to a credit card agreement 

in the event of a default. And under this reading, you 

would -- even if the creditor changed the terms of the 

contract, as in increased the default rate above the 

maximum that the contract would authorize, so the 

contract says we can charge you 30 percent in the event 

of a default and you impose an interest rate of 

100 percent -- then even in those circumstances, you 

only have to provide contemporaneous notice of the

change. So you would basically have to put a letter in 

the mailbox on the day that you implement the new 

100 percent interest rate that was not disclosed in the 

initial agreement.

 And our submission is that that's not a 

reasonable interpretation of section 226.9. And it is 

true that the rules have been amended, but we have to 

look at the purpose of the rules from the point of view 

of the -- of the Board which enacted those rules in 

1981. And you can't assume that the Board at that time 

expected a set of rules that would never -- that would 

never require subsequent notice to be -- to be supplied 

unless there is a change in the terms of a contract, in 

which -- in which notice would have to be required 

anyway.

 The next point that the parties -- aside 

from the language of the -- of the regulation itself, 

the parties rely on the official staff commentary, as do 

we, in supporting their position. And the parties argue 

that the word "specific" allows them to -- I'm sorry -­

the Government and Chase Bank argue that the word 

"specific" allows them to specify in advance only the 

maximum rate and that the word "specific" encompasses a 

maximum and the circumstances of causing that maximum to 

go in effect of a universal default situation, where if

you default to any creditor or make a late payment to 

any creditor, then it triggers the new rate, which goes 

up to a discretionary maximum.

 It's our contention that that kind of 

situation of a universal default and a discretionary 

maximum rate is not a specific disclosure under any 

sense of the word. And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're getting back to 

what was my initial question. So you say you can't have 

flexibility that would favor the cardholder. If the 

initial notice is to count, then it has to be a fixed 

rate and the company can't exercise discretion to reduce 

the rate. That's what you're saying: A fixed rate 

would be okay. The problem with this is the company 

provided flexibility to reduce the rate in the interest 

of the cardholder.

 MR. BECK: That's one of the problems. The 

other problems are that the triggering event is not 

specific enough and that it applies retroactively.

 But, as to that problem, which we -- we do 

agree is a problem, that's a result of the Board's 

decision to allow reductions in interest rates without 

requiring notice. And if it were true that that meant 

that there's no point in giving a specific interest rate 

because it could always, after all, be lower -­

JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say "specific 

interest rate." I mean, my understanding of it -- and 

I'm asking, so you can correct me if that isn't so -- is 

there's a regulation, Regulation Z.

 MR. BECK: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And then the staff put out 

some commentary and says here's what that means, among 

other things: That the creditor can increase the rate 

at its discretion, and you've got to give notice. You 

have to give notice, but you have to give some more 

notice if the original notice does not include specific 

terms for an increase.

 And then they give an example. Suppose the 

increase could occur under the creditor's contract 

reservation right to increase the periodic rate.

 MR. BECK: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's a little obscure. 

As I say it, I'm not sure what I'm talking about. So 

then, later on, the Board puts out another -- not called 

official staff commentary, but they say: We'll tell you 

what that specific -- word "specific" terms mean. It 

means when they didn't say anything about the interest 

rate or they didn't say when in fact they were going to 

increase the interest rate from X to Y, then they didn't 

give specific notice.

But they did give specific notice if they 

told you when it would increase, by default -- when you 

default. And they did give specific notice when they 

told you what the maximum it would go up to was, like 8 

percent or 18 or whatever it is. Okay? So that's the 

Board's interpretation of its official staff commentary, 

which in turn is an interpretation of the reg.

 So if we're supposed to defer to their 

interpretation of their own reg -- I mean, my goodness, 

wouldn't we defer like double to their own 

interpretation of their own staff commentary, which is 

an interpretation of a reg which they have an authority 

to issue under the -- you see my point.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BECK: I see your point, Justice Breyer. 

But I would say that when you're talking about an 

interpretation of an interpretation, you're even further 

away from the original congressional intent that's 

empowering these kinds of interpretations. So I don't 

think that would -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that would be an 

argument you could make. You could say that -- that 

their interpretation here exceeds their authority under 

the statute. Now, of course, if you're right about 

that, all this stuff goes out the window.

MR. BECK: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's a pretty hard 

argument to make that one, I think.

 MR. BECK: And we're not making that 

argument, Your Honor. But what we are saying is -- is 

that when you look at the interpretation, you have to 

judge it based on the authority that comes with it and 

the deliberation that comes with it.

 And in this case, we know that the Board 

itself has designated the official staff commentary with 

notice-and-comment process as the way that it wants to 

officially interpret rules. And there's good reason for 

that, because the Board was concerned, as Congress was 

concerned, that there was all these differing 

interpretations of the -- of Regulation Z that were 

going out in the form of opinion letters.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's left of your 

arguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous, 

the official staff commentary is ambiguous? What's 

left? Is Auer deference then required?

 MR. BECK: I think -- I think Auer -­

brief at least? We can talk about whether the ANPRs or 

the unofficial commentaries are -- are due deference.

ambiguity?

 MR. BECK: I think in that case that the 

Court would have to defer to some degree to the brief, 

because that would be the only source of the Board's 

opinion in that case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your case rises and 

falls on whether we believe that the statute is clear?

 MR. BECK: The regulation and the official 

staff commentary.

 But I would also say that that deference 

does not have to be conclusive, and it should not be 

given the force of law, even to the brief, because the 

agency has said that it doesn't -- it specified the 

official staff commentary so that there aren't these 

multiplicity of different opinions going out, 

interpretations of Regulation Z that are difficult for 

banks to access to figure out what their obligations are 

under the regulations.

 And -- and so the Board itself doesn't want 

opinion letters and briefs and things to be -- to be 

interpreted as -- with the force of law, because that 

would, you know -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a different 

question. You're claiming that the Board's regulations 

supersede whatever deference Auer would otherwise give

to amicus briefs?

 MR. BECK: Yes. I think that's right or at 

least limit that deference. I think that the Court 

should at least -- should at least view the brief with 

more skepticism, given that the Board has wanted this 

very careful deliberative process for making its rules.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bauer, if -- most of 

your argument seems to rely on the official staff 

commentary, but the official staff commentary itself 

seems to me to cut against you. It says no notice may 

be -- need be given if the specific change is set forth 

initially. And then it gives examples of what that 

means. And it says such as an increase that occurs when 

the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a 

certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a 

particular rate and the account balance falls below the 

specified minimum.

 So the example that they give is an example 

where there's a triggering event and there's a penalty 

rate that comes into effect as a result of the 

triggering event. And that's exactly what is true here.

 MR. BECK: Yes, but in that case, Justice 

Kagan, you know for certain anyone who has a bank 

account can know what the balance of that bank account 

is. And so there's no uncertainty about whether the

balance triggering event is satisfied. And then there's 

no uncertainty about what the resulting rate is because 

section 226.6 says you have to disclose each interest 

rate and the range of balances to which it is 

applicable. So you have to know both the interest rate 

and you have to know the triggering event. And that's 

very different from a case where you're not sure, first 

of all, whether the bank is going to use its discretion 

at all. You don't know for sure whether your -- whether 

there's anything negative on your credit report that 

would even trigger that discretion to begin with. And 

you don't know, if the discretion is triggered, what the 

rate will be because the bank reserves discretion to set 

it anywhere up to the maximum.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, on the triggering 

event first, it's true that you might know your account 

balance, but it's also true that you might know whether 

you paid your bills on time. What's the difference?

 MR. BECK: Well, as -- there's the 

discretionary difference, for example. There's no -- in 

the bank situation, the rate is automatic and is not 

based -- it doesn't just trigger an exercise of 

discretion.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't see that in 

the example that's given. I don't see that it limits it

to a situation in which there is an automatic increase 

in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in 

your rate.

 MR. Beck: Well, for that, I would look to 

section 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate 

and the range of balances to which it is applicable must 

be set forth initially. And so you know from the very 

beginning which balances on your account will trigger a 

certain interest rate. And so there's no -- in that 

case, there's no uncertainty. But the other difference 

is that in the bank account situation, your balance is 

either above the maximum or below the maximum.

 But when you're talking about universal 

default, it's not always going to be obvious to you, 

first of all, whether anyone has reported anything to 

the credit agency. Oftentimes, certain creditors will 

overlook a certain late payment, for example, and maybe 

they reported one and it might not show up on your 

Experian credit report for months or years later, and 

then you will not know at what point it comes into play. 

So you would -- the only way to know for sure in that 

circumstance is to subscribe to the Experian credit 

reporting service just like Chase does so that you would 

know when there's any negative events that are reported 

to the credit agency that would possibly trigger Chase's

discretion, but even in that case you wouldn't know for 

sure whether Chase had implemented its discretion or 

not.

 And I wanted to say that the -- that the 

government -- its own interpretation of the regulation 

is, especially when considering the amendment, is itself 

inconsistent, because the government says that the new 

regulation fixed the problem. But the new regulation 

uses the same language as the old regulation when it 

comes to what's required for a -- for a later change. 

It does carve out the default rate situation as a 

special case. But for every other kind of rate increase 

that has happened subsequent to the initial disclosure, 

it still uses as a triggering event any change in terms 

required to be disclosed by section 226.6.

 And if it were true that -- that what the 

Board wanted to do was fix this ambiguity and this 

problem that was set forth in -- that was in the 

original regulations, then it would be very, very 

unlikely that the government would then implement the 

same language in the amended regulation and leave that 

same ambiguity in place rather than clarifying exactly 

when subsequent notice would be required.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not following that 

argument. I thought that the new regulation says now

any time there is a change in the rate, whether it was 

announced originally or comes up later, just keeping it 

nice and simple, a rate change, you send notice. And 

you've got -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days' 

notice. I thought that that's what the new regulation 

was.

 MR. BECK: That's why I am saying the 

government is inconsistent because that's what the 

government says that it does, but what it -- what the 

regulation actually says in 226.6(c), the new version, 

any change required to be disclosed -- a change in any 

term required to be disclosed by section 226.6 is the 

same thing. It is true that there's a new subsection 

(g) that applies just to default rates, and it's very 

extensive because it covers a lot of aspects of default 

rates. So now I think it is clear that default rate 

increases would have to be disclosed. So the problem in 

this case would certainly be resolved.

 But the Government's position is that -­

that there was a consolidation of all change notices 

into one 45-day notice period, and that's not clear from 

the regulation because it still uses this same ambiguous 

language that was in the old version. So I think the 

Court -- the Court should -- and for us that's an 

independent reason for the Court to view skeptically the

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 Just three small points. My interest was 

piqued when Justice Breyer said that he acknowledged 

that he may have no idea what he was talking about in -­

with respect to a reservation of rights. And I just 

want to be clear that reservation of rights clauses, 

which are also referred to as change-in-terms clauses, 

are ubiquitous in these -- in contracts and initial 

disclosures. They are a term of art, as the Board has 

recognized. And what they are is simply a statement by 

the credit card issuer in a consumer open-credit account 

arrangement that, you know, it may decide to change any 

term in any respect at any time. And the Board's

regulations make clear that if you do that, that is if 

you implement a change in terms pursuant to a 

reservation of rights clause, you have to provide 

notice.

 Now, the specific -- what "specific" means 

in the commentary to the regulation, which is a question 

that Justice Kagan asked, it seems to me was absolutely 

explained by the Board in a 1998 amendment to Regulation 

Z, which is comment 6(a)(2)-11, which is reprinted in 

relevant part on page A of our blue brief. This really 

is in our blue brief.

initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or 

more specific events, such as a late payment or an 

extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the 

creditor must disclose the initial rate and the 

increased penalty rate that may apply." And this was an 

amendment in 1998 that the Board made to Reg Z in what 

it recognized, what it stated was on account of the 

increased use of default penalty terms in the initial 

disclosures, that it wanted to make clear that if both 

the triggering event and the maximum rate was specified, 

there would be no change in terms if an increased rate 

were implemented.

 And finally, I just want to address my 

friend's point that there may be some question about 

whether TILA even authorizes the Board's explanation of 

the type of subsequent disclosure that was or wasn't 

required and underscore Mr. Palmore's observation that 

in TILA until 2009, there was a requirement for initial 

disclosures, there was a requirement for periodic 

statements, but nothing at all about subsequent 

disclosures. Thank you.
