CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical 

Company v. Bartlett. 

Mr. Lefkowitz. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

This is a classic case of impossibility 

preemption. Federal law required generic sulindac to 

have the same ingredients, the same warning and the same 

safety profile as the branded version. But a New 

Hampshire jury imposed liability because sulindac didn't 

have a different safety profile, meaning a different 

ingredient or a different warning. 

And as Mensing recognized, that's an 

impossibility conflict. And there is no principle basis 

for treating design defect claims any differently from 

failure to warn claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lefkowitz, could I 

understand something just about the scope of your 

argument? It -- it seems to me that in this case we are 

not really dealing only with generics, we are also

dealing with brand-named drugs. 

And I guess the -- the thought there would 

be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, 

as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're 

really all in the same boat. In other words -- you 

know, they have a design, that it is only that design 

that's approved. If they change their design there's no 

authority to continue marketing it. They have to go 

back to square one. And that's just as true of brand 

names as it is of generics. 

So am I right about that? That -- that if 

we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, 

putting the warning card aside, where you are in a 

different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to 

design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in 

hand? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, it's -- it's 

certainly the position that the government takes in its 

brief. I'm sure Plaintiff's lawyers would find 

arguments to differ. But the important thing is that 

it's really a distinction without a difference in real 

life because in light of this Court's decision in the 

Wyeth case, what happens across the board is that design 

defect claims are brought either as they are in nearly 

every State where there is a warning component, or -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: I want you to put that aside 

for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very 

significant thing in your argument to put aside. But 

let's just assume that there was a design defect claim 

that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a 

different position. Let's just assume on a pure design 

defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name 

manufacturers are in the same position with respect to 

those claims? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: If you are hypothecating --

hypothesizing a pure design defect regime, we're not --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Just about how you make the 

drug? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Correct. That is certainly 

the argument the government makes. I'm not sure whether 

or not the Court would find any type of distinction as 

the Court did in Wyeth, but that is certainly an 

appropriate interpretation of what the government is 

saying. But --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Not what the government is 

saying, I mean, I myself, I just can't figure out what 

distinction there would be. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So I'm asking you.

sure reading the FDCA there is a matter. My point is 

simply that in the real world, the cases are going to be 

brought as failure to warn claims or as design defect 

claims with warnings components. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, you -- but again, and I 

know that this is a big part of your argument, but to 

the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, 

and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm 

asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish 

between generics and brand-name manufacturers? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: I'm not sure, Your Honor, 

that there is a way to distinguish. If you were dealing 

in a regime in a State statute or a State tort regime 

where the only issue was design, unlike in the New 

Hampshire design defect, where as we know from PA 18 

where the First Circuit made clear that it, in fact, was 

the lack of an adequate warning that in fact made the 

drug more dangerous under the design defect case, the 

Supreme Court's case Vautour, which is the leading New 

Hampshire case. And in fact the jury instruction in 

this case was a binary choice. It specifically said, if 

you find that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, then 

you have to take a look at was the warning sufficient or 

not. 

We have a case here that is directly

controlled by Mensing because the warning was critical 

to the design defect case. We also have a case here 

that even if it were just purely a design defect case, 

at least with respect to a generic drug company, the 

Federal sameness mandate, the same Federal sameness 

mandate that applied in Mensing to warnings, applies in 

design defect cases. And therefore it is a classic 

impossibility case, just as the Court found in Mensing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me, is -- is it 

now your position, and it seems to be, that any time the 

FDA approves a product that there can never be a tort 

liability claim because the FDA's approval is now the 

ceiling of what you can do? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not, 

Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They approve 

nonprescription drugs. They approve a lot of things. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely. And 

Justice Sotomayor, as this Court made clear in 

Mensing -- in Wyeth and as Justice Thomas made clear in 

his concurring opinion in that case, just because a drug 

is granted an approval by the FDA does not mean that 

it's entitled to have the same label for all time. The 

distinction, though, that the Court articulated was that 

in Wyeth a brand company has the authority, and indeed

as this Court found, the obligation to update its 

warnings. A generic --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true with 

respect to the active ingredients. An active ingredient 

requires a new FDA approval process. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: But -- but we were talking 

in that case about the warning. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but we came back 

to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of 

dancing around the argument -- which is what happens 

with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that 

has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's 

adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no 

reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement 

third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing 

all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this 

drug. 

Because your adversary basically took that 

position at trial. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't matter --

there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs, no one 

should have prescribed this, no matter what the label. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Actually, Justice Sotomayor, 

that is not the position my adversary took at trial. My

adversary specifically put on a case about the warnings 

and said, the fact that SJS/TEN was warned about in the 

adverse reaction section and cross-referenced within the 

warning section was not sufficient. If it had been in 

the warning section like the FDA later said it should 

be, that would have made the difference. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can argue. But let's 

go to the point I raised, which is, I think what you are 

arguing now is that no truly bad drug, that shouldn't be 

on the market, would there ever be a tort claim that 

anybody could bring --

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because the FDA 

approved it. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not. That's not 

our argument at all. Our argument, first of all, is a 

very narrow argument --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what tort claim could 

they bring? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, they could bring --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Both, against, the brand 

could manufacture and the generic. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Right now if the 

Plaintiff -- the Respondent here had taken the 

brand-name drug Clinoril instead of the generic

sulindac, in the New Hampshire law, as it exists and as 

it existed at the time of the lawsuit, she would have 

had both a design defect claim and a failure to warn 

claim. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How? The FDA approved 

the design. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Because the design defect 

claim --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And they couldn't change 

it without FDA approval. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: But they could change the 

warning, and that's the essential component, as the 

First Circuit made clear. At PA 18 what the First 

Circuit said was the label was relevant to the design 

defect claim. The lack of a clearer warning made the 

product itself more dangerous under the risk/benefit 

tests prescribed by Bextra. That's the design defect 

standard. 

So had the Respondent taken the brand-name 

drug, she would have had a cause of action, even under 

the articulation of the sameness standard under 

Hatch-Waxman that we are articulating here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of our cases --

she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the

pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know 

brand, generic, isn't that correct? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly the same issue that 

we had in the Mensing case a couple years ago. 

Obviously we understand that not all consumers get to 

select on their own; their doctors select or maybe their 

State Medicaid laws make this choice, or the pharmacy, 

but the standards -- again, conflict preemption comes 

when the State is imposing a requirement or an 

obligation or enforcing a standard that you simply can't 

comply with under Federal law without violating Federal 

law. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that New Hampshire 

had a real strict liability regime, so that you -- you 

sell a drug, and whether it's unreasonably dangerous or 

not it causes an injury, you pay, to spread the costs. 

Would there be a problem with that? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Alito, I think if we 

had what would really be an absolute liability scheme, I 

think is really what you are suggesting, something 

similar to the kind of vaccine compensation program that 

we heard about this morning, that would not raise 

impossibility preemption problems at all. It might or 

might not raise obstacle issues; it would depend perhaps

on the scope of the program, whether it was singling out 

certain types of drugs, how expensive it was; but that 

would be a very different situation. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there a First 

Circuit --

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Frederick argues that 

that -- that's the thrust of the -- of the New Hampshire 

law. Why is he wrong on that? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, he's wrong because --

Price v. Dick -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court case, 

says very clearly, "We do not have an absolute liability 

system. We do not make manufacturers insurers of their 

product." And in fact, Mr. Frederick on page 21 of his 

brief articulates the standards for liability in this 

very case where he said, it has to be found unreasonably 

dangerous. 

And we know from Judge Boudin's statement 

that I just read that that -- that condition of 

unreasonable dangerousness is premised in large part on 

the question of the warning. And it makes sense because 

drugs are unavoidably dangerous. If you have --

follow-up?

generic manufacturer in a worse position under the 

absolute liability scheme than it would be under the New 

Hampshire scheme? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well --

JUDGE ALITO: Because under the absolute 

scheme they might say, if that's the cost, we are not 

going to sell this drug at all? Is that the reason? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: No, it's -- it's not a 

question of -- of policy choices, it's a question of 

operation of law. The issue here -- States are free to 

do lots of different things. They only are not free to 

do things when they conflict directly with Federal 

obligations. Basically, the Supremacy Clause sets up a 

rule of priority. 

And you have that rule of priority come into 

play when you have a State requirement and you have a 

Federal requirement. Here the vaccine program does not 

hinge on a question of whether or not the generic 

company violated a safety standard, whether the State is 

saying, your drug is too dangerous either because of the 

warning or because of the design. 

It is simply saying, we are going to charge 

manufacturers $1 dollar per prescription or --

not only what everyone agrees it is, a floor to enable 

you to market, but it is also a ceiling. That is you 

meet the FDA -- you get the FDA approval and 

that gives you a right to market, not simply an access 

to market, but it -- it operates as a ceiling? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: With respect to the 

question, Justice Ginsburg, as the Mensing Court made 

clear, when this very issue came up with respect to 

warnings which are commanded as a sameness requirement 

by Federal law in exactly the same way as the molecule, 

the design, the Federal regime does operate as a floor 

and as a ceiling. 

And when Federal law authorizes you to 

market a drug in interstate commerce by granting you the 

ANDA, that comes with it enormous protections. In fact, 

Congress has established --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there something in 

the -- in the Act that says that the States have no role 

with respect to the safety and efficacy of the drug --

the drug, it's only the FDA approval, that's it? 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: There is no express 

preemption clause here. However, as we know from 

Mensing where the Court articulated it in footnote 5 and 

as we know from Geier where the Court went and said 

ordinary conflict principles apply. In fact, even when

we have an express preemption clause and we have a 

savings clause, that they don't apply, we have to use 

ordinary operation of conflict --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think 

in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word 

"authorizes," and typically, when we think about 

impossibility, it's not enough that a State law 

penalizes what Federal law authorizes. 

What we -- something is impossible when a 

State law penalizes what Federal law requires or 

maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law 

gives you a right to do. But it's not enough for 

impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law 

permits. 

And it seems as though what we have in the 

FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can 

sell this. But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it 

doesn't give you a right to sell it. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, Justice Kagan, 

I'd like to give you two answers to that. The first as 

to the impossibility, for over 50 -- 50 years exactly 

now, this Court has been articulating as the 

paradigmatic example of impossibility preemption.

Growers where the Federal government said you can't sell

an avocado with less than 7 percent and you can't 

sell -- and the State said you can't sell the avocado 

with more than 8 percent oil. Now, clearly, there is no 

Federal obligation to sell avocados. 

I would submit that Congress is not agnostic 

about the sale of drugs, but the key is that the 

quintessential example of impossibility has nothing to 

do with a Federal right at all. It is simply 

conflicting standards. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that is your best 

case, but -- you know, there are quite a number of cases 

where we've really held when a Federal law permits 

something, typically, a State can do more if it wants 

to. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Justice Kagan, the very same 

issue came out in Mensing as well. After all, PLIVA was 

not obligated in any way to sell metoclopramide in 

Mensing. But, of course, this Court found that that was 

a case of impossibility conflict. And moreover, 

Congress has -- as I said, is not agnostic here. 

Congress had established a regime where in 

order to take a drug off the market, Congress had said 

the FDA has to provide the company with all sorts of due 

process protection, direct appeal to the Federal court, 

and in fact, Congress, in 1997, specified that any

people at the FDA involved in the drug approval process 

at all, withdrawing drugs or approving drugs, has to 

have special technical, scientific expertise, very 

different from what we have in lay jurors. 

But simply stated, Your Honor, from a 

impossibility perspective, this is not only the Florida 

Lime example, this is the Mensing case as well. 

Now -- you know, the -- the Respondent 

doesn't really take issue with either the sameness 

requirement of design or the sameness requirement of 

warning. The Respondent recognizes that our hands are 

tied. 

The Respondent also doesn't really try to do 

much with salvaging the First Circuit's dodge on 

supremacy by saying we could stay out of the market. 

Instead, what the Respondent does is he tries to carve 

out a distinction between strict liability and 

negligence claims. 

And all I will say before reserving my time 

is there's simply no basis in the law. This Court made 

clear in Riegel and in Cipollone and in several other 

cases that with respect to preemption, the same rules 

apply, strict liability or negligence imposed 

requirements by this case.

Mr. Yang? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG, 

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

New Hampshire law applies a hybrid 

design-defect standard that imposes liability for harm 

caused by a product if the product, in light of the 

manufacturer's warnings, is unreasonably dangerous. 

Now, that standard falls within the 

traditional way that this Court has looked at 

impossibility preemption in Mensing. It's also implicit 

in Levine because the analysis of the courts -- the 

analysis in Levine reflects an implicit judgment that 

the manufacturer could simply stop selling the product. 

You know, if that were enough to avoid a Federal 

impossibility preemption, there'd be no reason to do 

the analysis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's a 

little different. Our cases are focused on the concern 

that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a 

different duty than the Federal government. 

That's not what's going on in a strict 

liability regime. They're saying, we're not saying you

should have a different structure, we're not saying 

anything about warning, we're saying if you do this, 

you're going to have to pay for the damage. It's not --

it's not a different duty. And I think that's what's 

underlying the argument that, well, you can just stop 

selling because you don't have to adjust how you're 

going to make the drug. You understand that it's going 

to be the same as the Federal drug, but our system is, 

you pay for the damage. 

MR. YANG: There are two, I think, arguments 

embedded within that. There is a question of whether 

State tort law, whether by negligence or strict 

liability, imposes a duty that might conflict with the 

Federal obligation. And the second argument, I think, 

which is distinct, is that if you could simply stop 

selling, that would be a way of -- of cancelling 

impossibility preemption if there were in fact a 

conflict between the two standards. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How would you define the 

duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the 

First Circuit and according to the Respondent? 

MR. YANG: The duty is that one cannot 

market an unreasonably dangerous drug in light of the 

warnings -- that's unreasonably dangerous in light of 

the warnings. And what that means is that a

manufacturer will have to pay money in the liability 

suit if he doesn't meet that standard. 

And as this Court recognized in Riegel and 

in earlier -- in Cipollone, that this type of tort 

obligation, when you contingent -- make an obligation to 

pay tort liability based on meeting a standard under 

State law, that is a duty that could conflict with a 

Federal duty. And the Federal duty here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is that meeting 

a standard under State law that your friend's argument 

says, that's not what we're talking about here. The 

standard is the same. It's just a question under strict 

liability that if you follow the same Federal standard 

and market this in our State, you're going to pay the 

compensation for the reason of -- you know, spreading 

the costs. 

We don't want you to do something different. 

We just want to say that you want to do the same thing 

as the Federal government, and then you're going to have 

to pay. It's different than the -- at least that's how 

I understand their argument, which is that it's 

different where the situation says, yes, you can market 

it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way. 

That's a different duty for the manufacturer.

question of stop selling, which I think is what your 

question goes to, that you can always escape liability 

if you simply stop selling and don't have the market. 

It's not clear to me, first, that Respondent is, in 

fact, adopting the government's position because in our 

view, the obligation to change the labeling to make it 

safer and therefore escape liability under design-defect 

law in New Hampshire falls within the Court's decision 

in PLIVA v. Mensing. 

The only distinguishing factor we think that 

is material here would be whether the ability to stop 

selling means that there's really not a conflicting 

obligation. And as that would have been true in 

Mensing, it would have been true also in Levine, and 

would not have necessitated any impossibility analysis. 

And I think this, as my brother was just 

explaining, traces back to Florida Lime and Avocado 

Growers. The court framed the impossibility preemption 

inquiry there -- and I think this is important -- at the 

top of page 143. It says, the question is whether 

compliance with Federal and State regulation is a 

physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate 

commerce. That was the -- the formulation. 

So the idea is if you are an avocado grower 

in Florida and the Federal government said you have to

pick your avocados before they're at 7 percent oil and 

then California says, you can't sell in our State unless 

it's 8 percent oil, it's impossible to be a person 

engaged in interstate commerce there unless you violate 

one of those obligations. And when you have to violate 

one of those obligations, it's the State law that --

that falls. And I think, Justice Kagan, you were 

explaining --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, that suggests that 

there is an obligation of the Federal government. If 

there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's 

an impossibility defense. But if there's no obligation, 

if all there is, is permission from the Federal 

government, where do you get the impossibility from? 

MR. YANG: Let me draw a distinction if --

that I think might help. 

When the Federal government were to say --

let's go -- stay with avocados -- that avocados must 

have at least 7 percent oil. And the State says, you 

know what, we think it actually needs 8 percent oil. 

It's not impossible to comply there. But what we have 

here is a comprehensive regulatory scheme, where an 

expert agency with the relevant information makes an 

expert judgment based on sound -- sound scientific 

evidence that this drug is, in fact, safe and effective

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I take that point, 

Mr. Yang. I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then 

you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the 

FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as 

merely authorizing drug sales. 

You're saying essentially that when the --

when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just --

you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do 

this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed. 

So that when States take action as against that -- you 

know, it's -- it's a conflict. 

MR. YANG: Our -- our position is --

JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's --

MR. YANG: -- a little narrower. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and that's something I 

don't think we've really ever said. 

MR. YANG: I don't think the Court has 

addressed this question expressly. That is -- that's 

true. But I think our position is a little -- little 

tighter than that. Which is, when the State is imposing 

an obligation, they do it based on a safety standard --

that is in fact second-guessing the FDA -- that is 

preemptive. 

Not simply because the FDA has set the

standard, but the FDCA also has within it the judgment 

that safety is best effectuated not only by having the 

FDA set the standard, but by forbidding any manufacturer 

from deviating from that once it's been approved by the 

FDA. 

When we're talking about a drug's 

formulation, the manufacturer cannot change it. And 

that's what brings this within the ambit of 

PLIVA v. Mensing. And it also, I think, reflects why 

the Florida Lime example is -- is relevant because 

when --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So without the 

preemption clause, actually, with an express saving 

clause, you're arguing essentially complete field 

preemption. You're basically saying the minute that the 

FDA gives you permission to sell, it's a right to sell. 

And -- and it can't be altered by any State police 

power. 

MR. YANG: No, we're -- we're actually not 

saying that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't see how 

you're not saying that. 

MR. YANG: Well, no, with respect to the 

design-defect claims that -- and failure to warn, with 

respect to generics -- remember, this is exactly what

the Court said in Mensing -- we're saying the result in

Now, if we go to the pure design-defect 

claim -- and a pure claim, in our view, is one in which 

carves out the failure to warn issue, and it 

hypothesizes a reasonable physician that knows all 

the -- the health benefits and risks --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's your --

you're telling me that's exactly what the FDA is saying. 

You're saying there is no such thing.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's no strict 

liability that a State could impose. 

MR. YANG: If I might just finish. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would like to hear your 

answer. 

MR. YANG: Yes. When that pure 

design-defect standard has been satisfied, it means that 

no physician would prescribe the drug for any person, 

which means that drug, regardless of how you might 

improve the warnings -- it just doesn't matter because 

they know all -- all the adverse and positive benefits 

of the drug. It should not be marketed because it 

should never be prescribed. 

And when it should not be marketed and it

complies with the Federal government's misbranding 

standard, about dangerous to health when used as 

instructed, and it honors the FDA's rule by requiring 

new and scientifically significant information that was 

not previously before the FDA, that would not be 

preemptive. That is not this case. 

And so what we are trying to do is preserve 

the FDA's role here, not have juries second-guess on a 

case-by-case and State-by-State basis imposing different 

safety obligations on manufacturers when the Congress has 

established a regime for FDA to control this. 

Now, we're not saying the FDA's decision is 

forever binding. If there is new and scientifically 

significant evidence that hasn't been considered by the 

FDA -- and this is analogous to what the Court already 

did in Wyeth v. Levine -- because there, in the 

impossibility preemption, the Court looked to whether or 

not there would be newly acquired information that would 

allow a manufacturer to go within the changes being 

effected regulation in order to change the labeling. 

So what we're doing is just like what the 

Court required to be done in Wyeth, that in that 

context, if you meet the Federal misbranding standard, 

and you avoid the problem of PLIVA -- because you don't

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to start with the questions that 

you and Justice Alito posed about State law because it's 

important to understand, before you have impossibility 

conflict preemption, to understand what the State duty 

is here. 

I think it was conceded that it would not be 

impossible to have an absolute liability regime. So the 

question here is because New Hampshire actually makes it 

somewhat easier for manufacturers to evade liability, 

that that somehow creates a different kind of preemption

problem. We would submit that it doesn't. 

What the State law is seeking to do here, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is to impose liability where there is 

proof of an unreasonably dangerous product. 

That unreasonable danger entails evidence of 

a risk/benefit analysis that looks at the overall risks 

to the population against the overall benefits that are 

provided to the drug. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury decides all of 

this, right? 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's wonderful. 

Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and 

true decide for the whole State what the -- what the 

cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that 

unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also 

can save some lives. 

And the jury's going to decide that? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it is. 

And notably, the FDCA doesn't preclude that. 

Wyeth v. Levine affirms that principle. And what's 

important here is that under State law, there's not a 

duty to change the design or to change the label. It 

is, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, exactly as you 

postulated, that if there is an unreasonably dangerous

drug, that the people that are harmed egregiously, like 

Karen Bartlett, will have an opportunity to compensation 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not so sure --

I'm not so sure it works that way because of the jury 

point. They didn't say that yes, you can market this 

drug, it benefits -- you know, 99.9 percent of the 

people, but there is that 0.1 percent, and you're going 

to have to compensate that person. 

They said the risks outweigh the benefits, 

period. So you should not market this at all. And it 

does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, of course, 

Mr. Chief Justice, Mutual put in their defense in this 

case -- they rested after the plaintiffs put in their 

case. So it's not to say that in another case, they 

wouldn't have an opportunity to prove that there is some 

benefit of their drug. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you in 

that case? You've got one jury saying the risks 

outweigh the benefits, can't do it. And then you're 

saying well, later, there might be another jury saying 

yes, you can.

there is no offensive collateral estoppel that would be 

applied, Mutual can adopt a different trial strategy. 

It is often the case, Mr. Chief Justice, that in these 

kinds of cases, the defense applies different tactics to 

how they defend this case. 

In this particular case, they chose to waive 

their comment k affirmative defense. They chose not to 

put in any affirmative evidence itself. They chose 

after the trial in their Rule 50 motion for judgment as 

a matter of law not to challenge the warning 

instructions that were given to the jury -- as Judge 

Boudin noted and as the district court noted -- they had 

waived their preemption warning argument. 

And so what they seek to do here after not 

being able to show, which they cannot show under New 

Hampshire Supreme Court precedent, Vautour and Kelleher, 

cases that we cited in our brief, that New Hampshire 

imposes any duty to change any conduct by the 

manufacturer whatsoever. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Frederick, it -- it does 

seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver 

argument floating around here, but it does seem to me 

that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of 

the warning is really all over this case. There was 

expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning,

there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the 

warning. 

In the closing statements that the lawyer 

gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that 

the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the 

label was ineffective before. So there is just all over 

this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does 

suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of 

Mensing. 

MR. FREDERICK: Let me address that because 

I think that's the hardest part of this case to 

understand, and why this is different from Mensing. In 

a strict liability case in New Hampshire, the warning is 

not relevant as a -- as an element of the claim. What 

the jury is required as an element of the claim is to 

prove unreasonable dangerousness. 

And District Judge La Plant, who presided 

over this very complex and difficult trial with a lot of 

skill, understood the difference between the concept of 

adequacy of a warning which describes the risks and 

efficacy of the warning which limits or minimizes the 

risks. 

And all over the pretrial instructions, he 

made very clear to the counsel, you are not to argue 

about adequacy of the warning because that goes to the

comment k defense that they waived on the eve of trial. 

Instead, once the jury finds that the drug is 

unreasonably dangerous, it may use the warning as a way 

to limit or minimize the risk. 

In other words, the warning could only 

benefit Mutual because liability was going to be found 

in spite of the warning and not because of the warning. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I see that. But I don't 

understand why that matters. That is, the -- I mean, I 

was thinking just what you said. I was thinking well, 

I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay? 

So I lost, I lost. The -- the -- the point is that --

that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if 

there were no warning here at all, then it would be 

unreasonably dangerous. 

I think, yes, that probably applies to 

chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it 

probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the 

defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use 

it. And as you say, that would be not -- it would be 

despite or whatever it is, despite, not because. 

But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes 

for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous, 

too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning. 

Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of. But properly

labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case. 

MR. FREDERICK: It is not. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because -- why? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, absolutely not, 

Justice Breyer. The evidence here was clear. No 

warning would have made any difference to lessening the 

risk. And that is because, and this is on --

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, in this 

case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there 

is no such warning that could make a difference, that's 

what they're asked to find? 

MR. FREDERICK: All that they -- in terms of 

minimizing the risk. Justice Breyer, here --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how can that be, 

Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a 

large portion of their case trying to show this, that 

the warning was inadequate. So the plaintiff must have 

thought that there was a possibility that if the warning 

was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the 

warning was not adequate, liability would follow. 

MR. FREDERICK: The case as it was litigated 

up until the day before the trial was with a comment k 

defense, which allows as an affirmative defense the 

defendant to say if the drug is unavoidably unsafe and 

it has an adequate warning, i.e. it adequately describes

what the risks are, complete immunity from suit. 

They abandoned that comment k defense on the 

eve of trial. And so as the judge understood and 

instructed the jury, the only role that the warning 

actually played was whether it could lessen the risk to 

patients who took the drug, i.e. in the risk/benefit 

analysis, it's somewhat less risky in weighing it 

against the benefits. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The failure -- the 

failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck 

that out. So there was no failure to warn defense in 

the case. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, that's 

correct. And as the Le Blanc case held in the 

New Hampshire Supreme Court, the New Hampshire law 

treats failure to warn cases as distinct from 

design-defect cases. Here, no words would have made any 

difference because the scientific --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where is that? That's -- I 

do see that distinction. If, what you're -- but look, 

the complaint's filled with words about adequate 

warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da,

saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do 

with adequate. There is no warning in the world that 

anybody could have invented that would have made a 

difference. I'll have to think about that one. But in 

the meantime, where is it that that's what they said? 

MR. FREDERICK: Where is it in the record? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. How do I discover 

that you're right about this? Because everything in 

the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to 

talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is 

no warning in the universe could possibly have made a 

difference. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, I would direct you to 

two --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do I discover that? 

MR. FREDERICK: -- two pieces. The JMOL 

order that the judge issued, which is in the petition 

appendix, goes through this very clearly. And Judge Le 

Plant understood how the different roles of warning 

apply, and he instructed the jury, and this is in the 

pre-formal colloquy that he's giving to the jury orally, 

you can find this at 496 of the Joint Appendix where he 

says, "Adequacy is not an issue for -- the adequacy of 

the warning is not an issue for you to decide."

then on page 516 of the Joint Appendix, he says, "You 

only consider the warning to minimize the risk," i.e. to 

benefit Mutual in the assessment of whether or not in a 

risk/benefit analysis this drug has greater risks 

than --

JUSTICE BREYER: The second point is a 

different point. The second point is, look, I have 

chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10. All right. 

If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was 

unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label 

explaining the whole thing, it doesn't. It isn't 

unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and 

they could perhaps wouldn't find it. 

All right. Now, you can call that 

diminishing or you could call it adequacy. Call it what 

you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing 

and is different from saying, no label in the universe 

would say it. 

MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, a 

chemotherapy drug has got a huge benefit. It 

potentially saves you from cancer. A nonsteroidal 

antiinflammatory drug, of which there were 16 other 

types, is not at all analogous to a chemotherapy drug.

JUSTICE BREYER: We're talking about what 

juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know 

about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are. 

That's why I said let the FDA say it. 

MR. FREDERICK: But that's why when the jury 

gets evidence that aspirin and acetaminophen, Tylenol 

produce the same kind of pain relief, but they do not 

produce the kind of SJS/TEN that Ms. Bartlett -- that 

caused 60 percent of her body to burn. I mean, that 

gives you a very clear contrast. 

JUSTICE ALITO: If that's correct, and maybe 

it is, doesn't that mean the drug should never have been 

approved? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, because the evidence at 

the time of approval had not yet been ascertained. What 

was clear from the unpublished Pharmacia report that 

went into evidence in this case was that between the 

time of 1980 and 1997, the adjusted reporting rate of 

these adverse incidents went very high, and it was of a 

rate that was comparable to Bextra, which went on the 

market several years after that study ended, in which 

the FDA, in looking at a comparable adjusted adverse 

reporting rate, concluded should be taken off the 

market. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it true that when

the -- the FDA reviewed this whole class of drugs, they 

decided to pull Bextra, but not this drug? 

MR. FREDERICK: That is true, but what the 

FDA did not take into account, and this is what the 

district judge instructed the jury on September 22nd, 

2010, I think it's page 108 in the charging colloquy, is 

the evidence in this case was that the FDA did not have 

that evidence. 

So what the Solicitor General seeks to argue 

here is evidence that was not in the record and in which 

Mutual's own expert who created this evidence testified 

in deposition he didn't give it to the FDA. And then 

Mutual never put him on the stand to be cross examined. 

And so now what we have is a trial record that shows 

this evidence was not given to the FDA at all. 

JUSTICE ALITO: The -- the SG says that the 

FDA did have this right, did have it and did consider 

it, and that's incorrect? 

MR. FREDERICK: That is incorrect. That the 

FDA, if it considered it, there is no record of it doing 

so because in the response to the 2005 citizen petition 

and in a later memorandum, it never mentions sulindac. 

So if you are to take any kind of regulatory preemption 

here, it surely has to be on the basis of a considered 

action that the FDA takes after notice and comment

That was the kind of standard that was

that is absent here. And, in fact, this case has even a 

weaker case for that kind of considered and rejected 

than in Levine itself where there was evidence that 

Phenergan had caused some arterial exposure. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you want me to write 

down in this case, from my understanding, that under New 

Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite 

without reference to the adequacy of warning? 

MR. FREDERICK: You can do that. Yes, 

Justice Kennedy, you can do that. It is a factor for 

the jury to consider. It is not an element of the 

claim. And what PLIVA makes clear --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now wait. What's --

what's a factor? The warning is or is not a factor? 

MR. FREDERICK: The warning can be a factor. 

What that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's -- that's

the warning relevant or not relevant to the 

determination of strict liability? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes, it was relevant as in 

this case. But, Justice Kennedy, if you were to take 

the position that mere evidence that is a factor for the 

jury to consider, even though there is no need to change 

any legal duty, you would be adopting field preemption 

under this statute because the whole thrust of PLIVA --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the 

definition of the duty. Was it permissible for the jury 

to define the duty here and the breach of the duty in 

part by -- by reference to the adequacy of the warning? 

And I -- I now understand your answer to be yes. 

MR. FREDERICK: No. And let's be clear on 

our nomenclature here. A duty is a legal requirement 

imposed under State common law, a duty to use due care, 

a duty to change the label, which is what was conceded 

in PLIVA and Mensing. Here New Hampshire law does not 

require a duty to change the label or to change the 

design. All it does, Justice Kennedy, is to say, if the 

jury finds that the risks outweigh the benefits, it may 

consider whether the warning would have lessened the 

risk.

the warning in, so you are liable for $9 million, and 

saying, you are liable for $15 million, but if you put 

the warning in, you are only liable for 9 million? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, when there is a 

comment k defense, Mr. Chief Justice, you may be off 

completely. And that's why the role of comment k is so 

critical in these strict liability claims. All --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but just to 

get back to my -- to my question. You say there is a 

difference between saying, you have to put on warning 

and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying, 

you are liable no matter no matter what because it's 

strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's 

reduced. If you are a drug manufacturer, you are 

supposed to see a difference in those two situations? 

MR. FREDERICK: There is a difference, and 

the difference is this, assume in the Diana Levine case 

there had been a strict liability claim that went all 

the way through. The question under a strict liability 

law would be would a -- would -- did the warning lessen 

the risk that she would have had gangrene and amputation 

of her arm? The adequacy of the warning under a strict 

liability law simply goes to did the manufacturer 

adequately describe the risks that the patient might 

incur.

In the Levine case it very well might have 

been that the warning adequately describes that there's 

a possibility of gangrene, but it didn't do enough to 

lessen the risk that she would sustain. And because 

there was a way to change the label to lessen that risk, 

she got a judgment for a failure to warn. Because the 

manufacturer's conduct was such that it could have 

improved the label. 

Here we acknowledge and the evidence shows 

there is no way to change the label here. Some --

some -- some number of people, maybe some in this room, 

might take sulindac and get SJS/TEN. We don't know who 

they are, and we can't write words that would tell 

anyone in this room, you have a lesser chance of getting 

that horrible disease. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but then if you apply 

this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, 

and it's why I came up and said, the FDA has to 

tell us -- you know. Because just what you said before; 

what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 12 

people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in 

Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of 

chemotherapy. 

You see, you could in certain horrible cases 

find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer

terribly. And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people 

rather than the FDA. So my solution to it, which you 

know because you read Medtronics, may not work, but it's 

the best I can think of. 

Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you 

want, no, there is some totally different thing. But 

what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind 

is I say, beware because it's also true potentially of 

some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's 

worrying me. 

MR. FREDERICK: Let's be clear, 

Justice Breyer. There is a difference between the 

application of impossibility preemption, which I don't 

think anybody here can argue with a straight face that 

simply paying a judgment in strict liability is 

impossible in light of the Federal regime, an obstacle 

preemption. 

Now, it may well be that there could be 

cases out there like your life-saving type drug, which 

by the way has a special regulation under a special 

statute to ensure that that is on the market, and some 

other drug where the risk/benefit equation is -- is 

such. 

But surely in our system we have to trust 

district judges to be able to grant or deny judgments as

a matter of law, where they conclude that the evidence 

would not be sufficient to show that the risk outweighed 

the benefit. 

And here, the judge made very clear that 

because Mutual had not put in any evidence of the 

benefit of its drug at all and arguably couldn't have 

done so because this drug is like aspirin -- except that 

it causes these horrific injuries -- it's reasonable to 

suppose that a jury which can decide misbranding actions 

under the FDCA, and that has been acknowledged by the 

majority in Wyeth v. Levine, can make the very same 

risk/benefit safety determination that Justice Thomas in 

his concurring opinion said also is -- enabled the 

States to make. The States are not precluded under the 

FDCA from making that kind of judgment. 

So in the hard case, Justice Breyer, there 

is a mechanism for preemption. The FDA has to act. It 

has to act pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking. 

It has to identify which drugs it thinks would not be 

subject to these kinds of strict liability claims, but 

it hasn't done that here. 

All it's done is to say, we happen to have 

some evidence in our files, ergo preemption. Well, 

preemption doesn't work like that under the Supremacy 

Clause.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just -- just to --

because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on 

the market? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And is it on 

the market with a different label? 

MR. FREDERICK: It is. The label changed 

after Karen Bartlett sustained the injuries that she did 

in this case. In fact, that was one of the arguments 

that -- that at the time, this was before PLIVA, okay? 

So there was a lot of failure to warn being argued 

because the regime, as the case came into trial was 

under Wyeth v. Levine, it was not under the 

PLIVA v. Mensing case. 

So Justice Kagan, that's why it's perfectly 

reasonable for the trial lawyers here to think that the 

warning is an appropriate thing because this Court's 

case that had just been decided made that perfectly 

clear. But what was interesting here was that Judge La 

Plant made a very clear distinction between the role 

that the warning would play, appropriately so, under a 

strict liability regime. 

Now, I would like to note that the avocado 

case is one that did not entail the State banning 

avocado sales. Judge Boudin is absolutely right when he

says that there is nothing under the FDCA to preclude 

the State from making a reasonable safety determination 

that might lead to the withdrawal of the drug. Now, 

admittedly, that is a rare circumstance. 

And that is not what New Hampshire is doing 

here, and in his post-trial orders Judge La Plant made 

clear that is not what New Hampshire is imposing here. 

All New Hampshire is imposing here is a duty to pay 

compensation if your unreasonably dangerous product 

harms a patient. 

JUSTICE ALITO: This argument about stopping 

the sale of the drug completely seems to me to eliminate 

the impossibility -- impossibility preemption, doesn't 

it? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, because the -- the duty 

here, if there is any duty to stop selling under New 

Hampshire law, it can be complied with by not selling 

the drug. There's nothing in Federal law that requires 

or mandates the sale of these drugs. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But that's true -- isn't 

that true often in -- in these impossibility cases? Let 

me say Congress passes a law that says everywhere in the 

United States you must drive on the right side of the 

road, and New Hampshire is quirky, they say, in New

to try comply with both at the same time. But certainly

JUSTICE ALITO: You decide -- if you decide 

to drive --

right. But the difference, Justice Alito, is what is 

the content of the substantive duty. If the content of 

the substantive duty is you -- the State says to do one 

thing and the Feds say do the opposite, that's 

impossibility conflict. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Feds didn't say to do 

the opposite. They said -- they didn't say you have to 

drive in New Hampshire. They say, you must drive on the 

right if you drive. They don't require you to drive in 

New Hampshire.

says in its logical extension, you look at the -- you 

look at the content of the duty there, the content of 

the duty was to change the label. What the majority 

opinion says is that Minnesota and Louisiana law said 

you must change the label and the Federal government 

says, you cannot change the label. So here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- I'm 

sorry to interrupt you. But your friend on the other 

side, of course, says PLIVA involves strict liability as 

well. So it did not say you must change the label. 

MR. FREDERICK: Actually we dispute what 

they say, and we've got an -- an excursus about Mensing 

in our brief, and what is clear is that as the case came 

to this Court, the only duty that was being litigated 

was the duty concerning the warning label. There was 

not a strict liability claim in the sense of a design 

defect. 

Mind you, there are strict liability claims 

in -- in failure to warn as well. That is essentially 

what comment k gets at. This case however, was tried as 

a design case only, and the State law duty made very 

clear there was no duty to change the design of the 

drug. And so therefore, under Mensing, there can't be 

impossibility because State law is not telling you --

suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado 

Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to 

do since they can just be fined and the money would go 

to pay the consumers of California who have the 

unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados. 

I mean, that would raise at least serious problems of --

commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth. 

MR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, that's not 

an impossibility hypothetical. That's an obstacle 

hypothetical. And in Wyeth, I think six justices said 

there is no obstacle under the FDCA of having State law 

remedies to compensate injured patients. 

So you know, the reason why it's important 

to keep these concepts of preemption distinct is that 

they ask you to grant cert on whether or not it is 

impossible to comply in light of PLIVA, which was an 

impossibility preemption case. That was not an obstacle 

preemption case. 

Now, having -- you know, I think gotten a 

deeper view of what State law requires, they're seeking 

to shift the case into an obstacle case, and virtually 

all of the Federal government's arguments here are 

obstacle-type arguments. It is because the FDA is so 

expert that it has this information in its files and 

that that should therefore negate and displace and

nullify State law, which is a rather sweeping 

proposition. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your point in this 

case that obstacle preemption has been waived? 

MR. FREDERICK: Granted --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or were you granted cert 

just on impossibility? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes, yes. Our position, and 

we -- we -- we made this clear that all they were asking 

in the cert petition was for an impossibility look at 

PLIVA. The obstacle argument has been waived in our 

view of the way this Court ordinarily takes certiorari 

cases and then decides them. So -- and on the 

impossibility point, I think that our position is clear. 

Now, Justice Kagan, the very first question 

out of the box was does this rule that they're 

advocating apply to brand name drugs and the answer 

unfortunately is yes. Because the premise of their 

argument is that simply because the FDA approved the 

drug and there would need to be some State law claim 

that would give rise to some alteration, that that 

necessarily would mean that it would be impossible to 

comply with. 

And so that applies to brand name drugs as 

well as generic drugs. We don't see a principal

difference, unfortunately, to distinguish them. There 

may be some difference in certain State laws. I don't 

want to speak for all 50 States, but the basic gist of 

their argument is FDA approval über alles. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: There is no such thing then 

as a brand name manufacturer can change some design 

features of the drug -- you know, without FDA approval 

or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's 

nothing like that? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, the FDA requires a -- a 

new drug or an abbreviated drug application, I get the 

terms of them sometimes confused, but if there was to be 

a tweak to the design, they'd need to go to the FDA to 

get approval for that. 

I want to make one other point, which is 

that strict liability applies to distributors as well as 

to manufacturers. And so here it seems obvious that a 

distributor can't change the design and it cannot change 

the label. 

But under normal principles of strict 

liability, the idea is that if you are a seller of the 

product in your normal course and it is a dangerous 

product that causes somebody to be injured, you can be 

held liable in strict liability. That principle is very 

well settled.

And so it would seem odd to suppose that the 

distributor who has no power to make any change in 

conduct that would make the product any safer also gets 

to be immunized from suit. 

I have no further points unless the Court 

has further questions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you respond to the 

argument, Mutual's argument that they have -- in 2005, 

they made -- this drug produced $7 million. The jury 

verdict was 21 million. They said that 3 years of their 

earnings wiped out. 

MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I've never 

been in a case in my time arguing before this Court 

where somebody in a reply brief at the merits put in 

evidence that they did not put in at trial and they 

sought to persuade you that that was somehow relevant. 

Number 2, the issue here concerns sulindac 

manufactured by all the different manufacturers of 

sulindac, not just Mutual. 

Number 3, we never have seen that 

information. It was never served on us. We have no way 

to test it. I have no idea whether it is accurate or 

not. 

Number 4, if they are only making 

$7 million, they ought to withdraw from the market

Thank you.

Mr. Lefkowitz, you have three minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY P. LEFKOWITZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Thank you. I'd like to just 

make three brief points. 

It is rather incredible to hear counsel talk 

about how the warnings were not the issue in this case. 

From the opening statement of plaintiff's counsel, I'm 

quoting now, "The evidence will show you that sulindac 

was unreasonably dangerous and had an inadequate warning 

as well. One of the easiest ways to show you this will 

be to show you that they got a new and better warning 

about six months after respondent took the drug. The 

label got better. 

And at CA App. 2761, we have the FDA letter 

explaining exactly why, in the FDA's view, the new 

warning was going to make the drug safer. What it 

said" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you get to the 

jury's -- to the instructions to the jury?

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Absolutely not. It was a 

proper instruction under New Hampshire law. It was an 

instruction that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's what the jury 

was supposed to apply, not what counsel said. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: The jury applied the 

instruction that the court gave it, which was to decide 

whether or not the jury was good enough -- the warning 

was good enough or not. And, in fact, as the First 

Circuit made very, very clear at PA 18A, it said, the 

label was relevant to the design defect. The lack of a 

clearer warning made the product itself more dangerous 

under the risk/benefit analysis of New Hampshire law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said there 

was nothing wrong with the jury instructions, at least 

you didn't object. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Your Honor, let me be clear. 

We objected at the very beginning of this case, we said 

this is all preempted. There is no ability to change 

the warnings. The warnings are acceptable as a matter 

of Federal law. And this Court, every Justice on the 

Court agreed in Mensing that we couldn't change the 

warnings. Once the Court rejected that, it was a fair 

statement of New Hampshire law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how did the Court

reject it? They threw out the failure to warn claim. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: The trial judge rejected our 

summary judgment motion on preemption. We raised these 

issues. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It says on page 5496, 

adequacy of the warning, I guess, the judge says, is not 

an issue before this jury. And that was the point. 

MR. LEFKOWITZ: Well, he said that, but then 

he went and he instructed the jury and, again, as the 

First Circuit made clear, it was in fact -- the 

dangerousness was because of the arguable inadequacies 

of the warning, which the plaintiff said we could have 

changed, we should have changed. 

I want to just finish with two brief points, 

if I may. On impossibility, look, this impossibility 

doctrine under preemption is premised on the fact that 

parties will engage in conduct. As Justice Breyer made 

clear in his opinion in the Geier case, he said, under 

ordinary obstacle principles, a State might be able to 

make you liable for using the Federally required 

windshield retention requirements. 

Obviously, there is no Federal requirement 

to sell cars. It conditions that if you sell the car, 

you have a requirement. If you sell a drug, a generic 

drug, you have a particular requirement.

The distinction between strict liability and 

negligence, Cipollone, Riegel, make absolutely clear 

there is no basis whatsoever for a distinction under 

law.
