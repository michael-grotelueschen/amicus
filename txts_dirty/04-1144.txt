 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument next in Ayotte versus Planned Parenthood of 

Northern New England. General Ayotte.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KELLY A. AYOTTE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice and may 

it please the Court:

 The Court of Appeals struck down New 

Hampshire's parental notification act on its face 

based upon a potential application of the act that even 

respondents concede may only arise in the smallest 

fraction of cases. In doing so, the act was rendered 

ineffective in the overwhelming number of 

applications where it is unquestionably 

constitutional, and State officials were denied the 

opportunity to imply -- apply and enforce New 

Hampshire's act within constitutional limits.

 New Hampshire's act can be applied in a 

manner to protect a minor's health if the rare case 

arises where a medical emergency occurs that requires 

an immediate abortion. In that rare case, if it does 

arise, where an abortion has to be performed 

immediately and the child does not want to notify a

parent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism 

available which requires New Hampshire courts to act 

promptly and without delay and in the best interests 

of the minor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you at 

this point? Because there is one thing that I'm not 

sure that I understand about your position, and one 

way of reading your brief takes you a step beyond 

what you have just said. So I would like to get 

clear on this.

 And I understood your argument to be that 

given the safeguards such as judicial override, there 

simply was no -- there was no need to read the health 

exception in, that in fact it was taken care of --

any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for 

the need for health exception in fact were addressed 

by the statute.

 The point at which I'm not clear on your 

position is -- occurs in what you've said on page 11 

of your yellow brief, if you could get that out. Do 

you have the carry over paragraph on 11? You go 

through the kind of a worst case analysis. And you 

say, well, you know, assuming that all of the 

safeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the 

unlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the

48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who 

performs an emergency abortion under such 

circumstances would not be subject to either criminal 

prosecution or civil liability because his or her 

conduct would not only be constitutionally protected 

but would be independently justifiable, and then you 

cite the competing harms. What do you mean when you 

say it would be constitutionally protected?

 I read that as suggesting that there was 

indeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of 

a health exception, but that may not be what you 

meant. What do you mean by constitutionally 

protected? What are you getting at?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, in that 

instance, we did not say that it was an independent 

constitutional requirement that there be a health 

exception, but certainly reading this Court's cases, 

we should apply our act in a manner to protect if 

that rare case arises where an emergency abortion 

would come forward. And, if a physician were 

prosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not 

only would he have a statutory ability to say this 

prosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also 

given those rare circumstances, we do not think that 

he, under the Constitution, may be prosecuted.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if he said, "I may 

not be prosecuted under the Constitution because," 

what follows "because," in your view?

 MS. AYOTTE: I may not because New 

Hampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to 

ensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance 

needs an immediate abortion, that she receives that 

immediate medical care in those circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that mean because 

there is a required health exception? I mean, isn't 

that what you're saying?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Souter, not that 

there is an express requirement of a health exception 

but that the law cannot be implied in a manner to 

infringe on the minor's health if that rare emergency 

case arises.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your first answer to 

Justice Souter was that the physician would say you 

can't be prosecuted under our law. Do you mean this 

act that we're looking at here? Or do you mean the 

law generally including constitutional protections 

that this Court has proclaimed?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, in that 

limited circumstance, we do not believe that the 

physician would be prosecuted under our parental

notification act, given that there is a mechanism --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of the text of 

the act or because of some policy that the attorney 

general would follow in order just to decline to 

prosecute? We want to know what this act says in the 

instance posed by Justice Souter.

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Kennedy, with 

respect to the act itself, assuming it were a life --

excuse me, a health emergency short of a 

life-threatening emergency, where a minor did not 

want to notify her parents and assuming those 

situations came forward and someone was unable to 

reach a judge, the act itself provides a mechanism in 

it that anticipates providing a judge where 

necessary, and so that would be the ability of a 

minor in those circumstances to seek a judge.

 But if for some reason all of those 

situations came together and the minor could not seek 

a judicial bypass in those instances, there is an 

existing provision of New Hampshire law, our 

competing harms defense, that we believe protects the 

physician in those circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's just imagine a real 

circumstance. A 15 year-old walks in 2:00 in the 

morning on Saturday into the emergency room and the

doctor looks at her, she's pregnant, she has this 

very high blood pressure, whatever. And the doctor 

thinks to himself, he thinks, well, immediate 

abortion, no question, immediately deliver the child. 

If I don't, I don't think she's going to die but 

she'll never have children.

 And he's thinking that. What's supposed 

to happen? He calls up Pam Pevagoglio or Pam 

Livingston and there is no answer. It's 2:00 in the 

morning and there is one of those things, leave a 

message, okay? Should I call your parents? No. 

They don't know I'm pregnant. Now, what's supposed 

to happen?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, the 

physician in those instances could perform the 

immediate abortion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that in 

the statute. It suggests the contrary. So what is 

the particular provision of New Hampshire law that 

tells that -- I mean, the doctor -- all these things 

are, you know, questions of probability. And he 

doesn't want to risk being prosecuted and he doesn't 

want to risk losing his license. And so what 

particular provision -- he happens to have his lawyer 

with him.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: What does the lawyer say? 

Okay? What's the provision that saves him? There is 

no health exemption in this statute.

 MS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, his lawyer 

would advise him, in those circumstances, that the 

competing harms defense would protect his actions 

because he needs to act urgently necessary -- in an 

urgently necessary circumstance.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would it protect him 

from a civil damages action as well as prosecution in 

a criminal case?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, by the 

plain language of the competing harms defense, it 

also precludes civil liability. I would also say that 

that lawyer would also advise him, if given the 

opportunity, the attorney general is prepared also to 

issue an opinion describing the applicability of the 

competing harms defense in this very rare 

circumstance, should it arise.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know? I mean, 

what you're saying is fine, but how do we know that 

that's actually the law? I mean, there are a lot of 

people who absolutely in very good faith would say 

that it isn't competing harm. They would say that

the competing right that the life of the fetus is more 

important than the possibility of the mother having 

children in the future herself.

 See, there are people in good faith on 

both sides of this argument. And so how do we know 

that the New Hampshire statute is going to do -- not 

the statute, but your competing harms defense is 

going to do for this particular woman what a health 

exception would do?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Breyer, because 

the harm that is being weighed here is the harm of 

urgently providing care to this minor who needs it, 

as opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get 

at, which is notification of parents. It's not 

whether or not the minor can have an abortion. The 

minor can always go forward and have an abortion 

under these circumstances.

 So people aren't weighing the right of the 

fetus, in this instance, to the right of the mother's 

health. So the weighing is quite easy. And if given 

the opportunity, my office would be prepared to issue 

an opinion as to the applicability of this defense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, your opinion --

that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on 

the line. And you said the lawyer would say, oh,

you've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Competing harm.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Competing harms, a defense --

I think that a lawyer who cares about his client 

would say, defense is not what we want. What we want 

is there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense 

and maybe the attorney general will give us a 

letter saying that we come under that defense. 

Wouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be 

protected is that there is no claim for doing what 

you're doing?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, in the 

Simopoulos case considered by this Court, one of 

the issues that was raised was a medical -- the 

physician was prosecuted for performing an abortion 

outside the parameters of the Virginia act. And the 

physician failed to raise a medical necessity defense. 

This Court held that that was sufficient prosecution, 

that that was okay. And this would work the same way. 

Once the physician raises a competing harms defense --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General, may I just point 

this -- suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of 

the legislative history and say, well, generally that's 

true. But when you have a legislative history that 

suggests that the legislature considered this very

defense and rejected it in the statute, would then that 

then give them some concern?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, the 

legislative history -- there certainly was some 

indication that the legislature did not want a 

general health exception. There is no indication in 

the legislative history that the legislature intended 

to preclude this narrow category of cases which 

constitute emergency cases short of that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if they discussed 

the issue on the floor of the legislature, why 

wouldn't they have drafted the precise protection 

they thought appropriate?

 MS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, when they 

discussed the history on the floor of the House and 

Senate, they felt that it protected for emergencies 

and there was no discussion of this narrow category 

of cases short of death.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you have another 

point here, don't you, about how general this statute 

is. We don't normally interpret statutes this way, 

that they are totally invalid if any application of 

them would be unconstitutional. That's not what we do 

with statutes normally, is it?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Scalia, no. In

fact, the analysis, if you look at this one potential 

application, this -- the standard applied by the 

Court of Appeals in this case goes well beyond even a 

substantial overbreadth test that is applied by this 

Court in the first amendment context.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the first amendment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right in 

reading your briefs that you don't object to a 

pre-enforcement challenge to the bypass procedure 

itself brought by physicians, for example?

 MS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, no, we 

do not object in that sense. We think that is a very 

good mechanism to bring forth a case given that this 

Court has granted third-party standing to physicians 

to resolve these types of claims. And teh benefit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I gather that 

the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that 

might arise in that case would be quite similar to 

the debate in the present context. In other words, 

there would be the same discussion between the 

different physicians about what emergencies arise and 

in what circumstances and whether that creates a 

problem and whether you can get to the courts in time 

and so on. It would be the same underlying sort of 

evidence that we have here, right?

 MS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, it 

would, but it would be much more narrowly focused in 

terms of bringing it as an as-applied challenge, this 

was brought --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How would it be 

as-applied? Look at your reply brief at page 3. And 

you've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful 

that you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement 

action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced 

with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit.

 You've talking about this small category of 

cases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the 

lines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says, 

sooner or later, I'm going to have such a case. Right 

now, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to 

come to any court, so I'm going to bring this 

pre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied. But I 

don't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just 

says, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with 

an actual medical emergency to bring this suit. So what 

is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would 

be proper?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the 

lawsuit would be a pre-enforcement as-applied 

challenge and the physician would bring the claim and

would say, as applied to me, I perform abortions, I 

also perform abortions on minors. I need to perform 

an abortion in these emergency settings. The court 

can issue an order, presuming it's not satisfied with 

the protections that are set forth in New Hampshire 

law that I've described.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you do that as a 

class action?

 MS. AYOTTE: Depending on the 

circumstance, he may be able to.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the 

circumstance? All you said here is there coule be a 

pre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to 

wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't that this 

case? I don't understand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, exactly.

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, this is 

not this case because this case was brought as a 

facial challenge. Our entire act was struck down 

based upon that one potential --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You mean he has to bring the 

as-applied challenge when he has the patient in

his office? He has to wait until he has the patient 

in the office, is that what you mean?

 MS. AYOTTE: No, he doesn't. He can 

bring it before the patient is in his office and then 

the court could issue relief which would be much more 

consistent with the principles of certainly separation of 

powers and allowing the overwhelming number of our 

applications of our statutes that are valid to go 

forward.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about a 

lawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the 

entire statute is invalid. But that, when faced with 

an emergency of the sort that this discussion has 

addressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the 

abortion?

 MS. AYOTTE: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Quite a different lawsuit 

from this one.

 MS. AYOTTE: That's quite a different 

lawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from 

the State's perspective, would allow the overwhelming 

number of applications of this statute where there is 

no dispute that it works well, to go forward.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in Justice Scalia's

case, would not the reason for that relief have to be 

a finding that the statute is unconstitutional? You 

can't just grant the relief because you think it's a 

good idea.

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Stevens, it would 

be only in the context of that one particular 

application as applied to that physician, which would 

have stare decisis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be a 

finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which 

doesn't necessarily implicate the general 

notification provisions.

 MS. AYOTTE: Mr. Chief Justice, that 

would be the case. And certainly if that one 

application, in that one potential rare case was 

found not to be valid, then the remainder of the 

applications can go forward. And that is how most 

cases work with respect to as-applied relief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then I think what you're 

saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned 

with this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief 

to the physician, so what they did was write except that 

they should have said this statute is not 

enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health 

and it cannot be applied in any such cases. Where there

is a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice Ginsburg, the 

First Circuit went well beyond because it focused on 

a general health exception, they've now focusing it on an 

emergency exception. But certainly the relief should 

have been as-applied. If I may reserve the rest of 

my time for rebuttal?

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did you ask that the 

relief ordered below be more restrictive? Was that 

challenged after the judgment was entered?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Did the Court below 

have a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly, 

as you suggest today?

 MS. AYOTTE: Justice O'Connor, we did 

raise the application of the severance clause below, 

although the court, both at the district court level and 

the First Circuit appeared to look at the -- the lack 

of a general health exception as a per se 

constitutional problem that rendered the statute as a 

whole invalid.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I just am not clear to 

what extent you really raised the possibility with 

the court below of carrying its judgment more 

narrowly as you're suggesting today should be done.

 MS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, we certainly 

raised the severance issue in the district court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've used this word 

severance now twice. Severance is I excised a clause 

from the statute, but you're not asking for that. It's 

not severance. There is no provision to be severed 

here. It's putting a caret mark and adding something to 

it. Not taking out any provision, but putting in an 

additional provision.

 MS. AYOTTE: Your Honor, you're 

correct. What our position is is that they did not 

meet the standard that they should have been able to 

meet for a facial challenge, which would grant 

as-applied relief which would only be invalid in that 

one potential application. If I may reserve the rest 

of my time, with all due respect.

 JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 

General Clement, we'll hear now from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and 

may it please the Court:

 Respondents elected to bring a facial 

challenge to New Hampshire's statute and succeeded in 

their goal in enjoining the statute in all its

applications. Despite the facial nature of their 

challenge, however, they do not contend that the 

statute is invalid in all or even a large fraction of 

its applications.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that was true in 

Casey.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think it 

was, with respect, Justice Souter. This Court found 

as to the spousal notification critically, that there 

was a large fraction of the applications of the 

statute that would give rise to the constitutional 

problem.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we may argue about 

what the fraction may be and we may argue about what 

substantiality means. But one thing I don't think we 

can argue about is that Casey was applying the 

Salerno standard.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, two things, 

Justice Souter. I think, first of all, this case has 

come up postured as being about a choice between 

Salerno and the large fraction test. And I think in 

some points, based on the way respondents have 

approached the case, that's become largely beside the 

point.

 At footnote 13 of their brief, they could

not be more clear, that they are not here contending 

that the statute is invalid in a large fraction of 

their applications. They instead are embracing a per 

se rule that if the statute does not have a health 

exception or an emergency exception clear on its face, 

it is void in its entirety.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Once again, that may be, 

but after Casey, I don't think one can plausibly 

argue that the Salerno standard is the correct 

standard. Whatever their position may be, whatever 

fractions of substantiality may mean.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I understand 

that's your position, Justice Souter, given that you 

joined Justice O'Connor's separate separate writing in 

the Fargo case. I think, however, that I read the 

opinion in Casey and I see the large fraction 

analysis only in the spousal notification context.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But why would we have a 

separate rule on facial challenges merely for spousal 

notification?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I can think of 

two reasons, Justice Souter. First of all, 

because this Court applied the no set of 

circumstances test in Akron II to a parental 

notification statute, this Court in Casey may not

have wanted to overrule Akron II to that extent.

 Second of all, I think this Court, in that 

very passage about the large fraction test, 

specifically distinguished spousal notification 

provisions from parental notification provisions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I were to 

conclude that under Casey, this fraction test applies 

to this case. Suppose I were to say that Salerno 

should not be applicable in this case. How should I 

rule in this case?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You should clearly rule 

in the State's favor. And the respondents have 

really given you no choice because they aren't even 

arguing that a large fraction of the applications of 

the statute are invalid.

 What you have before you is really a case 

where it's literally a one in a thousand possibility 

that there is going to be an emergency where the statute 

will operate. And the real question for you is 

faced with that kind of case. Do you invalidate 1,000 

applications of this statute noting that 999 of 

them are constitutional?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the plaintiffs have 

filed a narrower action attacking the adequacy of the 

bypass procedure?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. And they 

also could have -- what I think I would envision 

them filling is an even narrower provision that 

seeks a pre-enforcement declaration, kind of like 

Steffel against Thompson would be the model, that say 

that this statute can apply in an emergency situation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's exactly --

I'm leaving aside your fraction test, your 100 

percent test, because I don't think they capture all 

the considerations that are relevant. Focus on what 

you just said. What you've done is you've tried to 

create an injunction that will separate out the sheep 

from the goats, all right? The goats are only 

1 percent and the sheep -- But what does it say? I 

don't think you can say enjoin the bypass procedure, 

because if you enjoin the bypass procedure, there goes 

down the drain your whole parental notification because 

you can't have parental notification without a bypass 

procedure.

 I don't think you can say enjoin 

emergencies because to do that, you're going to have 

to get into the greatest difficult issue there is in 

this area, which is what does that health exception 

mean. And we've said throughout that that health 

exception has to be defined first by a legislature.

 So if you tell me how to write that 

injunction, then I'll be able to decide whether it's 

possible for a court just to say, okay, we only 

enjoin the goats as opposed to saying, legislature, 

this is basically up to you, the whole area.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And Justice Breyer, I 

would say the court has some discretion in how it 

formulates that order. It would basically say that 

this statute is not constitutional as applied to 

those emergency situations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's --

And if I could just say, it's no 

different than Steffel against Thompson. There is a 

case where there is a challenge against a broad 

criminal trespass statute. The theory in Steffel 

was not that the whole criminal trespass statute was 

unconstitutional. It was it's unconstitutional if you 

apply it to leafletting. And Justice Brennan for a 

unanimous Court said, yes, that's exactly the kind of 

challenge you can bring. And you can get declaratory 

judgment that says you can't do that, you can't apply 

the statute as to leafletting. But you don't strike 

down the entirety of the criminal trespassing statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The word leafletting is 

not as fuzzy around the edges as health exception,

given the fact that lots of people think health 

exception is a way of getting abortion on demand.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree with Justice 

Breyer that the legislature can draw this with more 

precision than a court could?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that seems to be 

a solution, that the legislature can make it precise, 

although a court could not.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think the court could 

issue any order a legislature could issue. And I 

think the fact that the court would have some 

discretion is an answer to the argument that, oh, 

well, if you leave this to the courts, you're cutting 

the legislature out of this. I think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't it be an 

abuse of discretion in this case? Because there 

seems to be an ample record here that the 

legislature, or a majority of the legislature made a 

conscious choice that they would rather have no 

statute than a statute with a health exception in it. 

They deliberately said the only statute we want is 

one without a health exception.

 Therefore, even if you touch all the bases 

that Justice Breyer has laid out, don't you end up

with a position that if we were to craft such a 

limitation, we would be flying quite precisely in the 

face of the expressed legislative intent.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think that's 

right, Justice Souter and I think it's because you 

have to be careful. I think it's easy to use loose 

language about a health exception. And I think if 

you looked at the First Circuit opinion, they seem to 

suggest there needs to be a health exception. And I 

think in the context of a parental notification 

statute, a health exception as opposed to a narrow 

exception for emergencies is a non --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever you call it, 

call it a health exception, call it an XYZ exception. 

They knew what they were getting at, they knew what 

they were worried about and they said, we will have a 

statute without it or we will have no statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter, 

I think they were --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there was a separate 

severability. Didn't it have a severability provision?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: They did and it's extreme 

severability.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so it said just the 

opposite. It said just the opposite, that if the

health exception is no good, the rest of the statute 

would survive. Isn't that basically --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right Justice 

Souter -- Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know how you 

would sever a health exception that is not there. 

They're saying if something is in here, you can sever 

it and we'll be satisfied with what's left. In 

effect, if we were to enjoin certain applications, we 

would be injecting an exception that they've 

rejected. And whatever that may be, it does not seem 

to be severance.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Two answers, Justice 

Souter. First of all, I think that if you look at what 

the New Hampshire legislators were concerned about, 

they were concerned about a broad health exception 

that would undermine the statute, not an emergency 

exception.

 As to the severability point, I think in 

some respects, severability is the wrong way of 

looking at it. In the context of as-applied 

challenges, this Court has not rigorously said that 

you look at the applications and see whether they're 

severable. The idea is that a statute is not 

constitutional in certain applications.

 But the New Hampshire legislature I think 

was -- even had the belt and suspenders to worry about 

that if you had a different view of that, it's the view 

that actually Justice Thomas embraced in his Booker 

opinion, that actually you do look at severance when you 

do applications. The New Hampshire legislature 

couldn't have been clearer, because they said not 

only do you sever the provisions, but sever the 

applications. We want to save as much of this statue 

as we can.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The end of the statute 

doesn't say that. The end of that provision says 

sever a provision.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You're right, Justice 

Ginsburg, but I don't think you look only at the end 

of the statute. It clearly says, if any provision of 

this subdivision or the application thereof to any 

person or circumstance is held invalid, such 

invalidity shall not affect the provision or 

applications of this subdivision which can be given 

effect without invalide - sorry -- provisions or 

applications.

 It seems like they had this case in mind, 

that there were circumstances in which perhaps some 

court would say it was unconstitutional to apply it

and that's not a basis to strike down the whole 

statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, there 

is usually great caution on the part of the Court 

from tampering with the statute. So excision is one 

thing. You just drop a provision. That's not possible 

here. The Court has been extremely reluctant about caret 

marks, which is what -- there is no problem with what the 

legislature did. It just didn't do enough. So the court 

would have to add a provision. Not subtract. There is 

nothing to subtract. There's an addition and courts have 

been reluctant to do that. They feel much more 

comfortable cutting something out than putting 

something in.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, I don't think that accurately describes the 

way the courts have approached as-applied cases. 

They often hold statutes unconstitutional as applied. 

Think of Wisconsin against Yoder. This Court said that 

a general compulsory education statute didn't apply 

to the Amish. It's just unconstitutional as applied. 

They didn't think, boy, you know, the Wisconsin 

legislature didn't expressly put in an exception --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody asked them to do 

anything other than that.

the statute doesn't apply. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

General. Ms. Dalven, we'll hear now from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER DALVEN

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MS. DALVEN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The unfortunate reality is that some 

pregnant teens experience medical emergencies for 

which the appropriate care is an immediate abortion. 

As the nation's leading medical authorities have 

explained, delaying appropriate care for even a very 

short period can be catastrophic and puts the teen at 

risk for liver damage, kidney damage, stroke and 

infertility.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose I am concerned 

that the record doesn't explain to me one way or the 

other whether or not your and the medical 

profession's definition of immediate allows time to 

make one telephone call to a judge.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, several

responses. First, the undisputed evidence here is 

that women in some emergencies, every minute is 

critical. Every minute puts them at risk of losing 

their future fertility and of major organ damage. 

That is confirmed by the nation's leading medical 

authorities which say that there is - that even very 

short delays --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be 

nurses or attendants that can get the judge on the 

line.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. Two 

responses. First, the procedures that we submitted 

in our supplemental brief that were approved by the 

New Hampshire Supreme Court made quite clear that 

there is no procedure for getting the judge on the 

phone. And in addition, any delay --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I've looked at 

those procedures and it seems to me that those are 

interpreted as what should happen in the ordinary 

case. They certainly don't preclude making a phone 

call and there can be phone calls for warrants in 

criminal cases in New Hampshire. That's specifically 

provided.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, but I 

believe that as Justice Breyer pointed out, if this

emergency happens on a Saturday, there is no 

provision whatsoever for the minor. In addition --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The problem was, it 

seems to me, that the bypass procedure can go a long 

way toward saving this statute, but this was not 

litigated in the trial courts. We don't know what 

New Hampshire's position is going to be. We don't 

know what the facts are.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I think what is 

quite clear from all the briefs is that once a minor 

arrives in the emergency room, it is too late for her 

to go to court. There is, as we said, every minute 

is critical and any delay from the time that the 

doctor faces a pregnant teen, determines that she 

must have an immediate abortion, any delay from that 

point forward puts the minor's health at risk.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, Surely not the delay 

for a quick phone call. Let's assume New Hampshire sets 

up a special office open 24 hours a day and this is 

the abortion judge, and he can be reached any time 

anywhere. It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is really an emergency 

situation? I guess if that's the case, the doctor better 

not put on his gloves.

 MS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor, I think then that 

the question would be what would be the purpose in 

such a statute if all you had to do was literally 

call a number and the judge would say, okay. If the 

judge had no time -- the nurse had no time to 

relay the facts, the judge had no time to ask any 

questions, the judge had no time to consider the 

evidence or look at the law, there is a real question 

about what potential purpose there could be of 

requiring even that small delay before a minor gets 

the immediate treatment she needs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The purpose is to save 

the statute which has thousands of applications that 

are valid.

 MS. DALVEN: But Your Honor, I don't think 

that putting a teen's health at risk, respectfully, 

is -- I don't think saving a statute is worth putting 

a teen's health at risk.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if your 

objection goes to the adequacy of the bypass 

procedure, what is wrong with a pre-enforcement 

challenge by physicians, presumably with standing, 

challenging the bypass procedure? Why should you be 

able to challenge the act as a whole if your 

objection is so narrowly focused?

 MS. DALVEN: Two points, Chief Justice 

Roberts. First is that our objection isn't to the 

bypass process. We believe that there would be --

regardless of how good the procedures the New 

Hampshire Supreme Court set up, there would still be 

inherent delay between the time a doctor diagnoses 

a patient and the time they get to court and get 

the order. So it's not a problem with the judicial 

bypass.

 The second question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a problem 

that arises only in the emergency situations.

 MS. DALVEN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So bring in a 

pre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with 

the act in emergency situations. Why does that even 

implicate the vast majority of the cases that don't 

create emergency situations?

 MS. DALVEN: As Justice Ginsburg pointed 

out, we believe that is this case. There is nothing 

between this case -- different between this 

case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This case doesn't 

involve an emergency situation. This is a facial 

challenge. There is no case at issue at all.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, the State

would be proper.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but what resulted 

here, it was the invalidation of the entire statute and 

all of its applications? Is that how it now stands?

 MS. DALVEN: That believe is how --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, so the question 

you're being asked is, how can that be narrowed in some 

fashion to focus on the problem? The statute may 

well have a majority of valid applications. So how 

can we narrow the application? And what of our 

doctrines allow a narrower application? So you need 

to focus on that. Obviously, it's a matter of 

concern.

 MS. DALVEN: Sure. I think this 

Court in Casey addressed that consideration. And 

Casey was essentially this case, a pre-enforcement 

challenge brought to the adequacy of the medical 

emergency exception. And this Court held that if the 

law prohibited an immediate abortion for some of the 

very same conditions we outline here, it would have 

been unconstitutional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's because the

Court explained the inadequacies it identified were 

present in the large fraction of cases. We don't know 

if that's true here.

 MS. DALVEN: Respectfully, Your Honor, not 

with respect to the medical emergency exception. I 

think that was true with respect to the spousal 

notice provision, but not at all with respect to the 

medical emergency exception.

 In this case, it was -- we're talking about 

the same conditions that were in Casey and here as well. 

And actually here there were additional considerations 

because in Casey, there was a medical emergency 

definition that extended to some health threatening 

circumstances and here there is none.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't it be 

entirely adequate to protect what you're concerned 

about to say this New Hampshire statute is 

unconstitutional to the extent that it fails to 

provide an exception for situations where there is 

imminent danger to health, and then all those 

immediate dangers to health situations would be left 

unregulated. The statute doesn't reach them.

 But nonemergency cases would continue to 

be governed by the statute. Why couldn't -- in other 

words, why wasn't that the appropriate judgment for

the First Circuit to have entered in this case, to 

say statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for 

emergency cases, there is effectively no law?

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, that would solve 

the constitutional problem in this case, but I 

believe it is not the best course for three reasons. 

First, as this Court has already discussed, the States 

around the country have adopted at least 10 different 

medical emergency definitions. And this Court has no 

way to know which if any of those formulations --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you wouldn't 

have -- it would be that the emergency is not 

regulated. The private doctors can act in a medical 

emergency. They are not controlled by any 

legislation.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. But many of 

the States -- a few States have chosen to have 

special exceptions that just say medical emergency. 

Most of them define --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we're dealing with 

New Hampshire. We have a specific case that 

challenged New Hampshire's law. So can you focus on 

this one?

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor. I think we 

still don't know which definition New Hampshire

would use.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose it were from 

your point of view. 

I don't know from the other side's point of view, I 

guess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can 

not be enforced in any circumstance in which a 

physician certifies in good faith that he believes an 

immediate abortion is necessary for the health of the 

mother. All you're looking to is the state of mind 

of the physician.

 Now, the problem that I think we would see 

with that is you would then be writing into the law 

the broadest possible definition of what that health 

exception means. So I'm not sure the New 

Hampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and 

I'm not sure the other side would like to do it. But 

looking at it from your point of view, do you have 

any objection to it?

 MS. DALVEN: No, that's correct, Your Honor. 

That would solve the constitutional problem here, but 

Your Honor is right, I think there is a significant 

concern about whether that's what New Hampshire would 

have done --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

would be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied

challenge. I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that 

this narrower focused proceeding is going to be --

could be brought doesn't mean -- doesn't answer the 

question of how it's going to come out.

 But presumably the litigation would be 

very similar to what we've seen in this case, in 

which a doctor is saying, well, you do need an 

immediate medical exception. Others are saying the 

judicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns. 

But it would be focused on the provision that is 

causing you concern rather than the statute as a 

whole.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe that 

that really is this case. There is nothing in the 

complaint that says this is a facial challenge, and 

we only want a declaration that the statute is 

unconstitutional and enjoin it in its entirety, and 

if we can't have that, we want nothing else. We expect 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what happened 

and you're here defending that judgment.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, Your Honor, and we believe 

it was the proper course, but there is nothing in the 

complaint that says that we only want a total 

invalidation.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Then is there any 

objection by you to remanding this thing to let it be 

more narrowly focused?

 MS. DALVEN: I believe it is not the 

better course for three reasons. One is we can't 

tell what exception the New Hampshire legislature 

would have chosen. In addition, I think there is 

real cause for concern about rewriting this law for 

New Hampshire. If this Court says that that's the 

proper course, I believe that the federal judiciary 

will be faced with rewriting abortion law after 

abortion law after abortion law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your complaint 

asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction 

against the act.

 MS. DALVEN: Yes, that's right, Your 

Honor. Also two points, though. We asked for any 

other relief that is just and proper and we had other 

claims that could not be solved by a more narrow --

by more narrow relief, we claimed that the act's 

judicial bypass doesn't -- isn't sufficient under 

this Court's case -- this Court's decision in Bellotti 

II, it doesn't provide for confidentiality and then 

there is no way to remedy that without facial 

invalidation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to agree 

to this unless you've focused on it and think it 

really is your position. I take it, as I'm 

listening, that you would not object to an injunction 

that says that this statute cannot be applied in any 

circumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself 

or herself, believes that there is a health 

emergency, period.

 Now, I take it as soon as we get more 

narrow than that, you might object on the ground 

that that will leave ambiguous cases where there 

really is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't 

know what to do and would have to go to court, by 

which time it will be too late.

 MS. DALVEN: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Have I stated it 

correctly? You've focused on it, thought about it, 

stated it?

 MS. DALVEN: I appreciate that and yes, 

Your Honor, I have.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Thank you.

and with substantial support in sound medicine.

doctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what 

he's doing, why should he be protected?

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, I believe your 

question focuses on exactly why this Court should 

facially invalidate. It requires this Court to 

decide additional constitutional questions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's just one more 

condition, good faith is not enough. You can have a 

good faith quack.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, we believe that 

would be unconstitutional, and because it would 

subject a doctor to going to jail for providing care 

that he honestly believed was necessary to save a 

patient's organs, to save a patient's future 

fertility, to save a patient's vision. We believe 

particularly in an area as controversial as abortion, 

that that is inappropriate. But again, after --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure that's the case 

with regard to other medical procedures, if you're 

grossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, I'm sure, 

in most States.

 MS. DALVEN: I believe it's generally a 

medical malpractice and not a ciminal liability. But 

in any event, this is a question for the Court. And 

in National Treasury Employees Union, this Court said

that we're writing more narrow relief requires the 

Court to answer additional constitutional questions 

not directly presented by the case, the appropriate 

course is to facially invalidate and let the 

legislature decide how to write the exception. We 

believe that's the appropriate course here as well.

 In addition, going back to the legislative 

abdication point, we believe that facially 

invalidating -- rewriting the law here would 

eliminate any incentive for legislatures to pass 

constitutional laws in the first instance.

 This was a clear requirement. This Court 

has said for 30 years you cannot endanger women's 

health, you must have an exception for health 

threatening emergencies. New Hampshire did not 

include such an exception. And if this Court 

rewrites it, it will in essence give a green 

light to legislatures around the country to pass 

broad restrictions and leave it women and their 

doctors to go to the courts and be the full 

defenders of the right --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the model of this 

case, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have 

an actual patient class action and the court says the 

statute cannot be applied to a medical necessity,

period. No fancy frills of adding another things which 

courts generally don't do. But then there would be no 

regulation of medical emergencies. Why isn't that what 

-- doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've 

brought and couldn't the First Circuit have done that 

and then you would have no complaint about the rest of 

the statute?

 MS. DALVEN: The First Circuit could have 

done that. We did have additional claims like 

confidentiality.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I know that.

 MS. DALVEN: But the First Circuit could 

have done it. We believe the First Circuit was 

correct in not doing that for the two reasons I 

discussed and an additional reason as well.

 As Justice Souter pointed out, we don't 

know at all that the legislature would have passed 

this law with a broader exception. Indeed, 153 New 

Hampshire legislators have told this Court that there 

is significant doubt about whether they would. And I 

know that might be surprising to some people, but I 

would like to explain why, in the world of abortion 

politics, it's not at all surprising.

 Some folks with good faith believe that any 

exception beyond one for a life-saving emergency

renders a ban -- a abortion restriction meaningless. 

And they refuse on principle to vote for any broader 

exception, any ban, any restriction that has a 

broader exception.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then they shouldn't have 

voted for the severability provision which clearly 

says if, in one of its applications, it's invalid, 

the rest can be given effect without the invalid 

provisions. I mean, the severability provision 

really just flatly contradicts your assertion that 

the New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to 

happen.

 MS. DALVEN: Your Honor, a few things. 

First, we don't believe that the severability clause 

directs the court to sever applications. Second, 

neither this Court nor New Hampshire courts treat 

severability clauses as mandates. The question is 

still whether, if there is significant doubt about 

whether the legislature would have wanted it, they do 

not sever, and as particularly whereas here, this 

Court would have to make decisions for the legislature 

about what that exception should look like.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this 

historical information? Since the decision of the 

district court and the decision of the court of

appeals, has the legislature considered enacting a 

different statute that would solve the problems?

 MS. DALVEN: They have not, Your Honor. 

There has been no bill put forward, to my knowledge.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be that it 

wouldn't have been all that hard to do. I don't know.

 MS. DALVEN: That's right, Your Honor. 

They could have enacted a law with a medical 

emergency exception and we could have all gone home.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe they 

assumed that the medical health exception of the sort 

you're arguing for is not constitutionally required 

and that's what would be litigated in a narrow 

focused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a 

bypass procedure. Maybe they assumed it would follow 

the Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry 

about severing in light of particular 

unconstitutional applications.

 MS. DALVEN: Perhaps that is true, Your 

Honor, but I still believe that that is this case, 

that there really is no different -- I mean, in 

Casey, the plaintiffs brought a facial challenge 

before the law took effect to the adequate --

challenging the adequacy of a medical emergency 

exception.

 And this Court indicated that if the law 

prohibited an immediate abortion for women with the 

conditions Dr. Goldner described in his declaration 

here, it would have been unconstitutional and some 

relief would have been appropriate, even though that 

was a facial challenge and even though the alleged 

inadequacies of the medical emergency would harm 

relatively few women. So I don't think that there is 

any bar to this Court if they --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the 

statute, putting aside the medical emergency issue 

under our precedence, is the parental notification 

aspect of the statute constitutional?

 MS. DALVEN: No, Your Honor. We had 

additional claims --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Other than the 

confidentiality?

 MS. DALVEN: We believe we had three 

claims, the health exception, the medical emergency 

exception for health threatening emergencies. The 

death exception we believe is also inadequate and the 

confidentiality. In addition, the procedures that the 

court issued -- the New Hampshire Supreme Court 

approved raise an additional problem as well. So 

there are claims in addition to the health threatening
