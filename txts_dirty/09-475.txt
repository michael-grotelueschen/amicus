(10:09 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument this morning in Case 09-475, Monsanto 

Company v. Geertson Seed Farms, et al. 

Mr. Garre. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Biotech crops have produced enormous 

benefits for the nation's farmers and consumers. The 

district court in this case issued a broad-based 

injunction against the planting of a highly beneficial, 

genetically engineered alfalfa crop. In entering and 

sustaining that injunction, the courts below erred in 

two fundamental respects. 

First, they short-circuited the requisite 

inquiry into the likelihood of reparable -- irreparable 

harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to 

get into this anyway in the course of preparing its 

environmental impact statement. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Garre, the Respondents 

argue that we should dismiss the writ here as 

improvidently granted, and I wonder if you could explain

why that isn't the preferred course of conduct. They 

contend that when this was before the Ninth Circuit, 

your firm could have but did not contest the -- the 

vacatur of the APHIS deregulation order. It’s argued 

that an environmental impact statement is likely to be 

issued very soon, or fairly soon. Maybe the Solicitor 

General could give us an estimate. 

If we agree with your argument that the 

Ninth Circuit applied the wrong preliminary injunction 

standard and remand for them to apply the right 

preliminary injunction standard, the case may be moot by 

the time they do that. And the alternative is for us to 

plow into the extremely fact-bound question whether 

applying what you contend to be the correct preliminary 

injunction standard of relief would be warranted on this 

record. 

In light of all that, why shouldn't we take 

their suggestion? 

MR. GARRE: The Court shouldn't, Justice 

Alito. First as to the vacatur, we appealed the 

judgment that contains the vacatur and the injunction. 

And our notice of appeal, which is on page 59 and 61 of 

the excerpts of record in the Ninth Circuit, makes clear 

that we explicitly appealed the vacatur as well. 

And let me explain that a little bit more,

but first I want to say as to the environmental impact 

statement, the government can address that more, but my 

understanding is that we’re probably about a year away 

from the environmental impact statement. This case 

presents important legal issues concerning the entry of 

injunctive relief. 

We think the Court properly granted 

certiorari and should decide those issues. We think 

that, although the record is large, that this Court can 

decide, as it did in Winter, that as a matter of law 

this record does not support a finding of irreparable 

harm. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Winter didn't involve 

something -- as I understand, the -- the decision 

vacated the deregulation order. You are not challenging 

that. Well, it seems to me if there’s no deregulation 

decision in place, then we’re back to the Plant 

Protection Act, and there’s no authorization for the 

planting of these crops. So as long as you haven't 

challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I 

don't see how there's anything for us to deal with. 

MR. GARRE: We did appeal the vacatur as 

well as the injunction which is contained as part of the 

same judgment. We know that the district --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: However, you haven't in

your brief. Didn't you say you weren't challenging the 

vacating order? You keep saying -- I know you appealed 

it originally, but the point is that you didn't seek 

certiorari on that ground. 

MR. GARRE: Well, we -- our argument all 

along, Justice Sotomayor has been that the court, the 

district court, erred in not adopting the government's 

proposed judgment. If you look on page 184 of the 

petition appendix, that proposed judgment makes clear 

that it’s intended to replace the district court's 

judgment, including the vacatur. So all along the whole 

argument about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that those 

are two different things, then, right? The vacatur is 

one thing and the injunction is another, right? 

MR. GARRE: They are part and parcel of the 

same judgment. It's true, a vacatur is different than 

an injunction. But here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under the 

vacatur, the normal APA remedy is a remand to the agency. 

In fact, there are some courts that say you can't get 

anything else. But whether you can or can't, it's clear 

that the burden is on you to get something short of 

complete remand. The burden is on your friends to 

get -- establish the injunction.

The problem with combining the two, it seems 

to me, is that you are imposing on them the burden to 

meet the injunction standard simply to get a remand to 

which they are entitled under the APA. 

MR. GARRE: Well, the district court could 

have vacated the order in its entirety and send it back 

to the agency. It didn't do that. It not only went 

ahead and enjoined the planting of RRA, Roundup Ready 

alfalfa, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the vacatur does 

that. You can't plant once the deregulation order is 

vacated. 

MR. GARRE: The vacatur was in part. We 

know that because the district court's judgment allowed 

the continued planting and harvesting of Roundup Ready 

alfalfa, the planting before 2007. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would say 

that the injunction is limited only to a decision the 

agency might make to allow partial planting? 

MR. GARRE: Well -- and importantly, the district 

court's judgment -- and it's on page 108 of the petition 

appendix --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. GARRE: -- not only enjoined the planting 

of Roundup Ready alfalfa, it enjoined the agency from taking

interim measures. It --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. GARRE: We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Why 

did it do that? I mean, the way the APA works, this is 

sent back to the agency. If the agency wants to 

partially deregulate, it can do it. And then you can 

challenge it under the normal APA procedures. 

MR. GARRE: And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very odd to get 

an injunction to an agency telling them they can't do 

something under the APA. 

MR. GARRE: Well, I'm not going to disagree 

with you on that. It is important that they enjoined 

the agency from implementing the very proposed measures 

that we’re now finding -- fighting --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I’m looking at --

MR. GARRE: -- in the context of an 

injunction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at page 58a. 

Maybe that -- you referred to what as the district 

court's --

MR. GARRE: 108a. It's 108a of the petition 

appendix.

the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to 

spare the people who had already purchased seeds, 

allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007. 

MR. GARRE: Planting was allowed until 

March 30, 2007, and then that alfalfa could be continued 

to be harvested; seeds would be harvested and maintained 

separately. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is it your position that 

that gives you the hook, the entry point, for saying, 

well, now the district judge didn't just replicate in 

all respects the universe without the regulation; it had 

some specific injunctive relief, and it didn't go far 

enough? That’s --

MR. GARRE: Absolutely. That in combination 

with the fact that it actually enjoined the agency from 

what it could have done, otherwise done, under --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But whose --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority do 

you have for the proposition that when a court vacates 

an administrative order, it has the authority to tailor 

an injunction rather than simply remand the matter to 

the agency? 

MR. GARRE: Well, I think this Court's 

decision in Weinberger involved at least an analogous 

situation, where the court found a statutory violation

of the Clean Water Act. It doesn't involve the vacatur 

of a decision, but the court then went on to add an 

injunction on top of that. So you had the statutory 

violation that arguably prohibited the conduct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess --

Weinberger, of course, involved a statute. I mean, the 

concern is that the authority to determine how far to go 

in deregulating or partial deregulating is for the 

agency to make. And once there has been a violation of 

the APA, it goes back to the agency. What the district 

court did here was assume that responsibility itself. 

MR. GARRE: And we at the outset at the 

district court stage, if the -- if the district court had 

done that, that would have been fine. It could have gone 

back. The agency could have adopted the very proposed 

measures that we’re now talking about in the context of 

an injunction. The district court did not do that. It 

entered the injunction not only as to the sale of RRA, 

but as to the agency taking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then --

MR. GARRE: -- those interim steps. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, I'm looking at 

the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision 

is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a 

regulated article. We could simply say as far as it goes,

that's all right; anything else is surplusage. We take it 

to be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again 

a regulated article, period. 

MR. GARRE: And we know the district court 

didn't mean that literally, because its own judgment 

allows the continued planting and harvesting of RRA 

planted before --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but I thought --

MR. GARRE: -- March 2007. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was just a 

dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds. 

That was recognizing that they had incurred an expense, 

that they were all ready to plant. That -- that was the 

only exception. It goes back to the status of a regulated 

article with this one exception. 

MR. GARRE: Well, if it's a regulated 

article, then there's no use of it allowed at all unless 

the agency is granting exceptions. So the district 

court's grant of that exception was an exercise of 

its equitable authority in the context of considering 

Respondents' injunction. 

Respondents have litigated this all along as 

though the injunction provided something in addition to 

the vacatur, and this Court's cases establish that the 

injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy that

does. It allows people to go into court to enforce it. 

It provides an opportunity for contempt sanctions. 

If I could just -- if I could address the 

issue of irreparable harm, there are two key things the 

Court -- we hope the Court will understand in 

adjudicating the question of irreparable harm. 

First is you need to separate out hay 

production and seed production. There’s absolutely no 

evidence in this record whatsoever of any 

cross-pollination from RRA hay fields to another hay 

field. So the district court's injunction applies 

broad-based to hay production and seed production. But 

at a minimum, we think you have to take seed production 

out. 

The next thing is that, when it comes to the 

risk of harm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Hay production out. 

MR. GARRE: When alfalfa is grown for hay, for 

forage, as opposed to grown for seeds which can then be 

planted. 

The next thing to know is what we're talking 

about here is the risk that -- and Roundup Ready alfalfa 

will appear in a conventional or organic alfalfa field. 

We're not talking about transforming a single alfalfa 

plant in the country. It's the risk that an existing

alfalfa plant will produce a seed, which will then 

produce another alfalfa plant which would be a Roundup 

Ready alfalfa plant. So not a single alfalfa plant 

in this country is going to be harmed by the addition of 

Roundup Ready alfalfa. 

The district court found, on page 43 of the 

petition appendix, that Roundup Ready alfalfa provides no 

harm the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what's 

the legal error? You started by identifying the first 

one, which was short-circuiting the irreparable harm. 

This seems more like factual correction which you're 

getting into. Put it into a legal box for me. What are 

your legal claims? 

MR. GARRE: Sure. There’s three legal 

arguments we have, Justice Sotomayor. The first is the 

district court short-circuited the whole analysis by 

assuming up front that, since this was going to go to 

environmental impact statement, it didn't have to 

seriously get into the likelihood of irreparable harm. 

And we think that that’s clear error under this Court's 

Amoco decision. And, in fact, if you look at --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain, 

Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the 

Federal law is before the agency engages in an action

that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS? So this 

unit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal 

law by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS. 

MR. GARRE: Federal law and the regulation 

at 40 C.F.R. 1506.1(a) allows action to go forward where 

there’s not an adverse environmental impact. The 

agency has explained in great detail in declarations 

that allowing the very limited use of RRA under the 

restricted conditions of the proposed injunctions would 

not result in any environmental impact. 

If I could reserve the remainder of my time 

for rebuttal. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Garre. 

Mr. Stewart. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, 

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS, 

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I’d like first to address briefly 

Justice Alito's question about the length of time that 

the agency anticipates the EIS will take. The agency 

now anticipates that its best estimate is that the EIS 

will be ready approximately a year from now. A draft

EIS has been submitted for public comment. The public 

comment period was extended until early March of 2010. 

The agency has received on the order of 145,000 public 

comments. 

And, so, in addition to parsing through 

those and seeing which of them need to be responded to, 

the agency wants to consult with other Federal agencies. 

And, so this process is going to take longer than APHIS 

had anticipated at the outset. 

Now, we said in our brief in opposition that 

the fact that the EIS process was ongoing was a reason 

for this Court to deny certiorari. I think regardless 

of how good an argument that was at the cert stage, the 

Court has granted cert, and we think that the Court 

should decide the case. There’s no realistic prospect 

that the case will become moot before this Court's 

decision is rendered. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go to the 

second part of Justice Alito's question, which was the 

issue of standing, both yours and the Petitioners’. 

What is it exactly that we’re being asked to review? 

Obviously, you’re going ahead with the EIS. You 

haven't sought a stay of that. 

MR. STEWART: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what's the

basis of the challenge to the injunction? 

MR. STEWART: When the district court issued 

its summary judgment ruling, it asked the parties to 

propose their own forms of a judgment. And APHIS might 

have done what the Chief Justice suggested ought to have 

been done; that is, it might have indicated that the 

court -- that either it should simply issue a 

declaratory judgment or that it should vacate the 

deregulation order, and the matter would have been 

remanded to the agency to decide what to do next. 

And if that had happened, the agency could 

then have issued an administrative order that embodied 

the same proposed conditions that were embodied in the 

injunction. Presumably, the plaintiffs would have 

challenged that, and we would have had a new lawsuit. 

Now, what APHIS tried to do, in essence, was 

to streamline the process by combining into one steps 

that could otherwise have been taken separately. And it 

proposed an injunction that said the deregulation 

decision is vacated and replaced by the following 

protective conditions. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have the burden 

to establish your entitlement to those conditions that 

are short of a remand, correct? 

MR. STEWART: I don't think it would have

been our burden; that is, if the -- if the order had 

simply been -- the deregulation order had simply been 

vacated and remanded to the agency, and the agency had 

then performed the analysis that’s reflected in the 

Hoffman declarations and said we are putting in place a 

complete deregulation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, sure. 

Agencies can do that. 

MR. STEWART: Agencies can do that. And it --

on review of that, it would not have been our burden to 

establish that those --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, because 

-- but here the question is whether the court can do 

that. The court is stepping into the shoes of the 

agency. And I would say it's -- I mean, there's 

authority that you can't do that at all, but certainly 

you’d have the burden to establish that those 

reliefs short of remand, that you are entitled to that. 

MR. STEWART: I think in the ordinary 

course, you’re absolutely correct. And in the usual 

case, it's an important principle to us that the court 

should not usurp the agency's role. 

Here I think, in fairness to the district 

court, if the court had issued the injunction we 

proposed with the protective measures that were

reflected in the government's proposed judgment, the 

court would not have been usurping the agency's role, 

because it would have been adopting the very protective 

measures that the agency identified as appropriate. So 

we think that the district --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you’re 

short-circuiting notice and comment or whatever else is 

required, the reason we send this to an agency, because 

they are expert and all that. The agency is acting 

without the benefit of any input on the partial 

deregulation. 

MR. STEWART: Well, it is certainly acting 

with the benefit of whatever information it received in 

the form of public comment in its original environmental 

assessment for the complete deregulation. And in 

addition, the district court, in deciding whether the 

agency's proposed conditions would have been appropriate 

could have entertained comments from obviously the 

Respondents and from anyone else who wanted to 

intervene. 

But to go back to Justice Sotomayor's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you have -- let's 

just -- if this had -- if the order had vacated the 

deregulation and sent it back to you, what would you 

have -- the agency have had to do to issue temporary

regulations consistent with the ones you proposed to the 

district court? 

MR. STEWART: Our view is that, first, that 

we would not have had to go through public notice and 

comment, because, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(2), there is an 

exception for good cause, and here the relatively 

limited timeframe that we were talking about in our view 

would have constituted good cause. Obviously, the 

plaintiffs might have challenged that. 

Now, we would have had to perform some sort 

of environmental analysis to comply with our NEPA 

obligations in order to feel sufficient confident --

confidence that implementation of our proposed measures 

would not cause significant environmental impacts. It 

wouldn't have had to be an EIS; that is, NEPA provides, 

in appropriate circumstances --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can -- when you -- can 

you stop right there, because I thought the law was, 

government agency, before you engage on a major 

activity, EIS first, and then you can have a 

deregulation order? 

MR. STEWART: I think that's -- it is 

correct to say that, as a matter of the statute and the 

regulations, an agency cannot decide to prepare an EIS on 

a particular act, decision, and then implement that very

decision during the pendency of the EIS. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's what I 

thought. 

MR. STEWART: But our -- our core point here 

is that what we were proposing for the interim, that is 

allowing continued planting subject to various 

protective measures, was fundamentally different from 

the action on which the EIS was being prepared. That 

is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as far as the court 

is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an 

EIS was required. And then the district court vacates 

the deregulation decision. I thought that, under the APA, 

at that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the 

agency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with 

law, and so we send it back. 

MR. STEWART: You are correct. And we are 

not asserting the right to implement the deregulation 

decision; that is, the decision removing all Federal 

constraints from the planting and harvesting of RRA. 

We’re not asserting the right to do that during the 

pendency of the EIS process. 

The CEQ regulations speak to this question, 

and they don't say while an EIS is ongoing, no activity 

related to the action for which the EIS is being

prepared may go forward. They say in the interim the 

agency can't do things that will have an adverse 

environmental impact or will foreclose reasonable 

alternatives. 

So, what the agency might have done at the 

outset was say: We need to do an EIS before implementing 

a complete deregulation decision. The effects of doing 

that are at least potentially sufficiently great that an 

EIS is being prepared. However, we feel confident that 

interim planting during this limited period, subject to 

these proposed protective measures, will not have 

adverse environmental impact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you 

agree that when you’re talking about the elements of 

the injunction that are short of remand to the agency, 

that the Respondents do not have the obligation to meet 

the injunction standards with respect to those? In 

other words, it's part of the judgment. It's not an 

injunction, and you have the burden if you want the 

court to do anything other than send it back. 

MR. STEWART: I hope I didn't misunderstand 

the question. If you’re referring to the types of 

activities that would have been prohibited even under 

our proposed injunction; that --

the -- about the types of activities that would be 

prohibited if the court just remanded it back, vacated 

it, which is everything -- you can't plant. 

MR. STEWART: No, I think in order for 

the -- the plaintiffs to get an injunction against 

those, they would have had to meet --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my point is 

they don't need an injunction. The thing that’s 

bothering me is you’ve got two different things, the 

vacatur and the injunction. And it seems to me by melding 

them together, you’re trying to impose the burden on 

the plaintiffs to meet the injunction standard to get 

the benefit of the vacatur. 

MR. STEWART: Well, I think if this had 

happened through the alternative events -- course of 

events that I discussed previously; that is, if the 

matter had been remanded back to the agency and the 

agency had issued an administrative order that embodied 

these proposed protective conditions, then the 

plaintiffs would presumably have either filed a new 

lawsuit or challenged this within the confines of this 

suit. The burden would have been on them to show both 

that those protective measures were --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you short-circuited 

that. Isn't this more akin to you seeking a stay of the

vacating order? 

MR. STEWART: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The district court 

vacated the deregulation. No one can plant. You and 

the Petitioners go into court and say to the court: 

Stay that deregulation with respect to this kind of 

planting. Aren't you the one seeking the stay? And if 

so, isn't it your burden to show that you're entitled to 

whatever it is you seek? 

MR. STEWART: Well, all that the court had 

decided up to the point when we submitted our proposed 

judgment was that an EIS was needed before the agency 

could implement complete deregulation. And I think in 

this respect the case is similar to Winter; that is, in 

Winter in the district court -- the district court 

initially imposed six restrictive measures on the Navy, 

and the Navy elected not to challenge four of them but 

challenged the other two. I suppose that the Navy could 

have asked for, in a sense, vacatur of its proposed 

action and then announced a new action that consisted of 

compliance with the four unchallenged restrictive 

measures and noncompliance with the other two. 

From our perspective, rather than 

short-circuiting the process, as I say, we were trying 

to streamline it; that is, the court could have sent it

back to us, we could have told it what protective 

measures were appropriate, and then some months later we 

would have been back in court to review the adequacy of 

those, particularly because we thought of the -- any 

injunction as being something that would stay in effect 

only for the relatively limited period of time while the 

EIS was being prepared. 

We tried to speed up the process by telling 

the court in advance these are the protective measures 

we think are appropriate without the need for a remand. 

And the court's fundamental error was in equating what 

we had proposed with the complete deregulation that was 

the subject of the lawsuit. I think that the -- the 

agency's declarations explained why the protective 

measures that were embodied in the government's proposed 

injunction would have been fully sufficient to prevent 

irreparable harm to the plaintiffs during the pendency 

of the EIS. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's the legal 

error you identify? 

MR. STEWART: That's the legal error we 

identify. We also think that the district court did, 

without quite using these words, announce a presumption 

in favor of injunctive relief; that is, the district 

court said, wrongly in our view, that it couldn't assess

the adequacy of the proposed protective measures because 

that would duplicate the analysis that was going on in 

the EIS. We think that was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree -- would 

you agree that if the district court had just said the 

deregulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready 

alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that 

would be okay? And you would have no basis to prevent 

this from going straight back to the agency? 

MR. STEWART: I think the district court 

could have done that and, as I say, if -- if the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And all, it seems to me, 

that the district court did do in addition to that is to 

say that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds 

that are -- that have already been purchased may be 

planted prior to March 30, 2007. 

MR. STEWART: If it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It’s the only exception. 

MR. STEWART: It didn't just say that. In 

its judgment, which I believe is at page 108a of the 

petition appendix -- and Mr. Garre referred to this 

previously -- it said in addition that the agency is 

enjoined from deregulating even in part genetically 

engineered alfalfa. 

So the district court didn't simply vacate

the -- the deregulation order and send it back to the 

agency to decide whether some interim protective 

measures would be appropriate. It said the agency can't 

do anything while the EIS is being prepared to allow the 

planting or harvesting of RRA except to the limited 

extent that the district court was authorizing with 

respect to already planted alfalfa. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view the 

correctness of that ruling has been preserved in the 

questions presented to this Court? 

MR. STEWART: Yes, I think -- yes, I think 

absolutely. Because the fundamental controversy both in 

the court of appeals and in this Court has been not 

whether an injunction should have been entered at all. 

For better or for worse, I think both the Petitioners 

and the government have acquiesced in the entry of some 

form of injunction. The controversy has been, should 

the district court have entered the government's proposed 

injunction instead of the one that it actually entered? 

And clearly if the proposed injunction had been entered 

instead, the Petitioners would have been better off 

because there would have been a continued market for 

their seed to planters who wanted to grow RRA in 

compliance with the proposed protective measures. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a little

different than answering Justice Kennedy's question, 

which is: Did you preserve the issue that the district 

court exceeded its jurisdiction in stopping you from 

further deregulation? That's a different question than 

whether or not it should have granted your further 

injunction which is, according to you, a further 

deregulation. But it's a different question. 

MR. STEWART: I'm not sure to what extent 

the Petitioners or -- or the government, frankly, have 

focused precisely on that particular language of the 

district court's judgment. But it has certainly been 

kind of the fundamental basis for our appeal to the 

court of appeals and for Petitioners' appeal and 

certiorari petition that what they are complaining about 

was the fact that a complete injunction was put in 

place, instead of an injunction that embodied the 

government's proposed protective measures, and we were 

focusing on the choice between two injunctions. 

We didn't focus specifically on the 

alternative course of action in which the matter might 

have been sent back to the agency and the agency would 

then have embodied those proposed protective measures in 

an administrative order. But I think the issue whether 

those protective measures would have been sufficient to 

prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs has been

Just to say one more thing about the CEQ 

regulations, this Court has held in the past that those 

are entitled to deference, and, again, they don't preclude 

all action during the pendency of the EIS.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In our view, Petitioners lack standing to 

bring this case to this Court. By failing to challenge 

the lawfulness of the deregulation vacatur either in the 

Ninth Circuit or in this Court, Petitioners have an 

insurmountable redressability problem. They cannot get 

the practical relief they seek even in the event that 

this Court vacates or narrows the injunction, and that 

is because the vacatur about which they said not one 

single sentence in the Ninth Circuit or in their opening 

brief or in their questions presented -- that is because 

the vacatur, which they never have challenged, had the 

unambiguous effect of reregulating RRA.

doesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it? 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, we're -- we’re 

defending it on the alternative ground, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that we have not persuaded you on our 

threshold question that there -- that there is a lack of 

standing. If, for -- I mean, they've made various 

arguments as to why they have standing, and I'm going to 

address them in a minute. But, you know, there's always 

a chance we’re going to lose on that question --

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROBBINS: -- and -- and although I don't 

think we ought to, we thought it would be prudent to say 

something about the merits. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Robbins, can I ask you 

about your clients’ standing? What individual plaintiff 

here stood to be harmed by what the agency had done? Which 

one of them was -- was within, what, 5 miles of any --

any field of the genetically engineered alfalfa? 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, the answer is that there 

are a great many plaintiffs who put in declarations, 

litigated this issue, and prevailed, and there was no 

appeal from it. For example, in the courtroom today, 

Mr. Pat Trask from western South Dakota, a hay and -- a 

conventional hay and seed farmer, who alleged, put in 

proof, that he stood -- if the deregulation went forward

cross-pollination and contamination. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What? From what? From 

what? From --

MR. ROBBINS: From --

JUSTICE SCALIA: From somebody within 5 

miles, 10 miles, 20 miles? 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, we have to be clear, 

Your Honor. What -- what -- what was enjoined was the 

future proliferation of this product, where the 

president of the company told the district court: If 

you let us continue to "introduce," in the words of the 

statute, this product, we’re already at 220,000 acres; 

we will become a million acres, a fivefold increase. And 

that was on the assumption that the EIS would take only 

2 years. It's since been 3 years, and now I hear it's 

going to be a fourth year. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want the Court to 

assume that somebody is going to be planting a field of 

the genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles 

of --

MR. ROBBINS: Well --

plaintiffs?

that within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at 

risk currently.

have organizational clients who have -- whose members --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. But you 

have to bring in a member from that organization --

MR. ROBBINS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who is concretely 

harmed. 

MR. ROBBINS: And we've put in declarations 

in the district court, multiple declarations from those 

members and from Mr. Geertson, the seed -- conventional 

seed farmer from Idaho, and Mr. Trask from South Dakota. 

But, Your Honor, let me -- let me, without begging the 

question -- I actually think -- I'm sorry.

that the harm is that from some seed-grown alfalfa, a bee 

or the wind is going to take the pollen and put it into 

a conventional field?

what makes this case --

alfalfa to seed as opposed to letting it just grow into 

hay? 

MR. ROBBINS: Most of the seed production is 

in the -- is in the Pacific Northwest and the West. 

There's a handful of States. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that handful of 

States --

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- is that where the 

risk exists? 

MR. ROBBINS: No. Oh, no, no. The risk 

was demonstrated at different levels and to different 

degrees both in the hay-producing States and in the 

seed-producing States. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just said the word 

"different levels and different degrees," but this is an 

all-size-fit injunction. 

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. Because, as I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is that 

reasonable when the risk is different depending on the 

place and type of growth?

kinds of risks. And I am happy to turn to the 

irreparable harm point, Your Honor, of the proposition 

that the risk must be sufficiently likely, which by the 

way, does not mean more likely than not, a suggestion 

made in the reply brief. No court has ever said so. 

"Sufficiently likely" talks in terms of the nature of 

the harm. 

Here, whether you are growing hay or whether 

you are growing alfalfa for seed, there is a 

sufficiently likely risk not only of cross-pollination 

or all the other ways that contamination happens --

through dropping seeds, through seed mixing, through 

custom cutting, through missing ends of fields --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you 

something? Is that because your farmers -- I understood 

farmers of hay had huge tracts of land. Do they rent 

equipment from someone else to do it? 

MR. ROBBINS: They often do. There’s 

custom cutting where you can't -- you know, you don't 

own the equipment. You hire a custom cutter who may be 

cutting an RRA field today and your field tomorrow. And 

the -- the risk -- and this is all in the record -- the 

risk of a seed contaminating another seed or getting 

into a hay field is easily sufficiently likely to not 

constitute an abuse of discretion.

Justice Ginsburg's question to be asking: What was

case from the Court's decision in Winter is that, 

whereas the Navy had been running these exercises for 

some 40 years and there was a well-developed track 

record as a consequence, here this is a new technology 

that was about to spread at least fivefold over 2 years. 

But I -- I do want to get back to the -- to 

what I think is the insurmountable problem that the --

that the Petitioners have on the issue of standing, because 

I heard Mr. Garre say this morning in answer to one of the 

Court's questions that the -- that the notice of appeal 

recited the vacatur as part of the notice of appeal.

That is true. That is because the notice of appeal, 

like most notices of appeal that lawyers file, simply 

quoted the judgment. 

But when you get to the papers -- the 

briefs, the questions presented, the argument, the oral 

argument, the questions presented in this Court, the 

opening brief, there is not a single word saying that 

the vacatur was wrong. And that’s important because, 

as I believe the Chief Justice was adverting before, the 

vacatur does not -- is not governed by the same 

injunctive standards. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- there's 

a flip side of that that is not so good for you, because 

one of the things you want from the injunction is a 

prohibition on the agency partially deregulating. Well, 

you’re not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends 

it -- should send it back to the agency and they can 

decide. And if they decide to partially deregulate, you 

have the APA challenges available to you. 

MR. ROBBINS: I -- I think, 

Mr. Chief Justice, there is some considerable force to 

the point that the injunction in that respect exceeded 

the scope of the vacatur. And it may be -- it may be 

that they have standing only to challenge so much of the 

injunction as exceeds the scope of the vacatur, but

that's not what they want. What they want is to do all 

the planting that the vacatur says they may not. 

And so I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument is 

that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing 

up the vacatur and the injunction? 

MR. ROBBINS: I would put it slightly 

differently. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROBBINS: I would say that the mistake 

that was made was in not appreciating, though it was 

called to his attention by the lawyers I -- by the party 

I represent, that the vacatur did have this effect. 

I do think that the injunction was sort of 

allowed to be litigated. There were many reasons why 

they litigated the injunction. We, for example, wanted 

a more demanding injunction --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't one of the 

reasons that they litigated the injunction was that by 

its terms and because of its issuance the agency on 

remand could not have adopted some partial measures to 

allow controlled planting? 

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. That is a reason why my 

clients sought the injunction. They sought -- they 

sought other things in the injunction as well, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- no, but isn't 

that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers, 

Monsanto, contested the injunction? They said --

because once the injunction is issued, as the 

government has told us today, they cannot issue some 

partial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards. 

MR. ROBBINS: There is -- that’s doubtless 

one reason why they litigated the injunction, but it is 

not a reason, Justice Kennedy, that they have standing, 

because vacating the current injunction will give them 

nothing that they -- that they -- that isn't already 

prohibited by the vacatur, except -- and I grant you 

this -- it will allow them to go back to the agency, 

seek a partial deregulation, which Mr. Stewart told --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that is 

substantial. It takes time, and the district court 

injunction that's now in effect prohibits that. And 

they have standing to challenge that. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I'm not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or at least that's their 

argument. 

MR. ROBBINS: That is their argument, but it 

isn't right, and here's why: One of the standing 

requirements is imminence, that it must be an actual 

harm or an imminent harm. Now, here are the things that

would have to happen for that scenario to come to pass: 

It would have to be remanded to the agency. Mr. Stewart 

told us this morning there would have to be at least an 

environmental -- an EA prepared, that may or may not 

come out in favor of a partial deregulation. There 

would then be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't mean to 

interrupt your answer, but they’ve already done an EA 

in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they 

found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori 

for partial. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, we don't know. I heard 

Mr. Stewart, who speaks for the government, tell us that 

it would require additional steps. But this Court's 

imminence cases, you know, can't -- do not accommodate 

this many if's. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me pretty 

doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court 

and said: This kind of partial deregulation ought to be 

allowed, and we’re in favor of it. I mean, you are not 

sending it back to an agency that’s a blank slate. You 

know that the agency favors this degree of deregulation. 

MR. ROBBINS: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I’d -- you 

know, I -- boy, I’d take a remand to the agency any

day. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I can -- I can tell you, 

Your Honor, maybe the best authority I could give you on 

how imminent this is, how -- whether it really meets this 

Court's standings tests, here's what Petitioners said 

about this exact scenario when they were in the court of 

appeals: They said that the prospect of a future grant 

of partial deregulation is, quote, "a hypothetical NEPA 

controversy," end quote, that, quote, "rests upon 

contingent future events that may not occur as 

anticipated or, indeed, may not occur at all." 

I take that to be the very definition of 

what is not imminent for purposes of this Court's 

standing cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I go back to 

something you said a while ago, that "likely" does not 

mean more likely than not? 

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's -- I thought 

that would be obvious. If I say your friends are likely 

to win, that means they are more likely than you. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I -- you know, I 

think the -- the answer is contextual, but in this 

context, "likely" for purposes of an injunction, 

Mr. Chief Justice, has I think never been understood to

mean more likely than not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have -- I --

I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided 

over the however many years we’ve had this standard. 

Is there a case that says "likely" does not mean more 

likely than not? 

MR. ROBBINS: No. But there are cases -- I 

mean, the issue has not been addressed by this Court one 

way or the other. I would say City of Los Angeles v. 

Lyons and the Amoco case both used the phrase 

"sufficiently likely," and the lower courts have 

understood that to mean sufficiently likely in light of 

the nature of the harm. 

Consider, if we were talking about the 

probability of the contamination of the water supply of 

New York City, would anybody suppose that the -- if the 

probability were 10 percent rather than 50.9 percent, 

that no one could go into court and get an injunction? 

Neither the private litigants -- you know, put them to 

one side. The government's own authority to obtain 

injunctive relief would be critically hampered if such 

an order came about, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't contamination of 

the New York City water supply. It's the creation of 

plants of -- of genetically engineered alfalfa which

spring up that otherwise wouldn't exist. It doesn't 

even destroy the current plantings of non-genetically 

engineered alfalfa. This is not the end of the world. 

It really isn't. 

The most it does is make it difficult for 

those farmers who want to cater to the European market, 

which will not accept genetically engineered alfalfa. 

It makes it more difficult for them to have a field of 

100 percent non-genetically engineered. But that's not 

the end of the world, Mr. Robbins. 

MR. ROBBINS: I don't think we bore the 

burden, an end-of-the-world burden, Justice Scalia. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROBBINS: We bore the burden to show 

sufficient evidence of irreparable harm such that, on an 

abuse of discretion standard, it was appropriate. But

likely than not” standard for likelihood of success or 

likelihood of irreparable harm. 

But I do -- if I could come to Your Honor's 

question about what the harm really is, there are three 

types of harms. There is the contamination of products, 

and we’ve talked about that. But there are two things 

we’ve not talked about. One of them is the choice to be 

in a line of business that farmers and businessmen across 

this country have chosen to be in. Some of them are in 

this courtroom today. They have chosen organics or 

conventional farming that is GMO-free. They have chosen 

to sell natural beef. And they have chosen this in a 

rapidly growing, large business with dollars -- billions 

of dollars at stake. 

You mention, for example, Justice Scalia, 

the European market. That is just the tip of the 

iceberg. The Japanese will not take -- which take, by 

the way, 75 percent of our alfalfa exports -- will not --

despite their formal government policy, will not take 

GMO products. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Robbins, but if, as 

is likely -- I think the government told us that the EIS 

is about a year away, but that the EIS is going to say 

deregulate --

MR. ROBBINS: Yes.

whatever the farmers of organic or conventional --

they’re only a year away from, so they will have to 

accept that there are other planters who want to do the 

genetically engineered crop. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I think history remains 

to be written about what will happen in response to that 

draft EIS that's a year away. We’ll see how it comes 

out. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think you yourself 

told us how it came out with other crops, that the 

genetically engineered crop was very popular and took 

over. 

MR. ROBBINS: Yes, it's very popular, but 

it's also -- you know, past is prologue. We’ve seen what 

happened with genetically engineered corn. You can ask 

Taco Bell --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's a 

decision for the government to decide, APHIS, and their 

lawyer, Mr. Stewart, who is in the courtroom told us 

what the APHIS view is. 

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. I understand.

of corn and the other genetically engineered crops, is 

that from contamination or is it just from -- from 

consumer choice; i.e., that that's what farmers like 

because it's easy to grow? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what happened with corn? 

You -- you -- you said -- gee, I was unaware -- I’ve 

been eating corn all this time. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, there’s -- there was 

the so-called --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What happened with it? 

MR. ROBBINS: There was the so-called 

StarLink controversy in which there was genetic 

contamination of corn. There was genetic contamination 

of organic soybeans and organic canola in Canada. There 

was .06 percent contamination of -- of -- of rice from 

genetically engineered rice that nearly -- that -- that 

cost the rice industry, as the rice growers' brief makes 

clear -- the amicus brief makes clear. 

The fact is the judge had before him 

all of this evidence, and he said it is sufficiently 

likely to -- to constitute irreparable harm. 

Now, Justice Ginsburg, it is correct that 

the draft EIS says this is coming. So, in a year, 

6 months, whenever it is, people may have to get ready

for a brave -- for a -- for a different world if not a 

brave new world. But it's worth looking at that draft 

EIS, because it is very candid about how different the 

world will look. 

It tells us we know this is going to shut 

down the -- the export market. We know that the 

Japanese and the Koreans and the Europeans won't buy your 

products. We know this will hasten the consolidation of 

farming. We know it will hasten the -- it will 

hasten the demise of organic farming, a rapidly 

developing business in this country --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All arguments you 

can make before HP -- APHIS and which presumably were 

made before APHIS --

MR. ROBBINS: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and can be made 

before APHIS if this is remanded. 

MR. ROBBINS: Indeed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't entitle 

you to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the 

meantime. 

MR. ROBBINS: I -- I agree that there is a 

respect in which the injunction goes beyond the vacatur, 

and I think, you know, there are arguments why the 

district court took that additional measure.

But I -- I think the upshot is that if that 

is the only respect that the injunction exceeds the 

limit of the vacatur, I don't understand how the 

Petitioners can possibly have standing to argue all the 

things that they argue, which is: We want to plant 

tomorrow. We want to plant the next day. We don't want 

to have to go back before the agency and let them do 

another EA. We don't want to have more litigation over a 

partial deregulation. We want to plant now. That's 

their argument before this Court. 

And that is precisely what the vacatur tells 

them independently they may not do, and they didn't 

challenge that. They didn't and they haven't. They 

didn't say a word until we brought it up in our 

bottom-side brief. Then we heard about it. 

And, Justice Kennedy, this is precisely the 

situation that was before this Court in Renne v. -- the 

California constitutional provision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MR. ROBBINS: -- in which Your Honor 

wrote the opinion for the Court. Where there are 

overlapping provisions, or for -- you know, two pieces 

of law that have overlapping effect, and you challenge 

one but not the other, you have a fatal redressability 

problem. That's where we are today.

And I have not heard -- I mean, I understand 

that the vacatur was perhaps only in part because the 

judge in his discretion grandfathered certain 

pre-March 30 growers -- fine. Maybe it was there for a 

partial vacatur. But whatever form of the vacatur it 

was, they didn't challenge it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's kind of 

artificial to separate the two out. I mean, it's one 

judgment, and they say they’re intertwined. The 

injunction is based on the vacatur. And so if they 

challenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they’re 

not challenging the vacatur. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I'm not sure that 

it's fair to say that the injunction is based on the 

vacatur. But I do want to -- I do think, though, Mr. 

Chief Justice, that every appeal is from a judgment. I 

mean, that’s more or less -- excepting unusual 

circumstances, that's the only thing you can appeal. 

But if I were, for example, appealing a 

criminal conviction, a judgment of conviction entered and 

sentence, and I raised only evidentiary arguments, and I 

fail to raise the sufficiency of the evidence, I -- I 

can't get a dismissal in the court of appeals, because I 

have -- I’ve failed to raise an issue. And it will not avail 

me one whit to tell the court of appeals, well, gosh, I

appealed the judgment, and the sufficiency of the 

evidence is embedded in the judgment. 

No. The way we appeal things in this 

country is we write sentences in our briefs about -- we 

write questions presented; we present questions to this 

Court. And I will say that, although all manner of 

arguments have been smuggled under the tent through the 

camel's nose in this case, when I look at the questions 

presented in this case, you’ve got to really squint to 

find even some of the arguments they have made, much 

less this one, which they have not made. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but we have to 

decide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide 

that the injunction does no more than the vacatur. 

MR. ROBBINS: No. I think what we -- I 

think the question is whether the relief that they are 

seeking is separately prohibited by the vacatur and 

whether that excess, which may arguably go beyond the 

vacatur, is sufficiently imminent to meet this Court's 

standing cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the 

district judge was wrong. He should have -- if you say 

the injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should 

have ended by saying it's vacated. 

MR. ROBBINS: I think that was an available

option. I think the reason he didn't is that, among 

other things, the -- the parties were arguing about 

whether the -- the injunction should be broader than the 

vacatur. And, of course, he had the authority, as the 

government has told us in its brief, to decline to 

vacate at all. 

So it's not as if the remedy phase had no 

point. It had a point. It's was all up for grabs. But 

in the end he issued a judgment with multiple parts, 

only a subset of which Petitioners elected to appeal. 

That was their choice. But now having made that choice, 

it seems to me surpassingly odd to draw this Court into 

a close reading -- and this goes back to one of the 

first questions of this morning, from Justice Alito --

the question about digging into this, what the district 

court appropriately called the voluminous record of --

of -- of declarations and evidence. That's an --

just a -- I think a passingly -- a passing strange use 

of this Court's resources, to dig into those materials, 

when in point of fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't necessarily 

have to do that. We just have to decide whether the 

lower courts did it.

that they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough, 

wouldn't it? We wouldn't have to do it ourselves. 

MR. ROBBINS: Respectfully, Justice Scalia, 

I think the only way you can say they didn't do it is 

by doing it yourself; because they said they did it. You 

look at pages --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They also said stuff which 

suggests that they didn't do it. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I won't -- and I am 

not here defending every particular line in some of the 

opinions, but there is no question that at 69a through 

71a of the petition appendix, the district court 

articulated the standard four-part injunction test. The 

court of appeals articulated it as well, said that the 

evidence was sufficient. And, indeed, in this record, 

there is sufficient evidence to warrant a finding of a 

likelihood of irreparable harm, reviewable under an 

abuse of discretion standard. Your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're -- if you 

are right that the injunction does nothing, they don't 

have standing because of that, we should throw the 

injunction out. 

MR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I -- I think, given 

that standing is a threshold question, I don't see how 

the Court could do that. I think the Court could say:

We conclude that the vacatur prohibits exactly the same 

things as the Petitioners are demanding from this Court. 

They didn't challenge it; they have a redressability 

problem, case dismissed --

worry --

MR. ROBBINS: -- or dismissed as improvidently 

granted. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The government doesn't 

have to worry about standing, does it?

the government I think has the same vacatur problem, but 

I don't think that's a burden I have to meet, because 

under -- I think it's Diamond v. Charles, the -- the 

standing has to be by the party that called upon this 

Court's jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In deciding irreparable 

harm, what weight if any should be given to the 

proposition that there was an environmental impact 

regulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit 

between, say, two farmers over a nuisance? What weight 

do we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there’s a --

a violation of the rule requiring an environmental 

impact statement?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is not alone a 

sufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it? 

MR. ROBBINS: No. And no -- no one is 

claiming that an EIS violation standing alone gives 

rise to an injunction, but it carries some important 

weight. And if I could just answer the question 

notwithstanding the red light, the answer to the 

question is the fact that they violated the EIS 

requirement tells us at a minimum that this was a 

significant -- a major Federal program that had a 

significant impact on the environment. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. ROBBINS: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, you have 

3 minutes. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Justice Kennedy, to answer your question, 

this Court in Amoco held that you don't give special 

weight to that; that you apply the traditional equitable 

factors. 

Your Honors, we absolutely did challenge the 

vacatur below. That's spelled out in note 1 of our 

reply brief. The whole fight in this case going forward

since the district court has been over whether or not 

the court erred in not adopting the government's 

proposed measures. On page 184 of the petition appendix, 

it makes clear that the government's opposed measures 

were intended to replace the deregulation order. So the 

vacatur and the proposed measures are one and the same. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a real problem if 

the whole appeal is over whether or not the district 

court should have accepted the agency's views. The 

agency has told us that it has side-stepped going 

through all of the regular -- all of the administrative 

steps it was required to. It may not have needed to 

give notice, but it needed to do some form of an EA and 

get comments and do other things. And it didn't do 

that. 

MR. GARRE: Well, it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can we say that 

the district court acted improperly, when it's the 

government who is asking the district court to forgive 

it from doing something it's legally required to do? 

MR. GARRE: The district court at least 

acted improperly in enjoining the agency from doing that 

on remand. And if that's all the Court thinks it did 

improperly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. My problem is I

don’t see that argument either in your brief or theirs. 

MR. GARRE: Well, it's part --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see only the argument 

that it erred by not accepting something that the 

government had no power to do outside of the regulatory 

scheme. 

MR. GARRE: It's -- our view is it's part 

and parcel of the vacatur order. The district court 

looked at this in the context of the injunction and 

posed those traditional factors in examining the scope 

of relief. 

JUSTICE ALITO: How do you answer 

Mr. Robbins’s --

MR. GARRE: I mean, it's important for this 

Court to put aside --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry to interrupt. How 

do you answer Mr. Robbins's imminence argument? 

MR. GARRE: In terms of going back for the 

imminence, we’re operating under this injunction which is 

unlawful. It's preventing -- it's causing real harm to 

the nation's farmers today. There couldn't be more 

imminence in terms of the harm that we suffer because of 

this erroneous injunction. With respect, it's -- it's 

the farmers that are challenging this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it be the

same problem for the farmers if we had only the 

deregulation decision vacated? They can't do anything 

until the agency then gives them permission to do 

something. 

MR. GARRE: If you go back, the agency 

could allow those measures to be implemented and that 

would solve --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's going to take 

time. 

MR. GARRE: -- our problem. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, it's going to take 

time, and you have the EIS on track within a year. So are 

you going to do this other operation in 6 months? 

MR. GARRE: Not necessarily, 

Justice Ginsburg, but, with respect, we’ve been 

operating under this erroneous injunction for 3 years. 

This Court should say it's erroneous. There are 

other cases that are repeating this pattern. It's 

important for the Court to correct this error. 

And briefly on the question of harm: There 

are no instances in this record of any cross-pollination 

with hay, only a couple of -- a few isolated with 

respect to seed, and their harm really boils down to the 

question of their psychological objection to genetically 

engineered alfalfa. That harm is not cognizable under
