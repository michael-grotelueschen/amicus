 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-901, Oregon v. Ice.

 Ms. Williams.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The factfinding at issue in this case is 

significantly different than the factfinding at issue in 

this Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the 

Court struck down changes in sentencing practice that 

had the effect of removing factfinding from the province 

of the jury. In those cases, the change in practice 

meant that a defendant could be convicted by the jury 

for one offense and then, based on nonjury factfinding, 

the defendant could be sentenced for what appeared to be 

an aggravated, more serious offense without the jury 

having made all the factual determinations necessary for 

that more serious offense.

 That doesn't happen in this case. In this 

case, the jury convicted Mr. Ice of six counts, and the 

sentence imposed on each of those six convictions 

satisfies the Apprendi rule. There's no additional jury

factfinding that alters -- or nonjury factfinding, 

excuse me, that alters a specific sentence for one of 

the convictions. Instead, what the factfinding in this 

case does is to significantly restrain the judge's 

ability to decide how to administer those multiple 

sentences for the multiple convictions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it -- it, by 

reason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's 

unusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that 

has one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an 

entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently 

unless a certain additional fact exists and that 

additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than 

by the jury. So that if you take seriously what -- what 

we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which 

has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the 

defendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if 

you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't 

apply here.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Justice Scalia, first on the 

point in terms of how unique this statute is, there are 

other States that have similar requirements, that there 

is initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be 

concurrent unless there is additional nonjury 

factfinding that authorizes the judge to impose

consecutive sentences. So it's not entirely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many others? Do you 

know?

 MS. WILLIAMS: It's difficult actually to 

come up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when 

you look at how other courts have sort of combined 

cases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different 

States have sort of changed their practice some of those 

have fallen away. It's clear that there's at least a 

minority of States that have this kind of limitation on 

what is otherwise inherent or a discretionary authority 

of the judge to decide how to administer these multiple 

sentences.

 The difference is that what this Court has 

been addressing in the Apprendi line of cases has always 

been a specific sentence imposed on a specific 

conviction. And what Oregon Supreme Court did was to 

expand that to say that, in addition to the statutory 

maximum that this Court described in Blakely, there is 

in effect a second statutory maximum that you must 

consider when there are multiple sentences being imposed 

for multiple convictions, and that's the total period of 

incarceration that the defendant will serve with and 

without the additional factfinding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, this fact can --

can turn out to be the most significant fact for the 

defendant. I mean, it could lengthen his sentence 

enormously. It's more important than many of the other 

facts that we leave to the jury.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and in this 

case, for example, the additional factfinding extends 

the whole duration of the -- of Mr. Ice's period of 

incarceration from 90 months to 340 months. But what is 

significant is that, as this Court said in Blakely, the 

Sixth Amendment is a reservation of jury power; it's not 

a limitation on judicial power. And I would submit it's 

not a limitation on legislative power, except to the 

extent that that exercise of power removed something 

from the province of the jury. Historically, it's 

undisputed that the judge made this decision about how 

multiple sentences would be administered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same 

about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth 

Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power 

where at least there is an entitlement by law to a 

certain lower sentence. And there we said you can't 

leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that 

trigger that law exist or not.

 MS. WILLIAMS: I think what's important is 

the foundation for that holding and the foundation for

the Apprendi rule. It wasn't simply that factfinding in 

general that exposes the defendant to a harsher 

punishment is something that should -- would be better 

served by having it done by the jury. It was that, 

because of the changes in sentencing practices, because 

States and Congress have been taking what traditionally 

had been elements of an offense and relabeling them as 

something else, as sentencing factors, that the jury was 

no longer finding what traditionally it would have found 

for each conviction. It was no longer finding what 

would have been each element of an offense.

 So what the rule does is it provides a 

bright-line way of testing what is the functional 

equivalent of an element for a specific offense that 

would have been within the province of the jury and 

therefore that can't be removed without violating the 

Sixth Amendment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The rule --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The rule does bear on 

culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the 

definition of an offense or a more serious offense.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.

 And I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed 

this case as in terms of -- that it may have simply been 

happenstance that the Court was looking only at single

convictions and single sentences being imposed on those. 

But I think that takes away the analysis that the court 

used in reaching the conclusions that it reached.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand why 

this happenstance is required to do it under the 

statute. I didn't quite understand that.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said it's only 

happenstance. He has to do it under the statute if he 

makes the finding.

 MS. WILLIAMS: No, what I'm trying to say is 

that I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact 

that so far in this Court's cases you had only been 

dealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as 

-- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would 

be a different statutory maximum when you have multiple 

sentences being imposed for multiple convictions. And 

so the supreme court, I think, treated it -- what I was 

saying was it simply is happenstance that that had been 

the -- the nature of the cases that this Court has 

decided, but then drew from this Court's decision and 

from discussion about punishment a broader meaning that 

somehow the jury must be involved in any factual 

determination that relates to the overall quantum of 

punishment for multiple sentences being imposed.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't we furnish the 

premise for that broader reasoning? Because we pointed 

out that the traditional role of the jury was standing 

in effect as the buffer between the power of the State 

and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi 

cases was that the concept of elements was being 

manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood 

in that -- in effect, that buffer position.

 And I guess the question here would be, is 

there -- is there room for -- in effect, for 

manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing 

scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme, 

so that the jury in effect loses control over the 

length, the ultimate length of time that an individual 

is going to serve? What is your response to that?

 MS. WILLIAMS: That the jury does not lose 

anything that the jury historically had within its --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the problem 

with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia 

raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same 

argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline, 

but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear 

on the new law an old concept. And this is a change in 

the law, to be sure. I agree with you, historically. 

The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at

all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted 

to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.

 But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept 

and the concern of the jury trial right to this new 

situation. So I don't think it's an answer to say, 

well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.

 MS. WILLIAMS: But there's something 

different here in terms of looking back on history and 

what we have presently, compared to when you are looking 

at the offense-specific sentence associated with a 

specific conviction, because the changes in practice 

there had the effect of taking away the ability to find 

an element or something that was the equivalent of an 

element, of removing that from the jury. And, 

historically, that is clearly what the jury's job was: 

To stand in as a buffer between the defendant and the 

government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I gather from your 

argument that you would -- you would be taking the other 

side and you would be saying that it has to go to the 

jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to 

concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was 

added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed 

with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not 

run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any

other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?

 MS. WILLIAMS: I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There it's attached to a 

particular crime. Do you really think that we should 

have a different result in that case from this one?

 MS. WILLIAMS: No, Your Honor, I don't, 

although I think that makes it a more difficult 

situation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it 

is focused on a specific sentence for a specific 

offense. But what is different is it still goes to not 

adding to the penalty for that sentence, but adding to 

how you are going to administer multiple sentences.

 And the history here is very different. 

Because what we have is, even though there wasn't a 

statute when the Framers would have looked at this 

issue, the issue did exist. Judges did make the 

determination about how multiple sentences would be 

administered. And what they would have considered would 

have been a wide array of facts and without really 

limitation other than --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same 

thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up 

to them and they considered a wide array of facts. So 

what? We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by 

law and say they can't do more than this, once you do

that, that fact has to be found by the jury. And that's 

what's going on here.

 MS. WILLIAMS: But I think what's different 

is that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi 

actually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury 

factfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the 

sentence was that was associated with the jury's 

verdict; that, in fact, that was the problem. Because 

once there was additional factfinding that permitted the 

judge to add to the penalty, that that had changed by 

taking something away from what the jury's role was.

 And so here we don't have that 

same sort of situation. I think that -- that that was 

exactly the argument this Court has rejected in those 

cases of -- of -- where Faith and others have attempted 

to suggest that historically judges were able to do this 

and so it shouldn't matter now that we have changes. 

But the Court rejected those arguments to say that, no, 

because the sentencing practices have taken something 

away from the jury, that is why we have the Sixth 

Amendment violation.

 So if in this circumstance we 

-- we have constrained judicial power -- and clearly 

that's what this statute does, is it tells the judge 

that, instead of being able to make this determination

based on this wide array of factual considerations, the 

judge now is limited in what the judge must consider to 

-- to then exercise discretion in administering these 

sentences. But all of that is 

legislative restraint of judicial power without touching 

in any way on the jury's historic role in -- in how to 

deal with these multiple --

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right in -- I just 

want to get the facts right. Am I right, you did this 

historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we 

can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you 

haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury 

rather than a judge that made this question of how you 

put together sentences for two separate crimes committed 

on the same occasion? Is that right, or is it an 

overstatement?

 MS. WILLIAMS: It is an overstatement only 

in the sense that I did not go back as far as --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say how far you 

went back. I said as far as you went back.

 MS. WILLIAMS: As far as I went --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what 

Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see 

what was true at the time of the writing of the 

Constitution.

MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And at the time of the 

writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us 

feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the 

judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total 

sentence where the person had committed two crimes on 

the same occasion.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, exactly. And that 

difference in terms of the history of showing that this 

was a judicial determination, that -- and now that the 

factfinding --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same 

in Apprendi. It was a judicial determination how much 

of a sentence you were going to get from ten years to 

life. It wasn't up to the jury. It was up to the 

judge.

 MS. WILLIAMS: But where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And yet when you constrain 

the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than 

20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a 

gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be 

left to the judge. It's a matter of law, and the facts 

must be found by the jury. And I don't see any 

difference here. I mean in both cases it was 

traditionally done by judges.

MS. WILLIAMS: But what this Court focused 

on with the Apprendi rule is that, although judges made 

decisions about sentencing within a range of possible 

sentences, what judges could not do was to find 

additional facts that were the functional equivalent of 

an element of a greater offense. And that's what was 

happening with those new sentencing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But we defined in effect 

what was the functional element of the greater offense 

in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the 

judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that 

would have been -- that would have established the 

maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?

 MS. WILLIAMS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. And aren't we 

in exactly the same position here? Because the 

defendant here can correctly say: I cannot be sentenced 

to the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of 

consecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which 

has not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of 

guilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be 

found to expose me to the heavier penalty.

 And that is exactly the same as the 

situation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and 

that is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the

proposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier 

penalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative. If 

you accept that, I don't see how you would escape the 

analogy with Apprendi.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, I do not accept 

that it is a -- an enhanced penalty for any of the 

specific convictions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Everybody agrees.

 MS. WILLIAMS: And it would be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If you had a choice between 

two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences, 

you know which one you are going to choose. So we -- we 

know what is the heavier sentence or the heavier 

sentencing option.

 MS. WILLIAMS: It does have certainly a 

harsher effect on the defendant than serving each of the 

sentences beginning at the same time. But I think the 

same could be said in terms of mandatory minimum 

sentences and the factfinding required for those.

 We obviously have cases where a defendant 

facing a mandatory minimum sentence is going to be 

confronted with a harsher sentence than he would face 

without that additional factor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the mandatory minimum 

is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities

that the judge could impose anyway without any further 

factfinding by the jury.

 MS. WILLIAMS: And depending on how you view 

this in terms of if you are looking at it with an 

offense-specific frame, each sentence imposed for each 

of the six convictions is also within the range of what 

the judge can impose. This additional piece of when 

those sentences begin does not take away from the jury's 

role. It does limit what the judge could otherwise have 

done, and it does that limitation by requiring 

factfinding.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- what 

about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having 

him tried as an adult? What about probation? What 

about alternative drug programs? What about diversion? 

I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be 

a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation 

where the total amount of punishment is greater rather 

than less.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and we are 

now litigating some of those very questions in light of 

the Oregon Supreme Court decision about what is the 

scope when you look beyond the specific sentence imposed 

for a specific conviction and look at this greater 

quantum of punishment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a lot easier to limit 

it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a 

particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the 

whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles 

that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome 

if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to 

sentences.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Although, Your Honor, some of 

these Douse-Greene decisions that are made again by 

nonjury factfinding do affect what the defendant's 

period of incarceration is going to be.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And doesn't the sentencing 

-- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include 

restitution, to include what is the equivalent of 

probation? I mean, there is a broad definition of the 

word "sentence" in the law which includes some of the 

things that I mentioned, though not all.

 MS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor, and the same 

is true for Oregon, that the sentence imposed and if you 

-- the -- the judgments are set out in the joint 

appendix in this case, that set out each of the 

sentences imposed for each of the six convictions, and 

you will see that there are a number of things in 

addition to the term of incarceration that are a part of 

that sentence being imposed.

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a question 

that may seem totally irrelevant? Do you think our 

decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania was correctly 

decided?

 MS. WILLIAMS: I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me under your 

reasoning in your case you might say that case was 

wrong. And I think it was wrong. I will be perfectly 

candid and say so. I think it was a very important 

decision.

 MS. WILLIAMS: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

that it is necessary to say that that decision is wrong 

to be consistent with the position I am asserting here 

or the decision in Harris, because there the Court made 

a distinction between what the jury traditionally would 

have been -- been doing and determined that that jury 

role was limited to deciding facts that increased only 

the -- the maximum penalty that the defendants faced. 

And so factfinding tied to imposing a mandatory minimum 

sentence is different.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. But it 

seems to me it is -- in the old common law tradition, 

following sort of the reasoning in the case you relied 

on, McMillan really should have come out the other way, 

because the jury normally would be finding the facts

that would allow the minimum -- the maximum to go up or 

the minimum. I forget which it was.

 MS. WILLIAMS: And -- and what I have done 

is to start with the proposition that we have in place 

the Apprendi rule as it has been construed in McMillan 

and in Harris, but that this is a -- a very different 

extension of that rule beyond anything that this Court 

has addressed in these cases.

 And it's an extension that doesn't have the 

same historic support that the Apprendi rule has. So I 

don't think that this Court needs to -- certainly this 

Court doesn't need to consider what impact this would 

have except for, I think, in accepting the Oregon 

Supreme Court holding. That to me does raise questions 

about the ongoing validity of McMillan and Harris. And 

-- and again, there are ways that you could certainly 

distinguish that and retain those. But what it does is 

to focus more on the jury as factfinder instead of 

focusing on what the jury's historic role was and the 

Sixth Amendment as a reservation of the power that the 

jury has, not somehow giving the jury additional power 

beyond what it has whenever factfinding is involved that 

is -- is related to a defendant's aggregate punishment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And, of course, it's part 

of your position that historically sentences were always

consecutive, if you go way back.

 MS. WILLIAMS: But, Your Honor, in the older 

cases we actually do find that they were -- there was 

discretion for the judge to have the sentences be served 

concurrently. It was viewed as in some ways not giving 

full effect to the jury's verdict of finding the 

defendant guilty for multiple offenses, which 

consecutive sentencing did give full effect to that 

verdict.

 And so it was in the nature really of a 

mitigation that the judge could do to lessen the 

severity of the punishment based on certain facts that 

the judge would consider and then in simply exercising 

the judge's discretion.

 But what is important here, I think, is that 

it was clearly something for the judge to decide. Once 

there were the multiple convictions, the jury's role was 

at an end, and it was then up to the judge to make the 

determination about how to administer those multiple 

sentences. And so long as we are not changing the 

jury's role in establishing that sentence for each of 

the -- the six convictions in this case, then we have 

not removed from the jury anything that would have been 

incorporated within the Sixth Amendment.

sentences from multiple States? You commit the crime in 

State A; you flee. You are then tried and found guilty 

of a second crime in State B. I -- I -- let's assume 

that the judge in State B has considerable discretion as 

to whether or not he intends to impose a sentence in B 

or send back to A, and that he knows that A is going to 

be concurrent.

 Under the theory of the case that's 

advocated by the Respondents, do you think that a jury 

trial or some sort of finding would be required?

 MS. WILLIAMS: I think that if the -- the 

law required the sentences be concurrent unless 

additional factfindings were made, then under the -- the 

rule announced by the Oregon Supreme Court and advocated 

by Respondent that question would have to then go to the 

jury even if it arises in -- basically in separate 

proceedings.

 So as you are sentencing in that separate, 

second proceeding, it would still be a jury question of 

whether those facts were -- were there that would allow 

the judge to impose a consecutive sentence.

 The Oregon statute treats that a little bit 

differently. It appears to give the judge discretion 

when there is a previously imposed judgment. Other 

States do it differently, though, and do require

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST G. LANNET

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. LANNET: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case presents yet another application 

of the bright-line rule from Apprendi. Oregon law 

entitles a criminal defendant to a concurrent sentence 

for each offense unless certain facts are found. Here 

for three offenses a judge found those facts and imposed 

a greater penalty of a consecutive sentence. That 

violated defendant's -- or the Sixth Amendment's jury-

trial guarantee that the judge's authority to impose 

criminal punishment must be limited by the facts solely 

found by the jury.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lannet, there --

there is one significant difference, I think, between --

the-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State 

labels something a "sentencing factor" or an "element." 

Every one of those questions that goes into determining

the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury 

under Apprendi.

 But when it comes to consecutive versus 

concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our 

main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are 

certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent. Or 

it leaves the total things to the discretion of the 

judge.

 And if we are looking at it from the point 

of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not 

going to make it totally discretionary because we want 

to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting 

certain restraints on the judge. So it seems -- what 

seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment 

is supposed to protect the defendant's right. And here 

the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more 

of a right. And he can say, that's unconstitutional, 

but if you give me less of a right, it would be 

perfectly constitutional.

 It's that enigma that I think is very 

disturbing about this case.

 MR. LANNET: Well, two points on that. One 

of them is that historically the jury trial -- the jury 

found the verdict of guilt. That, in itself, authorized 

the potential penalty of a very significant consecutive

sentence.

 Oregon has made a different policy choice 

here. And, to understand the full backdrop of it, 

perhaps the context, that before this Oregon -- before 

it had this statutory system in place, it had very 

liberal rules regarding merger. This was part of a 

series of enactments in which antimerger provisions were 

enacted so the defendant's criminal history would 

represent more accurately the number of convictions the 

jury had found him guilty of.

 Therefore, the defendants under -- in Oregon 

law the defendant must receive a separate sentence for 

each offense. So the increased number of sentences gave 

rise to the possibility of longer sentences through 

consecutive sentencing. Because in Oregon not only does 

an offense give rise to a discrete sentence, but whether 

the -- the sentence is concurrent or consecutive is an 

aspect of punishment for that offense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In Oregon traditionally if 

a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in 

the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that 

would not be considered two crimes?

 MR. LANNET: At a certain point in time 

there were judicial rules in place regarding merger that 

may have resulted in the entry of one --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can you cite me an Oregon 

case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape 

is only guilty of one crime?

 MR. LANNET: I would be happy to submit some 

in a memorandum. I would need another day to do so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lannet, in -- in 

connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you 

think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute 

which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime 

committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be 

30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not 

commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will 

be 15 years?

 Do you think if the -- if the statute were 

framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we 

would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been 

used or not?

 MR. LANNET: I certainly it would raise an 

issue about whether -- a different statutory 

interpretation, of course, that if the State was merely 

shifting a burden on a fact to the defendant to 

disprove, I think that that would run into problems with 

this Court's due process -- case law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, regardless of who 

proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the

judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent 

determination that he did not use a firearm could be 

left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?

 MR. LANNET: I think it would be very likely 

if this Court looked at this State's interpretation of 

the statute and found that the -- that the judge had no 

authority to impose the greater sentence?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see a dime's worth 

of difference between that and Apprendi.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How are you to prove these? 

I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why. 

Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time 

figuring out why. If you have an actual case and you 

have to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the 

evidence that although you want to say that your client 

did neither of these things, that if he did do them, in 

fact they were just one thing and weren't separate 

things? I mean are you prepared to go into all that 

detail in front of the jury?

 MR. LANNET: Well, again I think there would 

be a question about whether that would be proper, if 

that would be in fact shifting an element over to the 

defendant to disprove. I think that that would 

create --

standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that 

it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to 

the jury.

 MR. LANNET: Yes, sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So I wonder if you 

are prepared to put all those facts before the jury, 

say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my 

defendant who did it.

 MR. LANNET: Well, actually, Your Honor, a 

decision affirming the Oregon Supreme Court at this 

point would have little impact in Oregon. In response 

to Blakely, the Oregon legislature enacted a statutory 

scheme that gave back that enhanced sentence -- gave a 

procedure by which they go to the jury, and it's either 

-- and in a bifurcated proceeding that's ---

JUSTICE BREYER: That way, you have to 

have two --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Booker/Fanfan as well, as 

adopted, right? I mean that was what the dissenters in 

Booker/Fanfan would have --

MR. LANNET: Yes. Correct.

have to be a bifurcated proceeding?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there historic evidence 

that bifurcated proceedings were required before 

Apprendi?

 MR. LANNET: No, but I think that this is 

just a development of changing legislative choices in 

identifying facts. I think Apprendi articulated the 

functional path to determine the scope of a jury 

trial guarantee when the State attempts to relegate a 

fact to a judge rather than a jury.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I get back to 

the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi. Is it 

-- is it your position that if the offense, based on all 

facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of 

30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could 

determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense, 

you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a 

problem under Apprendi?

 MR. LANNET: In Apprendi I am not sure 

that -- that -- I mean it's a question of whether all 

the facts have been found by the -- by the jury 

authorize the maximum punishment. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it does. All 

the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years. And if 

it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge. But 

I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't

interpose a jury between the defendant and the State 

with respect to every element, but only those elements 

that increase the punishment.

 MR. LANNET: Well, the potential penalty the 

defendant faces -- and I think that if the penalty of 

whether a gun is present or whether a gun is not 

present, assuming that that would be enacted by a 

legislature, I think that as long as -- I mean the core 

question in Apprendi has been is the judge imposing a 

penalty within the range authorized by the jury verdict.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The core question is is the 

defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a 

certain penalty if a particular fact is found.

 MR. LANNET: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the answer would be, 

yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't 

use a gun to get a lesser penalty. And once you bring 

in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it 

means that it has to be found by the jury.

 MR. LANNET: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in addition, it must be 

true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay 

restitution if the facts show that there was no money 

taken. And you needn't, by the way, convict the person. 

You can convict him without finding that.

So the same would be true of restitution. 

We would have another jury to decide restitution, 

another thing that has never been done; is that right?

 MR. LANNET: Well, if only because the 

legislative scheme in place doesn't give the court 

authority to impose restitutions based solely on the 

jury's verdict.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, couldn't impose 

restitution without making a finding as to how much 

money was taken. So I don't -- I don't -- I can't 

imagine the legislature --

MR. LANNET: The Oregon appellate court 

doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. The Federal 

courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply. 

Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug --

again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with 

another jury being impanelled to try the question of 

whether there was a car; is that right?

 MR. LANNET: If -- if it was a fact that was 

necessary for the punishment, I think that follows 

within the rule of Apprendi.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a punishment.

 MR. LANNET: Although in Apprendi there was 

a concern about elements being shifted from --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe not. Maybe it would 

just be an in rem proceeding. What about the -- what 

about the proceeding -- what about the determination 

that a person who is going to trial goes to an adult 

court rather than a juvenile court, the difference being 

the extent of the punishment? You are not entitled 

to -- a complete defense to the punishments that they 

could impose. Do you see where I am going?

 MR. LANNET: I believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure which of these 

things would actual follow from your rule and which 

wouldn't.

 MR. LANNET: I think legislatively that the 

general statutes would set the maximum penalty as being 

punished as an adult and the juvenile system would be a 

different type of system.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But they will say no one 

can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system 

unless the person is indeed a juvenile. Who makes that 

factual finding?

 MR. LANNET: Well, Your Honor, the bright-

line rule of Apprendi as it applies in the sentencing in 

this case is a question of what the judge can impose in 

a proceeding that was initiated --

from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind 

of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different 

from what they did apply, does that require us to depart 

as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of 

differences that you have listened to?

 MR. LANNET: I believe that this Court 

already has. For instance, in Greene, under common 

law a defendant who committed a capital offense was 

subject to the death penalty and it was only upon -- and 

the trial court would get to exercise discretion whether 

to impose it. The Arizona legislature identified those 

facts and said, we are not trying to shift elements to 

the jury, these were never questions for the jury, but 

rather we are only merely trying to guide the court's 

discretion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a rather 

broad question?

 MR. LANNET: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In Apprendi the opinions 

were rather lengthy and discussed precedents at great 

length. Justice Thomas's opinion was quite scholarly 

and I discussed a lot of old cases. If this case that 

we have today had arisen before Apprendi was decided, 

what case would you have supporting your position?

dealt with elements of the crime and that sort of thing.

 MR. LANNET: Yes. But this Court looked at 

that practice and decided that what was not at issue was 

the legislative identified elements as being found by 

the jury, rather the underlying concern, the core 

concern, the position that this Court thought that the 

framers wanted to enshrine in the Sixth Amendment is 

that the judge's authority to punish is both created and

limited by the factual findings of a jury.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if under the 

law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a 

determination of where the defendant should be sent, 

which facility, based on determination of which one has 

the most room. Is that a determination that has to be 

made by the jury?

 MR. LANNET: I believe that that -- that can 

be distinguished, because it was would be a 

determination not based on punishment and not to impose 

a punishment on defendant. However, if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if one was, you 

know, the most horrendous prison in history and the 

other was one of -- a country club?

 MR. LANNET: No, I believe this Court has 

repeatedly stated in -- in downstream like decisions 

after convictions that whenever someone was convicted of 

an offense and sentenced to incarceration by executive 

agency, you are subject to the policies of that agency 

and there may be certain due process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but here in my 

hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the 

sentence. It's just like you've got to, you know, make 

restitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are 

going to this place rather than that place.

MR. LANNET: Well, this Court has identified 

a bright line rule that it's not the particular of the 

fact whether it would be something that would be 

historically found by the jury, but rather a fact that 

functions to increase punishment. I think I have 

trouble with the hypothetical saying that the 

different -- the different classification is sent to a 

different institution is intended as a punishment and 

not within the operations of the -- of the incarceration 

institution overall.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lannet, if we agree 

with your position and let's say you are engaged by the 

Oregon legislature and they say to you: We don't want 

to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what 

can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying 

to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main 

rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the 

judge's discretion but we want to rein in that 

discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences 

going from one judge to another?

 They want -- they want to say, yeah, we 

wanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we 

want to install certain controls so that the trial 

judges will be operating more or less uniformly. How 

could they do that constitutionally?

MR. LANNET: I think they could do as they 

are doing in what this Court has decided is juries are 

finding those facts, and that a trial court does not 

have to impose a consecutive sentence. Rather --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The juries are find --

that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this 

trial of guilt?

 MR. LANNET: If ordering the bifurcated 

proceeding much the way the aggravating factors under 

Oregon's guidelines assumes everything handles in the 

wake of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is it? Do they do 

it in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?

 MR. LANNET: It falls into the condition of 

what is defined as offense-related or offender-related 

factors. I think that these would come in as offense 

related and probably be in the main trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where a defense 

attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.

 MR. LANNET: Well, this Court has observed 

repeatedly that -- that the right to a jury trial is one 

that can be waived, and so the defendants have the 

opportunity to not exercise those rights. This is just 

that -- it's a right for the defendant but it's a 

constitutional role that this Court has identified as

being the jury role in our system. It -- it both 

authorizes, gives the arbiter authority to impose 

punishment and also sets the maximum.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the -- what 

if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent 

unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior 

federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive 

to the federal sentence?

 MR. LANNET: Well, if that was -- if the 

Almendarez-Torres prior conviction exception is a Sixth 

Amendment issue, which the Court has stated that it is, 

then I believe that there would not be required a jury 

finding, much like if the legislature identified facts 

that would be reflected in the jury's verdict, or 

reverted back to the common law rule which gave the 

trial court authority to impose consecutive sentences 

merely on the basis of if there was a conviction. I 

think that the facts identified by the Oregon 

legislature here are quite different than what would 

qualify as the Almendarez-Torres exception. That 

exception -- the basis that it has if we rationalize 

consistence with the rule is that a fact of a prior 

conviction has already been established in accordance 

with the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. These are 

facts about the offense for which a consecutive sentence

is contemplated. So, these are facts about the event 

that is being litigated at that moment. And the Oregon 

legislature has predicated the greater penalty of a 

consecutive sentence on those facts, and precedence 

instructs that when the legislature does so, the 

defendant has a right to have a jury find that fact 

beyond a unreasonable doubt before the State can rely it 

on and impose that greater penalty.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Lannet, one of the --

or perhaps the driving force behind Apprendi was the 

fear of abuse by a combination of the charging power and 

the sentencing power. What abuse do you see if -- if 

you lose this case? What potential abuse?

 MR. LANNET: Well, I think that it would 

send a message to legislatures that they can enact 

statutory schemes that have -- that allow for many 

instances where consecutive sentences are authorized 

based on the facts and that those facts do not implicate 

a Apprendi role, and therefore is a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That it would --

MR. LANNET: Yes. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I didn't mean to 

interrupt.

 MR. LANNET: To set maximum punishment based 

on consecutiveness rather than, as they were doing under

the guideline system, by allowing a range and requiring 

facts to exceed that range.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They -- they would do by 

consecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they 

were trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was 

trying to do by the sentencing factors?

 MR. LANNET: I believe there's at least a 

great possibility of that, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any room for 

harmless error here? I mean, it seems to me patently 

obvious that both of the statutory conditions were fully 

satisfied. It was within -- put it within the 

discretion of the judge.

 MR. LANNET: Well, I think this Court should 

not find those errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt 

for several reasons: First, the State has the burden of 

proof that it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and 

has not attempted to do before the Oregon courts, the 

appellate courts; it has not done so before this Court. 

I think the Oregon Supreme Court necessarily concluded 

that this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, is there any doubt 

that he wanted to commit an offense twice?

 MR. LANNET: I think that praises an issue 

of statutory interpretation. I think that that is one

of the issues --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But statutory 

interpretation questions aren't for the jury.

 MR. LANNET: You are right, Your Honor, but 

they are the ones for the Oregon Supreme Court in this 

instance, and the Oregon Supreme Court narrowly 

concluded that the findings of the jury found -- did not 

establish the factual predicate to impose consecutive 

sentences; however, they did not go into a comprehensive 

analysis of what precisely those facts are, and in fact 

the State -- the Petitioner here is actively litigating 

the meaning of the statutory provisions at this point. 

So it really is unclear what precisely are the facts 

meant by this -- by the statutory terms.

 I think it would put this Court in a 

position to interpret the State statute in the first 

instance, and disagree with the Oregon Supreme Court's 

implicit conclusion, because it's under a State 

constitutional requirement and also this Court's 

requirement that it cannot reverse a lower court unless 

it concludes that an error is harmless beyond a 

reasonable doubt.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It held as far as the 

State constitution went, this is fine. It's only the 

Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from

doing this.

 MR. LANNET: Yes, I would acknowledge that 

there is no analysis in the written decision, and that 

is part of the problem because it didn't identify the 

particular facts and conduct a harmless error analysis 

for the benefit of this Court.

 However, the court heard this case with a --

in a consolidated argument with State v. Gray, in which 

it did address the State's harmless error argument and 

recognized that, in Washington v. Recuenco, this Court 

had said that a -- is subject to harmless error 

analysis.

 So, I think necessary in the Oregon Supreme 

Court reversing the lower court's decision is that 

conclusion that this error was not harmless beyond a 

reasonable doubt. And subsequent to this case, the 

Oregon Supreme Court decided State versus Hagburn -- and 

I have a citation for that, if you like. It's -- and 

that is identified -- it addresses the State's harmless 

error question. The citation is 345 Or. 161, and that's 

regional reporter 190 P.3d 1209. And in that case we 

had sexual offenses arising out of the same general 

factual scenario, where a young victim testified that 

she was abused in two different rooms on two different 

days, and the Oregon Supreme Court said there is no

factual default in our consecutive sentencing system 

that let -- the jury was not decided that this occurred 

during the same criminal episode or during a separate 

criminal episode. And in light of the vague testimony 

by the victim, they could not conclude that a jury would 

have found that.

 So I believe that the -- that to the extent 

that the Oregon court has analyzed the statute, that I 

think that it would -- it backs up the conclusion that 

it found this not to be harmless beyond a reasonable 

doubt.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One way of -- if you are 

right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon 

legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to 

the judge's discretion. However, before the judge makes 

a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of 

the following factors. That would be okay?

 MR. LANNET: I believe so, if that kind of 

statutory provision was interpreted like you are 

suggesting, that the court has authority based solely on 

the jury's verdict and is merely exercising its 

discretion and there is no requisite factfinding or the 

-- even the requirement to find a fact to impose a 

consecutive sentence, then I think it wouldn't praise an 

Apprendi issue.

JUSTICE SCALIA: No entitlement to a lesser 

sentence?

 MR. LANNET: No entitlement to a lesser 

sentence, Your Honor. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if it's subject 

to judicial review for judicial review for abuse of 

discretion?

 MR. LANNET: I believe so. I think that 

this Court has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't give 

you an entitlement to that, to the exercise of 

discretion that isn't abused?

 MR. LANNET: Not an entitlement that is 

based solely on the facts found by the jury's verdict. 

I don't believe it would.

 Ultimately, this case was just an 

application of the Apprendi rule. The State asked this 

Court to replace that bright-line functional rule with 

some yet unidentified criteria for identifying 

constitutionally protected elements. It hasn't really 

offered this Court with any suggestion of what those 

constitutionally protected elements are except to say 

that that fact at issue in this statute are not those. 

At a minimum the State asks for an exception to the 

Apprendi rule based on historical reasoning about an

allegation that this was only meant to control the 

discretion of the sentencing court and it didn't shift 

any elements. And that kind of argument was explicitly 

rejected in Blakely, Booker, and Cunningham. The Oregon 

Legislature authorized consecutive sentence as greater 

penalty only for offenses committed under certain 

factual circumstances. Those facts, not the jury -- not 

found by the jury -- increase the defendant's penalty 

from 7-1/2 years to over 28 years.

 Affirming the decision below would adhere 

the bright-line rule in Apprendi and it would preserve 

the jury's role in finding each fact that authorizes the 

maximum punishment. Thank you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Counsel, don't -- well, the 

case that I mentioned on my account. I'm thinking about 

it -- it's not going to make any difference.

which this -- the circumstances in which this Court has 

applied it so far. The Apprendi rule has been applied 

as a bright-line test for deciding when a sentence for a 

specific condition has satisfied the Sixth Amendment. 

And the way it operates is the rule itself tells us what 

are the necessary facts that the jury must find, and so 

there doesn't need to be a new rule to determine what 

are those constitutionally protected facts. The 

Apprendi rule does that for us by saying that any fact 

that exposes a defendant in a particular conviction and 

sentence to a greater penalty based on -- that -- based 

on a fact that the jury has not found, is the functional 

equivalent of an element if we had looked historically 

at what the jury's role was. And so, therefore, that 

additional factfinding, if it exposes the defendant to a 

-- a longer penalty, a greater penalty for a specific 

conviction, it must be found by the jury. And that is 

how the Court has applied the rule to this point.

 So all we are asking is that the Court 

clarify that that is the full scope of the Apprendi 

rule. And the reason for that is again, going back to 

what this Court said in Blakely, that the Sixth 

Amendment is only a reservation of jury power. And here 

what we have here is something that is entirely a 

judicial determination -- that historically has always

been a judicial determination -- and the only overlay we 

now have is a legislative effort to regulate that 

judicial authority through the mechanism of requiring 

factfinding.

 It's something that the legislature often 

does, is to try to regulate judicial discretion by 

requiring factfinding and by limiting the kinds of facts 

the judge may consider. And that's what is being done 

in this case without removing anything from the purview 

of the jury. And so we would ask that this Court 

reverse the Oregon Supreme Court. Thank you.
