 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-604, Union Pacific Railroad v. 

The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.

 Mr. Ballenger.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BALLENGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Section 3 First (q) of the Railway Labor Act 

says that the findings in an order of the division shall 

be conclusive on the parties, except that the order of 

the division may be set aside for one of three specified 

reasons. As a matter of plain dictionary meaning in 

this context, "except" means that there are three and 

only three exceptions to the otherwise conclusive nature 

of these awards.

 In the Sheehan case, this Court explains 

that the dispositive question is whether the parties' 

objections falls within one of the three reasons 

specified within the statute. This Court explained that 

the statutory language means just what it says and that 

a contrary conclusion would ignore the terms, 

purposes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the circuit 

court did things in an unusual order. Instead of 

reaching the statutory question, it reached the 

constitutional question, in par, because it viewed the 

two as intertwined.

 Why isn't its judgment that there's a 

statutory violation what's at issue before us, because 

that's what they said?

 MR. BALLENGER: Well, Your Honor, it 

certainly would be this Court's prerogative and 

appropriate for this Court to choose to reach the 

statutory ground first, but we think that the 

Respondents have no viable claim under the statute, and 

so then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not?

 MR. BALLENGER: Their only claim under the 

statute is under the second statutory ground of review 

for an award that fails to confine or conform itself to 

the board's jurisdiction. An arbitrator's 

jurisdiction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. It's an award that 

is contrary to the act.

 MR. BALLENGER: But, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the --

MR. BALLENGER: They -- they have never made

that argument, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I saw it in their 

brief to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit analyzed 

the requirements of the act and of circular one and said 

the board's ruling is not based on those.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, on -- on page 5 

of their brief to the Seventh Circuit, they waived any 

argument based on that first statutory ground of review. 

There was a first count in their petition for review 

that was based on that statutory ground, and on page 5 

they renounced it.

 The only --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's the same argument --

it's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and 

the words in the APA are "arbitrary, capricious, abuse 

of discretion," so somebody who has an unfair procedure 

says it violates those words.

 MR. BALLENGER: Well, if --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't really see that 

it's any different, except we normally go to those words 

before we would decide a due process question. It's the 

similar kind of question. Why wouldn't we do the same 

thing here?

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, I think that 

there is an important difference. The first ground of

review under the act provides review for violations of 

the plain terms of the RLA itself. The second ground is 

for an act in excess of jurisdiction, which the lower 

courts have correctly understood to be a reference to 

this Court's Steelworker trilogy standard of review for 

labor arbitration generally. An arbitrator's 

jurisdiction is to interpret and to apply the parties' 

agreement and the relevant arbitral rules. An 

arbitrator exceeds his jurisdiction if but only if, 

under this Court's well-settled case law, his decision 

isn't even arguably construing or applying the relevant 

principles, and this decision clearly satisfies that 

standard, Your Honor.

 I would urge the Court to look at the 

board's decision in this case, and one of the five 

appears at pages 65 -- 65a to 72a of the petition 

appendix. The relevant reasoning starts on 68a to 71a. 

The award contain five pages of careful reasoning by the 

board. The board says that, quote: "We carefully 

studied the arbitral and judicial precedents cited by 

both parties in support of their respective positions"; 

and that "An evidentiary process after the appeal to 

this board would have been contrary to the procedural 

requirements contained in circular 1, as well as the 

weight of arbitral precedents supporting the carrier's

position."

 Well, what are those requirements? Section 

301.2(b) of circular 1 expressly says that, quote: "No 

petition shall be considered by any division of the 

board unless the subject matter has been handled in 

accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor 

Act," which includes the statutory requirement that a 

conference must have occurred. The board has reasonably 

understood that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, just to be --

do you -- do you contest the question of whether there 

was conferencing?

 MR. BALLENGER: It's a complex question, 

Your Honor. In the arbitration, Union Pacific went --

when this issue came up, Union Pacific went back to its 

records and determined that it had proof in its own 

records that two of the five cases had been conferenced. 

And so we essentially conceded that point in the 

arbitration.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You conceded that there 

was conferencing?

 MR. BALLENGER: We didn't contest that point 

in the arbitration. Of course, the arbitrators 

correctly determined that it was irrelevant.

 As to the other three, the -- Union Pacific

did not have in its files the paperwork that it would 

expect to see there if conferences occurred. So --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure that answers 

my question.

 MR. BALLENGER: Well, we took the position 

in the arbitration that we don't know for sure whether 

conferencing occurred and that it's Respondent's burden 

to prove it, and that the proof that they proffered in 

the arbitration was not convincing and sufficient to 

satisfy their burden. We think that constitutes 

contesting the issue in an ordinary legal sense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you didn't contest it 

in two. Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a 

conference.

 MR. BALLENGER: In two cases, that appears 

to be correct, Justice Ginsburg. But, of course, the 

board properly determined within its discretion that 

that fact is not relevant because the board enforced its 

procedural rule that the evidence of conferencing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the board can 

make rules of procedure. It can't make rules of 

jurisdiction. The dismissal of all these petitions was 

for want of jurisdiction.

 Now, if the board has no authority to set 

its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress

has that authority, not the board -- then it is required 

to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it. So 

why isn't that the very first question that this Court 

should deal with?

 The board threw these cases out for want of 

jurisdiction. Whatever the failing was, it was not and 

could not be jurisdictional because the board has no 

authority to describe its own jurisdiction.

 MR. BALLENGER: But Your Honor, the 

board was -- I think the board is entitled to mean 

different things by the word "jurisdiction" than perhaps 

an Article 3 court would mean. This Court often means 

many different things when it uses that word.

 What the board held was that the -- under 

the language of circular 1 and the weight of arbitral 

precedent the board cannot consider information that is 

not included in the parties' initial submissions. The 

board has understood for a very long time, consistent 

with the language of circular 1, like Section 301.2(a), 

that it is an appellate body that makes decisions on the 

basis of a record that is before it, that was organized 

on property and presented by the parties in their 

initial submissions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say this is just a 

mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board

saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle 

this?

 MR. BALLENGER: The substance -- I think it 

can -- you can get tied up in the word "jurisdiction" in 

a way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be.

 What the board held was that the confluence 

of the procedural rules, specific procedural rules, in 

circular 1 established two propositions: First, that 

the board cannot consider a matter unless conferencing 

in fact occurred; and second, that the only evidence 

that the board is ever allowed to look at under its own 

procedural rules is the evidence that is in the initial 

submissions. If you put --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you dispute 

what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the 

board, even when there has been no conference, let alone 

no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed 

proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then 

the board will pick up?

 MR. BALLENGER: That -- we don't contest 

that, Justice Ginsburg. But, of course, this isn't 

ordinary agency adjudication of the sort conducted under 

the APA, where the board has to stand behind as an 

entity every decision that is made by any panel.

 This is a peculiar sort of agency-supervised

arbitration, and it's perfectly appropriate in this 

context for two simultaneous panels of the board to 

reach different interpretations of the same language. 

And a Court really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's true generally, 

but if the board believes that as a matter of law it 

can't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for 

excusing a failure to include something in the record 

because, in its own language, we can't do it, the law 

doesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to 

consider matters outside the record, we don't apply 

normal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other 

rules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to 

immediately raise a defense like you could have done and 

waited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest 

that the board is not reaching -- merely resting its 

decision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its 

decision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it 

of jurisdiction to hear the case?

 MR. BALLENGER: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. First of all, this Court squarely rejected in 

the Sheehan case itself the suggestion that there is 

independent judicial review just because a question of 

law is at stake. That was the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but that -- this is

not merely a question of law. This is a question of 

jurisdiction: Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?

 MR. BALLENGER: There is no question, no one 

has ever disputed in this case, that the board was 

entitled to hear this matter.

 For instance, the question of arbitral 

jurisdiction, no one has ever disputed that this Court 

-- that this dispute was properly before the board. The 

board resolved it. The board simply resolved it on 

procedural grounds. And the explanation that it gave 

was that considering material outside of the initial 

submissions would be contrary to circular 1 and to the 

weight of arbitral precedent directly on the point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I am looking at the 

decision and they are all identical in this respect. 

The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of 

the remaining procedural or substantive issues 

associated with this claim.

 "No jurisdiction," that sounds like they are 

saying: We have no authority to consider anything about 

this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof 

of the conference.

 MR. BALLENGER: Again, Your Honor, I think 

the important point is that the board is not required to 

use the word "jurisdiction" in precisely this sense.

There is no question that the board has jurisdiction 

over this dispute. It is a minor grievance under the 

Railway Labor Act within the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't you think there is 

a big difference between the adjudicator saying:  I 

could, but I choose not to because there is no reason 

for your failure, from: I won't because I can't.

 MR. BALLENGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are -- those are 

two very different concepts.

 MR. BALLENGER: They're -- they certainly 

are in an Article 3 court, Your Honor. But this Court 

has said many, many times that the word "jurisdiction" 

is a word of many meanings, too many meanings.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- could you go 

back for a minute? I mean, this reads as if it's very 

complicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and 

that's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not 

such a hard case. Basically, there is a statute filled 

with words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to 

interpret that statute as meaning that the board should 

have fair procedure, not unfair procedure.

 Now, if you are willing to make that giant 

step, the remaining issue in the case is whether the 

procedure here was fair or unfair. And the Seventh

Circuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains 

why it was unfair. And the reason basically it was 

unfair is because no one in his right mind previous to 

this case would have thought that you should fill up 

your brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to 

contest. And after this case, the board said: By the 

way, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional 

facts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since 

you didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give 

you a chance to do it now.

 Okay? So I read that. I thought, is there 

something wrong with that? And then I thought I'd ask 

you, because you would know.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BALLENGER: I think that there are 

several things wrong with it, Your Honor, starting from 

the premise that the statute guarantees in all instances 

procedures that are, quote unquote, "fair" in an 

untethered sense.

 This statute guarantees specific procedural 

rights, which if you put them together do guarantee fair 

procedures. But it doesn't guarantee fairness in the 

abstract. So what you have to look at are whether the 

specific procedures that are guaranteed by the statute 

were complied with, and they were.

Now, taking a step back, even if we are 

going to talk about what is fair and unfair, there is 

absolutely nothing unfair about what happened here. As 

the board explained, referencing its own prior 

precedents and the plain language of the regulations 

that are governing, the Respondents clearly were on 

notice that they had to do this.

 Several prior decisions of the board had 

dismissed grievances for precisely the reason that there 

was no evidence of conferencing in the on-property 

record. That is if you look at page 40 of the joint 

appendix 18679 from the first --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any -- is there 

any rule describing how one has to get this into the 

record? It's just-- how -- what would have been the 

proper way to prove that conferencing occurred?

 MR. BALLENGER: As the board has explained 

in prior cases, the ordinary method of proving that 

conferencing occurred is that the last exchange of 

correspondence on the property between the carrier and 

the union, references the conference that had occurred 

and what happened. And then both parties or -- or 

the -- the union use that exchange of correspondence 

to -- in their initial submissions to the board pursuant 

to section 301.2(a), which requires, consistent with the

text of the statute itself, that every submission of the 

board will include, quote, "A full statement of the 

facts and all supporting data bearing on the dispute."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't refer to 

conferencing, does it?

 MR. BALLENGER: A full statement of -- of 

all of the facts and supporting data, which includes 

conferencing. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Implicitly includes con --

not expressly includes conferencing.

 MR. BALLENGER: Well, that's how the board 

has understood it, and, of course, the board is entitled 

as an arbitral body to interpret its own rules.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.

 MR. BALLENGER: Within the enormous 

discretion that this Court has established in the 

Steelworkers trilogy standard of review, which is that 

as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or 

applying the appropriate principles, his decision has to 

stand. There is no real question, I think, if you look 

at the five pages of careful reasoning and the expressed 

text of Circular 1 here that this -- this is an 

exemplary arbitral award. The arbitrators were careful, 

they were construing and applying the relevant 

principles. And this Court has said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's going against 

another panel that says, not only you don't have to have 

the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are 

not going to throw you out.

 Now, there is different panels, but it is 

the same board. Why shouldn't the grievants here say, 

we don't understand this? It's conceded there was a 

conference, at least in two of the cases. Our buddies 

didn't even have a conference and this same board, a 

different panel, allowed them to cure it. And I can't 

cure it now. That is the height of arbitrary behavior 

by the board, it seems to me.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, exactly the same 

thing happens to litigants in courts all of the time. 

Three identically situated litigants go to three 

different trial courts in the same State with identical 

claims under the same statute and they present those 

claims and they get three different answers from the 

State trial courts. That is not a violation of due 

process. Sometimes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not -- I'm not 

talking about due process. I'm talking about conformity 

with the act, the act's requirement. I --

of the Railway Labor Act scheme that different -- each

panel of the board is its own discreet interpretive 

universe and is to be judged by the Federal courts 

according to the standards set up in the statute. It 

will happen that boards -- that panels disagree about 

the proper resolution of an issue. That's happened --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So does the board as a 

whole apparently, because I am looking at the 

instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the 

parties, when you are going to make a submission don't 

include unnecessary documents, and among things don't 

include things that aren't in dispute --

MR. BALLENGER: Three things about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- like letters 

requesting conferences.

 MR. BALLENGER: Three things about that, 

Your Honor. First of all, that instruction sheet 

doesn't apply here at all. It applies only when the 

parties get together beforehand and agree to file a 

joint -- a joint submission to the board, so that they 

really have talked about what is in dispute and what 

isn't. It wasn't even promulgated until after the 

submissions in this case were made.

 And it's not clear how the board is going to 

understand that language. It doesn't say that the 

parties can omit evidence of conferencing. It says they

can omit, if they don't dispute it, letters requesting a 

conference.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It must be what they think 

of as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that 

they already had promulgated. The rule and the statutes 

say, the rule says you have to include all known 

relevant argumentative facts. So if the circular says 

we mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an 

argument about.

 And then the statute says, a full statement 

of the facts bearing upon the dispute. And the circular 

and then this document say we mean a full statement of 

facts that somebody might think have something to do 

with an argument that people are having.

 And, so, only after this case did the board 

say, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that 

nobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever 

disputed or seems to.

 Now, what's -- what's the response to that?

 MR. BALLENGER: Again, Your Honor, there is 

nothing unique or new about what the board did here. 

The board has done this before.

 Now, as to the circular, it remains --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm right in `stating what 

they did? Is my statement of what they did, which was

meant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and you are going to 

say, that's right, that's the correct statement of what 

happened?

 MR. BALLENGER: No, I'm -- I'm disagreeing 

with the -- the characterization that this is the board 

saying, we're going to make up a new rule that we've 

never applied before. That's not what happened here. 

The board said that the weight of arbitral precedence 

supports the carrier's position.

 Now, as to the -- the instruction sheet, it 

remains to be seen how the board is going to interpret 

that. And in an appropriate case, a court, if they 

interpret it in a manner that was wholly arbitrary and 

without reason and would violate the Steelworkers 

trilogy arbitral standard of review, then of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the board is telling 

people, I will go back a sentence: "Representatives may 

wish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or 

irrelevant to the disposition of the dispute."

 I mean that -- that seems to me is trapping 

people, if the board says, please don't dump on us 

unnecessary paper.

case could have legitimately relied on that instruction 

sheet, whatever it means. And the -- the board has not 

yet construed what it's going to mean. But it doesn't 

by its own terms apply here, because a joint submission 

was not made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then if -- then a person 

following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice 

because if you don't put in every document, if you don't 

put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to 

be out and never have your grievance heard.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, in an 

appropriate case, if a board panel interpreted that 

language in -- in a manner that would be inconsistent 

with something that that panel then did, then there 

might be an inherent conflict that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do I understand you to say 

that that provision was not applicable here anyway?

 MR. BALLENGER: It's not applicable at all, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side contest 

that?

 MR. BALLENGER: Not that I am aware of. 

It -- it only applies in the case of joint submissions, 

and it was not promulgated until after the submissions 

here were filed. So no one could legitimately rely on

that instruction sheet.

 And in any event --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They are not relying on 

it as applicable in this case. They are relying on it 

as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the 

parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.

 MR. BALLENGER: Well, the board obviously 

does not consider evidence of conferencing unnecessary, 

Your Honor. It has held for a very long time, going 

back, I think, 40 years to Award 18679 at least, that 

evidence of conferencing is essential to the board's 

consideration of any dispute under the terms of the 

statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some panels of the board. 

Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.

 MR. BALLENGER: That's right, Your Honor. 

But an arbitral decision does not violate the 

Steelworkers standard of review simply because other 

arbitrators disagree.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a decision on the 

merits. Here we are talking about a threshold barrier 

to even get your case heard. And that is being decided 

differently by different panels.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, this Court has 

made clear that issues of procedural arbitrability,

threshold conditions to arbitration, are governed by the 

same standard as merits issues in arbitration. In the 

Misco case, for instance, there was a question of 

evidence, and the arbitrator refused to consider certain 

kinds of evidence. And this Court said questions of 

procedure are for the arbitrator.

 In John Wiley v. Livingston, which is in 

many ways very similar to this case, it involved a 

procedural precondition to arbitration that the parties 

have to meet in conference prior to beginning the 

arbitration. And the question in John Wiley & Sons, was 

whether that precondition of conferencing should be 

waived on the grounds that on the facts of that case it 

would be futile. And the party -- one party tried to 

get a court to intervene on that question, because it 

could have precluded the arbitration entirely. And the 

Court said that procedural questions arising out of the 

arbitration and bearing on its disposition are for the 

arbitrator, not for a court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question. 

I may have an incorrect impression about it. Is the --

the thing that's at issue is whether or not conferencing 

occurred. Is it also important to know what happened at 

the conferencing? You may not know this. Is the -- is 

there some sort of -- of factual description of the

negotiations that took place during conferencing an 

important part of the submission?

 MR. BALLENGER: Not ordinarily, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the only -- the only 

importance is to just to establish the fact that there 

was a conference?

 MR. BALLENGER: It was very important to the 

congressional plan and so it's written into the statute 

that the parties make one last effort to settle these 

grievances before it comes to the board. That is a 

precondition of the board's consideration of any 

grievance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in two cases you 

concede that that condition was met, that there was a 

conference?

 MR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we are not even 

talking about a conference requirement. We are talking 

about a pleading rule, how you plead. Everybody 

concedes that the conference occurred in two cases.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's how you plead that.

procedural rules. And the board has a procedural --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can we -- I'm 

sorry.

 Let's assume that in a published opinion 

there are two procedural defaults. One, the union does; 

the other, the railroad does. The board says, you know, 

I am resolving this dispute.  I'm not forgiving the 

union's procedural default, but I will forgive the 

railroad's procedural default, because they're an 

important lifeline business for America and we've got to 

make sure that they're protected at all costs, and union 

members are just not important enough to that scheme.

 MR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, in that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In your theory, there is 

no due process violation in that case? They have heard 

the arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to 

make your point about the procedural default. They are 

announcing a new rule. It's okay. So what's wrong with 

that?

 MR. BALLENGER: That case would be 

reviewable, Your Honor, and properly so under the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under what theory?

 MR. BALLENGER: -- statutory ground of 

review for exceeding jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why?

MR. BALLENGER: Because in that case the 

arbitrator is not even arguably construing or applying 

the rules; he is dispensing his own brand of industrial 

justice, as this Court said in the Enterprise Wheel and 

Car case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, point me to any 

rule, that --- you know, anybody could point to a rule 

and says it commands a result. They -- there are rules 

here that say disputes should be submitted to the board 

and resolved. And they are resolving the dispute, the 

dispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you 

didn't.

 MR. BALLENGER: But every -- every 

adjudicative body has to have the ability to set and 

enforce procedural rules governing its procedures.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they can do that. 

That's what -- that's what the circuit said.

 MR. BALLENGER: In the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could have passed a 

rule that told people, warned them, and said this is a 

procedural rule we are going to apply.

them together give at least fair warning of --

interpretation of rules that don't command a result 

become improper, outside the board's jurisdiction? 

According to you, never.

 MR. BALLENGER: Under the -- under the 

Steelworkers standard of review for arbitral decisions, 

there will be a point at which the board's 

interpretation isn't even arguably grounded in -- in the 

rules, and it will be reviewable. As a matter of 

constitutional due process, which is what we are here 

talking about today, there probably is no point outside 

of the substantive interpretation of a criminal statute 

where that kind of interstitial gap-filling or 

interpretation could be unfair. It happens to litigants 

all of the time that they come to a court and are 

surprised by how a court resolves a disputed procedural 

question.

Respondent would like to stress is that we are not here 

reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract 

or here under the review standards set by Steelworkers 

trilogy. We never received an interpretation of the 

contract, and by that I mean the contract in any 

aspect -- procedural rules of the contract, substantive 

rules of the contract. No contract interpretation for 

these five engineers. And the reason that the 

Respondent urged both a statutory and due process 

violation is that without any interpretation of the 

contract, these five cases were dismissed invoking 

Circular 1, Code of Federal Regulations, as the basis, 

and denying these five engineers any determination of 

their contract claims.

 They never got to what the Railway Labor Act 

with its mandatory arbitration procedure promised the 

engineers and the carriers: a resolution of their 

contract claims for the purpose of industrial peace.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it didn't -- it didn't 

promise them that categorically. There were certain 

things they had to do, right? One of which was to have 

conferencing, and in three of these cases they didn't. 

So that promise didn't extend at least to those three 

cases. And in the other two, where there was 

conferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act

would have to, for the adoption of procedural rules. 

And the procedural rule here, according to the 

arbitrator, required the submission of that evidence 

of -- of consultation with the complaint, which didn't 

happen.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I respectfully 

disagree. These cases -- the panel never said that the 

three cases were not conferenced. Union Pacific has not 

said that these three cases were not conferenced. The 

panel said that, no matter how convincing the evidence 

that these other three cases were conferenced, that all 

five cases were conferenced, it would not consider that 

evidence because it was not attached to the original 

submission.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you say that all 

five were -- were conferenced? Is that your position?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, absolutely. We have 

correspondence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we have rules 

like that -- we have rules like that all the time. No 

matter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't 

included in the question presented, we say you can't 

raise it. This is just a rule like that.

conferencing in -- in the record at a particular time. 

You didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact 

that on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not 

an adequate challenge to the procedural rule.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, that would be 

true if there was a rule that required these documents 

to be attached to the original submission. There is no 

such rule. 301 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there is 

now? In other words, this is -- rulemaking by 

adjudication is not unheard of.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Rulemaking by adjudication 

is not unheard of, Your Honor. But this is not 

rulemaking by adjudication because this particular 

panel, which is an arbitration panel, a division, it's 

five members, it's a division of the adjustment board, 

has no power to make rules. Congress in section (v) of 

Section 153 of the act delegated the rulemaking power 

under this act on a one-time basis. In fact, it put in 

the dates. It had to start in June 1934 and be done in 

19 -- October 1934. That is the only power that this 

34-member adjustment board has to make rules.

 A panel has no power delegated to it by the 

Congress under this act, and the act is very specific, 

because Congress --

think that was where the board erred, in requiring 

conferencing?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: It is in Section 152, which 

is not a statute, by the way, that the NRAB administers.

 We are not disputing that we have to prove 

conferencing. We're happy to prove it. We have 

evidence of conferencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- can 

the board adopt procedures about how you go about 

proving conferencing? You say there is no rule because 

there wasn't a rule adopted in 1934. There is a rule 

that there has to be conferencing. Does that mean that 

at any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by 

the way, there was conferencing? Or can the board say, 

this is how you go about establishing it?

is to facilitate the purpose of the act, which is to get 

a contract interpretation.  We have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can -- the 

board can never have a rule that says, you have to 

establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the 

first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days? The fact 

that all that has to happen under the act is that there 

be conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way 

you want, at any time you want?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: No, you're not. Your Honor, 

you are not free to establish it any way you want. You 

have to have relevant evidence that the conferences 

occurred, relevant probative evidence that it is not 

prejudicial. The only rule that has been cited here for 

keeping this evidence out is 301.5, and that is at page 

50 -- 62a. And it is the rule that the Seventh Circuit 

focused on, and it describes what should be in the 

original submission. And it says, if I may quote part 

of it, at 62a, the Court can read along with me: that 

"Under the caption 'position of employees,' the 

employees must clearly and briefly set forth all 

relevant argumentative facts, including all documentary 

evidence submitted in exhibit form quoting the agreement 

or rules involved, if any; and all data submitted in 

support of employees' position, must affirmatively show

the same to have been presented to the carrier and made 

a part of the particular question in dispute."

 That rule is referring to the investigative 

process as to whether -- for example, one of the 

engineers ran a red light, it's alleged. So we are 

going to argue about that. They put on testimony. We 

have witnesses. There is cross-examination. And then 

the investigative officer makes a decision about whether 

that's going to be put in the record.

 The conference is an informal phone call. 

It's not specified in the collective bargaining 

agreement. There is nothing in the collective 

bargaining agreement about it. But it's an informal 

phone call that takes place after the whole contract 

grievance procedure has been exhausted, and then, 

before, it can be 30 seconds -- you know, Charlie 

Ridenour, can call up Mr. Stone and say -- you know, can 

we settle this? No. We can't. Okay.

 That's -- that's a conference. That's all 

it is, and what has to happen under the Act and, 

unfortunately -- and it is unfortunate, we did not put 

in the joint appendix, Section 2, Part 6, 152, Part 6, 

of the Railway Labor Act, which describes what happens. 

The union has to send a letter requesting a conference.

have been describing evidence, but we've got letters 

about all of these conferences, saying, we want to have 

a conference.  Once that happens, that triggers a 

process. They have to specify -- both sides have to get 

together and specify a meeting take place.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where does 

it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a 

conference?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, it's in Section 2 of 

Part 6 of the Railway Labor Act. We did not cite that. 

It's in the statute.

 The conferencing, by the way, is in Section 

2 of the Railway Labor Act. The board and its power and 

procedures is in Section 3. Section 3 has no mention of 

conferencing whatsoever in it. There isn't -- the word 

doesn't appear in the section which describes what the 

board is supposed to do or the board's procedures.

 And it doesn't appear in the CFRs either. 

The CFR's has this rule, Your Honor, that says -- you 

know, trial type evidence has to be presented at this 

investigative hearing below. Why? Because it's an 

appellate court mand you don't want to get surprised --

you know, the union can't come forward in this case and 

say, well, we have a surprise witness that shows 

Mr. Smith didn't run the red light.

I mean, that's just out of bounds. It 

surprises. It's blind-siding. You can't do it. The 

Seventh Circuit said: Wait a second. This rule doesn't 

have anything to do of proof of whether this phone call 

occurred after the whole written record has been created 

below. There are no rules about this, and, given that 

there are no rules -- and given that the union -- and 

the panel says this in its opinion -- is waving before 

the panel -- you know, Mr. Neutral, we have letters --

you know, back and forth between the parties about the 

fact that conferences occurred, and they don't dispute 

that two of them occurred.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I still don't 

understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question 

about how the panels -- how these panels -- how the 

board, in your view, is supposed to go about making some 

sort of sensible procedural rules about establishing the 

that conferencing took place.

 They can't do it by rulemaking, and you seem 

to argue that they can't do it by adjudication, so 

what -- they can't do it at all? There -- this is just 

going to be chaos, that there is no way to establish a 

regular procedure to establish that there was 

conferencing?

question. I think the answer is that there are no 

procedures on this because it wasn't -- it's not part of 

the -- the process was set up to develop the trial type 

evidence -- you know, whether the red light was run or 

not.

 It wasn't set up to determine how 

conferencing occurred, and it's artificial to put the 

rulemaking in here. The Seventh Circuit said: 

Giving -- given the how and why of it, it should be done 

in a way that is least prejudicial to the parties.

 The Union Pacific could have raised this 

issue when we filed the notices. They didn't. They 

didn't because the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said, on that point 

in your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise 

the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time 

the union files its notice of intent to file a 

submission.

 What is -- what is the basis? You didn't 

give any citation for that. You say, ordinarily, that's 

what the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you 

are tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about 

conferencing.

 What -- what makes you -- what backs up this 

statement that, normally, carrier raises the absence of

conferencing as an impediment at the time the union

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, the answer is 

past practice. Although this is not a collective 

bargaining situation, we are not applying the 

contractor. That was the past practice. That's what we 

alleged. This case was to show --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So could the 

board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: The adjustment board could 

adopt a rule. That is the agency -- and it still 

exists. It has got offices here in Washington, D.C., 34 

members. They were given this explicit rulemaking power 

by Congress. They were delegated with the authority. 

If there is an agency out there that is entitled to 

Chevron type deference, that is the agency.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they do anything else? 

What do they do? What does the adjustment board do?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I'm not sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to get you in 

trouble, but I'm not sure they do anything.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear, 

you say it's established practice that the railroads 

normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a 

particular point, and you think the board is without 

power to say: Look. This is the established practice. 

You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going 

to consider your objections.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: No, no, Your Honor. Our --

our position is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. You mean 

that they -- the board can't do that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: We don't think that the 

board can or should do that. What we do think is that, 

if there is -- the rule that I just read from, 301.5, 

says that you raise relevant argumentative facts.

 Union Pacific, when the parties exchanged 

the submissions, did not say that there wasn't any 

conferencing. Now, their -- their comeback to that in 

the reply brief was, well, we didn't know you had not 

conferenced until we saw that you didn't have any 

evidence of it. I mean, that's just not -- slightly, in 

our view, disingenuous.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could they -- could they 

adopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go 

through -- do everything that is necessary prior to the

time of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very 

last minute and send in a letter saying: Oh. By the 

way, there was no conferencing; could they adopt a rule 

like that because it's just a big waste of everybody's 

time to leave it to -- to the last minute?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, in our view, the 

panel couldn't, but the adjustment board could, and the 

adjustment board comes out with these little procedures, 

like the one read here that -- which they say is not 

relevant, that says -- you know, let's have these joint 

submissions, let's keep evidence of conferencing out.

 They are trying to -- these submissions that 

come in for these arbitration cases are not to be 

believed. I mean, they are like six feet high. So 

there is a constant effort on the part of everybody in 

the process to pare down the submissions to what is 

actually in dispute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought, under the 

Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad 

deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: But, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That we would review 

only for whatever it is.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: This is not the Steelworkers 

trilogy. The Steelworkers trilogy is about private

arbitrators determining private contracts and 

determining the procedures under private contracts. 

They are -- they are applying the procedural rules of 

the contract. There is nothing like that here.

 We are here because a government-funded 

panel, under a mandatory procedure, funded by the 

government, was applying the Code of Federal 

Regulations, not rules that the parties agreed to 

themselves, so the deference that is given to -- by this 

Court to a private arbitrator applying private 

procedural rules that the parties agree to, and so on 

and so forth, isn't present here because this is 

governmental action. It is a governmental agency.

 Now, we can -- the AFL-CIO gets into an 

argument about whether it's a state action. But the 

bottom line is that these are arbitrators paid for by 

the government. The arbitrators are selected -- or the 

eligible pool is selected by the government.

 They are applying the Code of Federal 

Regulations to keep us from getting to any procedural 

rule or any substantive rule under a private collective 

bargaining agreement. That looks a lot like 

governmental action blocking the people from getting 

their -- resolution of their private contractual claims. 

That's why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the review -- the 

review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions 

pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the 

standard of review of that is different than private 

arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: It should be, and, in the 

hornbook sense, it is, the reality of it is, and that's 

true here. We can say it's de novo review. We can say 

it's a different standard than -- than Steelworkers or 

John Wiley, and this is not a John Wiley case.

 But the reality is you aren't going to get a 

court's attention, unless they did something that is 

actionable under the Steelworker trilogy, too. And the 

Steelworker trilogy has the Enterprise Wheel case, which 

says, if the arbitrator starts making up rules 

willy-nilly, dispensing "his own brand of industrial 

justice," not drawing their essence from the collective 

bargaining agreement or, in this case, the CFRs.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't think 

that this is that. I mean, if you say: Look. Here's 

the rule. You have got to file these things by this 

date, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial 

justice.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: But there is no such rule,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm saying that, if 

the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may 

challenge it as-- as violating due process because you 

didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't 

say that the board is imposing its own brand of 

industrial justice.

 That sort of seems, to me, goes to the 

merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than 

procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was 

hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and 

not the other.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, all I can say, 

in answer to that, is that there are governmental rules 

that have very specific procedures that are in place.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position 

was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that 

these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority 

for the board. I'm looking at something that says, 

"National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of 

Procedure, Revised June 23rd." That's put out by the --

the board, the one that you said that is --

MR. GEOGHEGAN: The adjustment board down 

the street. 34 members.

your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing 

in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the 

right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties 

to these disputes are obliged to follow.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that authority is 

vested only in the board, not in the panels.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Arguably, in the board.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how that could 

possibly be true. I can't imagine being an arbitrator 

and not being able to say: All right, you know, we are 

going to have a conference next Tuesday. I want you to 

have all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this 

particular point that we are going to discuss in by two 

days before.

 Can't do that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would not know how to run 

an arbitration without -- without establishing some 

rules of procedure.

happen here. If I may explain, there is --

of procedure.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: I -- well, Your Honor, an 

arbitrator can set rules of procedure within the 

parameters of what is allowed by the act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, all right. That's a 

little different.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: But the act itself, and the 

CFRs, are very clear that there is no requirement that 

this evidence has to be submitted in the original 

submission. And once the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're making sense. 

It says that, or it just doesn't address the question of 

whether they have to be included in the original 

submission? I mean, I assume there is no provision that 

says -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says 

the conferencing materials do not have to be included in 

the original submission?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: There is no CFR that says 

that the conferencing materials have to be in the 

original submission or the case is dismissed. There is 

nothing like --

none that says they don't have to be. In other words, I

take it that this is an issue that is simply not 

addressed by the CFR rules?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, in any specific way. 

I understand Your Honor's point, but the fact of it is 

that the record that you attach to the original 

submission is only about the relevant argumentative 

facts that are in dispute. That doesn't mean that 

that -- that there isn't other evidence in the record 

down below.

 What happened here, and this is different 

from all the other cases, is that the union came in and 

said: Oh, we've got evidence. And we've got evidence 

that relates even to correspondence between the parties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you are just 

disputing the validity or applicability of the rule. 

You don't want to comply with the rule. I mean, is it 

any different than saying: Look, okay, we've got this 

arbitration that is going to go forward. We are going 

to meet at 10:00 Monday morning. It is the first 

meeting. One side doesn't show up and then they say, 

well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at 

10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying 

that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't 

penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00 

Monday morning.

MR. GEOGHEGAN: I think that an arbitrator 

could penalize a party for not showing up. But the --

the fact of this is that there is no authority in the 

arbitrator to bar evidence of conferencing simply 

because it wasn't in the original citation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I take it your point is 

that there is a rule? It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b). If 

that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that 

would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by 

10. And that rule says you have to submit the 

argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you 

don't have to submit the facts that are not 

argumentative.

 I take it that that -- suppose that you are 

wrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that. I think 

maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong. Suppose 

they have loads of authority to make rules. Again, you 

have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did.

 In your research -- and the same question is 

really addressed to your fellow counsel. In your 

research on this, did you find any instance in which 

either a court or an agency does change a rule, and 

says: Now you have to say the date right underneath the 

caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk. 

Okay? They changed the rule. And they have every good

reason in the world for doing it. And then they apply 

it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about 

it, and then they won't let them change it.

 Now, is there any case at all which said 

that that was lawful? I can think of lots of cases that 

say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is 

unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in 

the world to make the rules. I have lots of cases like 

that. What I wondered is if anybody found a case along 

the lines that I just said.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: We did not, Your Honor, and 

the Wells case in particular, where there was no 

question that the rule was valid, was a case where the 

Fourth Circuit found a violation of due process because 

the parties did not have reasonable notice, or the 

carrier in that case did not have reasonable notice that 

it was the postage date that was the date for the brief, 

instead of the postmark.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you recall the 

situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer 

described, and we can debate about it, whether it's 

rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you 

would say that in the situation you described, it 

violated due process, right?

 JUSTICE BREYER: And because -- I mean, in

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said he did 

have rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict 

MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, you were asking 

me whether he could require the parties to show up at a 

certain time. I mean, there are certain rulings that 

are in the case. I don't want to get hung up on -- on 

rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's not get -- can I ask 

about argumentative facts? I frankly have never heard 

of a phrase like argumentative facts. You seem to think 

it means only those facts that are in dispute.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would be a 

pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the 

event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and 

you only write down the facts that are disputed and none 

of the facts that are agreed to.

 It couldn't possibly mean that. I would 

think that argumentative facts simply means facts 

relevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant

to the argument is whether you did the necessary 

consultation. But I don't know how you could interpret 

argumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in 

dispute. What kind of a statement of facts would that 

be?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, Your Honor, you may be 

correct in your view of it, but the parties have 

interpreted this as being the facts that are in dispute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. GEOGHEGAN: And remember, this is a 

procedure that is not about conferencing or proving 

conferencing, it is a procedure that -- about what 

happened at the trial.

 So when you are looking at that 301.5, you 

are looking at a rule that is designed to make clear to 

the arbitrator and the panel what it is that is being 

disputed, after the investigative hearing where the 

carrier superintendent signs off and says, you know, we 

are going to discharge this guy because he ran the red 

light.

party define --

the grievance know exactly which facts are in dispute at 

the time when they made the submission? Here, there's a 

dispute about whether there was a dispute about 

conferencing.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes. Well, that's because 

this particular rule is so focused on what happens at 

trial.

 Your Honor, if you look at the collective 

bargaining agreement and the trial-type procedures, they 

are elaborate. It is like a state court proceeding. 

There is not a neutral party. There is a carrier's 

officer behind it. But you have union representatives 

who are better than most lawyers, I must say, in terms 

of putting in the exhibits and evidentiary record and 

cross-examination. This is all transcribed elaborately 

in the transcript, so that it's like at the end of a 

trial. I mean, the parties know, at the end of a 

contested criminal or civil trial that may go on for, 

basically, all day, what the facts are that are in 

dispute.

 But at any rate, this is the regulation that 

was created in 1934, and it was not about proving 

conference --

a common-law adjudication method of developing new 

rules. And that there is precedent out there for 

dismissing these arbitrations because the conferencing 

was not established in the record at the time the 

proceeding started. Is this a reference to the -- to 

precedent, correct?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, this isn't a 

system of precedent. There is certainly no strict stare 

decisis here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that, 

but were there presidents that might well have put you 

on notice that you better get this in the record?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: No, Your Honor, not in or 

our view. I mean, the cases they cite are arbitration 

awards where the arbitrator says, looking at the whole 

record, not what was attached to the original submission 

-- there isn't a single arbitration award that says, we 

are only looking at the original submission and we won't 

look at any evidence that might have been in the record 

below and you want to add now. There isn't any case 

like that. So -- but there are only a handful of these 

cases that they cite in the joint appendix.

 Your Honor, there are probably 60,000, 

70,000 of these cases. They are not codified online.

dozen cases out there which were dismissed because there 

was the failure of the record to show that there was 

conferencing below?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: We do admit that, but we say 

that in our particular case, the record would certainly 

include or we would be allowed to supplement with the 

evidence from the --

that the record show it affirmatively is not supported.

they -- originally we passionately objected to this, and 

the -- and the neutral members said, oh, fine, you know, 

we will -- we will reconvene for -- we will reschedule 

this in three months, come back.

 So everybody came back with the evidence. 

Union Pacific came back with what -- I mean, they found 

out that, in fact, they have -- probably two of these 

cases had been conferenced, we came back with our 

letters, we said here it is, and -- and the neutral 

member said, oh, no, you don't understand, I didn't 

really want you to do this. So, you know, why -- why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you 

could submit that offer of proof at any time during the 

proceeding and the board would have to accept it?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: We think of it as relevant, 

probative evidence as to conferencing when the objection 

had not been raised at the time that these cases were 

conferenced, at the time that this --

MR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I'm afraid there 

is such a rule, and that is 301.5. And it says that the 

parties have to praise relevant argumentative facts in 

the original submission. That doesn't mean that it only 

has to be in the original submission, but there was only 

one submission here, and they did not raise 

conferencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to my 

earlier question is that you can submit that offer of 

proof at any time, and it has to be considered?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, any time that the 

objection is raised. If -- if it is not done in a way 

that prejudices the other party, the answer is yes. 

There is no rule that prohibits that.

 And the purpose of the Act, Your Honor, is 

to get the parties to have contract interpretations. 

And the way this was done -- the way these cases were 

dismissed without any hearing and what the Seventh 

Circuit called blind-siding and what the union 

dissidents said was gamesmanship is the kind of thing 

that should be of concern of this Court, because it 

really undermines the integrity of the arbitration 

process, and it's very important to keep that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you some 

questions about the common law that we are talking about

here.

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there also cases out 

there in which the record doesn't tell us whether there 

was conferencing, but nevertheless, the merits were 

decided?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, sure. I mean, but it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There are least six -- six 

or are there more than that?

 MR. GEOGHEGAN: I don't think that there 

are -- there are the cases that we cited where it turned 

out there wasn't conferencing and the arbitrator said go 

back and conference. I mean, you can step outside the 

hall and do it in 30 seconds. You know, it's a -- it's 

a statutory procedure that is not really part of this 

proof process that is set up by the collective 

bargaining agreement. Well, my time up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Geoghegan.

 Mr. Ballenger, you have three minutes 

remaining.

looking for are at pages 40 and 45 of the joint 

appendix, and also we would suggest that you look at 

first division award 23883, which is easy to locate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Were any of those 

decisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one 

panel?

 MR. BALLENGER: All these decisions are 

rendered by one panel. The board never sits as -- as a 

body.

 The Respondent suggests that the Steelworker 

trilogy standard that this Court has articulated for 

labor arbitration generally doesn't apply under the RLA. 

There is no authority for that, that many I am aware of. 

The lower courts have understood it the same way, and 

there is every reason to think that's correct. Congress 

was quite clear in the legislative history to the '66 

amendment that it anticipated that the standard of 

review under this statute would be the same as that 

applied in ordinary private labor arbitration. And, of 

course, the Sheehan case rejects the idea that there is 

some kind of special judicial review for question of law 

under the RLA.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there is a 

difference between governmentally ordered arbitrations 

and private contracts. In private contracts the parties

negotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the 

arbitrators then follow --

MR. BALLENGER: The difference, Your Honor, 

I believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when 

you have a procedural question, the question is what the 

parties would have wanted. Here the question is what 

Congress would have wanted, but there is no -- about the 

correct standards of review. But there is no reason to 

think that Congress wanted anything other than what the 

parties ordinarily want under this case law, which is 

for procedural questions to be resolved by the 

arbitrator.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it your position that 

if you go through the first phase and as everybody is 

walking out the two adversaries in the first 

investigative space say this is never going to be 

settled, this is the most important case in the history 

of this -- the railroad system. Let's go take it to the 

board.

 MR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they can't waive 

the grievance procedure, that they just can't go 

straight to you?

 MR. BALLENGER: That -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. The statute in section 2 Second requires a

conference. And Respondents argued initially in this 

case that the statute shouldn't be read that way and 

there should be an exception read in from section 2 

Sixth. That was rejected by the district court and they 

chose not to appeal it to the Seventh Circuit. It's not 

before this Court.

 Now, Respondent focuses a lot on section 

301.5 in its language about argumentative facts. I 

think that our interpretation here today of that 

language isn't ultimately the point. That this is a 

question for the arbitrators to resolve unless -- even 

if a court is convinced that the arbitrators committed 

serious error.

 But the more important maybe threshold point 

is that the arbitrators didn't say that they were 

resting their opinion just on section 301.5. They never 

invoked 301.5. They said circular one and the weight of 

precedent under the arbitration. And if this Court 

looks at section 301.2(a), which requires the parties to 

include all facts relevant to the dispute in their 

initial submissions, I think that resolves the 

question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we disagree with 

you. You say if the board was just plain wrong. If we 

look at the Act and circular one and say we can't find

what they said anywhere in there, does that doom your 

argument? Have they asked -- acted outside, has the 

board acted outside its jurisdiction?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer the 

question, counsel.

 MR. BALLENGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 The relevant standard is if the board is 

even arguably construing or applying the relevant rules 

and its decision stands, even if a court is convinced 

that the arbitrator committed serious error.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.
