 [10:14 a.m.]

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in 

No. 05-1056, Microsoft against AT&T.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May 

it please the Court:

 The limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent 

laws protects against the making, using or selling a 

patented invention within the United States. Section 

271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components 

of a patented invention within the United States and 

then simply ship them abroad for reassembly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, before you get 

into the merits I have a question, a preliminary 

question. I understand from AT&T's brief that there has 

been a stipulation entered into between the parties 

after the judgment below which preserved Microsoft's 

right to appeal and prescribed different dollar amounts 

that Microsoft must pay AT&T depending on the outcome of 

the appeal. Does that raise any, any muteness problem? 

Can you sort of wager on the outcome of an appeal that 

way?

MR. OLSON: No, I don't believe so, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose two parties 

just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a 

case or controversy, bet each other that the district 

court will come out one way or the other way in, in a 

trumped-up suit. Does that create a standing --

MR. OLSON: This is by no means a trumped-up 

suit. It's a very serious suit. The outcome, the 

judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not 

a matter of wager. It depends upon the decision of a 

matter of law of an interpretation of a statute of the 

United States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the 

same thing in the hypothetical I gave. It is a matter 

of wager, which way the Court will come out.

 MR. OLSON: This is an entirely legitimate, 

I submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal 

issue depending upon how a legal question is decided. 

The only thing that's been resolved is the amount that 

will be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of 

the appeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any, any 

precedent for that?

 MR. OLSON: It seems to me, Justice Scalia,

that it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases 

where there is -- someone pleads guilty in and 

preserving a right to appeal a certain issue. I don't 

have a case to cite to you but it strikes me as quite 

understandable that the parties might agree if the 

outcome of the legal question that the judge might 

decide is going to be X, then the consequence will be a 

liability for Y. If it's -- if it's of the opposite 

outcome, the outcome will be different. That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the amount were 

trivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this 

question?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think that if the 

amount --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then there would be a case 

with a controversy problem, I should think.

 MR. OLSON: I don't know what the Court 

might mean by the word trivial, Justice Kennedy, but 

this is a very significant major amount involved in this 

case. There is no question that the parties are very 

serious. It's a very significant legal question with 

respect to the interpretation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but is there a 

lot of money involved depending on whether you win or 

lose?

MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. OLSON: In this case, notwithstanding 

the limitation of in Section 271(f) that the components, 

there's -- liability of the components are created here, 

and reassemble the broad. The Federal Circuit held that 

foreign made tangible reproductions of computer 

operating code installed in foreign-made computers may 

be components which are deemed or essentially supplied 

from the United States, because copying is part and 

parcel of software distribution, and thus subsumed in 

the act of supplying. Under this ruling, U.S. companies 

may be held liable for patent infringement whenever 

their products are copied or replicated abroad. This --

the court of appeals decision and the position of 

Respondents requires reworking several words in the 

statute.

 The statute says supplied from the United 

States. The court of appeals said, well, it might be 

deemed supplied from the United States after it's copied 

abroad. The Respondent takes the words "such 

components" in the statute and reads them as not the 

same components.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, isn't one of 

the questions whether the software is really being

copied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the 

new manufacturer, or whether it's actually being 

supplied?

 MR. OLSON: It is being copied. There isn't 

any question that it's being copied, Justice Stevens. 

The stipulation which is in pages 44-A through 47-A of 

the petition appendix contains the words -- this is 

words to which respondent stipulated -- foreign-made 

copies replicated object code, foreign manufactured 

copies, foreign replicated object code. What happens, 

Justice Stevens, is that the golden master of the disk 

which contains the physical manifestation of the object 

code is read by a machine somewhere outside the United 

States, looked at and then copied onto another physical 

medium, either a hard drive or a disk. Many hard 

drives, many disks. Those foreign replicated physical 

tangible copies are then installed in computers and they 

become components of those computers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the master disk a 

component?

 MR. OLSON: The master -- well, AT&T has 

taken two positions on that. We --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your position?

 MR. OLSON: Our position is that it's not a 

component of the final product computers that are made

abroad. What is a component is a replication, a copy of 

a new hard drive or a new disk that's made a part of 

those computers which, without which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just the disk but not the 

information on the disk is the component.

 MR. OLSON: The information on the disk is 

of no use to the computer unless it's made into a 

physical machine readable document -- object.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- Mr. Olson, that 

is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what 

you call the object code appears in the -- in the 

computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with 

the master disk, and the object code is the critical 

component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the 

first question that you raised, whether digital software 

code, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be 

considered a component of a patent, patented invention?

 MR. OLSON: If I understand your question, 

Justice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way. AT&T has 

taken two positions. The most recent position is that 

it's the intangible object code, the series of 1's and 

0's, or instructions to a computer switch to be on or 

off, that is a component. They also took a position 

earlier in the case and which is referred to in the 

stipulation that it was the golden master, the physical

manifestation on the -- on a master disk that went 

abroad that was the component.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still would like to 

know your position. The golden disk is or is not a 

component?

 MR. OLSON: It is not a component --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But copies of the golden 

disk are or are not components?

 MR. OLSON: The copies, the physical 

manifestation on a hard drive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Physical manifestation?

 MR. OLSON: Our components of the foreign 

manufactured computers. Those components are not 

supplied from --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if you could, if 

you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components. Then 

if you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines. If 

you used for your disk the master disk for the last 

copy, then that would have been -- that would -- then 

the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last 

machine.

 MR. OLSON: If -- well, I think, if I 

understand your question, if you make -- and it depends 

upon where you make it, where you transfer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You make them abroad.

MR. OLSON: If you make it abroad, that --

and it's -- that is where the component is supplied 

from. Copies are made abroad. There's no question 

about that and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the disk, if the 

golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were 

used --

MR. OLSON: If the physical --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in a hardware, then 

that would be a component.

 MR. OLSON: If that physical golden disk 

were actually put into a computer and used without more.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm a little 

confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one 

method of getting the software into the new computers. 

And I thought it was the software which was arguably the 

component, not any physical manifestation.

 MR. OLSON: Well, that's why I said AT&T has 

taken two positions. Here's the position that they took 

in their brief before the court of appeals. Three 

decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively 

recognized software to be a physical and structural 

component of patented machines. The problem, Justice 

Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you -- what is your

view on whether or not software is a component?

 MR. OLSON: The -- if I may answer that by 

saying that people use the word "software" in two 

different ways. One of which, they use it as the 

intangible series of 1's and 0's. We submit that the 

correct way to understand the word "software" is the 

physical manifestation of that what is called source 

code, which is made into object code, which is made into 

machine readable code.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or at least the correct way 

to understand component.

 MR. OLSON: It is the correct way to 

understand the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the component then 

would be either a disk which is put into a computer or 

the portion of the hard drive to which the code is 

transferred.

 MR. OLSON: Yes. As I understand it, 

Justice Souter, and I think the stipulations make this 

clear, there's a reference in the stipulations to 

encoded transmissions but there's a -- but the parties 

also agree that's the same process as the golden disk. 

The golden disk is sent abroad. That is read by a 

machine and then the machine understands -- it's almost 

as if you were to read physically any other type of

document, read it to a machine. The machine understands 

what is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a 

disk or on a hard drive. Many copies are made in that 

fashion. They are installed in computers made abroad, 

sold to foreign purchasers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying that 

neither the source code nor the compilation are a 

component?

 MR. OLSON: Of the foreign? The language of 

the statute is the foreign manufactured product. Those 

are the computers that are sold abroad. It is our 

position that the only components that are in issue in 

this case are the physical manifestations of the object 

code on a hard drive or on a disk.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that neither the source 

code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the 

compilation is put on a disk?

 MR. OLSON: That's correct. And the -- the 

thing that's on the disk in the foreign --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems odd. I mean, 

Microsoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's 

the prettiest disk in the business.

 MR. OLSON: Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It says buy our program 

because the program means something.

MR. OLSON: But the program is nothing until 

made into a physical manifestation that can be made by 

the computer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What is patented? Is the 

physical object patented or is the software patented?

 MR. OLSON: The AT&T patent --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. OLSON: The '580 patent is a program, as 

I understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be 

married to a computer in order to be patented.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't patent, you know, 

on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?

 MR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There needs to be a device.

 MR. OLSON: An idea or a principle, two plus 

two equals four can't be patented. It has to be put 

together with a machine and made into a usable device. 

The bind that AT&T is in here is that the components 

that make the machines run that are produced abroad are 

not supplied from the United States. They are made in 

Belgium or Frankfurt or something.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That depends on what you 

consider the component. They define component as 

including the, what you've been calling the abstract.

 MR. OLSON: They have attempted, Justice

Ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways. They've 

said that it is a physical and structural thing, 

something that's on the golden master disk. And then 

they say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but 

that in the abstract never becomes a part of the 

computer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the Federal 

Circuit say? And I read the opinion a couple of times 

and it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the 

Federal Circuit was identifying the component as the 

object code itself or the master disk.

 MR. OLSON: Yes. I agree with you. The 

Federal Circuit was ambiguous, in part because there 

were two separate decisions. The court considered the 

component issue in the Eolas case and then when this 

case came along, said we've already decided the 

component portion of the statute; now we must decide the 

supplied from. So the language which the Federal 

Circuit used is a bit confusing. Basically what it 

said, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the 

act of copying. That means that any, any company 

sending a machine or a patented product abroad, that 

that machine must be copied in order to be mass produced 

abroad. It might be a pill. It might be a mousetrap. 

It might be a Buick. That exact identical copy if

replicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the 

patent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a patent 

on a biological organism and it was contained in a 

little vial, and you shipped it abroad. Just by doing 

nothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100 

different parts.

 MR. OLSON: If it reproduces itself, Justice 

Kennedy, somewhere outside the United States --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MR. OLSON: What you're suggesting is that 

there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold. 

It could be the same thing. If it's reproduced outside 

the United States by some laboratory outside the United 

States, then the components are not being sent from the 

United States for reassembly abroad.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this an artificial 

distinction in -- when you're talking about the making 

of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved 

in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time 

involved. But with, with software, the Federal 

Circuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive 

and fast to copy it that simply sending the information 

abroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of 

the golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies

overseas.

 MR. OLSON: I think there are three answers 

to that. Surely the patent laws cannot be determined 

according to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to 

replicate something. There has to be a line that makes 

some sense. Number two, it may be fast and efficient 

but there are certainly costs involved in taking the 

machines to do it. Number three, where would that take 

us? A design -- every product contains its own 

manifestation of its design. That would take us 

everywhere, because any product can be copied abroad. 

However -- and maybe there are going to be fast ways to 

produce other things. These are replicas, 

reproductions, copies. These are not such components 

that are supplied from the United States. If I may 

reserve the balance of my time? Thank you.

extension of normal territoriality principles that is 

designed to shore up the prohibition against actually 

making a patented invention in the United States, but it 

does not take the further and extraordinary step of 

applying United States law to the conduct of copying 

parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is 

properly the subject of foreign law.

 As a result, in the context of traditional 

manufacturing, for example, it has always been 

understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while 

companies cannot make parts in the United States for 

final assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it 

here -- they may make copies in a foreign country by, 

for example, sending the design to the foreign country 

or sending a specific part to the foreign country that 

can be copied there.

 That distinction between copying in the 

United States and copying in the foreign country has two 

critical dimensions. The first is that it protects the 

foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish 

the rules of competition that will govern companies that 

wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by 

copying their products abroad, assembling them there and 

selling them there.

that point, is that it enables United States companies

foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and 

selling parts abroad, subject --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, to the, to 

the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign 

nations that would have an interest in this, usually 

when that is so, hear from them and in this case there 

is a strange silence in that regard.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think that -- I can say --

a couple points I can make. One is, this case has, has 

been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to 

tie this to software on the grounds that software can 

easily be copied abroad, I think this case has been 

somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case. But in 

truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from 

anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was 

actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt 

that other nations would be quite concerned, like in --

in two ways.

 One is we have looked, not exhaustively but 

we have looked, and we have not been able to find a 

single other country that would apply its law in the 

circumstances if they were reversed. In other words if 

a German condition wanted to compete in the United

States subject to German law by making copies here, 

assembling them here, selling them here, Germany would 

stay out of that because it's the United States' 

prerogative. Also there are significant differences 

between the nations' patent laws. For software in 

particular, the United States is much more bullish on 

the patentability of software-related inventions than 

many other countries. But even for more mundane 

reasons, if we were talking about anything -- it could 

be that the foreign government doesn't think that an 

invention is particularly novel, it just disagrees with 

us about that, or it doesn't think there is sufficient 

advance in the prior art sufficiently inventive to 

warrant patent protection. And if the foreign country 

is going to make that determination regarding 

competition policy in its own borders, it's entitled to 

make that determination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about a 

domestic law question. One side is telling us it's the 

component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk 

or the object code. And the other side says this is 

just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template. 

Can a blueprint be patented? Can a mold be patented?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Not ordinarily. I mean --

I'm sorry.

JUSTICE BREYER: Copyright. Copyright. You

 MR. JOSEFFER: You can certainly copyright 

something like that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, but patent --

MR. JOSEFFER: Well the -- no, but the -- I 

think the most important point here is that the 

components of patented inventions do not have to be 

patentable. Many patented inventions are comprised of a 

bunch of parts where the parts themselves would not be 

patentable because say they were standard off the shelf 

parts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be a 

process patent.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, and we don't -- I mean, 

process patents, a process patent is a series of steps 

or acts for performing a certain function, such as 

turning rubber into a tire. We don't think process 

patents are relevant -- are, are covered by this statute 

for a couple of reasons. And it's not --

any copy of the same computer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in this case, you're --

but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or 

the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded 

instructions are transferred.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you accept that?

 MR. JOSEFFER: The United States view -- I'm 

not sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the 

United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is 

not a component of this invention because you don't need 

a blank disk to practice this invention. The -- the 

actual component is the physical substantiation, the 

physical copy of the software that's inserted into a 

computer and if you get a disk --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the disk 

plus the -- plus the coded instructions.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And again the coded --

the software could be on a disk or it could be on some 

other technology. It doesn't matter how it --

itself a component.

operating under the assumption that software is 

patentable? We have never held that in this Court, have 

we?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, but as I was saying 

before --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what should we do here? 

Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been

JUSTICE BREYER: If I were writing 

something, should I say on the assumption that it's 

patentable? Since the issue isn't raised?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No. I think, I think the 

reason that's not relevant here is that the patented 

invention in this case is not software. It's computer 

that has software loaded into it. And the components of 

a patented invention do not themselves have to be 

patented.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Ah, if you wrote it out, yes. 

If I wrote out a string of 1's and 0's I could copyright 

the strings of 1's and 0's that was -- that was written 

out on a piece of paper. But the -- in terms of what 

the component is here, the other things --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you, the point I 

don't understand when you say the -- the component is 

the disk that contains material, I understand that 

because here is a separate piece; it's a disk. You plug 

it in; it has the information on it. But then you say, 

if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the 

component. But the hard drive is not a separate thing 

like a disk. And when you say you put it on the hard 

drive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and 

offs. You have nothing there but the -- but the 

thought.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you call, you know, 

what? Is it a separate section of the hard drive? No.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, you could go later in 

and delete that software off the hard drive which 

confirms that the software does have a separate physical 

existence in there. But the main point is that the --

the software. The actual copy of the software. It 

doesn't matter if it's on a hard disk; doesn't mean it's 

on a disk; it doesn't matter if it's in the air in 

wireless transmission. It's just the physical copy of 

the software. And you could have a situation where 

there are multiple copies of that same component in a 

computer. One --

JUSTICE ALITO: If these -- if these 

computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows 

installed, the component is the electrons on the hard 

drive? Is that what, that's your position?

 MR. JOSEFFER: It's the physical embodiment 

of the software which in some instances is manifested by 

-- by those electrons. Now AT&T's contrary view is that 

the abstract code in the abstract is the component. The 

reason that can't be is that object code in the abstract 

is just a series of 1's and 0's. In theory I could 

memorize in my head or write down on a piece of paper. 

But that's not going to combine with other, with other 

parts to make a patented invention.

 And if I could illustrate that with a simple 

lock and key example, a key has a series of ridges on it 

that enable it to open a lock. And that series of 

ridges can be denoted by a sequence of numbers, bigger 

numbers for deeper ridges. But the component is the key

that actually turns the lock, not the abstract sequence 

of ridges on the key. And you can then say that about 

anything; you can always say that any physical product, 

any physical part, is a physical manifestation of its 

abstract design.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that analogous to the 

source and the compilation, the source being the design, 

the compilation being the key?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No. The source code and 

object code are just different computer languages for 

expressing the same thing. There is no -- there's no 

difference between them. One is words and one is 

numbers, but they mean the same thing. There is no 

reason to treat them differently.

 The point is just that if you treat the --

either the source code or the object code as the 

component, that's just the design of the actual physical 

software that goes into the computer. If you did that 

you'd have a vastly different statute because any 

physical part has a design, but the whole point of the 

statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United 

States while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale 

abroad.

 But if the design itself was a component 

then you could never copy parts abroad when something

was designed in the United States, because something 

designed abroad would always infringe because the 

something designed abroad would itself be the component, 

and that would be a vastly different statute there's no 

reason to think Congress intended here, especially 

because of the extraterritorial consequences.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Windows wasn't around 

when this statute was passed.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, the statute was enacted 

in 1984 when software was certainly present. It's fair 

to say that Congress was not thinking of software, but 

that's further caution for not expanding the statute 

beyond traditional territorial reaches. Because first, 

this Court has cautioned, has said that it should be 

cautious in applying existing electrical property 

statutes to new technologies. And in addition it's 

emphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against 

extraterritoriality applies in this very context. So 

Congress is writing against the backdrop of normal 

territorial principles, which are the making, using or 

selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to 

foreign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth, 

which has specifically held that Congress has to speak 

clearly to enact of statute like this.

position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be 

brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the 

Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp 

deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that 

notion should apply to an electronic world.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. And the reason that 

doesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that 

the component that we are talking about here is the 

specific part that goes in the machine. And if -- and 

if -- and under the statute you have to let the company 

send the design abroad to manufacture it abroad, both to 

protect the company's ability to compete abroad and to 

protect the foreign government's prerogatives. 

Otherwise it's just a vastly different statute than the 

one that Congress enacted. That's really our terms of 

the politics.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your time is up, but I 

want to ask you one yes or no question. In your view is 

software patentable?

itself, no.

MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court.

 There is no question that Microsoft supplies 

the Windows object code, that is the precise, machine 

readable sequence of commands that instructs a 

computer's processor. From the United States, that is 

paragraph 7 of the stipulation.

 There is likewise no question that it does 

so with the intent that precisely the same sequence, 

which runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will 

be installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's 

words -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may 

practice AT&T's invention.

 Those facts resolve this case because it is 

thus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of 

the words of the statute to say that Microsoft has 

quote, "supplied" a quote, "component" that when quote, 

"combined with hardware" enables the practice of AT&T's 

invention. Now let's look at --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I send someone to 

the Patent Office --

MR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I send someone to 

the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and 

this patent is written very, very, very concretely and

specifically. Gets on the phone, phones somebody in 

Germany and reads it to him. And that person, having an 

excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the 

precise instruction necessary to change the machine 

around or put various things into it. So now it is a 

precise copy of the machine in the United States.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's not the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- how is that 

different from this? How is it different?

 MR. WAXMAN: That is very different than 

this case because what -- first of all, we all agree 

that software code in and of itself, removed from a 

physical structure, cannot be patentable and when 

software -- when some -- when an invention that is 

practiced with software is patented, at the most what 

you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code 

which is language that humans understand and which 

computers do not.

 A lot of work has to be done in items of 

debugging and testing and compiling to create what is, 

by stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the 

precise, machine readable sequence that commands a 

computer's CPU millions of times a second. Source code 

would do nothing. Source code has to be worked on 

overseas.

that we stole from England, with the -- with the --

remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners 

and so forth? This genius comes over here; he looks at 

a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head, 

the precise details that nobody else could do. He runs 

back to Germany, and he builds it. Well, he has 

absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex 

details of this machine.

instead of sending the individual, we send the machine 

to Germany. This genius looks at it in Germany and

continually interact with the hardware of the computer

 Let's take this case. Okay. Is it -- the 

question is, is it a component and whether what was 

supplied was in fact combined. That's, that's -- that's 

what this case boils down to. As to the component.

 We have something, software program, the 

NetMeeting and sound recorded program that can in its 

object, its machine readable command form, is developed, 

bought and sold entirely separately from any hardware 

that it commands.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is what is on 

master disk.

 MR. WAXMAN: And that is what is either on 

the master disk or, although either side obscures this, 

that is what is represented in the electric --

electronic transmission, that is another means by which 

the code is supplied.

 And in paragraph 7 of the stipulation 

Microsoft acknowledges that it supplies the Windows 

object code by transmitting it to manufacturers 

overseas. And the way that happens is the code, the 

machine language, is resident in Redmond, either in the 

pits and lands of a CD or on the varying magnetic 

orientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from 

Microsoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is

it is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the 

Atlantic Ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a 

bit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there 

in Dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive, 

it's converted from photons to a series of electrical 

pulses.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that really what 

happens? As I understand it there is an intermediate 

step. They don't send it directly from the United 

States to each of the individual computers in Germany. 

They send it to a central point which then redistributes 

it. Is that not right.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that paragraph 7 

of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the 

other, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the 

following. Because if I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you're correct that 

they're just sending from New York direct to the 500 

different machines all on one transmission from New 

York, there's no lawsuit here.

Circuit has made this clear in the Waymark case and it's

the object code on the disk, not the disk itself?

 MR. WAXMAN: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why 

doesn't that get you --

MR. WAXMAN: It could be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that get you 

right back to the point that Justice Breyer was making? 

You are saying, I think, in essence if you send a 

blueprint -- this is like a blueprint. It tells, it 

tells a machine which may be in Europe how to put the 

object code on other disks or on hard drives. The 

machine in Europe is following instructions just the way 

an artisan would follow a blueprint.

 MR. WAXMAN: Here's the difference.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference?

 MR. WAXMAN: And it's nicely embodied in 

Microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word 

"antecedent." A blueprint or a design is a precursor to 

the actual device. It is the instructions about how to 

make something. It's not the thing itself. And here 

what we have is the object code that is the precise 

commands that, unlike design information, interact 

continuously with the hard drive and with the processor 

in order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the "continuously" 

does not describe the process of going from the master 

disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer 

sold in Europe. There is no continuous process there. 

As I understand it, what happens is -- let's just take 

the master disk and forget the photon for the moment. 

The master disk functions like a blueprint. They send, 

from the United States they send the blueprint to 

Europe. The blueprint is put in some kind of a machine 

in Europe. And by the use of the blueprint the machine 

puts electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive, 

and that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint 

analogy. And if it does, then any export of a blueprint 

or indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the 

'820, if that's the right number, patent in this case 

would be a violation.

 MR. WAXMAN: I have to disagree, Justice 

Souter, because the blueprint -- the patent is not the 

actual series of commands that runs the machine and 

neither is the blueprint. The blueprint is 

instructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in 

intangible code, but it's instructions about how to make 

something and once it's made it's done. You can say, as 

Mr. Olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing 

that is made. The blueprint for a semiconductor chip in

some sense is always reflected in that chip. But if you 

don't like the chip you have to get rid of it. Software 

can be -- if you don't like Microsoft Word, you can 

download it and you can delete it and download 

WordPerfect and use that. And what happens in the 

computer -- and I think this does bear on what the 

nature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense 

of the word "component" and the ordinary sense of the 

words "supply" and "combine," they apply naturally to 

what Microsoft does.

 I mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a 

screen, is a hard drive, is a CPU a component? Are they 

components when they have the code embedded in it? Of 

course. But that doesn't -- a tire doesn't become not a 

component of a car just because a tire with a wheel 

attached to it is also a component. The question is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose, suppose you 

had a machine that makes another machine, and if you 

ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for 

the machine that makes it. If you ship it to Europe and 

it starts making another machine, the statute is not 

violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?

 MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. This is not a 

machine tool. The thing that was violated, the machine 

readable object code, is precisely what is installed on

the computer and precisely what is moved from one part 

of the computer to another in different forms as the 

computer operates and it continually instructs. This is 

dynamic. It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: How would you, how would 

you -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're 

finished with that, because I don't see how to decide 

for you without at the same time permitting a person to 

walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application 

and the description, which after all at least can be a 

very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make 

a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just 

like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in 

Europe. They then make it. And that on your reading 

would violate the statute. It can't be right that that 

would and you don't even think it would.

 MR. WAXMAN: I don't because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And so what's the 

difference between that and this case for you?

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, there is a 

long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes, 

goes from high level system architecture to all the way 

down through component architecture, pseudo code, source 

code, which is, which is a description that humans 

understand, and the actual machine language that a

computer will understand. Invention -- patents do not 

specify machine language. The machine code is totally 

dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and 

somebody who takes source code -- I could make an 

argument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source 

code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade 

secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas, 

but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers 

and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into 

something a computer will understand that will combine 

with a computer, that involves a question of whether 

what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to 

assembly.

 Look at it from the perspective -- maybe 

this helps. Let's look at the question from the 

perspective of Microsoft, the OEM, and the user 

overseas. Object code is the end of Microsoft's 

manufacturing process. That is what they make. They 

don't make hard drives, they don't make disks, they 

don't make computers. They fully finish their product, 

the Windows operating code, and then send it overseas. 

The OEM is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That, that code is not 

patentable, you've said.

 MR. WAXMAN: The code is not patentable.

The expression is copyrightable. AT&T has not sought to 

get a patent on the code. AT&T has a patent on a system 

that can be practiced, among other ways, through the use 

of software.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But what is it that they 

export and send overseas?

 MR. WAXMAN: They export in a variety of 

different physical forms --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, it's a thing. It's 

an object of some sort, isn't it?

 MR. WAXMAN: It is an intangible sequence of 

commands that is carrying --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It is an object that has 

coded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way, 

those commands. But it's an object, isn't it?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it's not necessarily an 

object. I don't know whether you would call a stream of 

photons that is constantly repeated under the Atlantic 

Ocean an object.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, this may, 

this may help focus that question. Suppose the master 

disks were made abroad. You would be taking the same 

position, would you not?

JUSTICE SCALIA: I hope we can continue 

calling it the golden disk. It has a certain 

Scheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest 

to this case.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the question 

is what is made. If making it means somehow creating, 

reconfiguring the precise sequence of commands --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. That's given by 

Microsoft to one of its offices in Europe. But the 

golden disk itself is made abroad.

 MR. WAXMAN: If the, if the object code 

itself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed, 

is supplied from the United States --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only thing --

is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it 

something else. But anyway, it is the series of 0's and 

1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the 

United States?

manifestation of it is done abroad. You would still be 

taking the position that you're taking, is that not so?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, yes, except that the 

intangible sequence of commands can only be carried in 

the form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a 

bucket.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it doesn't have 

to be --

MR. WAXMAN: Even a radio wave. Microsoft 

has patent claims for software.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The physical object does 

not have to originate in the United States. Can they 

not transmit the commands to a physical object in 

Germany and have that be the substitute for the golden 

disk?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, of course, and they do 

that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. WAXMAN: They press a button and they 

have an electronic transmission that sends a stream of 

protons under the Atlantic Ocean and are changed into 

electrical impulses that are used to inscribe the 

precise code onto a hard drive in the form of 

electromagnetic pulses.

some central point which redistributes them. They send 

one copy to, say, the wholesaler, who then makes 500 

copies that are sent to the retail customers, isn't that 

correct?

 MR. WAXMAN: That may be. We don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is exactly what 

happens in this case?

 MR. WAXMAN: It's one of the things that 

happens in this case. We have a stipulated record that 

is not very detailed, but in that instance there is only 

one violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: My question is if that is 

what happens, when the retransmission takes place when 

one copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be 

components rather than copies of the single component?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, the only -- I have two 

answers to that question, both of them I think directly 

answering your question. First of all, the statute is 

violated only when the precise object code is 

expatriated from the United States, when it is supplied 

from the United States. That's the violation. The 

other issues are damages, what damages are you entitled 

to. What is combined with the computer is the precise 

thing that is supplied because it is the precise 

sequence of commands.

JUSTICE BREYER: But is there any precedent 

for that sort of thing? That is, I understand your 

point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to 

come down to the fact that this very, very complex and 

detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set 

of numbers. And I can understand how the patent 

application does not itself contain that set of numbers, 

but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate 

that set of numbers.

 But I then would be quite frightened of 

deciding for you and discovering that all over the world 

there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be 

thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this 

one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of 

information themselves and alone become components. So 

I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field 

analogous instance where the transmission of information 

has itself been viewed as the transmission of a 

component?

 MR. WAXMAN: I'm not aware of any. In the 

lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech 

industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious 

differences between what is supplied in terms of object 

code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a 

sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of

nucleotides. But I think we need to be quite precise 

here. We are not complaining that the component is an 

idea. We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a 

component is some form of information. What we're 

saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of 

dollars from an idea. When the commands are loaded onto 

the hard drive of a computer in the form of 

electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button 

saying give me NetMeeting, and the processor says -- and 

this is what electrical engineers say -- fetch the 

instructions, fetch the commands to the random access 

memory where it's -- where it is there reflected in a --

in a form of patterns of electrical charges. And when 

the code then moves back and forth, the instructions 

move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they --

they -- millions of times a second they are replicating 

themselves.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it an answer to 

Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no 

conceptual problem saying there would be liability if 

this happened within the territorial limits of the 

United States?

 MR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so there shouldn't be 

a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying

it abroad.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, sure, there is. It's 

a bigger --

MR. WAXMAN: If I can, I just want to make 

sure I answer your question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it's totally different 

in that of course it violates the patent in the United 

States. The whole question here is whether or not the 

person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can 

do or not do. And the -- the concern that I'm worried 

about is in the future it might be outside your field, 

it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the 

transmission purely of information is the transmission 

of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see 

in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction 

and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create 

other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri 

dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that 

detailed information abroad. Then suddenly it's our 

patent law and not the foreign patent law that would 

govern. That's why I asked for precedent.

 MR. WAXMAN: Okay. First of all, this 

statute does not reach anything that is done overseas. 

It doesn't reach what the German OEM does. It doesn't

reach what anybody does overseas. It -- it makes liable 

as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the 

United States who supplies from the United States a 

component with the intent, with the express intent that 

that component be combined in a way to create a device 

that would practice a U.S. patent. Now I don't believe 

-- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at 

issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions 

about what is or isn't a component. I might think that 

a design is a component or it isn't a component, but 

think of these three features: One, this is something 

that is totally modular. It is developed, bought and 

sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to 

which it is, with which it is combined, and between 

which it moves continuously as it operates. Number two, 

it can be removed or updated entirely independently of 

the other components. And it is dynamic, unlike 

designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to 

make something, all of which are exhausted. They have 

done their work when the thing is made. That's why 

those things are called hardware.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But --

MR. WAXMAN: These are instructions not 

about how to make something. They are instructions 

about what the other things that are made should do and

how they do it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You can perfectly well say 

that in this case. You can say that the instruction is 

exhausted once the golden disk has sent its information 

through an intermediary machine onto the new disk that 

is made.

 MR. WAXMAN: You could not say that because 

if you take the information from a golden master or a 

stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless 

that continues to move and change in form, the computer 

will not work. The computer operates by having you 

press a button saying do this function. The central 

processing unit then says where are my instructions on 

how to do it. It says find them and put them in random 

access memory, where it is then replicated in the form 

of patterns of electrical charges, quite a different 

physical form than it exists on the hard drive. And the 

program counter --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That simply means that 

after the -- the -- the -- the idea as you put it, has 

been placed on the hard drive, certain other processes 

must take place too before we get the result that people 

are buying computers to -- to obtain. But it's still 

the case that the -- that the code on the golden disk is 

exhausted once that has been transferred from the disk

through an intermediary machine on its way ultimately to 

a working computer just -- and my only point is -- just 

the way you can say that the blueprint in effect is 

exhausted once the house has been built.

 MR. WAXMAN: It's not because the blueprint 

has no further work to do. It was something that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. You can use it 

again.

 MR. WAXMAN: Something you teach, has no 

further work to do with respect to the infringing 

device, but the object code works continuously and gives 

continuous instructions to the various hardware 

components completely unlike. But let me go to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The object code has several 

jobs. One job when embodied on the golden disk is tell 

a -- is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to 

put a message on a hard drive. Another job that the 

object code has is when the object code gets on the 

resulting disk or the hard drive. But in fact, the 

manifestation of the object code on the golden disk and 

the manifestation of the object code on the resulting 

disk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable 

from what is constructed.

States in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft 

argued in the court of appeals and the district court, 

which is that if it took instead of one golden master, 

but 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one 

for each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement. 

But that also requires copying and transforming the code 

that is on the CD-ROM which is in the form of physical 

pits and lands and indentations, and downloading it into 

the hard drive where the same exact sequence is 

manifested as varying orientations of electronic, 

electromagnetic fields, and that is no different 

whatsoever than this case.

 If you say, well, what destroys you in this 

case is that the code has to be copied, replication, 

precise instantaneous replication is simply how software 

works. It's not just how it's supplied. It's not just 

how it's combined. It's how it interacts dynamically 

within the computer. And that's why we say it's a 

component.

 Let me just be clear about what the 

statutory interpretation question here is. It's not as 

whether our conception of the component as the code --

as the -- as the command is better than their conception 

of the component as a CD or a light wave or a telephone 

wire that contains that.

The question is, there may very -- it may 

very well be both things. The question is whether the 

word component naturally applies to what we do. And our 

-- we have given dozens of references to the use of 

intangible software, program software as components. We 

have given you the dictionary definition with an example 

from Webster's. They have not responded with one 

counter-example. The only dictionary example they 

provide you relates to the word "such", and it's in 

their reply brief on page 5. But they have given you 

not the first definition of such under Black, in Black's 

Eighth, they have given you the second one. The first 

one is, of this or that kind, she collects a variety of 

things. And that definition, under that definition it 

wouldn't matter whether you said, well, the component 

has to be physical or, you know, it could be either. 

Because even if it has to be physical --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of any 

machine -- can you think of any machine other than a 

computer that has a component that is not a physical 

thing?

 MR. WAXMAN: I can't. And that's why it

machines that have nonphysical things in them but not 

that operate in the sort of same dynamic way. We gave

individual foreign made computers. Those are -- those 

commands cannot be understood and cannot be used by that 

computer unless they are in a physical medium that is 

created as a copy of the master disk that sends abroad 

-- that's sent abroad.

 As I said at the beginning, the stipulation 

is full of the word "copies", foreign replicated copies. 

That's what we're talking about here, something that is 

recreated. And Justice Breyer, your question about 

someone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad 

and recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken, 

copies can be made in lots of different ways.

 And in response to Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: His answer to me is that --

that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if 

it's just information, because it's really a method that 

switches things at a level of detail that is impossible 

to put in a patent application. It's taking the 

information in a patent application, it's transforming 

it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not 

really even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that 

happen with electricity.

 MR. OLSON: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's putting that on 

the disk and then it makes other things happen.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's putting something 

physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that 

are copied from the master disk and then put into either 

a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing.  It's 

something that is into the computer that will make the 

computer operate.

 You're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the 

court of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was 

bringing this statute up to date and it even said so. 

We are making an extension of the statute to keep up to 

date with the technology. That is not for courts to do.

infringement act that happened in the United States

 MR. OLSON: The infringement that happened 

in the United States which was under Section B, which 

provides Section B inducement liability for making 

copies domestically of -- the same thing that happened 

here. Copies of the object code were put on physical 

mediums and sent to domestic manufacturers. Domestic 

reproduction constitutes infringement under Section 

271(b) but foreign reproduction is not a violation of 

Section 271(a) or 271(b). Hence, we're talking about

Official - Subject to Final Review 

the two sections where --

JUSTICE BREYER: So they had a license to do 

that, because if they didn't have a license to make the 

master disk here in the United States, the making of it 

would have violated the patent; is that right?

 MR. OLSON: The making of the master disk if 

actually used in a computer with a microphone and a 

speaker, and that's the liability that existed in the 

stipulation under 271(a). Making copies is liability 

domestically under 271(b). If it's going to be liable 

for foreign made replications, then it must be under 

271(f). The language of the statute, we submit is 

clear. Physical things must be components under 271(f) 

because they must be supplied from somewhere. Ideas 

have no physical from. They're in the air. The words 

used, "supplied from" tells us that it must be a 

physical thing combined with. Ideas don't combine with 

physical things to make a patented invention. Physical 

things do. Thank you, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Olson. The 

case is submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
