 P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:03 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart. 

Mr. Gray. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GRAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In cases involving safety exigencies, an 

officer's actions should be judged against a single 

objective standard of reasonableness, that is, whether 

the facts and circumstances known to the officers at 

the time of entry would warrant a reasonable person in 

believing that immediate intervention is needed to 

preserve the peace and protect others from harm. When 

officers have reason to believe that violence is 

imminent or ongoing, they meet that standard. 

In this case, the Brigham City officers 

responded to a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, upon 

arriving, witnessed a violent and tumultuous struggle 

between four adults and a teenager. The officers --

when the juvenile threw a punch is when the officers 

acted and thereby prevented injury. This is exactly 

what we would expect officers to do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What were they doing in the 

yard anyway? This sort of occurred to me. They 

couldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced 

backyard violating the curtilage of the property. How 

-- was that justified? 

MR. GRAY: Yes, it was justified. At that 

time what they heard from the curb side and then from 

the front was the same kind of violence going on. They 

heard that from -- from the time they arrived all the 

way. They -- they heard the thumping, the shouting, 

someone saying, get off me, stop, stop. And so what 

these officers were doing, in the course of that, is 

investigating that -- that, and it led them to the 

backyard. 

Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is any less required to --

to go into the curtilage than is required to go into 

the house? 

MR. GRAY: No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's the same test? 

MR. GRAY: Yes. And again, that was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that even if he 

didn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood, 

they could have gone in just because they heard 

somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?

 MR. GRAY: It's our position that they could 

have, though that's a much closer case. In this case, 

the officers acted in a very guarded manner. I mean, 

they -- they proceeded and they investigated step by 

step and, in fact, did not enter until a punch was 

thrown and there was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So what -- what you're 

saying is they've got to have a reasonable ground to 

take the first step. That may not be a reasonable 

ground to have taken the second step right then and 

there, but it's the same reasonableness standard. 

MR. GRAY: Yes, it is. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's --

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing that was left 

out of the succession of acts -- Utah provides for 

telephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do 

that. Once they checked to -- to determine that there 

was probable cause to enter, they could have called for 

a warrant, but they didn't. Is there a reason why they 

didn't? 

MR. GRAY: Yes. The reason is where there's 

a violent situation, things can change in seconds. I 

mean, it can turn deadly in seconds. They don't have 

time. Even though a telephonic warrant would certainly

be a more speedy process of getting a warrant, it's not 

speedy enough where punches are being thrown. I mean, 

it can turn deadly, one blow could give someone a 

concussion or even rupture a spleen. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- you don't 

really mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun 

and they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2 

minutes, since they could have gotten a telephone 

warrant, they would have to had to get a telephone 

warrant? 

MR. GRAY: No, not at all. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you don't 

want the -- the telephone warrant requirement to -- to 

up the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for the police 

to go in without a warrant, do you? 

MR. GRAY: No. In fact, precisely for that 

reason, the officers would not need a telephonic 

warrant in that situation no more than they would need 

a telephonic warrant in this situation. Time is of the 

essence. Violence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it wouldn't be of the 

essence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm going 

to kill you in 2 minutes. 

MR. GRAY: Well, that -- that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really want the

policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and 

get a warrant? That's ridiculous. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GRAY: That -- that would be assuming --

that would be assuming that you could take someone who 

is threatening in that manner at his word. I don't 

think that's something the officers could -- could 

afford to do. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are the police instructed 

-- the city police instructed about when the telephone 

warrant procedure is appropriate? 

MR. GRAY: That I -- I do not know. I assume 

so. They have procedures in place, but that I do not 

know. 

JUSTICE ALITO: When you speak about a 

violent situation, would that be limited -- would that 

apply here just because a punch was thrown, or would it 

be enough that the officers saw some men restraining 

the young man, or would it be enough if there were 

violent words being exchanged? 

MR. GRAY: With -- with violent words, 

generally not, though if it's accompanied with a show 

of immediate force or violence, then yes, in that 

situation. 

In this situation, I believe that officers

could have entered prior to the punch being thrown. 

What they witnessed is -- is this violent struggle 

between four adults and a teenager. They had no idea 

whether or not they were trying to molest the -- the 

teenager or whether the teenager was an intruder or 

what happened. But they could tell that it was 

violent. They knew that alcohol was involved based on 

the circumstances as they approached. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did they know that minors 

were involved? The record doesn't show that, at least 

in the preliminary direct exam of the officer. 

MR. GRAY: That minors were involved? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I mean, they knew 

that once they got into the backyard. Did they know 

before they got into the backyard? 

MR. GRAY: They knew that minors --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or did they just know that 

minors stay up late at night? 

MR. GRAY: They knew that minors were in the 

backyard. They -- they witnessed the two juveniles. 

They did not know that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's after they went 

into the backyard. 

MR. GRAY: No. They saw that from the 

driveway, through the -- the slit -- slit -- slats in

the fence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: They could see that they 

were minors. 

MR. GRAY: Yes, yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- you've 

been focusing on the violence because of the punch 

being thrown, but I gather they were called originally 

because of concern about the noise and disturbance of 

the peace and all that. 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a sufficient 

basis for them to have gone into the backyard and 

proceed from there? 

MR. GRAY: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're just 

shouting. There are five people in the house shouting. 

It's 3:00 in the morning or whatever. Is that -- is 

that enough? 

MR. GRAY: Probably not, certainly not where 

the State is -- where the State offers as -- as the 

proffered justification safety, it would not be enough. 

That would be a different justification for their 

actions. Certainly where they're disturbing the 

neighbors, we would argue that the expectation of 

privacy had diminished in that home because of that

disturbance. But again, where the State -- or where 

the city is offering as a justification safety, that 

would not be sufficient to go in. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but if -- if the -- if 

the complaint were -- were simply a complaint of noise, 

and they got to the -- the gate, the back fence, and 

they could hear all the racket inside and there didn't 

seem to be any practical way to get people to come to 

the fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the 

right to go through the gate and at least go up to the 

door and bang on the door? 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So they could have gotten 

through the curtilage. They could at least have gotten 

to the back door based entirely on noise. 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that there was a 

front door, which they approached first. As I recall, 

they left one of the officers in the front. 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So they could have banged on 

the front door. 

MR. GRAY: They -- they could have, though

the evidence was that -- and the trial court found that 

it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have 

heard it or probably would not have heard it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm a little puzzled. 

If the noise is the cause of their being there and if 

the noise is so loud at 3:00 in the morning that it's 

still continuing and nobody can hear the knock on the 

door -- they knock on the door several times and shout 

-- would they not have the right to go in then to quell 

the noise? 

MR. GRAY: Absolutely. All that I am 

maintaining is that they would not be justified under a 

safety exigency to go in. Certainly to -- as far as 

disturbing the peace, then yes, but not where the 

proffered justification is safety. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So if you're going to rely 

on the safety and the -- safety and the danger of harm, 

how serious does the harm have to be? And I use the 

word harm as defining the -- the threshold for this 

kind of entry. What if a father was spanking his child, 

for example? 

MR. GRAY: No. Spanking of a child would 

not. There's no indication under most circumstances of 

an intent to injure or abuse. Now, of course, if there 

are circumstances that would suggest abuse, then

officers could go in. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't yelling so 

loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00 

in the morning suggest that violence is at least 

imminent or may well be associated with what they're 

hearing? 

MR. GRAY: It certainly approaches that, but 

again, what we would maintain is there probably has to 

be more than simple shouting. If -- if it's 

accompanied by threats or a show of force or violence, 

then certainly they could go in. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there, in addition to the 

safety rationale which you're -- justification, which 

you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go 

in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved 

or not? 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that a separate --

MR. GRAY: Yes. That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you see a guy 

turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and 

can you go in right away if you see him doing that? 

MR. GRAY: Well, it's a crime ongoing, in 

progress. So there certainly could be made an 

argument. Now, whether or not there's an exigency, I

think that's doubtful because police could secure the 

scene and secure a warrant and then execute that 

warrant. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, but if that's 

the case, you have a much easier argument. Wasn't 

there an assault here? There was clearly an assault. 

MR. GRAY: Yes, and certainly where officers 

have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault, 

officers can enter. 

Now, one of the problems with the Utah 

Supreme Court's holding in this case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In connection with the 

answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then? If it's 

an ongoing crime, they can go in? It doesn't matter 

whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony? It 

doesn't matter how grave the crime is? 

MR. GRAY: Well, this Court in Welsh 

indicated that minor offenses -- you couldn't rely on 

the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is 

what it suggested. But certainly an assault, under 

Utah law, is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 

6 months in jail, and that's certainly of sufficient 

gravity to justify officers entering. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any kind of assault. 

I gather it's an assault if you're just sort of a

couple of guys pushing each other back and forth. 

MR. GRAY: Well, under Utah law, an assault 

is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to --

with an intent to do bodily injury. Now, pushing --

there's not that there. 

Now, one of the chief problems or primary 

problems with the Utah court's decision in this case is 

it creates a complicated and confusing bifurcated 

standard that forces officers unrealistically to choose 

between roles, to choose whether or not they are going 

to enter and act as caretakers or enter and act as law 

enforcement officials. 

Well, the reality -- first of all, it's --

it's very difficult for officers to try to make those 

kind of judgments in the heat of the moment, and this 

is precisely the kind of a -- the kind of case where 

that would be impossible to achieve because officers in 

this case are acting clearly under both roles. They're 

stopping crime and they are also protecting others from 

harm. We want officers to rescue people from harm when 

they have a reasonable basis to do it, not wait until 

you have to call an EMT. That's what Mincey provides. 

And if there are no further questions, I 

would reserve the remainder of my time.

question, if I may, if you have -- did the other side 

preserve the right to challenge this entry under the 

Utah constitution? 

MR. GRAY: No, they did not, and -- and the 

Utah Supreme Court recognized that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. MCNULTY 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. MCNULTY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

may it please the Court: 

The Fourth Amendment does not require police 

officers to stand by and be a spectator to escalating 

violence in the home when such an officer has an 

objectively reasonable basis to believe, given the 

totality of the circumstances, that prompt action is 

necessary to prevent imminent harm. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there were no 

punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient 

basis? 3:00 in the morning, loud shouting. Can they 

conclude, based on their experience, that's likely to 

escalate into violence and enter on that basis? 

MR. MCNULTY: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. In 

these facts, the Government suggests they would.

MR. MCNULTY: Well, it would depend on -- if 

-- if words are going to be the key --

JUSTICE SCALIA: One thing leads to another. 

Right? 

MR. MCNULTY: Well, that's correct. It 

depends upon, of course, what those words are. It's 

really a combination of the words and the context of 

the words. Here you have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there has to be some 

indication of the likelihood of escalation into 

violence? 

MR. MCNULTY: Correct, Your Honor. That's --

that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why? What if they're 

just so loud that it's perfectly obvious they're 

keeping -- getting -- the neighbors are awake and 

disturbed by it. Does it have to be a threat of 

violence? 

MR. MCNULTY: Well, Your Honor, if there's a 

loud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't

JUSTICE STEVENS: So then it doesn't matter 

what's being said.

MR. MCNULTY: But the -- what's being said 

may determine -- may determine -- whether or not entry 

is necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a 

prompt response is critical. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It may determine what is 

necessary to prevent harm, but what if it's not 

necessary to prevent harm, just necessary to prevent 

noise? 

MR. MCNULTY: Then it may still be 

reasonable. It may still be reasonable, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me the harm 

inquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous. 

We don't even have to look at that. 

MR. MCNULTY: I agree, Your Honor. It may be 

that the -- the noise alone could justify the 

circumstance. Certainly we wouldn't want a test that 

excluded words only --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. You -- you don't 

want to say that. The noise alone wouldn't justify

going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a 

violent event occurring. Certainly you'd have to knock 

on the door. Now, if they didn't hear you and the only 

way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go 

in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door 

real hard before you went in to stop the noise? 

MR. MCNULTY: Justice Scalia, in most cases a 

knock on the door would -- would be appropriate thing 

to do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not appropriate. Necessary. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Necessary. 

MR. MCNULTY: Well, it may very well be 

necessary depending upon the totality of the 

circumstances. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I hope so. I mean -- people 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but we've got a case 

in which knocking on the -- the noise is so loud nobody 

can hear the knock. 

MR. MCNULTY: That's why a knock on the door 

may not always be the right thing to do. In some cases 

it could be a futile gesture. In this case, the police 

announced themselves and were not heard because of that 

tumultuous --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And they did knock on the

door, yes. 

MR. MCNULTY: They entered and announced 

their presence, and they were not heard when they did 

that. So the knock is -- is normally the appropriate 

course, but in certain circumstances, the knock may 

either be futile, it could be dangerous, depending upon 

what was happening, and it certainly could waste some 

time if it was a dire emergency. 

The -- under the Fourth Amendment, a police 

officer may enter a residence without a warrant when a 

reasonable officer could conclude, given again all the 

circumstances, that an impending threat to life or 

safety justifies immediate intervention and the scope 

of the intrusion is reasonable in relation to the 

nature of the emergency. 

Whether the officer was subjectively 

motivated to enforce the law or render aid has no 

relevance in a constitutional inquiry. Volatile 

situations involving violence in the home can escalate 

in -- in seconds, and the on-the-scene, split-second 

judgment about exactly when the police officers should 

intervene is precisely what the totality of the 

circumstances test has long addressed and resolves the 

balance of the Fourth Amendment values. 

And this Court's recent decision in Georgia

v. Randolph contains a clear expression of concern for 

the need for the police to take prompt action to 

prevent harm in domestic violence cases. 

In this case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This wasn't -- this wasn't 

a domestic violence case. It wasn't anybody inside 

calling the police and crying, danger, rescue me. It 

was an outsider who complained about the noise. So I 

am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent 

somebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing 

the peace and the police have a right to protect the 

neighborhood. It seems to me that that's an easier 

argument to make. 

MR. MCNULTY: It is, Justice Ginsburg, to 

look at the -- the threat to the quiet of the community 

as one aspect of this. But the case contains even 

more. The case contains a punch that did some harm to 

another person in a kitchen setting where there is a 

strong possibility of escalating violence. It's the 

additional facts of that violence that was a potential 

there, added to the noise and the evidence of underage 

drinking, that made the totality of the circumstances 

objectively reasonable for the officers to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, let's 

suppose you have a police officer who knows there's

evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable 

cause to get a warrant. And he also knows that the 

family is going to be reenacting the murder scene from 

some movie as part of the family reunion. And so he's 

there just at the time where the -- in the scene the 

one guy says, and now I'm going to kill you with this 

knife, and he says, ah, and he goes in. 

Now, subjectively we know that he has no 

basis for fearing violence, but a reasonable officer on 

the scene, hearing somebody say I'm going to kill you 

with this knife, would have a basis for entering. 

So under your test, is that entry permissible 

or not? 

MR. MCNULTY: Permissible, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really. 

MR. MCNULTY: Because there the officer is 

unaware of the fact based upon the -- as I understood 

the facts presented, unaware of the fact that that is 

not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. He knows. 

He knows. He heard this is what they do at the family 

reunion. They always reenact this. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he knows that 

there's no -- well, but that's the difference here

between looking at the subjective motivation or what an 

objective, you know, officer would understand. 

MR. MCNULTY: If the officer has specific 

information --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. MCNULTY: -- a fact knowing that this is 

not truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a 

quick response, then that would be a fact in the 

totality of the circumstances that wouldn't justify. 

But, on the other hand --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the 

objective -- the -- the objective officer always knows 

at least as much as the officers actually know. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A good way to put it. 

MR. MCNULTY: The -- the officer knows --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't that your 

standard? 

MR. MCNULTY: Well, if -- I'm not sure if I 

understand the question. Would you please repeat it? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I -- I thought you 

were getting to the point of saying that on the 

objective test that you urge, the officer -- the 

objective police officer who sets the standard is 

deemed to know at least as much as the officer on the 

scene actually knows. In other words, we don't exclude

information --

MR. MCNULTY: Right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- from our objective test 

when the officer actually has that information. 

MR. MCNULTY: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. MCNULTY: What makes it difficult at 

times is that you often have two officers. One may 

know something, another may not know it. And that's 

why objective information is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except I -- I don't think we 

look to whether he knew that this was a family 

reenactment. I think we look to the facts that he had 

-- that had come to his attention which caused him to 

believe that this was a family reenactment. I mean, 

you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something 

else. The facts are -- are what matter and not --

MR. MCNULTY: Thank you, Justice Scalia. 

That's -- I agree that that is going to -- even what 

the officer believes he knows may be subject to error, 

and therefore, the objective test pulls us out of this 

question of knowing the officer's mind and allows us to 

look at the totality of the circumstances, what really 

was occurring and determine whether or not the 

reasonable officer would be able to enter

constitutionally under those circumstances. 

And here again is the -- a situation where 

there was mounting evidence, and the court in Utah 

wanted to make the motivation of the officer a 

significant factor in determining whether or not the 

officer could enter. Specifically, the court looked to 

the motive or intent of the officer to render aid as 

one way to analyze the situation. And the government 

argued that those distinctions -- or the distinction 

between rendering aid or entering for a law enforcement 

purpose is really a -- an unnecessary distinction 

because the officer, as the counsel for the State has 

argued, is acting in a split-second situation, seeking 

-- thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 

Mr. Studebaker, we'll hear now from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. STUDEBAKER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

There's two bases or two exceptions which 

would allow somebody to enter into somebody's home, 

which are before the Court today, one being the 

emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, the 

other one being exigent circumstances requirements for

the warrant. 

Under the facts of this case, neither one of 

those situations apply. Under exigent circumstances, 

there has to be probable cause to enter, and there has 

to be a warrant to enter. And if neither one of those 

-- actually under exigent circumstances, there has to 

be probable cause and there has to be the requirement 

that there be imminent danger basically to evidence or 

to the person. And if there's not exigent circumstances, 

and the officers have an obligation to obtain a warrant 

based upon probable cause to enter the home. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that probable 

cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts 

didn't question that there was probable cause. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- what 

happened was that the Utah courts found that the 

probable cause was there for the emergency aid 

exception, but I believe under the exigent 

circumstances requirement -- or the exception, that 

probable cause was not there to get out -- or actually 

to get into the home on the situations. 

But even if probable cause is conceded, the 

fact is that the facts of the case don't rise to the 

level of requiring such as immediate entry into a home

to bypass the warrant requirement. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I just get back 

to your general statement? Do I understand you to say 

that if they arrived on the scene and, you know, a 

really wild party was going on at 3:00 a.m., they knock 

at the door, nobody answers the door, they can't hear 

it for all the screaming and the music and so on, that 

under those circumstances, the police could not go in 

to -- to quiet things down? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, Your Honor. They 

would actually have to go out and get a warrant to 

enter the home. There's not an exigent circumstance 

under the facts that you presented which would require 

them to enter the home and bypass the warrant 

requirement. It's not severe enough under those facts. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Let's say they -- they see a 

fight going on. What kind of calculation do you think 

has to go on in the mind of the officer? They have to 

think, well, let me look at these people. Do they look 

like they're -- they're strong enough to really hurt 

each other? How likely is it that they're going to 

grab some object that's lying around, a knife, a 

baseball bat, or something, and -- and escalate the 

violence? What -- what sort of thought process do you 

think a reasonable officer is supposed to go through in

that situation? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Alito, what the 

officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of 

the circumstances and make a decision based upon the 

totality of what they see. And unfortunately, these 

situations are always fact-intensive based upon what's 

seen on the scene. And in the case presented here 

before the Court, none of those facts are presented 

that -- that would actually weigh and that was going to 

escalate into that type of situation. 

The officers actually had personal, firsthand 

knowledge of the events that were happening. They 

stood outside the home. They watched the event 

transpire through the window. The exigency was over 

when the officer entered the home. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you? Is there any 

case or anything that says you don't look at the whole 

circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter? 

I mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a 

hypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much 

noise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a 

knock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a 

kid there being held, who's obviously been drinking 

under age. He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes 

him in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under

those circumstances, of course, it was reasonable to go 

in. End of the matter. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Except for the fact, Your 

Honor, I mean, the -- the situation we have is that is 

-- it would depend on whether it's an ongoing situation 

or not. And in the facts presented here, it was not an 

ongoing situation. It ended and then the officer --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean -- you mean the 

noise stopped? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: It -- shortly after the 

smack in the face by the juvenile, Your Honor, the 

officer entered the home, and by his testimony, it 

abated right after he entered the home. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. The question is whether 

he could go into the house, and are you saying that 

before he went into the house, all the noise stopped? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: It had not stopped. No, it 

had not, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So my question is I'm 

interested in the law of it. Why can't I -- what's --

what -- the -- the Constitution says reasonable or 

unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search. 

So this doesn't seem unreasonable. A policeman isn't a 

lawyer. He just has to do what's reasonable in the 

circumstance. It's a huge -- well, I would be

repeating myself. But what I want to know is what in 

the law makes that opinion wrong? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, what makes that 

opinion wrong, based upon the facts that were 

presented, is the fact that the -- there was no warrant 

achieved in the situation. If the officer is entering 

under exigent circumstances --

JUSTICE BREYER: And there are two reasons 

why he didn't want to go get a warrant. It would take 

about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are 

awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep. And in 

addition to that, the underage drinking will continue 

for another half an hour or an hour. And in addition 

to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose. So 

those are the reasons why -- or worse. So those are 

the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: That may be what he thought, 

not the officer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Those are the reasons why it 

was reasonable to go in. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's wrong with that 

opinion? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: What's wrong with the 

opinion, Your Honor, is it still requires a warrant

under the situation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose I were to say 

at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because 

it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under 

those circumstances. What I'm looking for you to do is 

to tell me why. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the -- if 

they're going to enter the home, there has to be, 

obviously, a serious situation that's going to arise. 

And so with the -- the presentation which you 

presented, it's not serious enough to require the 

sidestepping of a warrant in the situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure 

that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the 

police did here. As -- as I recall, they -- before 

they went in, they -- they heard all this noise and 

they saw the punch. They pushed open the screen door 

and announced that they were the police. Okay? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then only went in when 

nobody heard them. Then they shouted even louder, 

police. I'm not sure that -- that just the noise 

wouldn't be enough to allow that. If you can't hear 

the policeman from the door, who's coming to check 

about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock

on the door, can the policeman not open the door and 

shout, police? Is that an unreasonable search and 

seizure. 

And then if you don't hear that, can he take 

two steps into the house? He's -- he's not looking 

under the carpets. He's not looking in the desk 

drawers. He's just shouting police so that he can 

bring to the attention of the people there the fact 

that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and 

you have to knock off the noise. I -- I would think 

that's perfectly reasonable. Never mind the punch in 

the nose. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Scalia, and you 

asked whether I thought it was reasonable or not, and I 

would say it's not. The -- the -- to bypass that 

warrant requirement, to enter the home under an exigent 

circumstances, which is what they were there for, it's 

got to be more serious than a -- a loud party, the 

situation. 

And ironically, the -- the testimony of the 

officer, which I guess there was a dispute about 

whether that was there or not because it's not 

specifically in the findings that the trial judge made 

or the two appellate courts ruled on -- but if the 

officer entered the home and shortly after that, I

mean, he opened the door, according to his testimony, 

and announced, basically raised his voice, and they 

heard him, why cannot he have done that outside the 

home? And that's the situation. This wasn't a serious 

enough situation that he couldn't have made the effort 

to make his presence known outside. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't hear him when he 

-- when he just opened the screen door. He had to step 

in a few more -- a few more steps. Then they finally 

heard him. That's his -- the way I understand these 

facts. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: And, Justice Scalia, he also 

had to raise his voice, and our contention --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, he had to raise 

his voice. I mean, there was a lot of noise going. 

It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a 

policeman comes to tell people they're making too much 

noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't 

do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention 

so he can tell them that. He has to go get a warrant 

to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about 

too much noise? That just seems absurd. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Your Honor, he would 

have to get a warrant. And -- and the requirement --

JUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that in a case

somewhere, or is that just your opinion?

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what I 

would like to know is what does it say in a case 

because I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might 

not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the 

party is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have 

to take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to 

just tell the people inside the house, knock it off. 

Now, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, we 

could take a poll or something, but is there a case 

that casts some light on this? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, I believe Mincey 

itself requires the -- the seriousness of the offense 

be evaluated, and further --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which case? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Mincey v. Arizona. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Was that involving a -- is

involved a homicide, but there, the search in question 

took place after the premises -- after the entry, after 

the premises were secured. The entry was never in 

question in Mincey. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What was in question was 

the search after the premises had been secured. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see how that 

helps you because here, in the course of securing the 

-- the premises, they had all -- all the evidence they 

needed. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: And -- and to answer the 

Court's question, there is nothing that I'm aware of 

where this Court has come out and said that a party is 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Mincey doesn't help. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct. And so we --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I wouldn't want this 

to be the party case. This also involves violence and 

it also involves underage drinking and all three are 

there together. 

But I guess a policeman, where he sees or 

hears or knows a crime is going on, can take steps to 

try to stop it so that it doesn't have to continue.

And is there any case that says it depends on how 

serious a crime? Is there a case that says if it's a 

sort of minor crime, like a disturbance of the peace, 

you have to permit it to continue, but if it's a major 

crime like homicide, you don't have to? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I don't believe there's 

anything that specifically says that, Your Honor. No. 

But there are cases out there that say that 

under the exigent circumstances, it's got to be a 

serious situation, and the question then becomes is --

is the situation -- is the party -- is the loud noise 

complaint serious enough to warrant entering into the 

home. And no, we would say it's not, Your Honor. It 

doesn't rise to that level, especially considering the 

fact that the exigency that the officers relied upon, 

the smack -- and it was over. The situation was 

already under control. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was -- it was over 

until somebody threw the next punch. They don't know 

what's going to happen the next. The kid broke away 

from the four people who were trying to restrain him 

once. Presumably he might be able to do it again. 

Maybe one of the four who were restraining him might 

come up with the idea that the best way to stop him 

from throwing another punch was to throw one at him.

The -- the police cannot make -- it seems to me on the 

facts in -- in this record, could -- could not 

reasonably draw the assumption that there was no risk 

of further violence. Am I going wrong somewhere? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Not completely, Justice 

Souter. But we do have a situation where only he broke 

free from one of the adults, not three of the adults. 

He was still under control in this situation. And he 

had gotten his hand free and smacked one of the other 

adults, the one who was the victim in this situation. 

So the officers -- unlike some situations 

where they're called out and they wander on a 

situation, the officers in this case had personal 

knowledge of what was going on. They stood outside the 

home and watched the event transpire. And so they 

really need to wait and observe what's going to happen 

and wait till the last second before they need to go 

in. In this situation, there was nothing that would 

demonstrate in the facts that it was going to escalate 

at all. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't -- you can't 

attribute what you just said to the trial court, and 

you emphasize the trial court's findings. The trial 

court said about what went wrong what the police should 

have done, as required under the Fourth Amendment, was

knock on the door. The evidence is there was a loud, 

tumultuous thing going on and that the occupants 

probably would not have heard him. But under the 

Fourth Amendment, he has an obligation to at least 

attempt before entering. Now, that's a statement that 

what went wrong was they didn't knock even though it 

was likely a futile act. 

Do you -- do you agree that that's a correct 

statement of the law, that what the police didn't do 

that they should have done was knock? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they 

should have knocked. They should have made that effort 

first. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't screaming, police, 

enough? I mean, as I understand the facts, he first 

opened the screen door. Now, is -- is that an entry? 

He didn't go in. I assume the screen door opens out. 

Most screen doors open out. He opened the screen door 

and shouted, police. Now, that -- that doesn't count? 

he has to knock on the screen door instead, even 

though they're more likely to hear him if he opens the 

screen door and yells, police? Why doesn't that meet 

the requirement? I -- this -- why is the trial court 

obsessed with knocking? 

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, and I think the 

reason the -- the trial court and -- is concerned about 

the knocking issue is it's, if you will, the baseline 

requirement under the Fourth Amendment, under the facts 

of this case, was to make their presence known by 

knocking. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the -- as I 

understand the -- the trial court, he accepted the 

probability that the knock would be futile, and yet he 

thought as a formality it was nonetheless required. A, 

do you understand the trial court to have taken that 

position? And B, if it did, do you believe that is 

correct as a statement of Fourth Amendment law? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Justice Souter. 

I didn't catch the first A part. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did -- do you 

understand the trial court to have taken the position 

that even though the knock would probably have been 

futile, the police were required to -- to make it 

anyway, to knock anyway? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: That is what the trial court 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and do you understand 

that to be a Fourth Amendment requirement, i.e., no

futility exception? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I do, Your Honor, and I know 

that that's a -- a complicated issue, but it's still a 

requirement. But further, the court -- the trial court 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should there be no 

futility exception? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Well, even if there is, Your 

Honor, the trial court did not just say that -- there 

-- he -- the evidence was gone because of the failure 

to knock. The trial court found that the exigencies, 

as well as the appellate courts, didn't rise to the 

level which would require entry into the home. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that -- that may be on 

your argument that noise is never sufficient to 

dispense with a warrant requirement. But it seems to 

me that in -- in the reasonableness analysis that the 

trial court was going through, the trial court was 

saying even if it would probably be futile, it is not a 

reasonable entry without a knock. And -- and I take it 

you -- you accept that and you think the trial court 

was correct, that there is no futility exception. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I -- I agree, Your Honor, 

and this is why. Under, I believe, Wilson v. --

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, first, it 

wouldn't have taken any effort at all to follow through 

on this, and even though this Court has ruled that, you 

know, there is mandatory knock and announce -- or 

requirement, with some exceptions, I don't believe that 

this is one of those exceptions. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No one is denying that. I 

mean, we've had a knock and announcement requirement 

for 900 years. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is do you 

have to knock and announce when, on the facts before 

you, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and 

it will just be a wasted gesture. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Because, Your Honor, it's 

our position that it's one of the -- the threshold 

requirements to protect somebody when they're inside 

their home is to make that effort. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the standard of 

the Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, and 

isn't there something bizarre about saying 

reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?

 MR. STUDEBAKER: That was the finding of the 

court, Your Honor, the trial court, that it was futile. 

But, again, when an officer is placed in that 

situation to say that if an officer can decide whether 

something is futile or not, that could actually -- then 

that exception, if we're not careful, absorb that rule. 

So I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, that's why courts 

review these things. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Correct, and that is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if the court says, yes, 

based on the evidence before me, it would have been 

futile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness 

requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand 

the knock anyway? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Personally? Yes. Legally? 

No. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I mean, I am not going to 

try -- but, again, this Court -- the -- the courts 

below did say that that exigent circumstances didn't 

rise to the level --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the -- where did 

the trial court say that in the findings of fact?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the 

findings of fact. They're in the petition appendix at 

page 46 and 47. I don't see anything that has been 

specifically identified by the finder of fact as 

inadequate, other than the failure to knock. Where --

where did the -- where does the court say it doesn't 

rise to the level of exigent circumstances? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, if I look at 

paragraph 5 of the joint appendix -- or I'm sorry -- of 

the -- of the order, it says, at that point in time the 

court finds no exigent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is it? Where is it? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. In 

the petition for cert filed by the State of Utah, and 

it would be appendix page 47. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but what it says 

right after that to explain is it would have been 

sufficient. What he -- what he should have done was 

knock, and that would have supplied all that was 

necessary. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, and again, this 

isn't the, maybe, best worded order that the city had 

prepared in this case when they -- when the -- it was 

actually the city that prepared this, Petitioners. 

When I look at it, I look at two different sentences

there. There was no exigent circumstances, and 

further, what he should have done was knock. 

But further, the two appellate courts that 

heard this matter before, did rule on the exigent 

circumstances because that's what the Petitioners in 

this Court had brought before the appellate courts, and 

they found that in both the Utah Court of Appeals and 

the Utah Supreme Court, that the exigent circumstances 

weren't sufficient enough. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, maybe -- maybe 

you're taking our announce and a knock -- knock and 

announce requirement too -- too seriously or too 

literally. I mean, if a police officer comes up and 

the door is open, what does he have to do? Lean over 

and knock on the side of the door? Can't he shout, 

hello, police? Don't you think that satisfies a knock 

and announce requirement? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You really think you got to 

knock even when the door is open. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, under the 

situation, he's got to make his presence known. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And he did that here. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He stood at the door. He

opened the screen door and said, police --

MR. STUDEBAKER: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which he thought would be 

more effective than knocking on -- on the -- you know, 

the -- the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a 

very good knock. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. STUDEBAKER: And once he raised his 

voice, though, Your Honor, and -- and made himself a 

little bit more vocal, then they noticed him there. 

And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they still didn't 

stop. I -- I read somewhere in the facts that only 

gradually, as each participant in the melee became 

aware of his presence, did they sort of stop. It 

wasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieted 

down immediately. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Chief Justice, like you say, 

once they made their presence known, it dissipated. 

The -- the position would be if they can make their 

presence known inside the home, they can make their 

presence known outside the home and still protect that 

sanctity of the home that we're trying to insure that 

people are protected in within their home.

agreement that they couldn't have made their presence 

known because the noise inside was so loud that they 

would not have been heard. 

MR. STUDEBAKER: That's what the -- the lower 

courts have found to be true. But Justice --

currently, Justice Ginsburg, they found it to be true 

that the exigent circumstances we're not met under 

these facts. It wasn't serious enough to enter the 

home without the warrant, and I think that's the pivot 

point. Where is that line on the exigent 

circumstances? And our position would be that that 

line -- that it's got to be serious, it's got to be 

imminent, it's got to be an ongoing situation, 

something where somebody is either going to get 

seriously injured, evidence is going to be destroyed, 

somebody is going to flee. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was there anything in 

the facts that a reasonable officer would know from 

looking in the window to suggest that these -- the 

adults were not -- did not have the intention of 

inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young 

man that they were restraining? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Based upon the officer's 

testimony at the suppression hearing, Your Honor, it 

would be that did they not have a serious intention to

harm him is the fact that, one, there was nothing 

showing that they were actually doing anything more 

than restraining them, that juvenile. There's nothing 

in the record that shows that they were beating on him, 

that they were molesting him, or you know --

JUSTICE ALITO: They had -- did they have any 

reason to know why they were holding him? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: I would say that they would, 

Justice Alito, and this is why. You know, all that 

they were saying was they were trying to get the -- the 

juvenile to calm down. They were trying to get him to 

settle down. This was a situation where the officer 

testified that -- at the suppression hearing, that 

there was alcohol involved, that there was a minor. 

Those types of situations don't demonstrate the fact 

that this was an ongoing violent situation. 

Again -- and then further, the officers were 

called out for a party. They weren't called out for a 

fight in progress or -- or some type of physical 

altercation. They were called out because somebody had 

a loud disturbance going on. And those facts in my 

mind's eye don't rise to the level and would show the 

officer -- especially when the officer is standing 

outside the home watching this event, that there's 

nothing that -- that would rise to the level of

entering the home under the exigent circumstances. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Utah Supreme Court 

seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah 

protection against the -- the counterpart to the Fourth 

Amendment. They seemed to suggest that their own 

constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy 

of the home. Was there a reason why you argued only the 

U.S. Constitution and not the State constitution? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Justice Ginsburg, I was not 

the trial counsel below or at the appellate court, so I 

cannot determine what his matter was or what -- what 

his basis was for that decision. And it -- then it 

would appear that you're correct in the fact that the 

Utah Supreme Court is concerned upon that issue. But 

the fact is that it seems to have been briefed under 

the Fourth Amendment, has come up under the Fourth 

Amendment issues, and so that's what we're -- we're 

looking at. 

And even though a State, obviously, can give 

more protections to its citizens under a State 

constitution, the Fourth Amendment is still a -- if you 

will, a baseline requirement, and it still applies to 

Federal criminal courts. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I don't think 

the charges are in the record. At least I missed them.

They were charged with -- what are the charges and how

suppressed the evidence. I suppose the proceedings 

were dismissed, were they? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Your Honor, the proceedings 

have been dismissed against my clients. That is 

correct. 

And to answer the Court's question, the 

charges that they were facing was intoxication -- no. 

I'm sorry. Disorderly conduct, intoxication, and 

contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: What are the penalties for 

those charges? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: Worst case scenario, Your 

Honor, they could be charged with up to 6 months in the 

county jail, each one consecutive to each other.

we're resolving today.

evidence was -- that was suppressed was everything that

The answer to Your Honor's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Couldn't they have 

gotten all -- wouldn't he have been able to testify to 

all of that without even entering the home? 

MR. STUDEBAKER: They could have, Your Honor. 

However, they -- they did not. The prosecutor at the 

time didn't proceed under that issue. I'm not aware of 

why he did, but what we have, though, is obviously that --

that may have happened. And as the Court addressed 

previously, there may have been then an issue related 

to the curtilage which would have had to have been 

addressed or discussed. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but among the evidence 

they did have were the two -- two teenagers are 

drinking beer in the backyard. So they pretty clearly 

had the alcohol -- they could have gotten that in 

evidence.

that it could have been built into the curtilage --

enter the home without getting a warrant. 

And in the alternative, if they look at 

emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency 

aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our 

opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to 

look at probable cause. We have to look at their 

intent to enter because there's no probable cause to 

enter if they're performing that caretaking role to 

protect people. 

Obviously, the ultimate concern in -- in any 

type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home. 

It becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are 

-- are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the 

credibility of the people who testify, and then also 

take into account the constitutional protections which 

the parties are awarded.

 And we believe that based upon the facts and 

the evidence that were -- was presented, that the three 

different Utah courts that heard this matter were 

appropriate in their -- in their suppression decisions. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Gray, you have 6 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. GRAY 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. GRAY: Just a matter of clarification 

initially. Disorderly conduct is a class C 

misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail under 

the -- how it was charged here. Also intoxication is a 

class C misdemeanor, and contributing to the 

delinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor, 

punishable by up to 6 months in jail. So that's --

that's what -- but the officers -- and again, this case 

isn't about what they were ultimately charged with. 

It's whether or not they had a reasonable basis to 

believe that immediate intervention was necessary. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think the 

evidence that was available without going in the house 

would have supported all those charges? 

MR. GRAY: Not the intoxication. The 

intoxication has to be --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But two teenagers in the 

backyard were intoxicated. 

MR. GRAY: The -- the juveniles. But the 

defendants in this case were the adults inside the 

home. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, they charge that the 

adults were intoxicated. 

MR. GRAY: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's a serious 

crime in Utah I guess. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GRAY: We anticipated that comment 

actually. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GRAY: And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And what's your response? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GRAY: Normally -- normally intoxication 

-- we think of it as -- as public intoxication, and --

and that's where it's usually prosecuted and where we 

find it. But intoxication that can become an offense 

where it disturbs others outside of the home, and 

that's what happened here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you have --

you have two questions presented. The second is

whether this was sufficiently -- sufficiently exigent 

to fall under the exigent circumstances. But the first 

was whether the test should turn on the officer's 

subjective motivation. I haven't heard much 

about that this morning. How is that presented on 

these facts? 

MR. GRAY: Well, the court created two 

different tests. The Utah court created two different 

tests. And under the one test, it examined whether or 

not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire 

to arrest or search for evidence. Now, the court, the 

Utah Supreme Court, concluded that they did -- that 

they were -- their motives were primarily law 

enforcement motives because they did not render aid. 

And this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's 

subjective motives play no part in the objective 

reasonableness test, and it should not do so here. 

Justice Ginsburg, you indicated that there 

was no -- no suggestion of domestic violence. The Utah 

Supreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence 

is seen in a home between adults and, for example, a 

younger person, that there would be reason to believe 

that domestic violence is possibly present. And that's 

what -- now, the court refused to look at that because 

there was no finding that the inhabitants or the --

those involved were actually cohabitants. 

Of course, this Court has never required that 

officers have a certainty of the situation, only a 

reasonable belief, and they clearly have that. 

And in any event, whether or not it's 

domestic violence or some other type of violence, it's 

something that I believe this Court in Mincey 

recognized, that officers can and -- and probably 

should -- maybe they didn't go that far, but it would be 

our position that officers should intervene in the face of 

violence, and that's what the officers did here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: My point was simply that 

this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse. This 

was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night, 

so that the -- the police response was to the noise, 

not to the violence. 

MR. GRAY: The initial response was clearly 

to the noise, but once the officers arrived, it became 

apparent that there was violence ongoing in the house 

and that's how the officers proceeded. 

If there are no further questions, we would 

ask the Court to reverse the decision of the Utah 

Supreme Court. Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
