 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 10-699, Zivotofsky v. 

Clinton.

 Mr. Lewin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LEWIN: Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 In its recent decisions in Medellin v. Texas 

and in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, this Court approved and 

applied the familiar tripartite scheme that Justice 

Jackson articulated in the Steel Seizure case. When the 

President takes measures incompatible with the expressed 

or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest 

ebb. In that instance, said Justice Jackson, his claim 

to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be 

scrutinized with caution to preserve the equilibrium 

established by our constitutional system.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Lewin, what power 

is Congress exercising here?

 MR. LEWIN: Justice Kagan, Congress has 

exercised its power over passport -- the issuance of 

passports under the immigration, naturalization, and

foreign commerce powers that Congress has. It has 

enacted passport legislation back in 1856, in 1926. It 

can control what the contents of a passport ought to be, 

what its duration may be, how the application is to be 

made. And we say this is an identification -­

JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think -­

MR. LEWIN: -- portion of the passport.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's relevant 

that the title of section 214 is "United States Policy 

With Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel"?

 MR. LEWIN: Well, we think -- and we've 

cited I guess in footnote 2 of our brief a number of 

recent cases of this Court that have said that you take 

each statutory provision independently and determine its 

constitutionality. True, Congress has a broader view 

with regard to the policy of Jerusalem being part of 

Israel than the executive branch has had since 1948. 

However, that purpose is not determinative of what the 

constitutionality is of subsection (d). Moreover -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say, Mr. Lewin, 

that -- you're not claiming exclusivity in Congress. 

You say foreign relations is a shared power. So, if it 

is a shared power, why does Congress trump the 

executive?

 MR. LEWIN: Because -- precisely because

under the standard of the Steel Seizure case and this 

tripartite scheme, if Congress determines that what the 

President has done -- and this is a statute which is 

really very narrow and deals with past conduct by the 

executive branch, as it were. It does not hobble the 

President in terms of future foreign policy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your -- under 

your theory -- and this is just following on Justice 

Ginsburg's question, I think. Under your theory, what 

foreign relations determinations are for the President 

alone to make?

 MR. LEWIN: Foreign relations determinations 

are not left to the President alone.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any foreign 

relations determinations that are for the President 

alone to make under your theory of the case?

 MR. LEWIN: Yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And those are?

 MR. LEWIN: Those are diplomatic 

communications. In other, it's the President who 

makes -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, who gets 

the telegram or something?

 MR. LEWIN: Well, who issues the 

communication to the foreign government, who

determines -- there are certain things that the 

President alone does because he's the one who implements 

foreign policy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any treatise 

writer or decision of this Court that supports such a 

narrow, crabbed interpretation of the President's 

foreign affairs power?

 MR. LEWIN: Well, with all respect, 

Justice Kennedy, we don't think it's crabbed. We think 

that that is exactly what Justice Jackson was referring 

to, and that's what this Court has said in the Medellin 

case and -- and in Hamdan as well, that if -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course -­

MR. LEWIN: Congress does not authorize -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in part the Jackson 

tripartite division, this famous division he had, I 

think assumes the validity of the congressional statute 

at the first step of inquiry. And here that's the whole 

question.

 MR. LEWIN: I don't know whether it's 

limited to the assumption with regard to the 

congressional statute. If Congress says, as it did in 

this case, we disapprove of the State Department's view 

that passports should not contain the -- the 

identification of Israel for people who were born in

Jerusalem, that is Congress disapproving of what the 

State Department and past State Department policy has 

been.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Lewin, you were cut 

off earlier when you were saying this reading doesn't 

hobble the President in the future.

 It says anybody born in -- in Jerusalem can 

have Israel listed, correct? What happens if there's a 

peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to 

sovereignty over Jerusalem? Is the President free to 

stop listing Israel on the passport?

 MR. LEWIN: If -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or does he have to wait 

for Congress to change the law?

 MR. LEWIN: I think he does have to wait for 

Congress to change the law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, you are hobbling the 

President with respect to situations that occur 

frequently -­

MR. LEWIN: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as happened in Egypt, 

sometimes overnight.

 MR. LEWIN: No, but it may in some way, in a 

very remote possible way -- I mean, I think under those 

circumstances, if there were a peace treaty and if

Jerusalem were handed over to a Palestinian state, I 

think Congress would repeal the statute.

 That's the point. Congress has the power, 

has the authority under the Constitution to enact laws, 

and it is Congress that makes the decision even with 

regard to foreign policy issues.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Constitution 

requires ambassadors to be appointed with the consent of 

the Senate. It gives Congress the power of the purse. 

So, why don't -- why isn't the better view that we let 

Congress express its approval and disapproval in the 

mechanism set up by the Constitution to do so? Meaning, 

if the President recognizes a country that Congress 

doesn't want it to recognize, it can withhold approval 

of an ambassador. It could refuse to fund the embassy. 

It could do many other things.

 But what entitles Congress to trench on a 

presidential power that has been exercised virtually 

since the beginning of the country?

 MR. LEWIN: With all respect, Justice 

Sotomayor, I think history demonstrates that that's 

simply not true, that in fact Congress has had equal, 

quote, "recognition power," if in fact that's a power 

rather than a ceremonial duty. We have in our reply 

brief gone through the fact that from Presidents Monroe,

Jackson, Taylor, Lincoln, and even at the time of 

President McKinley, Congress said: We have the 

authority to be recognized -- to recognize.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Lewin, this gets back to 

the question of exactly what congressional power you're 

basing your argument on. You started by saying you were 

basing it on Congress's passport power, which is a 

function of its control over immigration issues. Now 

you're saying Congress has a co-equal recognition power. 

Which is it, or is it both?

 MR. LEWIN: No. It's in the alternative, 

Justice Kagan; it is both. We submit first of all there 

is no exclusive recognition power in the President, if 

there is a recognition power, and we spell that out.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that go the full 

length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the 

United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of 

Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital 

of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were 

the law. I take it, from everything you've argued, your 

position would be, yes, Congress has that authority.

 MR. LEWIN: We say Congress has that 

authority, but I have to add, Justice Ginsburg, that 

Congress has been very careful in the past and we 

believe it will be in the future to give the President

broad authority. To the extent Congress has tried to do 

that, Congress has consistently said that the President 

can waive the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem, 

because Congress recognizes -- this is one of these very 

rare situations where Congress has said what the 

President has done and what the Department of State has 

done is simply wrong.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Lewin, you're -- it 

seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal 

congressional power; you're arguing for a superior 

congressional power. You're saying whatever Congress 

says, the President has to comply with. Now, that's 

quite different from saying that they both have 

authority in the field. And if they both have authority 

in the field and they're exercising it in different 

fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene. 

I would let -- I would let them conduct the usual 

inter-branch hand wrestling that goes on all the time, 

which probably means that if Congress cares enough, 

Congress will win because, as you say, it has an 

innumerable number of clubs with which to beat the 

executive.

 But if -- if the power is a co-equal power 

and they're both exercising it in a -- in a different 

way, why don't we just, you know, let them go at it?

Why is it any of our business which is the better 

foreign policy position?

 MR. LEWIN: We are not -- the Court is not 

being asked to determine what is the better foreign 

policy position. Congress has determined and -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Congress is supreme, then? 

That is your position. Not -- not that Congress has 

co-equal authority with the executive, but Congress is 

supreme.

 MR. LEWIN: No, there's two aspects to this, 

Justice Scalia. One is the recognition power. As to 

the recognition power, if it exists, Congress has it 

together with the President. But with regard to foreign 

policy and with regard to the question of whether 

Congress can trump the President, this is not a new 

proposition. The Court determined it in the Steel 

Seizure case. The Court more recently, in -- in 

approving Justice Jackson's tripartite scheme, approved 

it in Medellin v. Texas.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Medellin 

involved a situation where the President's purported 

exercise of authority changed domestic law, and not 

simply domestic law, but domestic State law. That seems 

to me to be quite a distinguishable circumstance.

 MR. LEWIN: But what -- again, what Justice

Jackson said was that when there -- the two are 

incompatible, then you look, the Court looks and 

scrutinizes, "subjects to scrutiny" -- those words are 

in Justice Jackson's standard -- scrutinizes what the 

President has done.

 And we submit in this case, if the Court 

were to look at the answers to the interrogatories in 

this case, what is the basis for the President's policy, 

if one scrutinizes it, we say in our brief, it's -- we 

call it trivial because what happens is the Department 

of State has said -- and, again, this is important in 

terms of this statute. All that happens with this 

statute is that 50,000 American citizens have the same 

passport as 100,000 other American citizens who were 

born in Tel Aviv or Haifa. It just says "Israel"; it 

doesn't say "Jerusalem, Israel"; it just says "Israel." 

And the State Department says that's justified because 

Arab countries or Palestinians may be upset if they 

misperceive -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- so, you're 

suggesting that the outcome of this of case would be 

different, from your perspective, if Congress said you 

have to say "Jerusalem, Israel."

 MR. LEWIN: I say it's a different case, 

yes, absolutely. In this case, what -- the important

thing about this case and this statute is that it gives 

the individual passport holder a choice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it -- why is 

it a different case?

 MR. LEWIN: It's a different case because if 

it were to say "Jerusalem, Israel," there would be more 

of an argument. Again, I'm not saying I would be here 

acknowledging that that's impermissible. But there 

would be more of an argument that it appears to be some 

official approval of Jerusalem being in Israel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, would there be 

-- there would be a greater concern -- the concern on 

the part of the executive that there would be adverse 

political reaction would have a greater degree of 

credibility?

 MR. LEWIN: Somewhat greater degree.

 Again -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so, we're 

supposed to decide whether or not the executive is 

correct in saying that it's a significant problem. And 

he says, well, he says that, but we know foreign policy 

better; we don't think it's going to be a big deal.

 MR. LEWIN: No, I don't think the Court is 

being asked to decide a question of foreign policy. 

Congress has decided that saying "Israel" alone does not

present a foreign policy issue. Congress recognized 

that, with moving the embassy, there might be a foreign 

policy issue. So, they said that the President can 

waive that.

 With regard to this provision, Congress has 

said, no, there's not likely to be any foreign policy 

harm. And all that the Court is being asked to do is 

it's being asked to enforce the congressional 

conclusion, which is, we submit, exactly what the third 

level under Justice Jackson's test is: That if, in 

fact, Congress decides that what the President has 

concluded or the executive branch has concluded is 

wrong, it may -- and it has the constitutional power to 

say -- with regard to foreign policy, we can exercise 

our determination.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see Justice 

Jackson's analysis -- what he's saying -- and I guess I 

don't think it's as controlling as others might. He's 

saying when there's a conflict, it's a harder case.

 MR. LEWIN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When there's -- when 

they agree, it's an easy case. When you can't tell, 

it's sort of a middle case. I don't see how that's very 

helpful in resolving the dispute before us.

 MR. LEWIN: Well, because he says that when

it's in the third category, the Court has an obligation, 

under those circumstances if it's going to keep the 

equilibrium of the balance of powers, to look at what 

the President's justification is.

 The word "scrutiny" is in there. That's not 

simply a phrase that Justice Jackson has taken out of 

the air. He says you're supposed to scrutinize it. And 

if you scrutinize it in this case, there's nothing other 

than the possibility that there would be a misperception 

by Palestinians. That's what the State Department is 

saying.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were we 

scrutinizing in the Steel Seizure case?

 MR. LEWIN: I think in the Steel Seizure 

case, the Court was scrutinizing whether -­

notwithstanding the fact that Congress did not give the 

President the power to seize steel mills, nonetheless 

whether there could be some justification that, even in 

-- contrary to Congress's wishes, the President would be 

able to exercise that power.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what presidential power 

would have supported that, the war power?

 MR. LEWIN: Well, possibly the claim that as 

Commander in Chief under -- in the time of the Korean 

War he would be able -­

President's power even though it was -­

there's a difference.

 MR. LEWIN: Well, but that's -- that's an a 

fortiori situation, Justice Kennedy. If Congress didn't 

even say you may not seize steel mills, but simply 

because they didn't give the President affirmatively the 

authority -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it is if you assume 

that the statute is valid.

 MR. LEWIN: Well, but the statute in this 

case -- again I come back to the fact that the statute 

in this case is a passport statute.

Congress's declaration of a foreign policy, as opposed 

to Congress's exercise of power relating to immigration 

control. So, convince me that I am wrong on that.

 MR. LEWIN: I think you are wrong on that, 

Justice, and let me explain why.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LEWIN: Let me explain why. Because it 

is clear from the history of this line on the passport 

that it is purely an identification of the individual; 

it is not an exercise of any foreign policy. Indeed, 

the passport statute itself says that a passport is "any

travel document issued by competent authority showing 

the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality." And in 

this case, the history of this line on the passport 

demonstrates, I think conclusively, and the State 

Department has acknowledged it, that it is purely a 

means of identification.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you suggesting -­

MR. LEWIN: And what Congress has said is, 

with regard to these citizens, we will permit them to 

identify themselves, like Congress permitted the 

Taiwanese to identify themselves.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But are you suggesting 

Congress enacted this because they thought that if these 

individuals' passports simply said "Jerusalem," there 

would be an identification problem?

 MR. LEWIN: Not be -- Justice Alito, it's 

not because there would be an identification problem. 

But there was -- Congress recognized that with regard to 

the 50,000 people who have a passport that says 

"Jerusalem," they are being denied a certain sense of 

self-respect that they feel they should be able to have 

in terms of their own identification.

 This is not a statute that's designed to 

create some political brouhaha or -- or make a foreign 

policy statement. It's a statute that, frankly, fits in

individual passport holders. The State Department says 

if you're a Palestinian or an Arab and you were born in 

Haifa and you don't like seeing "Israel" on your 

passport, we'll allow you to eliminate "Israel" from 

your passport. And all that Congress has said is -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: That might be true, Mr. 

Lewin. I think you would have a better argument if this 

statute said if you were born in Jerusalem, you can pick 

anything you want in your passport; you can pick 

Jerusalem, you can pick Israel, or you can pick 

Palestine. But the statute in fact doesn't say that. 

It says you can pick Israel.

 So, why isn't that a statement of foreign 

policy as to recognition that Jerusalem is the capital 

of Israel, as opposed to what you're characterizing it 

as, which is a freedom of -- you know, a sort of choice 

provision?

 MR. LEWIN: I think that's -- what you said 

the statute doesn't say, Justice Kagan, is exactly what 

the statute does say. The statute does say that the 

individual passport holder can choose to say "Israel" or 

can keep it as "Jerusalem," and if he's born before 

1948, he can say "Palestine." So, it is an individual 

choice.

reflection on my own seniority that -­

 MR. LEWIN: -- it's my generation that fits

that that's all that the statute does. The statute is a 

means of permitting self-identification by an American 

citizen who says: My birth in Jerusalem, indeed in West 

Jerusalem, which has always been recognized to be part 

of Israel -- I want to call -- I want my passport to say 

"Israel."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's recognizing 

that principle only with respect to a particular 

jurisdiction. An American citizen born in Northern 

Ireland doesn't have this option, because he thinks 

that's part of Ireland.

 MR. LEWIN: No, but an American citizen born 

in Taiwan apparently does have that option, even the 

though the United States says we don't recognize Taiwan 

as an independent country.

because of a State Department judgment that in one 

situation, it's significant; in the other, it's not.

 MR. LEWIN: Well, it's -- no, it's not just 

because. It's because what happens is there is a 

recognition in both cases that it is a personal 

identification choice with regard to what goes on the 

passport. Sure, in that case, the State Department 

didn't take it to litigation, although I submit that had 

they chosen to litigate that case, they would have a 

stronger position than they have in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But a personal 

identification choice can also have significant foreign 

policy implications, can it not? Is -- is that an 

either-or situation?

 What the State Department is saying is to 

allow this particular personal identification choice may 

antagonize some foreign nations that we don't want to 

antagonize.

 What if they gave them the choice of saying 

"Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East"? Okay? 

That's their choice. They can have that on their 

passport. Would that be okay?

Court's view about Congress's power with regard to (a) 

passports -- and again, I go back to the fact that in 

Zemel v. Rusk, in Haig v. Agee, in Kent v. Dulles, in 

all these passport cases, this Court said we look to see 

whether what the President does is authorized by 

Congress, whether implicitly or otherwise. So that, I 

submit, that with regard to passports, you need the 

congressional authority, whether it's implicit or 

express.

 And with regard to your question, 

Justice Scalia, yes, Congress could in an exercise of 

its passport authority say here is what the passport has 

to say. It would be a foolish statute. But this Court 

has said, and I think you, Justice Scalia, have said it 

many times, it's not the Court's job to determine 

whether Congress is foolish or not. If Congress decides 

that, look, somebody born in Israel, a passport should 

say "Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East," 

Congress can say that. Congress has passport authority.

that you're skipping over the question that the D.C. 

Circuit decided. I take it your view is it's not a 

political question; so, the Court should resolve the 

merits.

 MR. LEWIN: Our view is it's not a political 

question because it is like many other questions that 

affect foreign policy. And the Court said in Baker v. 

Carr, not every decision that touches on foreign affairs 

or foreign policy is a political question that can't be 

determined. It -- it -- arguably, according to the 

Government, this affects foreign policy. We say it is 

simply Congress having passed a statute which either is 

unconstitutional -- we say it is constitutional -­

either is unconstitutional or the Court should simply 

enforce it, like in the Japan Whaling case.

 In the Japan Whaling case, this Court 

rejected the claim that the outcome of a determination 

by the Court might very well affect foreign relations, 

and it said it's not a political question.

 I'd like to reserve the remaining time for 

rebuttal. Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 The executive has determined that the 

passports it issues should not identify Israel as the 

place of birth for persons born in Jerusalem. 

Petitioner seeks relief under section 214(d) that would 

countermand that executive judgment. But under the 

Constitution, that is an exercise of the executive's 

exclusive recognition power. The Constitution commits 

that power exclusively to the executive, and neither a 

court nor the Congress can override that judgment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What of all the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend 

documented contrary history at some length in his reply 

brief, where from the beginning at least, as he says, 

through the McKinley Administration, the two branches 

acted as if they had co-equal authority.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, if I 

might spend a minute or two on that history, because I 

don't think it shows what my friend suggests that it 

does.

 Before getting to the starting point of that 

story, which I think is the Monroe administration, I

1 would like to point out that in the Washington 

2 administration, the President confronted the question 

3 with respect to whether to recognize the revolutionary 

4 government of France. And President Washington 

consulted with his cabinet, and, of course, his cabinet 

6 included Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton and Jay. 

7 And they decided that this was a power that was 

8 exclusive to the President to such an extent that they 

9 didn't even need to send a message to the Congress that 

they were going to recognize the new revolutionary 

11 government in France. 

12  Now, the second fact that I think is 

13 critical as a matter of history is that there is not a 

14 single piece of legislation that has passed both houses 

of Congress and come to the President purporting to 

16 recognize a foreign nation or a territorial boundary of 

17 a foreign nation. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Has there ever been an 

19 instance in which the President has recognized a foreign 

government over Congress's sustained objection? 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't -- I can't think of 

22 an instance of Congress's sustained objection. I think 

23 probably the closest we would come is the revolutionary 

24 government of Mexico, which President Wilson first 

recognized on a de facto basis in 1915 and a de jure

basis in 1917. Congress indicated displeasure with 

that. President Wilson sent his message to Congress 

saying that this is an exclusive executive function. 

Congress backed down.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are then the reasons 

that -- because your friend says that this is an a 

fortiori case from everything, because all of these 

words -- every time the word "exclusive power" has 

appeared in any source -- I think that's what you're 

saying -- it is meant that the President can act without 

supporting authority from Congress. But there never has 

been a case or a suggestion that the President can act 

where Congress has legislated to the contrary. Now, I 

think that's the -- that's the argument. And so, what 

-- I would like to hear what you have to say about that 

argument.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Yes, I will answer 

that question directly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: It is true that the Court 

has never before, with respect to the recognition power, 

confronted the question of whether the President is free 

to act in a manner different than a congressional 

command because Congress has never purported to issue a 

command. That does not mean, however, that my friend is

correct that this is a situation in which Congress has 

the authority to countermand or direct the decision of 

the President.

 This is, we submit -- even if one thinks 

about this as a Youngstown category three case, this is 

a Youngstown category three case of the kind that 

Justice Jackson identified in footnote 4, where he cited 

Myers v. The United States. The kind of case in 

category three of Youngstown, in which the President's 

judgment can prevail even over a contrary judgment of 

Congress, is a case in which the President has exclusive 

authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now -­

GENERAL VERRILLI: And that is this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But my question is, what 

leads you to that conclusion?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, let me -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What are -- there are very, 

very few cases I can ever think of where -- where the

act contrary to a statute. And so, the point of my

GENERAL VERRILLI: So, I do think, if I 

could -- I think it would be helpful in answering your 

question, Justice Breyer, if I could return to the Chief 

Justice's question about history. Moving beyond that 

initial recognition by Washington that this is an 

exclusive power, which I think is quite significant, 

when we get to the Monroe administration, there is a 

fight between Clay and Monroe about whether the 

President has exclusive authority to recognize the new 

South American republics.

 Now, a couple of points there. I think the 

-- what -- the only thing that one could point to as an 

action by the Congress that even implicates the 

recognition power is one house of Congress passed an 

appropriations measure for an ambassador. What the -­

the history treatise, the Goebel treatise that my friend 

cites, says on page 133, the very page that he cites in 

his reply brief, is that Clay's effort to contest the 

President's exclusive authority came to a, quote, 

"inglorious end," unquote.

 He then goes on to say -- my friend goes on 

to say, well, but a year later when President Monroe 

sought to actually recognize these South American 

republics, he asked -- he asked the Congress to join him 

in it. What he asked Congress for was an appropriation

for an ambassador. But it was not the sending of an 

ambassador to the Republic of Colombia that was the 

recognition. It was when President Monroe received an 

ambassador from Colombia that constituted the 

recognition, and that was an exclusive act that he 

undertook without any consultation with Congress. 

Now -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The two examples that are 

given in the brief, one of Texas, where Petitioner says 

there was a case where Congress went first -- Congress 

recognized and the President acquiesced, and the same 

thing with Taiwan; it was a statute and the President 

implemented it. So, if the -- Congress thought it had 

the authority, the recognition authority, in those two 

measures, and the President acquiesced.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I'd like to address Texas 

because I do think that's probably the most significant 

example that my friend's identified. But even there, I 

think if one works through the history, we'll see that 

it's an exclusive executive power.

 President Jackson, in his first letter in 

1836 to the Congress, says essentially: I hear you; you 

think we should recognize Texas. And then he says: 

It's an open question as far as I am concerned whether 

there's exclusive authority or not. It's not been

something that the legislature has ever studied, but as 

a matter of expediency, he says, we don't need to 

resolve that question, because I want to work with you. 

He then goes on to caution the Congress to not move too 

quickly for fear of precipitating war with Mexico, which 

I think, Justice Breyer, I'll try to return to a 

functional analysis later, and that's, I think, an 

important point.

 What -- then -- but I think what's 

important, Justice Ginsburg, is that what Congress did 

next was to pass two appropriations measures, one in the 

House, one in the Senate. Each of those measures 

appropriates funds for an emissary to the Republic of 

Texas, but each includes language that says: At such 

time that the President determines that it's appropriate 

to do so.

 If one looks at the page in the 

Congressional Globe that my friend cites, one will see 

that that language was added because, as originally 

introduced, the appropriations riders were objected to 

by members of Congress on the ground that they infringed 

on the President's exclusive recognition authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could 

stop you and just have you address the political 

question doctrine.

GENERAL VERRILLI: Sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say this is 

exclusively committed to the President, and, therefore, 

it is a non-justiciable political question. How is that 

different from saying it's our job to decide cases, it 

is justiciable, and then you can argue that the answer 

of that analysis is that it's exclusively committed to 

the President? I don't understand why labeling it a 

political question advances the analysis much.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think we agree, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that there isn't a very great deal 

of difference. We acknowledge that in conducting the 

political question analysis, that it is for the Court to 

decide whether there's a textual commitment to the 

executive; it is for the Court to decide the scope. We 

think that's what Nixon v. United States says; it's what 

Powell v. McCormack says; and that in answering those 

questions, we think that the Court will have gone a very 

long way to determining the question of the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not all the way? 

mean, if the Court decides that the Constitution commits 

this authority exclusively to the President, then it's 

all over. That's the merits of the case: Does the 

President have this authority? So, the political 

question label seems to be kind of a -- a subterfuge

because if there is a textual commission -- commitment 

to the President, that's the end of the case.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the -- I do think 

that with respect to the first Baker v. Carr factor, 

textual commitment is a factor that the Court has 

indicated is one that can lead to the conclusion that 

it's a political question.

 I do think that the Court has to go through 

the analysis. And so, at the end of the day, there may 

not be very much of a difference -- ­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't it depend on 

what the question is? In order to decide whether it's a 

political question, you have to identify the question. 

Now, if the question is whether the President has 

exclusive authority with respect to the formal 

recognition of a foreign country, that might be one 

thing. But what if the question is whether the 

President has exclusive jurisdiction with respect -- has 

plenary authority, unreviewable authority, with respect 

to anything that the President thinks has a bearing on 

the question of recognition.

 Now, if that's the question, is that 

committed exclusively to the President?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito, we 

don't -- we think Powell v. McCormack and Nixon say

that the question of -- not just the question of 

commitment, but also the question of scope, are questions 

for the Court to decide.

 And we do think, with respect to the 

question here, that even though it's for the Court to 

decide, it's for the Court to decide with a very 

significant measure of deference, because when -- the 

decision by the executive with respect to how it's going 

to handle the status of Jerusalem in passports is a very 

sensitive and delicate matter. This position was 

arrived at after very careful thought, and it is 

enforced very carefully. And I think from that should 

come the lesson that this -- and the reason is because 

the executive believes that the statement on the 

passport has to be understood as a manifestation of the 

President's exercise of the recognition power.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose this, General 

Verrilli: Suppose that this statute -- there was the 

section that's there now, and then there was another 

section, and the section said: The recording of Israel 

as a place of birth on a passport shall not constitute 

recognition of Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.

 Would that be constitutional?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I don't think it 

would change the analysis, Justice Kagan. I -- I think

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, my statute has a title

 GENERAL VERRILLI: I still -- I still think 

that would be within the scope of the executive's power 

to decide because the content of the passport, insofar 

as the Executive believes that it constitutes an 

expression of -- of an incident of recognition, is a 

judgment that the executive makes.

 Now, the Court can review that, but the 

Court's review of it should be done with a significant 

measure of deference as the Court suggested in Regan v. 

Wald. Now -­

me that's, again with all due respect, not in the best 

interest of the ultimate argument you're making.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, we appreciate that, 

Justice Kennedy. We do think that in resolving a

analysis, the questions that the Court would need to 

decide under Nixon and Powell would go a very long way 

to clarifying that problem.

area in which the executive's got to make the judgment 

because it's of paramount importance that the nation 

speak with one voice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- General Verrilli, 

then you are taking the position that this is not a 

shared authority; it's an exclusive authority, that 

there is no role for Congress. Am I right? Or is there 

some role in recognition for -- for Congress?

Ginsburg, is that the recognition power is exclusive to 

the President.

recognition of a breakaway province of a foreign country 

by the United States will clearly provoke a war with

that the President shall not recognize that breakaway 

province, knowing -- knowing that if he does recognize 

it, that country will declare war on the United States?

4 States for the conduct of foreign policy, but to be the 

sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are 

6 two quite different things. To say he's the sole 

7 instrument simply means that congressmen traveling 

8 abroad or globetrotting ex-presidents -- nobody except 

9 the President of the United States pronounces the 

foreign policy. But it doesn't necessarily mean that 

11 the President determines everything in foreign policy. 

12  He's the instrument, but there is certainly 

13 room in those many cases for saying that Congress can 

14 say what the -- what it's -- what the country's 

instrument is supposed to do. 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I think with respect to 

17 the question of recognition, Justice Scalia, that it is 

18 a power that rests with the executive. And I think in 

19 addition to the history, in that we do -- now in 

220-plus years in our Constitution, do not have a single 

21 example of Congress actually exercising the power, and I 

22 think in addition to the history, there are very good 

23 functional reasons why that is so.

your earlier question, I think those are significant.

The exercise of the recognition power depends, we think, 

on three things that make it clear that it needs to be 

exclusive. The first is timing; the second is 

expertise; and the third is a need for secrecy.

 Timing -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear the third.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: The need for secrecy.

 Timing is -- I think the Israel example 

shows, is of critical importance. But it's not just 

speed. Of course, Congress can't act with the dispatch 

needed in a situation like the recognition of Israel. 

But the -- but apart from that, recognition -- a 

recognition that occurs too soon could send events in a 

direction that could be very disadvantageous to our 

foreign policy. A recognition that comes too late 

could -- could squander an important opportunity in the 

national interest in the foreign policy realm.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, is the 

textual basis for your argument that the President has 

exclusive power here? Is it the Receipt of Ambassadors 

Clause alone, or is it something else? Because I was 

frankly a little bit surprised that your brief put so 

much weight on that Receipt of Ambassadors Clause, which 

arguably was meant to give the President a purely 

ministerial function and so little weight on any other

1 power that the President has. 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: So -- here's our position on 

3 that, Justice Kagan: We do think that the Reception 

4 Clause is the source of the recognition power. Hamilton 

identified it as the source of the recognition power in 

6 the Washington administration. I think it's now 

7 understood that it's hornbook law that that's the 

8 textual source, but to the extent that -­

is.

17 doesn't say a whole lot.

19 say in addition, to the extent there is a question, we 

do think, as I think we indicated in our brief, that -­

21 that one can see this power as part of what the Court in 

22 Garamendi described as the vast share of responsibility 

23 that the Constitution assigns to the executive. Now, we

exclusive to the executive, but we think this

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, if that provision were 

not in the Constitution, would you be making the same 

argument you are now?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: If the Reception Clause 

were not in the Constitution, but we had the same history 

that we have now and the same functional considerations 

about the need for it being in the control of the 

executive, yes, we would.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There are many things that 

Congress could do to frustrate the President's decision 

to recognize another country. Now, would you say all of 

those are unconstitutional? They all infringe the 

President's exclusive recognition authority?

 Suppose the President decides to recognize a 

country, and Congress refuses to appropriate any money 

for an embassy there or refuses to confirm any U.S. 

ambassador to that country. Those presumably would not 

be unconstitutional, would they?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: The -- I think that there 

would be a difference between -- I -- I think that -­

that Congress has authority over appropriations. 

Congress has authority to appoint ambassadors. It's 

entitled to exercise that authority, and it's entitled

the President's recognition decision.

 It is the position of the executive, though, 

that there could be circumstances in which Congress 

could try to exercise its appropriations authority in a 

way that would preclude the executive from exercising 

its -- its recognition power, and that -- the executive 

would in some circumstances believe that it had the 

authority to move ahead despite those actions by 

Congress.

 But, of course, this is not a situation in 

which Congress has passed a sense of the Congress 

resolution about what it thinks. It's not a situation 

in which Congress has exercised attaching conditions to 

its spending power about what private parties do. This 

is an effort by Congress to regulate the content of a 

passport, which, as the Court recognized in Haig v. 

Agee, is a core instrument of diplomatic communication.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's an 

exclusive power, to -- to determine of the contents of 

passports? Hasn't Congress exercised that authority -­

GENERAL VERRILLI: We -­

 GENERAL VERRILLI: We don't think that the 

entire content of passports is an exclusive power. I

the line is. But before doing so, I do want to push 

back a little bit on the notion that Congress has for a 

long time exercised authority over the content of 

passports.

 The first Passport Act was in 1856. What 

this Court said in Haig v. Agee was that the enactment 

of that statute merely confirmed a power that everyone 

understood to be inherent in the executive. That 

statute did not purport to regulate the content of 

passports. It, in fact, said that passports shall be 

issued under such rules as the President shall 

proscribe. And -- and in Haig, that was that language, 

I think, that led the Court to conclude that this was a 

confirmation of the executive's authority and an action 

in aid of that authority. Now -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I just want -- I don't want 

the time to elapse. You can finish that if you'd like. 

I'd just like somewhere a few words about the political 

question, which you don't believe in. From reading your 

brief, I would say you don't believe in it much. And my 

question on the political question for either of you is 

this: that -- that this is an area of foreign affairs. 

It's an area of -- of, you know, recognition. We know 

that. Never has this Court or anyone else held that 

Congress can go ahead in this area over a law passed by

Congress. But it is passports, which both regulate. 

And our real problem is these are words that are 

officially said and they are detailed words, and those 

words may really disrupt coherent foreign policy. 

Viewed that way, there are billions of words that might 

have the same effect. And do we know that these words 

will and some other words won't? No, judges don't know 

that.

 And, therefore, when you get into this area, 

the best thing to do is avoid multifarious 

pronouncements by various departments of government on 

one question; do not respect the views of other 

branches; and, judges, stay out of it. Let them work it 

out by themselves.

 I just want a word from either you and 

really Mr. Lewin on -- on that.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. Well, we do think -­

that's what -- we think that the appropriate inquiry for 

political question purposes is into the relief that the 

Petitioner is seeking and if the relief the Petitioner 

is seeking would invade the kinds of judgments that the 

Constitution commits exclusively to the executive. And 

the reason it commits these kinds of judgments 

exclusively to the executive is because this is a

that's a merits determination. The whole question is,

said, the exclusive authority, that's the end of the 

matter. It -- it's not leaving it -- it is not leaving 

it, as Justice Breyer said, to the political branches to 

fight it out between them. It is saying the President 

has the exclusive authority.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I -- I think in -­

In the absence of section 214, I think it would be clear

recognition is exclusively committed to the executive, 

and it would be a political question, if a party came in 

and said I want my passport to say something different 

about Jerusalem than it says, that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, the tension 

that I see here, and I think it's what Justice Breyer 

is getting at, is the label's important, because if we 

call this a political question and don't address the 

merits, the outcome is that the President is saying that 

he's entitled to ignore the Congress. I don't know what

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, as I said earlier 

or I tried to say, we think that the -- the analysis 

under the political question doctrine goes a very long 

way towards answering that question, Justice Scalia. We 

do think that this could be seen as a case like Gilligan, 

in which looking at the relief that the petitioner is 

seeking, the plaintiff is seeking, leads the Court to 

conclude that this -- that -- that entertaining the 

claim would embroil the Court in decisions that are 

supposed to be made by another branch; and that, in 

fact, I think you can understand section 214(d) as 

precisely that, an effort to try to draw the Court into 

this dispute between Congress and the executive over 

whether section -- over whether Jerusalem should be 

recognized as part of Israel.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: We -- we do think that 

the -- whether the Court is looking at it as a political 

question or whether the Court is looking at it as a 

judgment of the merits, the issue is textual commitment. 

This is -- there is textual commitment. This is a 

situation in which the country has to speak with one

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LEWIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me begin my rebuttal by echoing really 

what Justice Alito said during my colleague's argument. 

The question is whether anything that the President 

thinks bears on recognition, it forecloses this Court or 

any court from making that determination?

 This is not in our view a recognition case. 

This is a passport case. The question is, what goes on 

the passport, and may somebody self-identify? This 

is -- again, if one looks at the statute, if one even 

looks at the Foreign Affairs Manual, a passport is not 

today considered a diplomatic statement; it's an 

identification of a person in order to enable him to 

travel abroad.

 Now, again, let me also echo what the Chief 

Justice and Justice Kagan asked during my colleague's 

argument. If in fact the statute had said we don't say 

Jerusalem is part of Israel, but you can identify 

yourself as being in Israel, my -- we submit that result 

can very easily be achieved and was achieved in the case

of Taiwan by a public statement by the executive.

 Congress -- this law can be enacted. People 

who were born in Jerusalem can have their passport say 

either "Jerusalem" or "Israel." That's their choice. 

Congress hasn't said it has to say "Israel." And then 

the Department of State can issue, as it did in the case 

of Taiwan, a public statement saying this is not 

official American policy.

 Nobody's asking this Court to decide what is 

official American policy. Nobody is asking the Court to 

decide what, as Justice Scalia said, would happen if 

there were no congressional statute. In that case, it 

would be a political question.

 If my client had decided he wanted to have 

his passport say "Israel" and he had no congressional 

statute, and we brought the case to a court, the court 

could say, no, you're asking us to decide what the 

President should decide, what the Department of State 

should decide.

 But other than that, Congress has enacted 

the law. The -- the fact is that with regard to this 

legislation, it is a statute which determines personal 

choice with regard to a passport. The case can be a 

vehicle -- this case can be a vehicle for an 

authoritative clarification of the roles of Congress and

the President in conducting the nation's foreign 

affairs. If so, then we submit Justice Jackson's 

statement, which acknowledges that Congress has the 

final word in the third category, is one that should 

control. But there are narrower grounds for enforcing 

section 214(d) that do not implicate separation of 

powers issues.

 It's a passport law. It's within Congress's 

constitutional authority on the cases that have 

recognized that the President may not deny or restrict 

passports without the express or implied approval of 

Congress. That doesn't require the recognition or 

involve the recognition of foreign sovereigns.

 And the State Department's justification for 

a policy that Congress has disapproved does not 

withstand scrutiny. The Court merely has to look at the 

record in this case in which the State Department has 

said, look, we're concerned that there may be a 

misperception of what this means. A misperception.

 And it's extraordinary that on the basis of 

the fact that there's an alleged misperception, American 

citizens who have been authorized by Congress to say -­

identify themselves on their passports as being born in 

Israel will now find that statute nullified.

When Congress does not authorize him to do it, he may 

formulate it. But when Congress disapproves of what he 

does, then under Justice Jackson's test in the Steel 

Seizure case, Congress prevails.

 The fact that there is dictum in cases -­

particularly Curtiss-Wright, which has not come up in 

the course of the argument, but Justice Sutherland's 

opinion in the Curtiss-Wright case in which he spoke 

broadly of the President as being the sole organ of 

foreign policy -- one has to say that the Harvard

real discretion there?

 MR. LEWIN: Correct. The -- historians 

who've studied that have determined that he was just 

following Mr. Vattel, who said you had have to recognize 

any country that has de facto control; and, therefore, 

since the French revolutionists were in de facto control 

of the French Government, Washington had no choice. He 

was not exercising any kind of discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. LEWIN: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is 

submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the
