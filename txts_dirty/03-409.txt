1  P R O C E E D I N G S 

2  [10:03 a.m.] 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 

4 now on number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. versus 

5 Lasting Impression, Inc. 

6  Mr. Machat? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. MACHAT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

10 may it please the Court: 

11  This case concerns whether or not a defendant in 

12 a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements 

13 of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence 

14 of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of 

15 that affirmative defense. 

16  Now, here are four reasons why that should not 

17 be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it 

18 would render the defense useless, because if there is no 

19 likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark 

20 infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to 

21 prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark 

22 infringement? Second -­

23  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You agree with Judge 

24 Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it. 

25  MR. MACHAT: Yes. 

3 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the 

2 burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. 

3 There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to 

4 prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a 

5 defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove 

6 the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence 

7 of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of 

8 a burden. You have to prove, first of all -­

9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: In this case, did the 

10 plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer 

11 confusion? 

12  MR. MACHAT: This was a motion for summary 

13 judgement. 

14  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there anything in the 

15 affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer 

16 confusion on behalf of the plaintiff? 

17  MR. MACHAT: Yeah, actually, the record does 

18 contain some references to confusion. The -- in this 

19 case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did 

20 have some people that actually were confused. And when 

21 that happens, you need to look at what is causing the 

22 confusion. And essentially -­

23  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it might make it 

24 necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to 

25 avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer 

4 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't 

2 any. 

3  MR. MACHAT: Well, but that's shifting the 

4 issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of 

5 confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is 

6 even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of 

7 the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any 

8 resulting confusion. 

9  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it possible that 

10 showing consumer confusion could be considered by the 

11 court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair? 

12  MR. MACHAT: Well, the thing is, a lot of times 

13 when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or 

14 the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the 

15 confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the 

16 fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used 

17 descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements 

18 are being met. 

19  The confusion does not go to the likelihood of 

20 confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual 

21 elements of the fair-use -­

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm interested in 

23 Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to 

24 whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only 

25 discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's 

5 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly 

2 infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith 

3 assessment? 

4  In other words, suppose that it were shown that 

5 the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged 

6 infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used 

7 the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. 

8 Would that -­

9  MR. MACHAT: Yes -- well, that would show an 

10 absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the 

11 elements of the fair-use defense. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so that if you know 

13 that there's going to be confusion, there is no good 

14 faith? You wouldn't go that far. 

15  MR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a 

16 balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good 

17 faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word 

18 is, in particular. 

19  For instance, if you're using the word "best" -­

20 as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an 

21 extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further 

22 in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best 

23 food," or, you know, "Come to my store. I have the best 

24 buy." And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one 

25 of the risks that -­

6 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is it your position 

2 that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter 

3 how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is 

4 that your position? 

5  MR. MACHAT: No, I wouldn't go that far, because 

6 you also have to look at the objective use. 

7  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would have thought that 

8 consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; 

9 perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the 

10 issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position, 

11 do they not? 

12  MR. MACHAT: Well, I think -- I was reading the 

13 amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion, 

14 as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at 

15 whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not 

16 the term is being used as a mark or not. The same 

17 evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a 

18 likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the 

19 case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the 

20 case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair­

21 use defense have been -- have been met. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What did -- what did 

23 the district court do here? Did it grant summary 

24 judgement or deny summary judgement? 

25  MR. MACHAT: The -- well, the district court 

7 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found 

2 that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that 

3 my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to 

4 describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good 

5 faith. The Ninth Circuit -­

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district court -- the 

7 district court -- this way --

8  [Laughter.] 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- seemed to focus on the use 

10 of the word "micro color," just the word. It didn't bring 

11 up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears 

12 where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears 

13 in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the 

14 district court said you could use "micro color" as you had 

15 been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 

16 1999 new brochure. So -­

17  MR. MACHAT: Yes, that is correct. The district 

18 court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that 

19 use in 1999. 

20  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it might not have been 

21 confusion just by using the word. But when you're using 

22 it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different. 

23  MR. MACHAT: Well, in the abstract case, it 

24 could be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not, 

25 because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page 

8 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

1 brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And 

2 you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very 

3 bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So 

4 

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that wouldn't relate to 

6 the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate 

7 to the reason for which we took this case. 

8  MR. MACHAT: Correct. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, maybe the district 

10 court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good 

11 faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I 

12 understand it, the only question we have before us is 

13 whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an 

14 exception even when there is confusion. 

15  MR. MACHAT: Yes, I would agree. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed 

17 up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your 

18 side, have to present evidence of no confusion. 

19  MR. MACHAT: Yes, I think -­

20  JUSTICE BREYER: So as far as -­

21  MR. MACHAT: -- I think we're both saying the 

22 same thing 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: So as far as Justice O'Connor's 

24 question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if 

25 they want to go and present evidence that there is 

9 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, 

2 it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to 

3 that? 

4  MR. MACHAT: No, I agree. 

5  JUSTICE BREYER: No. So your answer to her 

6 question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the 

7 other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't 

8 have to show that there is no confusion. 

9  MR. MACHAT: Absolutely. 

10  JUSTICE BREYER: That's where we are, is that 

11 right? 

12  MR. MACHAT: That's exactly -­

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

14  MR. MACHAT: -- where we are. 

15  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you give us a -- I'd be 

16 much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily 

17 envision a situation where there is confusion but, 

18 nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a 

19 clear example. 

20  MR. MACHAT: In my particular case? This -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I mean, make up one -­

22  MR. MACHAT: Okay. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's really clear. 

24  MR. MACHAT: Let's use the words "best buy." 

25 Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and 

10 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's, 

2 he has the best buy." He wants to advertise on radio, 

3 "Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for 

4 the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and 

5 he keeps using those words "best buy." 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there's any 

7 likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean -­

8  MR. MACHAT: Well -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what if he just takes out an 

10 ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point? That would 

11 be closer. 

12  MR. MACHAT: Okay, in that case there would be 

13 confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best 

14 buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, 

15 he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair­

16 use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes 

17 up, it comes up in the case that -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to make it that 

19 in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type 

20 at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation 

21 point. That means it's a trademark? 

22  MR. MACHAT: Well, it would be evidence that it 

23 is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the 

24 words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's 

25 Electronics." 

11 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but if you had a 

2 -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great 

3 Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you 

4 have it in boldfaced print. 

5  MR. MACHAT: I agree, it's not necessarily a 

6 trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad, 

7 and you have to look at what the person is trying to use 

8 to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the 

9 products, or, in this case, the store. 

10  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if you have a sign 

11 that says "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P" 

12 and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a 

13 trademark. 

14  MR. MACHAT: Well -­

15  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whereas, if you say in a 

16 brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then 

17 that's okay. Is that the distinction? 

18  MR. MACHAT: Yes, but I'd go even further and 

19 say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n 

20 Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not 

21 necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like, 

22 "Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say 

23 that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue 

24 differently in that case. 

25  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth -- the Ninth 

12 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on 

2 the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at 

3 the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to 

4 recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the 

5 alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause 

6 confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. 

7  So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we 

8 know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is 

9 obliged to show likelihood of confusion." 

10  MR. MACHAT: They do it. But then on -- if you 

11 look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, 

12 the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle 

13 paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis 

14 only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood 

15 of customer confusion analysis." And then they quote from 

16 Transgo, and they say -- explain that "anyone is free to 

17 use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as 

18 such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the 

19 source of goods." 

20  In effect, what they're doing is, they're 

21 expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive 

22 words. Essentially what they're saying is -­

23  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, they go further 

24 in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer 

25 to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they 

13 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not 

2 available if likelihood of confusion has been shown. 

3  MR. MACHAT: Right, and that's -- that's where 

4 they're negating what they said in the beginning of their 

5 opinion. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They do have one authority 

7 for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think 

8 they're right about that. 

9  MR. MACHAT: Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I 

10 would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is a treatise 

12 writer who does take the position that if there's 

13 confusion, there's no fair-use defense. 

14  MR. MACHAT: Well, there are other treatise 

15 writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position 

16 and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if 

17 - even if there is likelihood of confusion. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So does the -- what is it -­

19 the unfair competition restatement? 

20  MR. MACHAT: Yes, that takes a similar position, 

21 as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the 

22 same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the 

23 confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is 

24 being caused because the person with the words in question 

25 is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion. 

14 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  If -- there's certain -- there's certain -­

2 there's certain terms and words that Congress has said 

3 never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of 

4 course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never 

5 get trademark protection in their primary descriptive 

6 sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in 

7 their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove 

8 secondary meaning. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought we're dealing 

10 with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning 

11 would be assumed. 

12  MR. MACHAT: Yes. In the case of an 

13 incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed; 

14 however, that still does not take away the burden of the 

15 holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of 

16 confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches 

17 only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the 

18 primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question. 

19  And one other quick example. The laws say you 

20 cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have 

21 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on 

22 their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone 

23 will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it." But 

24 they all have a flag on it. That's another example where 

25 Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion." Sometimes we 

15 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so 

2 business owners are free to describe their goods to 

3 consumers. 

4  And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance 

5 of my time. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Machat. 

7  Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you. 

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

9  ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 

10  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER 

11  MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

12 please the Court: 

13  Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a 

14 case where there might be confusion, but there would still 

15 be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner 

16 versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on 

17 page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had 

18 Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold. 

19  And this Court held, as a matter of the common 

20 law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, 

21 truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product 

22 will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result. 

23  There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe 

24 Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus 

25 Clark case. 

16 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes 

2 its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and 

3 that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, 

4 Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to 

5 your questions about, what does a fairness component of 

6 this test in the statute mean. 

7  There is not a general requirement that the -­

8 say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but 

9 the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what 

10 Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can 

11 see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief 

12 -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -­

13 putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the 

14 product. 

15  That is not some sort of general equitable 

16 receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what 

17 the defendant did and how they acted in describing. 

18 That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the 

19 defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner, 

20 Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at. 

21  In common parlance, in a common dictionary 

22 meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something, 

23 that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate, 

24 reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to 

25 describe a product. One could reasonably --

17 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does -- does consumer 

2 -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the 

3 plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense? 

4  MS. MILLETT: Not by itself, no, Justice 

5 O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense, 

6 and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is 

7 being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you 

8 could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used 

9 as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively, 

10 reasonably, accurately describing your product. 

11  If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's 

12 a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I 

13 can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, in the Coco-quinine 

15 case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine 

16 without using the particular term, and then he decides, 

17 "you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm 

18 going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do 

19 that just in order to get more customers away from the 

20 trademark-holder." Is that good faith? 

21  MS. MILLETT: Yes, because there's nothing, in 

22 the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business 

23 and to do better and to use descriptive terms 

24 descriptively to do that. The good-faith -­

25  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -­

18 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MS. MILLETT: -- continued here -­

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- what if he intends to 

3 increase his market share precisely by causing the 

4 confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element, 

5 wouldn't it? 

6  MS. MILLETT: The good-faith element is, do I 

7 intend -- it depends on what you mean by "causing 

8 confusion." If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit 

9 the secondary -­

10  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah. 

11  MS. MILLETT: -- meaning of the term -­

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

13  MS. MILLETT: -- that's what good faith means in 

14 trademark law, generally. It has an established 

15 component. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

17  MS. MILLETT: If I intend to do that. But just 

18 showing that consumer confusion could result, or that I 

19 hope consumers will pause and think about, you know, "what 

20 -- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in the 

21 marketplace?" But I have to -- if I intend to avail 

22 myself of the secondary meaning that you've established of 

23 the goodwill that you've generated, that's what good faith 

24 goes to. 

25  But to use fairly to describe is not a general

--

1 means of just saying -­

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you -­

3  MS. MILLETT: -- if there's confusion, that's a 

4 bad -­

5  JUSTICE STEVENS: What does the term "micro 

6 color" describe? 

7  MS. MILLETT: The term "micro color" describes 

8 -- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as 

9 I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent 

10 make-up process. And the reason it's called "micro color" 

11 

12  JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it have a meaning in any 

13 context other than describing the -- one party's product 

14 in this case? 

15  MS. MILLETT: I wouldn't begin to know whether 

16 other professions or occupations use the term "micro 

17 color." But my understanding, from the record, is that 

18 the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color 

19 inks. 

20  And the reason that they use the term "micro" -­

21 and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of 

22 the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these 

23 inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's 

24 micron-size. 

25  And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by 

20 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term 

2 "micro color." 

3  Now, "micro" is a common term that's -- common 

4 descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many 

5 contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all 

6 familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to 

7 "micro." But "micro color" -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there -- wasn't there 

9 something to the effect that "micro pigmentation" is a 

10 synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another 

11 name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has "micro" in 

12 it, "micro pigmentation." 

13  MS. MILLETT: That's my understanding, yes. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Micro pigmentation" sounds 

15 awfully close to "micro color." 

16  MS. MILLETT: "Micro color," yeah. That's my 

17 understanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on 

18 one side of the dispute or the other on the merits of 

19 whether "micro color" is a generic or a -­

20  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to weigh in on 

21 it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, 

22 if you think that side should win, that the words are 

23 being used in a descriptive sense. And if "micro color" 

24 doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they 

25 associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you 

21 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 lose. 

2  MS. MILLETT: But, Justice Scalia, the problem 

3 here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them 

4 lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe 

5 their product, or not that they failed to act in good 

6 faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark, 

7 but that it was a -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right, that's not the 

9 issue in the case. 

10  MS. MILLETT: Right. Right. And my 

11 understanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact, 

12 the descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and 

13 that's on page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in 

14 the joint appendix on 152. 

15  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're right. 

16  MS. MILLETT: But, again, our concern is that 

17 this statute has to be read with the terms Congress 

18 enacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck 

19 the balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented 

20 protection that this Court recognized in "Park 'n Fly" to 

21 descriptive terms, but policing the line between the 

22 secondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and 

23 the -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the 

24 availability of descriptive terms in their original 

25 descriptive sense. 

22

--

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, if you choose 

2 to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your 

3 chances -­

4  MS. MILLETT: Exactly. 

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that that descriptive term 

6 will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and 

7 cause confusion. 

8  MS. MILLETT: Exactly. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And if you don't want 

10 confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive. 

11  MS. MILLETT: That's exactly right. There's a 

12 tradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right 

13 up front, right up front, the immediate appeal and 

14 resonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. "Best 

15 buy." Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best 

16 buy. "Chunky" candy bars. It's going to be easier to 

17 break into the marketplace with "Chunky" candy bars or 

18 "Almond Joy" candy bars, because consumers will have a 

19 sense of what they're getting, than if you come in with a 

20 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: "Schwartz," "Schwartz" candy 

22 bars. 

23  MS. MILLETT: "Schwartz" candy bar, "Kodak," I 

24 don't know 

25  JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't do anything for you. 

23 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  [Laughter.] 

2  MS. MILLETT: I don't know why that is, and why 

3 would I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more 

4 work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, 

5 Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms 

6 out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words. 

7  And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, 

8 in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as 

9 this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe 

10 Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg 

11 versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, 

12 if it's apt and accurate, that's what "used fairly" means. 

13  And if its satisfies that objective test, and if 

14 it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not 

15 used as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because 

16 that -­

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you tell whether it's 

18 used as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems 

19 to be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as 

20 a mark, then there is a violation. 

21  MS. MILLETT: The fair-use defense is 

22 unavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. 

24  MS. MILLETT: -- defenses that are available, 

25 but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable. 

24 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 That's correct. 

2  The way you prove whether something is used as a 

3 mark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. 

4 When something is used as a mark, that means it is 

5 signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the 

6 marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling 

7 you who is making it or who is putting it out on the 

8 market. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So let's go back to the use 

10 on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as 

11 they're using just the word "micro color," I see your 

12 position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. 

13 But what about when they use something that looks like a 

14 mark? 

15  MS. MILLETT: Well, there's -- there's going to 

16 be difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by 

17 taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign 

18 everybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that 

19 they can do some colorful display, but not a mark. 

20  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. 

21 Millett. 

22  Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you. 

23  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN 

24  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

25  MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

25 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 please the Court: 

2  Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is 

3 contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of 

4 the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to 

5 Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that 

6 someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this 

7 defense does not apply only to descriptive terms. 

8  Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be 

9 available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive 

10 marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a 

11 mark. Indeed, our mark here is not --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you use a fanciful term 

13 descriptively? I mean, I think that's the definition of 

14 an arbitrary or fanciful term, that it doesn't mean 

15 anything. 

16  MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may mean something in a 

17 different context, I think an example you could use would 

18 be the arbitrary trademark of "Apple" for computers. 

19 There could be advertising for Computer Electronics, 

20 Incorporated in the fall, when there's the back to school 

21 rush, using the term "Apple" in a descriptive sense: 

22 "Apples for Teachers," you know, the beginning of the 

23 year, "Come to our store." 

24  So, in reliance on that, you drive two hours 

25 because you're the school district director who needs to 

26 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 buy ten new computers to hook into the system. You get 

2 there, it turns out they're not Apple Computers. 

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but do they use the apple 

4 as clearly a descriptive term with secondary meaning, 

5 that's what gives it protection. But if you have an 

6 arbitrary term, as Justice Scalia says, how could that be, 

7 how could the defense have any relevance to a fanciful or 

8 arbitrary term. And I thought the defense only was 

9 relevant when you -- everybody agrees you're talking about 

10 descriptive terms? 

11  MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, the Solicitor 

12 General does not take that position either, in their brief 

13 they recognize that this applies to all level of mark. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that, all we need to 

15 decide this case is to assume that it's descriptive. 

16  MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, the Ninth 

17 Circuit's holding was that it was inherently distinctive, 

18 or descriptive, and we maintain that it is suggestive, as 

19 was pointed out earlier, this isn't a word that can be 

20 found in the English language anywhere, it doesn't 

21 describe the pigment or the ink, what it does is suggests 

22 the small nature and the fine lines that are ultimately 

23 used when this is applied. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that it was 

25 descriptive, would the Ninth Circuit test still apply? 

27 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 That you would have to show absence of confusion before 

2 you raised the good faith defense? 

3  MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe that's what the 

4 Ninth Circuit test does, this was a summary judgment 

5 entered against us when we had introduced -­

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you agree, then, 

7 that in a case where the mark is descriptive, the non­

8 trademark holder, the defendant in the case, can raise the 

9 fair-use defense without having to show that there's no 

10 confusion? 

11  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, we believe it's the 

12 plaintiff's burden, it's clear it's the plaintiff's burden 

13 to show likelihood of confusion. The point is, under the 

14 district court's absolute rule, notwithstanding evidence 

15 in this case of actual confusion, indeed, summary judgment 

16 was entered against us because the district court took 

17 Petitioner's absolute view that there was no relevance 

18 whatsoever to likelihood of confusion to the determination 

19 of fair use, that's the rule in the Ninth Circuit overall, 

20 and that's what needs to be affirmed. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm confused. I thought 

22 the question you're supposed to answer, which is in the 

23 blue brief, is whether they have to show an absence of 

24 confusion. And I guess now you agree the answer to that 

25 question is "no." Is that right, you agree with that? 

28 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the end of this 

3 case, isn't it? That's what we took it to decide, and 

4 that's -- you agree with it and they agree with it, so 

5 everybody's happy. We don't even have to write an 

6 opinion, we can just--

7  MS. BRINKMANN: I believe the Petitioner came up 

8 with that formulation because they had taken on the burden 

9 because they were the movant on summary judgment. That's 

10 where that misnomer came from. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you object to the 

12 formulation of the question presented? Here's the 

13 question, "Does the classic fair-use defense to trademark 

14 infringement require the party asserting the defense to 

15 demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion?" That's 

16 the question. And you say, "no." 

17  MS. BRINKMANN: We agree that the plaintiff, 

18 it's clear that under - in the Ninth Circuit - the Ninth 

19 Circuit pointed out that, Justice Ginsburg quoted before, 

20 made clear that the plaintiff does bear the burden of 

21 establishing likelihood of confusion. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose you establish it, 

23 maybe we can find some differences here, would you also 

24 agree that simply establishing confusion is not enough to 

25 overcome the fair-use defense, you'd have to also show 

29 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 that the confusion, along with possibly other things are 

2 such that it shows unfairness, or what's the other word, 

3 unfairness, or lack of good faith? 

4  MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that when Congress -

5  JUSTICE BREYER: You agree with that, or not? 

6  MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, we agree that 

7 when Congress wrote the test in 1946, it used the terms 

8 "used fairly" to refer to the common law, which included 

9 not only the common law of technical trademark, but the 

10 common law of unfair competition. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Good, so now we have something 

12 I can disagree with you about. Now, the question would 

13 be, why, it's the words are unfair, why, if you just show 

14 there's some confusion, which normally there would be, or 

15 quite often there would be, why is that enough to overcome 

16 their defense that they put here? 

17  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the time that those 

18 words were used, the common law, and we respectfully 

19 disagree with the Solicitor General's office on the 

20 reading of Warner, we'd urge the Court to read that. The 

21 reason the Court allowed the use of the term in that case 

22 is because they quite clearly said it did not have a 

23 secondary meaning. There is no trademark protection for 

24 descriptive words with secondary meaning, we are in 

25 complete agreement with that. We're dealing with the 

30 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 secondary meaning. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so now, if we're 

3 going to go back into what the Court did, I would say that 

4 I was a little disturbed reading this as to why you get 

5 protection at all, because I was thinking "micro color," 

6 well, that describes very well what it is, it's a tiny, 

7 teeny, weenie, weenie bit of color. 

8  And when I think of "micro pigment," I think of 

9 a farm animal, I think -- I don't know what I think, it's 

10 confusing me. So, for an average person, the word "micro 

11 color," I thought, "Gee, that's very descriptive of just 

12 what it is, a teeny weenie bit of color." 

13  MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, I would urge 

14 you to look at joint appendix pages 137 to 139 where it 

15 lists twenty other competitors that sell this very 

16 product, they have no cause to use that word. It is not 

17 used in the industry as a descriptive term, they're called 

18 "pigment," they're called "ink," they're not called "micro 

19 colors," that is my client's trademark. 

20  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference between 

21 pigment and color, especially when it's not just "micro 

22 color," don't they advertise "micro color red," "micro 

23 color grey," so pigment -­

24  MS. BRINKMANN: The typical suggestive term, it 

25 was created to associate the high quality that my client 

31 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



--

1 markets in this product with that term, I want the "micro 

2 color" pigments, not the other pigments that are sold by 

3 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, what about the word, is 

5 it -- am I wrong in what I suggested before, that the 

6 word, "micro pigmentation" is used in the trade as a 

7 synonym for permanent makeup? 

8  MS. BRINKMANN: That's correct, and oftentimes, 

9 trademarks are shortened versions of other terminology. 

10 The fact is it is suggestive because "micro colors" is the 

11 protected trademark here. 

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: But there is a sense of color 

13 in which color is synonymous with pigment. And I assume 

14 that's what was accepted here, which leads me to my 

15 question, I don't understand why we're having this 

16 discussion. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. 

18  JUSTICE SOUTER: Because I thought it was agreed 

19 that for purposes of the defense, this was a descriptive 

20 use, is that incorrect? 

21  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, for purposes of 

22 the defense, it's the other party that has to be using the 

23 term differently. 

24  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could you just point to 

25 me -- I'm not asking so much about the "why," I just want 

32 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 to know what this case is. Is there someplace in the 

2 materials that we've got that indicate that, in fact, you 

3 dispute that there is a descriptive use here? 

4  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, footnote 3 of the red brief 

5 explains that this purported concession that they discuss 

6 about the use of this mark had to do because Justice 

7 Ginsburg was distinguishing before, early uses on a 

8 bottle, and a flyer, which we dispute occurred, but 

9 assuming they occurred, those were descriptive. In 1998 

10 and 1999, Petitioner started using this on their marketing 

11 brochures in a very different manner. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, this still goes to 

13 the merits of the defense and not to the question 

14 presented. The question presented is, descriptive or not 

15 descriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is 

16 consumer confusion? And your position, if you're opposing 

17 the question presented, is that if there is consumer 

18 confusion, there is no defense. And it's -- I thought 

19 that was the only question you were going to discuss here, 

20 not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has 

21 been made out in this case, because these words were or 

22 were not descriptive. I mean, that's a -­

23  MS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor, I'd be 

24 happy to discuss that. As I pointed out, it's contrary to 

25 the textual language used by the Congress in 1946. They 

33 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 meant "used fairly" to mean what the common law meant. 

2 The common law prohibited confusing uses of both technical 

3 trademarks and trade names. 

4  Moreover, Petitioner's interpretation is 

5 contrary to the clear focus of the Lanham Act, which is to 

6 prevent customer confusion. The whole point is so that 

7 you can walk into a store -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, may I stop you 

9 there, because I thought you have conceded, as I think you 

10 must, I thought you conceded quite clearly, I wrote down 

11 that you said, it is the plaintiff's burden to show 

12 likelihood of confusion. So, if it's the plaintiff's 

13 burden to show likelihood of confusion, how can it be the 

14 defendant's burden to show unlikelihood of confusion? 

15  MS. BRINKMANN: We don't believe it's the 

16 defendant's burden, we believe we -- the district court 

17 was correctly reversed by the Ninth Circuit in entering 

18 summary judgment against us, notwithstanding the fact that 

19 there was dispute regarding likelihood of confusion. And 

20 the district court did that, because as I said it was 

21 absolutely irrelevant to the determination of used 

22 fairly. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I think this is really 

24 quite confusing, Ms. Brinkmann. The question presented, 

25 as several people have pointed out, whether the Lanham 

34 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Act's fair-use defense to trademark infringement requires 

2 a party asserting the defense to demonstrate the absence 

3 of a likelihood of consumer confusion. 

4 Now, do you agree or disagree with that? 

5  MS. BRINKMANN: We -­

6  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can surely answer 

7 that, "we agree," or "we don't agree." 

8  MS. BRINKMANN: We don't agree. We believe that 

9 likelihood of confusion defeats the fair-use defense. 

10  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Okay, okay. 

11  MS. BRINKMANN: And we would point out that as a 

12 textual argument and the purpose argument -

13  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, may I just 

14 interrupt, but when would one ever be able to use the 

15 defense if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, 

16 prima facie case, I assume, includes the burden of 

17 establishing likelihood of confusion. So, is there any 

18 room for the defense at all? 

19  MS. BRINKMANN: As we point out in our brief, 

20 Your Honor, we do believe that since the amendment in 

21 1988, this has ultimately become a redundancy, but the 

22 plaintiff's burden of showing likelihood of confusion -

23  JUSTICE STEVENS: So the answer is no. 

24  MS. BRINKMANN: It remains as a Congressional 

25 emphasis that even if, in a trademark situation, a use 

35 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 that is not likely to confuse is allowed. That is what, 

2 this was a -

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: It's allowed without the 

4 affirmative defense. 

5  MS. BRINKMANN: To understand why this came in, 

6 it's important to understand in 1946 this defense applied 

7 only to incontestable marks. It did not apply to other 

8 registered marks. 

9  At that time, incontestable mark holders did not 

10 have to prove likelihood of confusion. That incontestable 

11 mark was a conclusive evidence of the mark holder's 

12 exclusive right to use that mark on the same goods. Same 

13 mark, on the same goods that were set forth in the 

14 affidavit with the PTO. That was akin to early common 

15 law. 

16  At that point, the plaintiff could go into court 

17 with their incontestable mark, and it was conclusive 

18 evidence. So there had to be a safety valve for 

19 defendants to be able to say, "Okay, I know this is an 

20 incontestable mark, I know that, and I know I'm using it 

21 on the same goods, but notwithstanding, I can use it 

22 because I'm using it fairly, I'm not confusing consumers 

23 with this. That's what the purpose was. In 19 -

24  JUSTICE STEVENS: But are you suggesting, I want 

25 to be sure I follow your thinking, are you saying that in, 

36 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 back in those days, somebody with an incontestable mark 

2 did not have to prove likelihood of confusion? 

3  MS. BRINKMANN: It was presumed by the weight of 

4 that, that was the conclusive evidence. 

5  JUSTICE STEVENS: Because otherwise, wouldn't 

6 that defeat the defense, too, then? 

7  MS. BRINKMANN: Because the way Congress 

8 structured 1115(b), it was conclusive evidence except 

9 subject to the seven specific defenses, this was the 

10 fourth one. 

11  JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying, isn't 

12 your answer to Justice Stevens is that it was a rebuttable 

13 presumption? 

14  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. 

15  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

16  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, I'm sorry, yes. Yes, Your 

17 Honor. I would also point out that when Congress amended 

18 in 1988, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that 

19 they intended to change this and that's what's so 

20 fundamental about the position - the district court 

21 position. This is a gaping hole in the core purpose of 

22 the Lanham Act. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose IBM had used the 

24 word "computers" when they were the only company for ten 

25 or fifteen years to mark their product. Now, another 

37 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 company comes along and they produce the same thing, they 

2 want to use the word "computer." You're saying that that 

3 would be the end of it, they couldn't do it? 

4  MS. BRINKMANN: Not at all, Your Honor. 

5  JUSTICE BREYER: People would be confused. For 

6 a while they'll think that "computer" refers to IBM, there 

7 would be confusion, but it's the best word to describe the 

8 product, in fact, at least a very good one. 

9  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if that were the 

10 case, it was more than likely, almost certainly be a 

11 generic term with no protection. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, at the very beginning, 

13 IBM was the only one to do it, they didn't have to call it 

14 computer, they could have called it a word processor, they 

15 could have called it a "think faster." I don't know what 

16 they could have called it, but I mean, you know, they 

17 chose the word computer. 

18  MS. BRINKMANN: And Congress took that 

19 explicitly into account when it allowed any mark to be 

20 canceled at any time for genericism. Escalator, aspirin 

21 are all examples of your situation. That's exactly what 

22 happened, and when they came a generic term, that 

23 trademark was canceled and it became used as generic. 

24 Congress took that into account. 

25  JUSTICE BREYER: So what is this fair-use 

38 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 defense for, since you're normally going to show confusion 

2 to show the infringement, what's it for, in your opinion? 

3  MS. BRINKMANN: Since 1988 it's a vestigial 

4 reminder of what Congress wanted to make sure was 

5 understood in 1946. Even for the strongest, incontestable 

6 mark on the same goods, we are still going to always allow 

7 uses that are not likely to confuse. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't usually interpret 

9 statutes that way. I mean, you tell us what Congress had 

10 in mind, but our best indication of what Congress had in 

11 mind is the words of the statute. And the words of the 

12 statute make no sense if they say you have to prove 

13 confusion and the only -- however, there's a special 

14 defense which you have, which turns out to be there's no 

15 confusion, that's not a special defense. 

16  MS. BRINKMANN: Two points, Your Honor -

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Makes it a meaningless statute, 

18 really. 

19  MS. BRINKMANN: Two points. Petitioner gives no 

20 meaning to words "used fairly." So if a worst statutory 

21 construction -

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did when they 

23 outlined to us what it means is you're using it 

24 descriptively, and not as a mark. 

25  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, those are other 

39 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 terms that are used in the statute, those are separate 

2 requirements. There are four requirements in the 

3 provision, used not as a mark, used descriptively, used in 

4 good faith, and used fairly. They read "used fairly" 

5 right out of the language. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right 

7 that several cases say, the key here is, are you using it 

8 as a mark. Because that suggests you're trying to pawn 

9 off your goods as another's. Are you using it as a mark? 

10 Or, are you using it, merely descriptively? I thought use 

11 as a mark was the key, you're using it as a mark, you're 

12 not using it in good faith. 

13  MS. BRINKMANN: No, that is one of the factors 

14 in likelihood of confusion, that you can take into 

15 account, that there can be non-trademark uses that are 

16 confusing, but the common law cases we talk about are full 

17 of examples of that. 

18  I would like to make one other response to 

19 Justice Scalia's point, if I could. Justice Scalia, to 

20 the extent that you hold that the fair-use defense no 

21 longer prohibits, all uses are likely to confuse as 

22 unfair, we would look to the suggestion made by the amici 

23 that there is a middle ground that likely to confusion, in 

24 any event, cannot be completely irrelevant to the used 

25 fairly determination, as Petitioner in the district court 

40 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 would have it. 

2  We discuss on page 15 of our brief, for example, 

3 the Restatement's position, which we would urge the Court 

4 to look to, which is akin to what the amici suggests. 

5  JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but I don't 

6 think that's the question presented here. I mean, we 

7 could agree with that, that it's relevant to deciding the 

8 defense, and still answer the question presented the way 

9 that the Petitioner wants. 

10  MS. BRINKMANN: The district court's entry of 

11 summary judgment must be reversed, the Ninth Circuit did 

12 that because of its total disregard for likely to 

13 confusion -­

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but the 

15 issue here is whether the Ninth Circuit simply went too 

16 far in the other direction and required too much. And all 

17 we have to determine is whether there is a per se 

18 obligation to prove non-confusion. If we do so, that 

19 doesn't necessarily reinstate the district court's 

20 position, it simply says that the Ninth Circuit went too 

21 far, isn't that correct? I mean, that is what is -- that 

22 is the issue before us? 

23  MS. BRINKMANN: I think the ruling from this 

24 Court would have to be that it's not an absolute defense 

25 against likelihood of confusion. 

41 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about if the ruling were 

2 a defendant who uses a descriptive term fairly and in good 

3 faith to describe its goods or services is not liable for 

4 infringement, even if some residual confusion is likely. 

5 That's what the Restatement that you've just been 

6 applauding says. 

7  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, and that discussion 

8 explains a couple of things. It explains that if there is 

9 a likelihood of substantial confusion, that would be the 

10 outer limit, ordinarily that would not be a fair use. It 

11 also points out that likelihood of confusion is relevant 

12 to that determination that Your Honor just described. 

13 Yes, we would win under that position, Your Honor, that's 

14 absolutely correct, that's the middle ground of the 

15 Restatement -

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would win -

17  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You'd still have to vacate 

18 the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying 

19 that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of 

20 it. 

21  MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we would 

22 actually urge the Court to affirm the judgment below, in 

23 support of we cite cases in our brief, the Meritor case 

24 and the Yakima case, in which the judgment of the Ninth 

25 Circuit reversing the district court should be affirmed, 

42 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 and there are other holdings of the Ninth Circuit also 

2 that are not before the Court that should be affirmed. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, you're urging 

4 then that the Ninth Circuit be affirmed on alternate 

5 grounds. 

6  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that's -

7  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We rarely do that. 

8  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, I understand 

9 that, but in this particular situation -

10  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why wouldn't we just vacate 

11 it, and you have other grounds that the court below didn't 

12 address, but why wouldn't, at the very least, we vacate 

13 the judgment and send it back? 

14  MS. BRINKMANN: We certainly would agree, Your 

15 Honor, that if we are then given an opportunity on remand 

16 to go back to summary judgment and carry our burden of 

17 establishing a likelihood of confusion, but not have it 

18 held against us. For example, in the middle ground, to 

19 determine what used fairly is, in addition to likelihood 

20 of confusion, we would suggest that there are other 

21 factors that the Restatement puts forth. For example, 

22 whether there is commercial justification for the use. 

23 Did we point out, there is no commercial justification, 

24 there are twenty other competitors that don't use this 

25 terminology. 

43 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE SCALIA: They might have been afraid 

2 that you'd sue them. 

3  MS. BRINKMANN: That's quite a strong mark, Your 

4 Honor. 

5  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brinkmann, am I right 

6 that they were, "they" being KP, they were in fact using 

7 the word "micro color" before you registered your 

8 trademark? 

9  MS. BRINKMANN: No, we dispute that, Your Honor, 

10 they've never produced one bottle from that period. In 

11 fact, we introduced four bottles of their -

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be -- that 

13 would be a disputed issue of fact. 

14  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor. 

15  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And are we making any 

16 differentiation at all between the mini color red or 

17 whatever, and this logo that appears? 

18  MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, all the difference in the 

19 world, Your Honor. We maintain that that is a mark use. 

20 I mean, the district court rejected that as well, but that 

21 is one of the issues where you suggested that courts have 

22 resolved these on whether something is used as a mark or 

23 not, that is not an easy answer, and that is why it's 

24 always part and parcel of the likelihood of confusion. 

25  That's the purpose of the Lanham Act, to ensure 

44 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 that when you go into a store, you can buy the products 

2 you want. For example, in the health and safety area 

3 here, you may be willing to buy a product that costs more 

4 money because you know of the quality of them. At the 

5 same time, you want to be assured when you go in, because 

6 you don't want to buy the one that's recalled all the 

7 time, or that has ingredients that cause allergies for 

8 you, that's what the Lanham Act is to protect. And it 

9 encourages the economic efficiency of the market -

10  JUSTICE STEVENS: Your customers are pretty 

11 sophisticated people, I guess, they're specialists in an 

12 unusual trade, so they're not just like a person walking 

13 off the street that doesn't know what it is, they probably 

14 know this market pretty well. 

15  MS. BRINKMANN: That's directly relevant to the 

16 likelihood of confusion, Your Honor. In fact, the typical 

17 way of proving that when it ultimately goes to trial is 

18 through consumer survey. And the law is clear that that 

19 survey would not be of the person on the street, it would 

20 be of the appropriate purchasers, who are more 

21 sophisticated clinicians and cosmetologists. 

22  But, Your Honor, even on that situation in this 

23 record, we have direct evidence of confusion. It's at 

24 joint appendix page 170, Your Honor, it's the declaration 

25 of Gloria Torres, where about 1998, 1999, she was one of 

45 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 the people who did sales, and she started getting calls 

2 from people wanting products, and it confused her because 

3 they weren't on my client's customer list, and also they 

4 were citing different prices. It didn't mean anything to 

5 her at the time, it turns out this was the confusion 

6 because they were actually seeing this new usage on the 

7 marketing brochure by KP Permanent. 

8  JUSTICE STEVENS: Just out of curiosity, it has 

9 nothing to do with the case, do they market this product 

10 with color charts, just like paint companies do? 

11  MS. BRINKMANN: They do, Your Honor, that's 

12 absolutely right, color wheels, color -- and also in the 

13 micro pigmentation history, it's very important, because 

14 even though it's like tattooing, the purpose is absolutely 

15 the opposite, it's to hide the color. So mixing of the 

16 colors is a critical component of that industry. 

17  I want to make another point about the economic 

18 efficiency that is furthered by the trademark laws and not 

19 allowing likelihood of confusing uses, which is what 

20 Congress intended. By allowing purchasers to know that 

21 they're getting the product that they want, they're a lot, 

22 able to be more efficient in the market -

23  JUSTICE BREYER: I also -- it's very efficient 

24 to allow people to communicate, in English. 

25  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, there's nothing to 

46 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 prevent that. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I guess that's the 

3 question, because sometimes people -- I have no doubt -

4  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, I don't think 

5 there's anything -- the way that Petitioner passed the 

6 Lanham Act grossly overstates it. I mean, I would just 

7 submit the following list. The only thing that the Lanham 

8 -- the Lanham Act does not allow registration of generic 

9 brands, as we mentioned before. 

10  It allows cancellation of any mark if it becomes 

11 generic. It applies only to commercial uses, not usage in 

12 ordinary English language, only in connection with the 

13 mark. It can only have a valid trademark when it's 

14 actively being used, any mark can be canceled or abandoned 

15 after three years. 

16  It also, of course, only applies when there's 

17 likelihood of confusion. Also there is an expert agency 

18 that reviews and goes through a process in which there can 

19 be oppositions, objections, all of this could be brought 

20 up at that point. 

21  And also Congress directly addressed 

22 anticompetitive interests when it enacted the statute. 

23 It, in 1946, enacted B(7) as a defense for antitrust 

24 violations. It also reinforced the Justice Department, 

25 and the FTC maintains its enforcement authority, and it 

47 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 also had a particular provision that allowed the FTC to go 

2 in and cancel registration. I'd also point out -

3  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What would be a really 

4 expert agency, which you referred to as represented by the 

5 government here, and it takes the position quite different 

6 from yours. 

7  MS. BRINKMANN: At this point in time, Your 

8 Honor. I would also point out economic efficiency -

9  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You say at 

10 this point in time? Are you suggesting that it took a 

11 different position some other time? 

12  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case, it -­

13 this mark has been put through becoming to -- but went 

14 through all of the procedures that the PTO required. 

15 There's no question that this is a valid mark. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not assailing the 

17 validity of the mark. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Nobody is challenging 

19 it, it's the fair-use defense. 

20  MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, no, what I -- the 

21 government's position is the same position that, in fact, 

22 it urged before Congress in 1946. The Court's opinion in 

23 Park 'n Fly makes this clear. They did not want 

24 descriptive terms at all protected, even with secondary 

25 meaning. And as the Park 'n Fly opinion makes clear, 

48 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Congress rejected that and struck the balance this way and 

2 included all of these other safeguards, not allowing 

3 registration of generic marks, always prohibiting uses 

4 that are likely to confuse. 

5  We would also point out that that encourages 

6 economic efficiencies for businesses as well. By being 

7 able to benefit from the reputation of your mark, the 

8 business invests more. As soon as confusion is allowed, 

9 there is a free rider problem, and that competitor is free 

10 riding on that investment. And it's a disincentive for 

11 further investment and it undermines the quality of the 

12 goods, because the only way -

13  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Certainly the Restatement and 

14 the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on 

15 this. 

16  MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that the Restatement 

17 and the amici are very consistent in rejecting 

18 Petitioner's position and the district court's position 

19 that likelihood of confusion is completely irrelevant. We 

20 embrace that, I think that's a consistent position, and 

21 that would be the bottom line, I would urge, on this 

22 Court, because Petitioner's position in the district court 

23 wreaks havoc, truly, with the statutory framework that 

24 Congress set up and intended. 

25  We believe as a matter of strict statutory 

49 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 construction, that indeed it is now a vestigial provision, 

2 the fair-use defense, after the 1988 changes to the 

3 inconstestability provision. But if the Court is not 

4 going to hold that that fair-use defense prohibits uses 

5 that are likely to confuse, we would urge the Court to 

6 adopt the Restatement position, that the totality of the 

7 circumstances, likelihood of confusion is relevant, we 

8 think factors that it's confusing in relationship to a 

9 health and safety issue would be relevant, the investment 

10 by the mark holder could be relevant. And to the extent 

11 the competitor had a commercial justification for it, 

12 because it was a term that everyone needed to use, but 

13 "micro colors" is just not that kind of terminology as the 

14 record in this case demonstrates. 

15  If there are no further questions, Your Honor. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. 

17 Brinkmann. Mr. Machat, you have three minutes remaining. 

18  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL MACHAT 

19  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

20  MR. MACHAT: Thank you. I'd like to point out 

21 that Ms. Brinkmann's reference to the legislative history 

22 is incorrect, and I'd just like to refer the Court's 

23 attention to my reply brief, pages 14 to 17 where 

24 basically it shows that prior to 1988, courts were 

25 required to find a likelihood of confusion before finding 

50 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 for the plaintiff on a trademark case. I'd also like to 

2 point out that in this particular case, the trademark is 

3 not for the word "micro color," the trademark is for the 

4 logo mark, and here's some of the confusion. 

5  The Respondents were able to obtain a trademark 

6 registration for the logo itself, and the strength in the 

7 logo itself is not being copied, we're just using the 

8 descriptive words within the logo itself. And Congress 

9 always intended for descriptive words to be free for 

10 everybody to use in their primary descriptive sense, so 

11 long as the person, the subsequent user, is not using 

12 those descriptive words in the secondary meaning sense, 

13 and that's the distinction. 

14  The confusion is only an issue to determine 

15 whether or not the elements of the fair-use defense is 

16 being met, but that confusion should be distinguished from 

17 likelihood of confusion. Confusion is a factual 

18 determination, likelihood of confusion is a legal 

19 determination. So you can use whether or not there is 

20 actual confusion to determine whether or not the mark, sorry, 

21 the word is being used as a mark. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I forget your position, if 

23 you've taken it, do you agree that the degree of confusion 

24 that is predictable or that is likely is one of the 

25 elements that can be used to determine whether the use is 

51 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 a fair one? Do you agree or disagree with that? 

2  MR. MACHAT: I would agree, the degree of 

3 confusion, but that comes into whether or not -

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, that's all I wanted 

5 to know. 

6  MR. MACHAT: In this case, "used fairly" means, 

7 it does mean something, we're saying used fairly refers to 

8 whether or not the use is a truthful or reasonably 

9 accurate description of the mark. And it always -­

10 truthful is something that the common law always looked at 

11 to see, that was a term used, in fact, by this Court in 

12 the Warner decision, basically, to quote briefly from that 

13 decision, it said "the use of a similar name by another to 

14 truthfully describe the same product does not constitute 

15 a legal or moral wrong." 

16  So I would maintain that "used fairly" means 

17 truthful, or can determine whether or not it's exactly 

18 true, reasonably accurate. And that would be the meaning 

19 of "used fairly." And of course, good faith refers to the 

20 intent, and there you have the elements of the fair-use 

21 defense. 

22  Also, I'd just like to point out once again the 

23 Ninth Circuit opinion, it says on the bottom of page 17a, 

24 it says, "KP can only benefit from the fair-use defense if 

25 there is no likelihood of confusion between KP's use of 

52 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 the term `micro color', and Lasting's mark." And then


2 they go on to say, "as discussed above, because in this


3 case they can be no fair use --"


4  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Machat,


5 the case is submitted.


6  (Whereupon at 11:02 a.m., the case in the above­


7 entitled matter was submitted.)
