 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-463, Summers v. Earth Island 

Institute.

 Mr. Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a 

nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to 

bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the 

availability and scope of judicial review under the 

Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of 

equitable relief. As this case was decided by the 

district court and as it comes to this Court, it 

involves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that 

govern the procedures to be followed by the Forest 

Service in deciding whether to approve individual 

site-specific activities in national forests.

 The two regulations provide that 

site-specific actions that are excluded from either an 

environmental impact requirement or even an EA under 

NEPA are also not subject to special noticing and

comment and administrative appeal provisions applicable 

to the Forest Service. The Ninth Circuit sustained the 

district court's nationwide injunction as to those 

procedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a 

challenge to a specific site-specific activity.

 The court did so, moreover, on the basis of 

an affidavit from one member of one of the organizations 

who could not begin to establish standing under this 

Court's decisions by showing an imminent injury by 

virtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the 

Court affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to 

all forests with respect to all projects listed in ten 

categories identified by the district court, including 

national forests and projects that don't even -- that 

are not even included within that one declarant's 

generalized interests in certain natural forests.

 For the multiple combination -- combination 

of multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's 

decision cannot stand.

 First, as with respect to standing, the one 

declaration on which both the district court and the 

court of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman, 

which is reproduced in the petition appendix. And on 

page 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go 

to injury at all with respect to the particular

regulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the 

bottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other 

regulations that are no longer at issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Standing itself, I mean, 

it's a little unusual. Suppose -- I mean, Congress here 

has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims 

at a class of litigants. And it says to the class of 

litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you 

what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate 

a certain appeal procedure.

 Now, if you are a member of the class that 

frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage 

of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant, 

at least enough for Article III? And we know as far as 

prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to 

give you standing, so I think would it take care of 

that.

 Are you saying no matter -- that just normal 

litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again 

in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to 

challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article 

III and Congress specifically tells them they can?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not specifically 

said that they may challenge --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let's imagine that Congress

did, Congress did say: By the way, lawyers who have 

handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value 

has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an 

affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch 

may appeal from the court's promulgation of the 

following general rule, dah, dah, dah. And that 

Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, first of all, I don't 

think it could be lawyers. It has to be a party.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Those who -- fine, 

forget that, yeah.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think there would be 

substantial doubt that Congress could do that, because 

let me explain why, and this goes to a point that 

Justice Scalia was making in the prior argument.

 Procedural wrong is not Article III injury. 

The injury in this case comes from the application of 

the regulation in a specific site-specific --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean Article III and at 

Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster, 

whatever they had, they must have had some procedural 

rules, and sometimes they had general procedural 

rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look 

it up. But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that 

time or the clients who had certain cases were not

permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some 

other rules.

 Do we know the answer to that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In a particular case, I 

suppose.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Generally. 

Because you have a special procedure, here's what you 

can generally challenge our rules.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if I could make, again, 

several points. Congress has not passed such a statute. 

And there may be room in particular situations for 

Congress to pass a special statute that would identify 

particular interests that could then be taken into 

account in terms of whether Article III standing would 

be established.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then your answer is, 

if Congress says you can do it, have a general 

challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is 

if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't 

stop them?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- what I said, that 

would be a different question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. What's the answer to 

that different question?

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it might depend on a 

particular -- it might depend on a particular case. In 

the Whitman case the court says that the statutes 

providing for direct review of regulations eliminate 

prudential limitations on ripeness in that case, but 

they wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of 

standing. It would be necessary to show a threatened 

injury. Now, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, don't we have 

to assess the need for -- for showing a specific 

threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard 

in a case like this? Because the claim is made on the 

other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find 

standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are 

going to be a number of specific instances which in 

practical terms can never be challenged when that 

regulation is applied.

 There were one or two instances, as I 

recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be 

no challenge because the announcement of the action was 

made on the very date that the action was taken. So 

that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and 

standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on 

behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer 

described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any

challenge to a lot of specific actions.

 What's your answer to that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Several answers if I may. In 

the declaration on which standing was based in this 

case, that claim is not made. And that is the only 

declaration that was made -- that was submitted before 

the district court entered its judgment. There was an 

argument made like that after, after the fact.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Assume for the sake of 

argument that it is made in this case.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Okay. Then --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What should you respond?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It is conceivable in a 

particular case that a person who -- who claims to be 

injured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it 

would not be a challenge to the regulation as 

regulation. It would be because specific, threatened, 

site-specific activities in which there would not be 

notice given in advance or there wouldn't be -- wouldn't 

be time, threatened to injure them. It would again be a 

challenge to the application --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But your response to that 

is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a 

specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge 

is not ripe. So that if you are going to stick to your

position elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail 

in that enterprise.

 MR. KNEEDLER: And -- and -- and that may --

that may well be right, but that would be a separate 

question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand -- I 

don't understand your response. If -- if someone has an 

interest in -- in stopping a particular action that 

would be governed by -- by -- by this general 

regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is --

is threatened proximately by that action, that person 

could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the 

action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That was my -- that was my --

and that was my point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would govern that 

particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent 

for invalidating the regulation in other cases. I --

presumably other courts would -- would similarly say 

that the regulation is invalid.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And that was the 

point I was trying to make. And if I -- if I could 

explain -- if I could explain the same point --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask 

this one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I

understand your position. Supposing the plaintiff in 

his declaration cites three or four cases in which the 

action was taken so promptly they didn't have notice in 

order to object. And then he says but so -- they -- all 

this was too fast for me. Now I want to -- want to do 

just what the plaintiffs are trying to do in this case. 

Would he have standing then?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- if there was -- if 

there was a category of cases in which that was likely 

to happen. Most of the -- most of the -- he may well 

have standing in that situation to challenge maybe an 

upcoming -- it's an unusual APA suit because -- because 

only final agency action can be challenged, but 

conceivably a threatened final agency action --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree that with 

that scenario he would have standing if his only injury 

in this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this 

case?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. The injury would come 

from the threatened on-the-ground activity, not the 

actual --

JUSTICE SOUTER: He doesn't know that in 

advance. That is the premise of Justice Stevens's 

question, and it is the premise of mine. There -- the 

point is being made by them that this happened so fast

that the threat has been realized before they could 

respond to it.

 MR. KNEEDLER: If -- if I -- if I could make 

a broader point here because there -- there may be 

certain categories, certain instances in which that 

might happen, but it is -- it is the exception, not the 

rule. And -- and the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I will -- I will assume for 

sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume we have got 

the exceptional case. Would there be standing?

 MR. KNEEDLER: In -- in the exceptional case 

there probably would be standing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if in 

Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had 

been three or four or five instances of action so fast 

it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that 

as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation 

as these people are trying to challenge it?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Not -- no, and that -- and 

that was the point I was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- not -- not in the way they 

are trying to challenge it, because they are trying to

challenge it across the board.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Tell us how they could 

challenge it, then? Tell us the right way?

 MR. KNEEDLER: What they would have to do is 

bring a -- a -- on a -- a particular national forest 

where a particular person visited and visited a 

particular area and there has been a pattern of 

particular activities that occurred without his knowing, 

he -- he -- in that situation he might well have 

standing to challenge a similar --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if it's the forest 

next door that he is worried about and they have not 

tried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in 

the forest next door before, he would not be able to 

challenge it.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. The -- the 

-- standing has to focus on the particular site-specific 

place where the individual has visited and if there is a 

repeated pattern of a similar type of activity that he 

doesn't know about and maybe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, why -- why 

-- why is that so? I am reading this ARA statute, and 

it seems to give people a right to notice, an 

opportunity to comment, and to undertake an 

administrative appeal.

Why isn't this statute that says, interested 

public, you have those rights, you have essentially a 

right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute 

like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in 

the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information 

about APAC?

 These were people who said: We are 

concerned about saving our forests. That's why Congress 

said that before these actions occur, there should be 

notice to the interested public, comment, and we are 

being cut out from that seat at the table. It doesn't 

do us any good after the project has been authorized. 

We want to be there when the decision is made to take 

action.

 MR. KNEEDLER: If I could respond in several 

ways. First of all, the due process clause imposes 

limitations on agency action, but that doesn't mean that 

-- that somebody can go into court and challenge agency 

procedures as violative of the due process clause until 

there is a specific proceeding going on and -- and 

completed in which there has been a violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute says 

says before there is a specific action you have a right 

to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.

 MR. KNEEDLER: There is no indication at all

in the passage of that statute that Congress meant to 

confer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those 

without complying with the usual APA provisions for 

judicial review.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe he has no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose the statute says 

anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of 

the due -- due process clause. Would that statute be 

valid?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. You -- you would have to 

-- you would have to show a particular injury and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Article III 

requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That is -- that is correct. 

And -- and there is no indication at all that in this 

statute, which was just intended to modify the Forest 

Service's intent to change its internal decision-making 

processes -- and Congress wanted to restrict what --

what the Forest Service was going to do -- that it 

thereby meant to change the fundamental nature of the 

agency's own internal regulations which would not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that different 

from FOIA? I mean there anybody can request anything. 

You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only 

have to show curiosity. You say: The statute gives me

a right to ask for this information.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- and the -- the Forest 

Service has -- has procedures for notifying people of --

of proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this 

case, and we point this out in our brief. There are 

really two separate types of procedures.

 One is the so-called Schedule Of Proposed 

Actions, which includes all the actions in which there 

would be a decision memo issued by the Forest Service, 

which includes at least all of the projects that 

respondents are claiming should be -- should be covered. 

That is published quarterly. It -- it is available on 

the web. It is also available in person. One of 

Respondents' declarants here on behalf of the Sierra 

Club says that by using that so-called SOPA, that 

schedule, he reviews every project in all 11 national 

forests in California. There is also, in addition to 

the SOPA -- and will submit comments when necessary.

 In addition to the SOPA, the Forest Service 

has what are called scoping regulations which -- in 

which every on-the-ground project is looked at to see 

whether it needs -- there needs to be NEPA compliance 

through an EA or an EIS, but also what is the nature of 

public participation that is required.

 In that scoping process the Forest Service,

the -- the local personnel at the Forest Service, will 

look to see who is interested in the particular project. 

The way this works on the ground is an organization like 

the Sierra Club through its declarant in the -- in the 

joint appendix will have somebody monitoring this SOPA, 

the Schedule of Proposed Events, and will say: I see 

that you have a -- a certain project listed. I am 

interest in that. Please notify me when you are about 

to take action to thin this -- this area or restore this 

burned area. Please notify me.

 When that happens, the Forest Service then 

sends out a letter, a so-called scoping letter, asking 

for comments. So this is not a situation in which the 

-- the organizations of the declarants in this case have 

been excluded. To the contrary, these are all people 

who pay very, very close attention to what the Forest 

Service is doing.

 The one declarant on which the court of 

appeals relied for standing on page 71a of the -- of the 

petition appendix, he specifically refers -- the only 

specific projects he refers to are timber projects, and 

the injunction here goes much broader than timber 

projects -- but he said that for example, in the 

Allegheny National Forest they put out scoping comments 

for a series of 20 timber sales. He knew about those

timber sales and he was able to comment on them. And 

the -- the declarants on whom the standing was based to 

challenge the Burnt Ridge Project, which is no longer in 

this case, in that case the Forest Service -- and this 

is in the administrative record -- sent out 1,300 

letters to people who had expressed an interest in that 

project before it was undertaken. Mr. Marderosian, who 

also monitors forest projects --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could any one of those 

have brought suit?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Anyone -- anyone who claimed 

to have used that area could have brought suit. Some of 

the -- some of those -- some of the people -- people 

submit comments.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean -- but the 

letter alone, I don't know what the criteria were for 

the addresses.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Those were people who had 

expressed an interest in the -- in the project.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, okay. Okay.

 MR. KNEEDLER: And Mr. Marderosian submitted 

a 23-page comment to the Forest Service with respect to 

the Burnt Ridge Project, and that is the other 

declarant. These are people whose profession or

Service. So this is not an instance in which -- in 

which notice is not generally furnished.

 I would like to make the same point I was 

making about standing in connection with the -- with the 

Administrative Procedure Act as well. Section 702 of 

the -- of the APA says that a person who is aggrieved by 

agency action is -- may seek judicial review thereof. 

The -- the agency action that is subject to judicial 

review has to be the agency action that causes the 

injury. The procedural regulation does not cause the 

injury. It is the on-the-ground activity, the 

site-specific decision -- the action, the agency action 

approving the site-specific action that causes the 

injury. That is what the person is entitled to judicial 

review on.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are saying that 

this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute 

is supposed to operate before the project?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It's -- it's -- it's by no 

means unenforceable. In the Burnt Ridge Project that 

was at issue in this -- in this case, the plaintiffs 

challenged the Burnt Ridge Project when it was completed 

on a number of grounds, that it was not properly 

categorically excluded from NEPA, that it didn't comply 

with the forest plan, but also that it had been approved

without complying with the -- with the ARA appeals 

procedures.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that was before 

the project was undertaken?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. An injunction, a 

preliminary injunction was obtained, and tellingly, and 

I think this is also instructive for ripeness purposes, 

there was a PI issued but not because of a violation of 

the -- of the ARA; the district court concluded there 

was a likelihood of success on some of these other 

objections, substantive objections to the project, not 

procedural objections --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- and enjoined it and then 

the Forest Service went through the project and the --

and the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I am pursuing this, but 

I'm actually having a hard time with this. Suppose --

suppose Congress passes a statute; the statute says 

every citizen of the United States has a right to 

receive notice of a certain set of Forest Service 

actions. Everybody. We want everybody who wants it to 

have notice.

 Now, if somebody really wants that notice 

and they don't get it, can they sue?

begin to look like FOIA, yes. But --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Sorry.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: In any case, I'm trying to 

make it look like FOIA.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's just what I am 

trying to do, and you say yes, they probably could, at 

least if you are just supposed to get a piece of paper 

that says "Notice." Now suppose Congress says, if you 

can show you are the kind of person who regularly asks 

and needs such notices, and if a regulation is 

promulgated interpreting this statute, you can challenge 

that reg prior to enforcement. Now does that violate 

Article III?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I believe it -- I believe it 

probably does, unless you can show that there is an 

imminent --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they did this. 

Suppose they said each agency has the legal power to 

promulgate regs interpreting FOIA as to when you get the 

thing, and when you don't, and moreover people who are 

regular FOIA requesters can challenge those regs prior 

to enforcement; what about that one?

MR. KNEEDLER: Conceivably. But I -- what 

-- what I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I am looking for a 

principle that is going to help me.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Congress has not done that 

here and this is why I wanted to shift to the APA, 

because this is subject to review under the general 

standards of the APA. Even if we can assume that there 

would be Article III standing to challenge a 

threatened -- a threatened, another one in a series of 

similar projects like off-road vehicle use or something 

which might occur before someone would be able to -- to 

-- to challenge it, that doesn't apply to timber 

projects and other things that take much longer to plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, I don't even 

agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice 

provision confers standing, because it's close to the 

APA.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I didn't say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Close -- close to the FOIA. 

In FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain 

document which the law entitles that person to. This is 

a concrete deprivation --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of something concrete.

And --

MR. KNEEDLER: I didn't -- I didn't -- I 

didn't mean to concede that there would be standing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought you were 

doing it. And I certainly don't --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, because you are right. 

And here the agency's procedures allow somebody to 

request to be put on the mailing list about a particular 

project. And that's the way you make it -- make it 

known and in fact that happened here. And also the one 

declarant -- it's perhaps instructive, the only other 

kind of notice other than this sort of situation where a 

person says I want to be notified when a particular 

project is going -- is going to take place, the only 

other form of notice is publication in a local newspaper 

of record that each national forest has which shows that 

this is -- that this notice provision is localized with 

respect to people who are going to be aware of what's 

going on in the forest and who are following it. But 

the declarant Mr. Bensman, when -- for another purpose 

is noticing or is pointing out this publication 

requirement in a local newspaper, says that his 

organization doesn't want to subscribe to local 

newspapers, that would be too much of a burden for them 

to have to follow what is going on in newspapers.

That's the -- that's the only kind of 

additional notice the statute ever provides for. The 

other kind of notice is the notice you get if you 

previously expressed an interest in the project, in 

which you basically demanded something along the FOIA 

lines that Justice Scalia was referring to.

 But again, back to -- back to the -- you 

call it ripeness, you call it the proper subject of 

judicial review as this Court said in National Wildlife 

Federation, based on section 702 of the APA, ordinarily 

a regulation may be challenged only when it has been 

reduced to manageable proportions by a concrete 

application of the regulation to the individual's 

particular circumstances. It's the application to the 

person's circumstances that gets challenged. In this 

context, it would be the application of the regulation 

that says there is no right of appeal in connection with 

the approval of a site-specific activity. If you think 

the project was approved in violation of the ARA because 

you weren't given a right -- after you got your notice 

you weren't given a right to appeal, then you could 

challenge that in court on the ground that it was 

approved without following the agency's procedures.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend on the 

other side says that that doesn't make too much sense

because the issue in every case is going to be the same, 

a purely legal issue, and so waiting for the application 

doesn't make any sense.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I don't think it is a 

purely legal issue. The Respondents concede that not 

all projects are subject to this statute, and the 

district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is where do 

you draw the line?

 MR. KNEEDLER: And that -- that's why it 

can't be purely a legal question. As soon as you -- and 

the district court acknowledged that environmentally 

insignificant projects are not covered by the act, and 

so that requires them an as-applied determination as to 

whether a particular type of project or even the 

particular project is one that is -- that is covered by 

the act. And not only that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you said 

the government's position is that the line is to be 

drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an 

EA. Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this 

notice, comment, appeal thing. And I thought the other 

side is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the 

line. It would be the same thing in every case, from 

the government's point of view, no environmental impact

statement, no environmental assessment required, no 

notice and comment. And they are saying you put the 

line in the wrong place.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but that doesn't 

answer where the line ought to be. And even if the 

government is wrong as to a particular project, that 

means the line has to be somewhere else. It may be that 

certain kinds of timber projects should be subject to 

appeal but that doesn't mean that some other road 

maintenance project should be subject to appeal.

 If I may reserve the balance of my time.

Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATT KENNA,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 This facial challenge to the Appeals Reform 

Act regulations could have been brought outside the 

context of the Burnt Ridge Project, as long as we had 

shown that it had been applied to a project and 

continued to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing 

basis.

there was not a regulation on this subject, but the 

agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain 

procedure in all of these cases, would you have it --

the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's 

consistent application of a certain procedure?

 You could certainly do it in a particular 

case, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you 

could certainly challenge it? But let's assume you 

don't have a particular case, you just object to the 

fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this 

thing that is wrong.

 Will you have standing to challenge that?

 MR. KENNA: The question of rightness in 

standing need to be treated a little differently for 

that. As far as the rightness question I think it would 

be a much more difficult case than here, but I would 

think could you do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would have standing?

 MR. KENNA: You would have to show, as Your 

Honor is indicating --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your complaint is I don't 

like the way the agency behaves?

 MR. KENNA: Not on that pure basis. No. 

You would have to show that -- or we would have to show 

some concrete harm from where it's been applied.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you make a 

difference with respect to the regulation? Why does the 

mere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be 

reflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter 

the standing calculation? You either have been harmed 

or you haven't been harmed.

 MR. KENNA: Justice Scalia, I don't think it 

changes the standing calculation. I think it does 

change the rightness and final agency action especially 

question somewhat, makes it much more clear. But we 

don't rely on procedural injury here. Even though I 

think there is potentially room for it along the lines 

of Freedom of Information Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Ninth Circuit 

relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?

 MR. KENNA: Well, I think what the Ninth 

Circuit did was similar to what the court did recently 

in the Winkelman v. Parma School District case where 

most of the discussion was about the procedural harms 

that the parents of the autistic school children were 

suffering. There was only one brief sentence tying it 

to the concrete harm, but it did tie it to the concrete 

harm. And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit did 

here. And certainly the district court very much went 

into tying the procedural harm to the on the ground

harm, and that's what it based its decision on.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, to read 

just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife 

Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle 

you face. It's on page 15 of the government's brief. 

It says: "A regulation is not ordinarily consider the 

type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the 

APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced 

to more manageable proportions and it's factual 

components flushed out by some concrete action applying 

the regulation to the claimant's situation."

 It seems like a high hurdle for you to 

surmount.

 MR. KENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that 

needs to be read in combination with the footnote 2 to 

that decision, which says of course if you have a 

regulation applying a particular measure across the 

board --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the Abbott 

Labs exception, isn't it? I don't think anybody 

suggests that that is applicable here.

 MR. KENNA: No, I don't think that's the --

I think the Abbott labs exception is an exception to 

where the plaintiff cannot show that the regulation has 

been applied to its situation yet.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's when his 

primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?

 MR. KENNA: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the drug 

companies have to do something. Well, they don't -- you 

know, they have to do it before they can -- they don't 

have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that 

their conduct has been affected.

 MR. KENNA: Yes. But I think where as here 

the regulation has been applied to the plaintiffs on an 

ongoing basis, it's conceded that it was applied 

thousands of times nationwide.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have not 

pointed to a particular fact under any of these 

affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs. 

In what the National Wildlife Federation case said, 

"Some concrete action applying the regulation to the 

claimant's situation. "

 MR. KENNA: We have the Burnt Ridge Project 

itself. And then once we have shown standing, it 

becomes a matter of mootness.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't shown 

any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on 

an ongoing basis because that has been settled. It's 

outweighed -- it's out the door.

MR. KENNA: Right. I think the court's 

initial standing analysis is at the time the complaint 

is filed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's in for a 

penny, in for a pound. If you show standing with 

respect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B, 

and C?

 MR. KENNA: No, Your Honor, I would 

respectfully say that the focus is on the beginning. 

And then as the -- as this Court said last term in Davis 

v. FEC, then it becomes a matter of mootness, and 

between that case and the Laidlaw case, that is a lower 

hurdle. So once we had the standing -- and the 

Marderosian declaration is worth looking at, because it 

talks about harm from the Burnt Ridge Project itself, 

which the government concedes, as well as from 

application of the regulations to be denied notice, 

comment and appeal throughout the Sequoia National 

Forest.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you never completed 

your answer in commenting on the National Wildlife 

Federation statement with reference to footnote 2. What 

is it that footnote 2 tells us in light of which we must

course, if you have a particular regulation applied to a 

particular -- to a category of circumstances across the 

board, of course you may challenge it. And I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that all it says? No, I 

think it speaks of categories across the board that 

affect -- that immediately, concretely affect the 

person complaining of the regulation, which is the case 

in these areas where you have a regulation requiring 

drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal 

penalty to print certain things on labels. That 

immediately affects them.

 I think that is what footnote 2 is about, 

not about -- not about any regulation that is across the 

board. That wouldn't make any sense.

 Where is footnote 2. Let's read it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. KENNA: There is many cases where it was 

not an effect on primary conduct yet a facial challenge 

was permitted. In fact, this Court has never rejected 

before a facial challenge to a regulation that is 

published in the Code of Federal Regulations where it 

has been applied on an ongoing basis.

 So, in Sullivan v. Zebley, it was child 

disability benefits, it was a benefit referring 

regulation, which said we see no reason to force as

applied challenges instead of a facial challenge.

 You have Thomas v. Union Carbide, which was 

not a regulation telling Union Carbide how it had to 

manufacture its pesticides, but rather how it would 

affect arbitration -- it's arbitration when it got into 

disputes, which is like National Park's case, which was 

held unright not because of that fact, but because it 

had not yet been applied.

 When you look at all of these cases that 

rejects facial challenge where either the regulation has 

been applied and has not -- and then the court gets to 

the question of whether it affects primary conduct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem they are asking 

you on this -- it was at least a problem for me -- I 

think it's tough on rightness is because the government 

is saying here: Look, you want to challenge it outside 

the context of a particular action that you don't like. 

Well, there's never going to be an action, never going 

to be such an action that we are going to take that you 

won't find out about, that you will not be able to 

challenge in that context if you are really hurt. There 

isn't one. You can't name one that's ever been or 

imagine one that ever will be, okay?

 Now, is that so?

so. The joint appendix at page 101 discusses an 

instance where Mr. Bensman did not get notice at all.

 The issue with --

JUSTICE BREYER: You see where they are 

going next. And if you -- suppose that the thing you 

just told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty 

hard to find one, then the -- why this has never been 

decided and why it's difficult. Because I would start 

with Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations. 

How easy is it now to solve the legal problem? Here? 

Perfectly easy. Nothing's going to change.

 Factor two, how likely is it that they will 

work with this legal rule and change it around here? 

Zero.

 But three, what kind of harm is it going to 

cause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief 

now? And they are saying here that's also zero or next 

to zero. So what do you do if the factor that cuts one 

way is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is 

zero, or near zero?

 Now, I have to admit I have never seen a 

case on that. I don't know if there has been one 

before, and I don't know exactly what to do. And if you 

can go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.

the appendix, even apart from the assertion that there 

are -- the fact that there are certain actions that will 

receive no notice, I think the fact of the matter is we 

did what the court has instructed us to do, and that is 

we brought a facial challenge in a concrete example with 

the Burnt Ridge timber sale project. Now, it's passed. 

Now it becomes a question of mootness, and I think the 

mootness question is easier to solve because the Court 

has said that it's a lesser hurdle than standing, and we 

have shown through the Bensman declaration that it's 

continuing to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing 

basis, that they suffer harm by not being able to get 

these procedures which caused them on-the-ground harm 

because the forest is not protected as well as it would 

be with it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I now have 

footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular 

measure that applies across the board to all individual 

classifications. It goes on to say, which is final, 

"and has become ripe for review in the manner we 

discussed in the text." Then we say, or Justice Scalia 

says, "it can of course be challenged under the APA by a 

person adversely affected. And although that may have 

the effect when they get a general decision invalidating 

a program, it says that a quite different from

permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the 

program as though that itself constituted a final agency 

action."

 So you still have to become ripe for review 

in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I 

read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be 

brought by a person adversely affected. I don't see how 

footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at 

all.

 MR. KENNA: Well, in that footnote, it's 

saying it's quite different from permitting a generic 

challenge to all aspects of the land-withdrawal review 

program. And I think that was the problem in Ohio 

Forestry, where you had this broad program left with 

facts to sort through and apply, but the opinion in Ohio 

Forestry said, of course, though, if the plan had cut 

out someone's right to object to trees being cut, that 

would be the kind of action that would be challengeable. 

And so I think what that later part is talking about, in 

National Wildlife is saying, this isn't the kind of 

action we allow challenges to. It's not final agency

challenge. " And I don't -- that seems to me to be a 

restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.

 MR. KENNA: But that gets us to the standing 

question. And here the Marderosian declaration showed 

he was affected both with regard to the Burnt Ridge 

Project and other projects on the Sequoia National 

Forest. We have the Bensman declaration that talks 

about how he was harmed in his local forest from not 

being able to comment on timber sales, and we have the 

subsequent declarations.

 And I would also point out in the Lujan v. 

Defenders case, both in the note 8 and Justice Kennedy's 

concurrence, there's a discussion about how, in 

Robertson v. Methow Valley, for instance, a standing 

declaration didn't even need to be raised because it was 

obvious that, in that case, that the plaintiffs were 

amongst the injured because they were a local group in 

their local forest.

 You know, here we have an assertion 

uncontroverted by the government that these are being 

applied on every forest on an ongoing basis -- it's 

stipulated to that. To contend that the Sierra Club is 

not injured, especially in light of the declarations

that we've submitted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be like 

in footnote 2, the general program. Yes, they are 

saying these types of activities we don't do the notice 

and comment and appeal. That's the general program. 

But you have to wait until it's applied to a particular 

individual who is adversely affected.

 MR. KENNA: Well, all I can say, Your Honor, 

is I thought we did that by bringing it in the context 

of the Burnt Ridge sale and then it's a matter of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had had a ruling 

on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then 

that would have been precedent for all these other 

cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a 

determination?

 MR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor, we never 

brought an as-applied challenge to these regulations in 

the context of the Burnt Ridge sale.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are seeking a 

different line. And, by the way, I don't know what the 

line is that you are seeking. But the government says 

if you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give 

notice, comment, et cetera. What would be your standard 

for when you need notice and comment?

of the Appeals Reform Act. There are two parts that are 

important. One is, it says, "a proposed decision 

implementing a forest plan shall be made subject to 

notice and comment." And then section C states that 

"any decision approving such an action shall be subject 

to appeal." So you have two elements: That there is a 

decision approving something and it implements a forest 

plan.

 Now, that's the way it worked under the 

Forest Service before the Appeals Reform Act was passed 

and what Congress meant to keep in place substantively 

with a different procedure through the ARA. So a 

Christmas tree permit, for instance, an original 

Christmas tree permit is exempt, not because it's 

insignificant. We've never conceded, and that's what 

the whole merits were about, that it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You need a permit to have a 

Christmas tree? Where is this?

you want to go and cut your own Christmas tree --

Now, that is exempt, not because it's environmentally 

insignificant, which, you know, it probably is in most 

cases, but because there is no decision approving it. 

And that's the way it has always worked, and that's 

where we think the line needs to be drawn, although, of 

course, the merits were not raised by the government

that are useful to look at are, for instance, Blum v. 

Yaretsky for standing, and that was the nursing home 

case where nursing home residents that had been denied 

-- they had been sent to lesser nursing home facilities, 

they were on assistance -- challenged the way in which 

that was being handled. And the Court said, you know, 

the historical basis for these plaintiffs is that they 

have been denied their -- they have been in these

situations and it's perfectly likely that they are going 

to be in again. Another case would be the Northeastern 

Florida Chapter of Contractors v. Jacksonville case, 

which I am afraid we did not put in our brief, but that 

was where victims of reverse discrimination had been 

regular bidders on construction contracts, and they were 

held to have standing because it was obvious they were 

going to suffer these harms again and there was not even 

a discussion of the declarations.  Here, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not unusual. I 

mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already 

been suffered but to harm that is imminent. And if 

these people are regular bidders and they say, you know, 

I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine. 

But these people are -- you don't know any specific 

project. They are just people interested in forests 

throughout the United States.

 MR. KENDALL: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's quite different from 

saying, "I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to 

me." I don't see anything -- you know, anything except 

in the case that was settled that has that kind of a 

connection.

plaintiffs were treated is similar to here, where you 

have members who -- it's uncontroverted that they are 

constantly using the national forests and commenting on 

forest appeals. And we have a reference to 20 specific 

timber sales. They weren't mentioned by name, but it's 

always been this Court's jurisprudence to elevate form 

-- I mean, elevate substance over form -- so it's not a 

creative pleading exercise that can either get you in or 

out of standing; it's a commonsense inquiry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me the two cases again 

that you are relying on for this.

 MR. KENNA: Blum v. Yaretsky, and that we 

cite in our brief; and then Northeastern Florida Chamber 

of Contractors v. Jacksonville. That's a 1993 case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's that? What's 

the cite for it?

 MR. KENNA: 508 U.S. 656 1993.

 Now, getting back to the ripeness issue in 

particular, as we go through the list of cases, it seems 

that the facial challenges have always been permitted in 

situations similar to this. The key question is, has it 

been applied? So National Parks Conservation 

Association hasn't been applied. No prediction that it 

might be applied, therefore not ripe. Thomas v. Union 

Carbide, I think, is particularly instructive because

there the case preceding that was held unripe because 

there had not yet been an arbitration under the federal 

insecticide law. But by the time the case came to the 

Court, there had been an arbitration that had passed, 

and on that basis the Court said yes, this is a ripe 

controversy because here it's been applied, and there 

was no finding of mootness even though that arbitration 

was done, and that's the same situation that we have 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I go back to standing 

for a minute.

 MR. KENNA: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You may have looked this up 

and may have found something here.

 Suppose an organization that has a purely 

ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal 

court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are 

not going to get into Federal court. Now, suppose that 

agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and 

makes their life more difficult. I guess that the fact 

that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them 

into court. They are already somebody who doesn't; they 

don't. So I can imagine cases saying that.

 Contrast that with the case with a person 

who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible

allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that 

there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an 

agency and they frequently complain about chemical X, 

but they don't have a particular case, but they will 

often be there. Now, the agency promulgates a 

procedural regulation that hurts those people who 

normally have a concrete injury. All right? There I 

wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as 

a basis for standing.

 Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting 

the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found 

in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the 

first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word 

"nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair 

comment.

we have on the --

redlining in loaning for -- discriminatorily loaning in 

neighborhoods had organizational standing, not 

representational as we claim here through our members, 

but actual representation in and of themselves. And I 

think when you combine those cases together, I think 

there is some room for that finding that there is that 

injury.

 But I would -- I would point out here that 

the -- we don't claim it, and even though the court of 

appeals, again, talks quite a bit about it, it 

ultimately tied it back. And even if it didn't do a job 

that this Court found to be sufficient, I think the 

focus really has to be on the district court, as that is 

what originally looked at the declarations and did a 

very good job of discussing the on-the-ground injuries 

suffered combined with procedural injuries.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about 

Northeastern Florida? I have dug that out. I don't 

think it -- it supports what you say. In its complaint 

what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority 

business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville, 

and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying 

that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution.

 And what happened -- what the Court said 

about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged

that many of its members regularly bid on and perform 

construction works. Now, if it had stopped there it 

might fit your case, but then it went on to say, "and 

that they would have bid on designated set-aside 

contracts but for the restrictions imposed."

 As I read the case there were designated 

contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them 

but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved 

was the assertion by the city that you don't have 

standing unless you can show you would have been awarded 

the contract. And we said, no, no, you don't have to be 

awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have 

been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's 

enough for standing.

 So that's not this case.

 MR. KENNA: But I think the record supports 

the same kind of assertion. So, for instance, if you 

look at Tim Bensman's declaration at page 71a of the 

petition appendix, it says how on those timber sales he 

would have commented and appealed them if he was given 

the opportunity, and he would like to go back there if 

he could preserve the quality of those areas that he 

visited.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And where is 

"there"? He would like to go back where?

MR. KENNA: He would like to go back to the 

areas in -- where those 20 timber sales are, some of 

which he had been to before and would like to return to. 

And I -- and the supplemental declarations, when this 

came up again and the government pressed, because they 

asked for more specifics, those specifics were provided.

 And so, for instance, at the joint appendix 

at page 90 you have Eric Wiberg using the Weiser River 

drainage and talking about he wasn't going to get notice 

of that. Only because he happened to be personally 

familiar with the area was he able to communicate his 

views to the Forest Service, and it actually ended up 

changing what the Forest Service did because he just 

happened to find out and he happened to know it. So 

that's a specific --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This isn't one of 

those after-submitted declarations, is it?

 MR. KENNA: That -- that latest one I 

referred to is. Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't we 

generally not look at after-submitted declarations in 

determining standing?

 MR. KENNA: Your Honor, I don't think that 

is correct. I think the Court can look at any documents 

in the record which show standing at the time of the

suit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you -- if 

yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at 

that?

 MR. KENNA: Well, the cases that the 

government provided for rejecting declarations were 

offers submitted to this Court or certainly an appellate 

court and I agree that is more problematic, or it would 

have been more problematic if the district court had 

excluded the documents and said it's not going to look 

at them. We would be looking at an abuse of discretion 

standard as was at issue in Lujan v National Wildlife 

Federation. But certainly when a, an appellate court 

takes up a record from a district court it is entitled 

to look at all the evidence submitted and especially 

when it's a case like standing -- or an issue like 

standing where it's a constitutional question that is 

important and you may look at all the circumstances --

there is no reason to reject a later filed declaration.

 But again, we don't rely on those alone. We 

think it's the totality of everything that supports --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The later filed, 

where along the district court proceedings were they 

filed?

 MR. KENNA: They were submitted -- after the

judgment setting aside the regulations, there was 

litigation over the government's stay motion pending 

appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you lose that 

again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get 

some more declarations. The reason we don't look at 

after-submitted declarations is because there has to be 

under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a 

particular time. It seems to me this would be an 

endless process. You know, every time the district 

court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay, 

here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's 

another basis, well, here's another declaration. I'm 

not sure that that's what our cases sanction.

 MR. KENNA: Well, the -- the district court 

didn't find a flaw. It found that we had standing. It 

was -- the government reiterated its standing argument 

in the context of the stay. This essentially opened the 

door by arguing again, "hey, you have no standing," in 

addition to "we should get a stay because of the 

equities." And so it seems perfectly appropriate in 

that circumstance to submit additional declarations. We 

didn't just file them out of the blue because we 

thought --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You filed them after

judgment, right?

 MR. KENNA: We did. But they -- I think 

also the issue is there's been the many decisions of the 

Court which say, you know, standing after the fact isn't 

going to do you any good. And what I think it's 

important to keep clear here is that the declarations 

were later filed, but they referred to events going on 

before the judgment came down.

 So, we have declarations at the time of the 

complaint, very specific; the government concedes they 

are very specific; they talked about both the Burnt 

Ridge sale and the regulation. We have the Bensman 

declaration at the time of the merits consideration, 

which showed the case was not moot, that he was still 

being subjected to these regulations and being denied 

notice and comment. And then we have additional 

declarations after the fact of the government -- I'm 

sorry of the district court's decision, which buttressed 

all of the above.

 And it seems appropriate under that 

circumstance in light of the statements by the Court 

that I discussed in the Defenders case and elsewhere, 

that standing is a practical inquiry, that standing 

should be found in such circumstances.

about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire 

nation, on a controversial question that normally the 

court would just rule for its own area?

 MR. KENNA: Well, I think there is a 

difference, Your Honor, between setting aside a 

regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act and 

what would normally be some sort of nationwide 

injunction such as where you had, say, challenged a 

local timber -- local forest service district for not 

analyzing NEPA correctly, and the Court not only set 

aside that action but said, and "oh, by the way anywhere 

else in the country that's doing it like this, you are 

enjoined, too."

 I think it's a very different question where 

you have a regulation that's being challenged under the 

APA. And it's always been the Court's assumption that 

setting aside a regulation, which the APA commands a 

district court to do, also using its discretion, means 

that it is set aside without geographic limitation. And 

so I think, you know, the Ninth Circuit may have said a 

bit much to saying it was compelled by the text of the 

APA but I do believe the district court properly weighed 

the Mendoza interests.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, you 

have three minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 First, the Burnt Ridge Project illustrates 

the way that we think an issue like this should be 

resolved and shows why the sentence from National 

Wildlife Federation that you quoted, Mr. Chief Justice, 

disposes of the case, and that is that a regulation --

particularly a procedural regulation whose only 

relevance is in an agency proceeding for approving a 

site-specific activity -- that can only be challenged in 

connection with that site-specific activity. That's 

what the sentence in National Wildlife Federation was 

driving at; that is what Section 702 says; when you can 

challenge the agency action that aggrieves you and that 

is consistent with what the Court said in National 

Wildlife Federation, that a -- a court should intervene 

only when and to the extent that someone is harmed. 

This regulation can only harm someone in connection 

with --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That is not what it says. 

It says this is our ordinary practice it doesn't say

it's the limit on our practice.

 MR. KNEEDLER: He was talking about 

injunction. I was talking about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were talking 

about --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- ripeness under the APA but 

it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I 

just could address that for a moment.

 Injunctive relief is -- is discretionary and 

Section 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit 

a court's ability to deny relief on appropriate 

equitable grounds. And this is best illustrated by the 

-- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant 

in a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the 

regulation is invalid on its face. The APA says set it 

aside, but surely the district court dismissing that 

indictment would not be setting aside the regulation on 

a nationwide basis. The effect of a declaratory 

judgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing 

an indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is 

governed by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a 

court reaching out and extending its ruling to people 

and forests and projects that are not before -- not 

before the Court.

 And the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in

which this could be challenged. A particular project 

where there was not an appeal, if someone wants to 

object to the project on that ground or any other 

ground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there 

may be other grounds on which that project might be 

invalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate 

a legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied.

 The final thing I wanted to say is about the 

claim of procedural injury and that this might be like 

FOIA or something like this. I think it's instructive 

that the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of 

conferring rights on individuals. It's a direction to 

the Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an 

appeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency 

normally does to establish procedures for administering 

things. There is certainly nothing in the text that 

suggests that it was intended to confer the 

extraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the 

court for purely procedural grounds. It was just meant 

to fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative 

procedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can 

only be challenged in a challenge to the final agency 

action in which the procedures are applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. 

Kneedler. The case is submitted.
