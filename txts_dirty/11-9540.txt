3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument first this morning in Case 11-9540, Descamps 


v. United States. 

6  Mr. Johnson. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN B. JOHNSON 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. JOHNSON: May it -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

may it please the Court: 

11  In this case -- it doesn't matter what my 

12 client was convicted of in 1978, in the State of 

13 California. What's important for the Armed Career 

14 Criminal Act is what he's convicted of. And as we all 

know, when you're -- to be convicted of a crime, 

16 elements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt or 

17 agreed to by a defendant after waiving his 

18 constitutional rights. 

19  In California, burglary -- unlawful entry as 

defined by the Court in Taylor on what a generic 

21 burglary consists of, is not an element of California 

22 burglary. Any entry with the intent to commit a crime, 

23 a theft, or a felony will do. A California jury is 

24 never required to actually find unlawful entry in the 

Taylor sense.

1  Regardless of the defendant's conduct, a 

2 California burglary conviction is not, by its elements, 

3 Taylor burglary for Armed Career Criminal Act. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't take issue, do 

you, with the argument that in -- in determining what 

6 the State law is you can take account not only of the 

7 words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court 

8 interprets those words? 

9  MR. JOHNSON: I -- I don't take issue with 

that, Your Honor. I think if the State's -- State 

11 courts clearly state something is an element of a crime, 

12 I -- you know, I agree with that. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the California Supreme 

14 Court has said that an element of the burglary statute 

is the violation of some possessory interest. Now, I 

16 know there is some disagreement between you and the 

17 government about that. But assuming for the sake of 

18 argument that that is an element, one way for the 

19 California court to express that is to say simply, as it 

has, that an element is the violation of the possessory 

21 interest. 

22  Another way of saying exactly the same thing 

23 would be to say that the term "enters" under the 

24 California burglary statute means either breaking into a 

structure or the violation of the possessory interest in 

4

1 some other way. 

2  MR. JOHNSON: Okay. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Those are exactly 

4 equivalent. Now, if they were to say the latter, would 

a conviction under this statute potentially qualify 


6 under the Armed Career Criminal Act? 


7  MR. JOHNSON: Well, I don't believe it 


8 would, because I don't believe possessory interest 


9 equates to Taylor definition. 


JUSTICE ALITO: No, but they -- they set out 

11 alternative elements, either breaking into the structure 

12 or the violation of the possessory interest in some 

13 other way. 

14  MR. JOHNSON: Well, if -- if the elements 

are shown, and if that's the definition, then yes. But 

16 I don't think California possessory interest is the same 

17 thing. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: No, but they have said -- do 

19 you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the 

violation of the possessory interest, and B, the 

21 elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory 

22 interest in some other way, are exactly the same 

23 substantively? 

24  MR. JOHNSON: I -- I don't, Your Honor, 

because in the Taylor sense you have to have an --

5

25

Official 

1 unlawful -- trespass, actually a trespass, or an 

2 invasion of a person's -- well, unlawful trespass. In 

3 California you don't have to have a trespass. And as 

4 the Court indicated in the Taylor decision, it talked 

about shoplifting in the State of California. So is a 

6 shoplifter someone who should be subject to an Armed 

7 Career Criminal Act enhancement? 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: I thought your argument was 

9 that if the terms of the statute set out alternative 

ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative 

11 elements in essence, that then, even if some of those 

12 alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one 

13 does, then a conviction under that statute potentially 

14 can qualify. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, I --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that -- do you not --

17  MR. JOHNSON: -- I have no argument with 

18 that. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. 

MR. JOHNSON: That's the modified 

21 categorical approach, I believe. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Alright. Now, what if the 

23 State Supreme Court says exactly the same thing? Your 

24 answer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether 

the elements are set out in the statute or whether they 

6

Official 

1 are defined by the State court. 

2  MR. JOHNSON: Well, I -- as I said, if -- if 

3 the element is set forth and it's an element that meets 

4 the definition of the generic definition in Taylor, then 

I agree with you.  But I don't believe California 

6 burglary does that, because the entry with intent to 

7 commit a crime is burglary in California. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'll ask the question 

9 one more time. Is there a difference -- what the 

California court has said is that an element is the 

11 violation of a possessory interest. Assuming for the 

12 sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct 

13 statement of California law, is there any substantive 

14 difference between saying that and saying the element is 

breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a 

16 possessory interest in some other way? Is there some 

17 substantive difference between those two things? 

18  MR. JOHNSON: Well, there may not be a 

19 substantive difference, but in California breaking is 

not required at any time. It's not an element of the 

21 crime. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Johnson, can I try what 

23 Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a 

24 different way? And it's really the argument that the 

Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 indivisible statute -- indivisible statute, and you can 

2 reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and 

3 Justice Alito gave one example of that. And the 

4 question that the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said 

that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a 

6 divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when 

7 we have an indivisible statute, given that any 

8 indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads 

9 as a divisible one? 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, because in -- in that 

11 case, the jury -- if a statute is made where the 

12 question is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit 

13 that with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is 

14 weapon, the jury is only required to find weapon. And 

if gun is -- is the fact that needs to be shown for an 

16 active -- predicate, you don't get there. 

17  Again, you go back to the element, what's 

18 the person convicted of. They'd be convicted of a 

19 weapon violation, not a gun violation. And so, I -- I 

suggest it's the same thing here. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But I thought our cases 

22 held that when you have a conviction for a weapons 

23 violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to 

24 decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun, 

a knife or an ax, can't you? No?

Official 

1  MR. JOHNSON: If the State's statute sets 

2 off those as an alternative element, I would agree with 

3 that. If they are not set out in an alternative 

4 element, then I don't think they are -- I think they are 

a manner and means of committing the crime.  I don't 

6 think they are an element of the crime. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or if -- you acknowledge if 

8 the State supreme court says "weapon" could mean a -- a 

9 gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would 

suffice, right? But if the supreme court doesn't say 

11 that, we cannot imagine it? 

12  MR. JOHNSON: Well, I -- if it's spelled out 

13 as an element, I think you can, but if it's not an 

14 element --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not spelled out as an 

16 element, but the State supreme court says, our statute 

17 says weapon. Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a 

18 knife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard 

19 documents and we find that this conviction of a weapon 

violation was in fact based on the possession of a gun. 

21  MR. JOHNSON: Again, I think it would go 

22 back to the element of -- of weapon --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: The problem is there's no 

24 way. This is purely conceptual. A State supreme 

court that says the word "weapon" in the statute means 

9

1 knife, ax, or gun. Now, are those three ways of 

2 committing the crime? Or are they three crimes, each 

3 with a separate element? That is -- we'd need not only 

4 St. Thomas Aquinas, but I mean, we'd need those angels 

dancing on the head of a pin. 

6  There is no difference that I can imagine. 

7 And therefore you are saying, look to the point of this 

8 statute; it is not to look to the individual way in 

9 which it was committed, and therefore go to the statute 

to see whether you have a single crime or separate 

11 crimes, okay? That's that's what I think your argument 

12 is. 

13  MR. JOHNSON: It -- it is. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think I understand 

your argument? 

16  MR. JOHNSON: I think you do. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If I understand your 

18 argument -- it's not as friendly a question as you might 

19 hope--

(Laughter.) 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: -- because what I want to 

22 do next is say, why are we debating this point, because 

23 the only difference I can see under the California 

24 statute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of 

debatable. And the very next clause of this statute 

10

Official 

1 says "or otherwise," "or otherwise involves conduct that 


2 presents a serious potential risk of physical injury." 


3  So, why not forget about this metaphysical point 


4 and say, look, even if you are totally right, you've 


still got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far 

6 as we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that 

7 involved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary, 

8 that whatever risks were presented by burglary are 

9 surely present here. So let's forget the metaphysics 

and just go on to clause 2. Now, why hasn't anybody 

11 done that? It's a mystery to me, because you haven't 

12 and they haven't. So why not? 

13  MR. JOHNSON: Well, it's not my burden to do 

14 that. And -- I expected that question, but I think even 

under -- under the residual clause we win the case. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 

17  MR. JOHNSON: Because in California a 

18 shoplifter is not -- but I would think --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But I mean, 

what I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any 

21 attention. I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody 

22 pays any attention. I think Justice Posner said it. He 

23 said, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical 

24 questions, is this dangerous or not. Let's do a little 

sampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of 

11

25

Official 

1 people that this particular State statute X get 

2 convicted under and where a whole lot of them are 

3 dangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not. 

4 And so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some 

numbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is 

6 really a burglary statute. 

7  MR. JOHNSON: Well, there's -- there's other 

8 ways other than just shoplifting. There -- for example, 

9 a mortgage broker going into a home with an invitation. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you could. I just 

11 don't think there are that many people who burgle their 

12 own homes or who go into the home of somebody else with 

13 an invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay 

14 overnight and burgle everything. I mean, there are some 

such, but --

16  MR. JOHNSON: Doesn't it come back to the 

17 test that this Court thought Congress meant when you 

18 made the ruling in Taylor that we're not going to look 

19 to the manner and means of commission, we're going to 

look at the elements --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. It doesn't 

22 have to do with that. It has to do with the crime and 

23 the crime is the crime that the statute defines. And 

24 the question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a 

serious potential risk of physical injury? And if 4,000 

12

25

Official 

1 manifestations of that crime it does, and 3 

2 manifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say 

3 the overall judgment here is this is a crime that does 

4 present that dangerous risk. That's because in almost 

all cases it's there. 

6  MR. JOHNSON: Well, if the Taylor definition 

7 -- after the Court worked that through, I think the 

8 Taylor went with the categorical elements approach. I 

9 think what you're talking, Your Honor, is -- is a 

different approach. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's exactly pure 

12 categorical. You have a crime in a statute. You don't 

13 know how dangerous it is. It is not burglary, arson or 

14 explosives. So to find out if it presents the same kind 

of danger you do a little empirical research. That's 

16 all I'm saying. It has nothing to do with categorical. 

17  MR. JOHNSON: But then why do we have the 

18 "is burglary" language and the other sentences? Don't 

19 they get eaten up by that? 

JUSTICE BREYER: "Is burglary or otherwise," 

21 "or otherwise," "burglary or otherwise," and the reason 

22 we have "or otherwise" is because Congress does know 

23 that the number of State statutes that are sort of like 

24 something, but not completely like something is in the 

thousands. And so that's why they put in "or 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 otherwise." 

2  MR. JOHNSON: I think in this case one of 

3 the -- one of the considerations that drives our 

4 argument is that if you get into that fact-finding mode 

of manner and means in order to establish an element 

6 that is not in the State statute, which is in the case 

7 we're looking at here, I think you got an Apprendi 

8 problem, and I think under the Sixth Amendment my client 

9 should have had a right to a jury trial and proof beyond 

a reasonable doubt. 

11  He went from a max 10 to a max of life and a 

12 mandatory min of 15 years, based on what I -- we contend 

13 is fact-finding in violation of Apprendi. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the Court were to 

say, we now hold that the modified categorical approach 

16 applies to this statute and to these facts. Would the 

17 plea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified 

18 categorical approach the defendant necessarily was 

19 convicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic 

crime of burglary? 

21  MR. JOHNSON: Well, I think the breaking 

22 under the -- under the California statute is a manner 

23 and means of committing the crime. It's not an element 

24 of the crime, because you don't have to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if he necessarily --

14

20

25

Official 

1  MR. JOHNSON: -- do that. 


2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the defendant 


3 necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the 


4 elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was 


convicted of that, would that suffice? And if it would, 

6 does the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that? 

7  MR. JOHNSON: That's kind of a two-part 

8 question. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a two-part question. 

I hope I can get an answer to each. 

11  MR. JOHNSON: Well, the first question is, 

12 because the breaking is not part of California 

13 requirement, a jury's never required to find that as an 

14 element. Nor does a judge when he's taking a plea have 

to -- to find that having taken place. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if under the modified 

17 categorical approach we -- we insist that in the 

18 particular case before us the generic components of the 

19 crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and 

if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with 

21 your view of what the law ought to be? 

22  MR. JOHNSON: I think -- I think it would 

23 be, because I think unless it -- unless it -- there are 

24 alternatives in the statute, some of which constitute 

the generic crime and some of which don't, I don't think 

15

1 you can use a modified categorical approach. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you're saying 

3 is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the 

4 jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted 

of that particular crime. 

6  MR. JOHNSON: That's obviously a more --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: The jury in finding him 

8 guilty of the generic offense could only have found that 

9 this mode of committing the offense was what he used. 

Nonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that 

11 mode; he has been convicted of the generic offense. 

12 Isn't that your point. 

13  MR. JOHNSON: Exactly true. Just like for 

14 an example would be in a plea bargain context the 

prosecutor charges a person with delivery of a 

16 controlled substance, maybe there is a problem with the 

17 search or something and they come up with a plea bargain 

18 of possession of a controlled substance. Are we going 

19 to 30 years later go back and say, well, the colloquy 

says this person did do a delivery, so we are going to 

21 punish him as if he did? 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under the modified 

23 categorical approach the whole point is that we do look 

24 to the plea colloquy. 

MR. JOHNSON: You look to the plea 

16

1 colloquy --


2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, which is why 


3 you say you don't think the modified categorical 


4 approach should apply. But I'm saying suppose we say 


that it does and we look at the plea colloquy. What do 

6 you want us to conclude from that? 

7  MR. JOHNSON: Even if you say it does, it 

8 still doesn't -- it's not an element of the crime. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you simplify that? 

Could you simplify that? What do you think the elements 

11 of -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I 

12 understand your position the elements of a burglary in 

13 California law is being in a place with the intent to 

14 commit a crime. Whether you got there with permission 

or without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant. 

16 So what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was 

17 being in that garage with the intent to commit a crime, 

18 correct? 

19  MR. JOHNSON: Yes. In California you --

just entry with intent is all you need, with intent to 

21 commit. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the unlawfulness is 

23 not necessary. 

24  MR. JOHNSON: It's not necessary and that's 

the point --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter what he said, 

2 he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he 

3 was convicted of under California law was entering 

4 and --

MR. JOHNSON: Exactly. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with intent. That's 

7 your point. 

8  MR. JOHNSON: And the manner and means of --

9 of committing it isn't the point. It's what are you 

convicted of. And again, I think unless the Court 

11 decides to change that approach, I think we're going to 

12 have an Apprendi problem. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: But your argument comes back 

14 to how the elements are defined. It comes back -- so in 

your view, what is critical is in a case of a broad 

16 statute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad 

17 category or whether it sets out lots of subcategories, 

18 that's what your argument comes down to. 

19  If the court says -- if the California 

legislature or the California court says, the element is 

21 entry, period, that's one thing. If they say the 

22 element is breaking or entering in some other way, 

23 that's something entirely different. It all comes down 

24 to that, in your view. 

MR. JOHNSON: Well, it may -- it may come 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 down to what -- what the Court thinks California means 

2 by invasion of a possessory interest. But again, I just 

3 -- I don't see invasion of a possessory interest as the 

4 equivalent of Taylor entry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because it's like the old 

6 joke. I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back 

7 to see whether he was charged with possession of a gun, 

8 which is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife. 

9 That's what we're looking for under the categorical --

modified categorical. But if all it says in the statute 

11 is weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a 

12 knife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for. 

13 Because the charge to the jury could have been, did he 

14 have a gun, a knife, or an ax, and the answer to that 

question, when the jury comes back, would be yes. You 

16 see? 

17  All they have to say is yes. They don't 

18 have to say which. And therefore, Apprendi would be 

19 violated, in your view. 

MR. JOHNSON: That's correct. I think that 

21 sums it up. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's your 

23 argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our 

24 prior cases. Because I thought it was clear, that if 

the element -- if the statute requires -- if to qualify

3 defined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be 

4 okay. Is that wrong? Isn't that your -- don't you 

agree with that? 

6  MR. JOHNSON: If the predicate element is 

7 included in the -- in the statute or the decision, I 

8 agree with that. But again, I don't think I have to --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: So your answer to 

Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no. 

11  MR. JOHNSON: Maybe I misunderstood the 

12 question. But I think the --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's -- let's get back 

to this case. I think what you're saying about the plea 

16 colloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I 

17 broke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said 

18 that, the conviction still would not be for burglary. 

19  MR. JOHNSON: The conviction is for just 

entry, and for the entry with intent, which again isn't 

21 how this Court defined burglary in Taylor. And so --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: And your principal 

23 argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the 

24 modified categorical cases is that you look to these 

Shepard documents to help you define the element of the

1 offense. So if you're not sure which offense the person 

2 has been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents 

3 to do that. But you don't look to the Shepard documents 

4 for a different purpose, which is, we know what the 

elements of the offense are, but we want to know whether 

6 this person also committed the generic offense. 

7  MR. JOHNSON: Yes. Yes. I agree with that. 

8 And -- but the government wants you to use the Shepard 

9 documents to go beyond that. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but -- here's, I 

11 guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point 

12 that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very 

13 categorical. It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't 

14 seem modified categorical. But there is something a 

little bit insane about your position. I don't see --

16 you take the most populous State in the country and 

17 everybody who's convicted of burglary, in the most 

18 populous State in the country, is not going to have 

19 committed an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice 

Breyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have. 

21  MR. JOHNSON: There's an -- there's an easy 

22 way to fix that. A State legislature can change their 

23 law, if they want to. The Congress can change the 

24 approach they want to take, and that would -- that would 

solve that problem. But I don't think it's up to the

1 Court to change 22 years of jurisprudence to do that. 

2 California has known this for over 22 years. These 

3 problems have been -- have been around and percolating, 

4 and the right to a jury on -- on issues of fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not 

6 California's problem, right? We're talking about 

7 Federal legislation and how that operates. 

8  MR. JOHNSON: I agree. So Congress can 

9 amend the statute if they wish, as many members of the 

Court have talked to the Court and asked the Court to 

11 do. But in light of how I believe this Court interprets 

12 the law, and the categorical approach, and the idea was 

13 that using the modified categorical approach would only 

14 apply in a narrow set of circumstances, the 

California -- or the Ninth Circuit's version is not a 

16 narrow set of circumstances. 

17  Arguably, it's just about any crime that 

18 comes in -- later on, sometimes decades later, they're 

19 going to be doing fact-finding on issues, some of the 

participants might have passed away. I mean, all kinds 

21 of things like that. It's not fair to the -- to a 

22 defendant under those circumstances that that kind of 

23 fact-finding is going to take place and result in the 

24 egregious extra penalties he's looking at unless he has 

a jury trial.

1  Those aren't facts of the conviction. They

3 difference between the Ninth Circuit's approach and what 

4 all the other circuits have. I think the other circuits 

get it. They get the idea modified categorical should 

6 be narrow. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's 

8 probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor 

9 definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or 

remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime. 

11 Why doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was 

12 convicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the 

13 building with intent to commit a crime? 

14  MR. JOHNSON: Well, California burglary 

is -- I believe, in my reading of the case law, it's --

16 the -- the intent is formed as you enter the premises. 

17 And that's when the burglary's been committed. If --

18 for example, that's the way I read the case law. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that intent would 

continue while the person remains in the building. 

21  MR. JOHNSON: Well, except the -- again, is 

22 it the intent in the generic sense, or is it the intent 

23 in the California sense? And I suggest there's a 

24 difference, because again, I don't believe -- invading a 

possessory interest, I think that came up when someone

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

12  MR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

13 and may it please the Court: 

14  I would like to start maybe at a point in a 

colloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer, 

16 which brought out the point that Petitioner's position 

17 here is that there's a difference between alternative 

18 elements in State crimes and alternative means; and from 

19 the point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're 

dealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make 

21 that sort of distinction. 

22  It's an unworkable distinction, because, 

23 from -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading 

24 guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an 

alternative means, it's just an alternative way of

1 offering the factual basis for the crime. And the 


2 sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this 


3 Court said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's 


4 offered for pleading guilty. 


JUSTICE BREYER: But you're not -- but 

6 you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose 

7 of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed 

8 the crime. You're looking to the factual basis or you 

9 look to these other documents in order to decide which 

crime it was that the offender committed. 

11  And the reason that you have to sometimes do 

12 that is because there are many State statutes which 

13 under a single section number list several different 

14 crimes, where "crime" here does not refer to a thing 

that happened at a particular day at a particular time, 

16 but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines; 

17 i.e., a general category. 

18  Now, every case that we've written it seems 

19 to me says that or is consistent with that. And that is 

certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being 

21 burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes. 

22 So the guilty plea is beside the point. It may just 

23 say, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter. 

24  And we don't know which of those three 

things: House, car, boat, which are there in that

1 section, was the crime committed. And he's saying 

2 that's the end of that. And so he says, then, look, 

3 this is a California State statute and it isn't divided 

4 into three parts. It just has one part. And that one 

part is not the equivalent --

6  MR. HORWICH: I think that --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: -- of Federal burglary as 

8 defined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case, 

9 end of matter, QED. 

MR. HORWICH: I -- I do think you've 

11 accurately described what Petitioner -- the dividing 

12 line the Petitioner would advocate is. But I would urge 

13 the Court to look at the experience of the court of 

14 appeals with trying to apply that dividing line, and 

that will reveal to the Court very clearly why it 

16 becomes unworkable. Because we've got several courts of 

17 appeals -- as the Court's aware there's a division of 

18 authority on this -- that have said, well, look, we want 

19 to look for statutes that are phrased in the disjunctive 

or that have these separately numbered subsection 

21 headings or something. 

22  Now, setting aside whether that's really 

23 principled or not to focus on the text versus the 

24 judicial decision, let's accept for the sake of argument 

that that's the line. The problem is that then the next

1 case that those courts confront, that applying that rule 

2 rigidly produces really strange results. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly right. So 

4 therefore, that was my question basically. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And of course Congress knew 

7 that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes 

8 with several different words and they -- you know, 

9 different ways of getting at the same thing, and 

therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal 

11 statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or 

12 otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a 

13 serious potential risk of physical injury. 

14  And so if you have a slight variation on the 

burglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary, 

16 but it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise 

17 present the same risks, at least if it's only a slight 

18 variation. 

19  MR. HORWICH: Well, I -- the parties have 

not briefed here and I wouldn't want to speculate 

21 on what the Court would --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: I know and that was my 

23 question. Why not?

2 premise that it should be classified as generic 

3 burglary. But let me offer --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe they haven't 

argued it because there's some serious constitutional 

6 doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime 

7 to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of 

8 physical injury is constitutional. That's such a vague 

9 standard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in 

conduct, quote, "that creates a serious risk of physical 

11 injury." I'm not about to buy into that one. 

12  MR. HORWICH: That -- that's -- I understand 

13 Your Honor's view on that, on that subject. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich --

MR. HORWICH: If I can try to --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm going to ask you about 

17 an argument you did make. 

18  MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand your 

argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's 

21 argument, because you very carefully distinguish what 

22 are what you call missing elements cases from this case. 

23  MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: So do you reject the Ninth 

Circuit's view that the categorical approach should

1 apply even where there is a missing element, as you --

2 as you call it? 

3  MR. HORWICH: Well, I want to be very 

4 careful that we're talking about the same thing, when we 

say "missing element." And so maybe I can give -- give 

6 an example of what I think is a missing element case and 

7 one to which we do not think the modified categorical 

8 approach can be applied. 

9  And -- and the good way to think about the 

exercise that we think a sentencing court should be 

11 engaged in here is to say, imagine there's a set of 

12 boxes on one side that correspond to the elements of the 

13 generic offense -- excuse me -- of the State offense, 

14 and then on the other side a set of boxes that 

correspond to the elements et of the generic offense. 

16  And the exercise is to go through the 

17 Shepard materials and figure out what goes into those 

18 boxes or what went into those boxes on the State side to 

19 establish a basis for the previous conviction. And then 

you take whatever was put in those boxes, be it specific 

21 or general or whatever it is, and then see if those 

22 things give you enough to fill in the elements of the 

23 generic offense. 

24  Now, in a case that we would call a missing 

element case, let's take, for example, because we're

1 talking about burglary, let's talk about criminal 

2 trespass. So criminal trespass let's assume is defined 

3 as the unlawful entry of a building or structure, 

4 period. And there's no provision that you have to have 

intent to commit a crime. Now, it doesn't matter what's 

6 in the Shepard materials for someone who pleads guilty 

7 to criminal trespass, because there's no way you're ever 

8 going to get something in one of those boxes about 

9 unlawful entry or structure that's going to let you fill 

in the generic box. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me give you a -- let me 

12 give you a different kind of example. Let's suppose you 

13 have a statute that's made it illegal to interfere with 

14 a law enforcement investigation. And you're prosecuting 

somebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to 

16 trial; it doesn't matter. The theory of the case is 

17 that the defendant violated this statute, interference 

18 with a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a 

19 police officer, okay? Is that a missing elements case 

or is that what you think is going on here, which is 

21 just -- it's just an overbroad statute? 

22  MR. HORWICH: Well, we would need to know --

23 I guess I would need to know in your hypothetical 

24 what -- what we're trying to classify that conviction 

as, because --

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: The conviction is 

2 interference with a law enforcement investigation. 

3 That's the statute. But interference with a law 

4 enforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it 

can be done in an extremely violent way, which would be 

6 an ACCA offense or not. 

7  MR. HORWICH: Well --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: And it's overbroad. There 

9 are ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA 

offenses in it. 

11  MR. HORWICH: Well, I'm sorry. I guess 

12 my -- my -- my concern is -- is that I would need to 

13 know what generic enumerated crime we're trying to fit 

14 that into, because although perhaps that could be 

classified under the residual clause --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Sure. 

17  MR. HORWICH: Well, that might raise a -- I 

18 think that raises a different set of questions. I want 

19 to be clear that our argument here at this point is only 

that the Court should accept this for purposes of 

21 dealing with the enumerated -- with enumerated offenses. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why would there be any 

23 difference between those two? Why would you take your 

24 argument differently from the residual clause than in 

the enumerated crimes?

25

Official 

1  MR. HORWICH: Well, I think because the way 

2 this Court's residual clause jurisprudence has evolved, it 

3 requires the Court to make some assessment of the degree 

4 of risk of some set of conduct that's not too much more 

serious than what the defendant engaged in, but not too 


6 much less serious and so I don't know what that 


7 reference point is. I mean, there's something of that, 


8 I think in -- in -- in Your Honor's disagreement with 


9 the majority in the Sykes case, I think of, trying to 


figure out what the right frame of reference to draw is. 

11  So I think residual clause cases are a very 

12 difficult context in which to -- to talk about 

13 hypotheticals here, and for that reason, I -- I would --

14 I would -- I think it's more productive to try to assign 

them to burglary or one of the other generic offenses. 

16  If I can give an example --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Well, let me -- let's 

18 talk about this case, then. I mean, I'm not sure I 

19 understand that quite. But let's talk about the 

burglary. Suppose that there was a State that just said 

21 entry. In other words, this State says unlawful entry 

22 and you say that's overbroad, but we're still in sort of 

23 the same universe of an element. Suppose the State just 

24 said entry. Would we be in a missing element world or 

in an overbroad world?

Official 

1  MR. HORWICH: If the State statute provided 

2 that all entries qualified, which is what I understand 

3 your hypothetical to be, then I think that probably 

4 amounts to a missing elements situation, because -- and 

I'm taking the Court's test from Shepard here. The 

6 question is what did the defendant necessarily admit in 

7 the plea colloquy. And there may be -- I want to be 

8 clear -- there may be any number of things that are in 

9 the Shepard materials that are noted in the plea 

colloquy, but if they are not offered as the legal basis 

11 for the defendant's conviction, then they don't make it 

12 into those boxes that I was talking about and they don't 

13 make it into being a basis for the generic offense. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's my problem, 

which is you say that, but how to define a missing 

16 element from an alternative element is -- overbroad 

17 element, doesn't make any sense to me. As I read the 

18 California statute, all it says is you have to enter a 

19 number of defined things with the intent to commit a 

crime. It doesn't talk about whether the entry itself 

21 is unlawful. That's your colleague's -- your opponent's 

22 argument. But you're trying to read into the method of 

23 entering that it could be legal or illegal, and so you 

24 look at the documents to add that. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think -- no, I

Official 

1 don't think we're trying to add that. I agree that 

2 if -- if -- if, for example, the California Supreme 

3 Court's decision in Gauze had come out the other way and 

4 said, yep, it's your own home -- you know, so what. As 

long as you're entering, the statute literally says 

6 "entry," there's no -- there's nothing further we need 

7 to examine, then I agree this would be -- you could call 

8 it a missing element case. 

9  But the problem with Petitioner's position 

about California law is that that's not California law. 

11 Petitioner says -- I wrote this down, any -- he says, 

12 "Any entry with intent to commit a crime will do." That 

13 is not true. You can enter your own house with the 

14 intent to commit a crime. That is not burglary in 

California. You can enter somebody else's house with 

16 the intent to commit a crime and that's not burglary if 

17 they know you intend to do that. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: True. But what they said 

19 in Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory 

right in a building. And that cuts in your favor, 

21 because that's not having different ways of committing a 

22 crime, that's what the word in the statute means. 

23  MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So now you're ahead. 

But the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that

1 invading a possessory interest includes -- includes 

2 going into a shop with an intent to steal something, a 

3 shoplifter. Now, you could go back to the Blackmun 

4 opinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it, 

because generic burglary is defined in part there to 

6 include generic, an unprivileged remaining in the 

7 building. And you say, you see, these are the same. 

8  Were it not for two facts. The first fact 

9 is in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting 

is not burglary. And then you look to the treatise that 

11 they cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes 

12 that even more clear. And says, no, when you talk about 

13 remaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank 

14 and not going into what used to be Jordan Marsh and 

staying overnight, or not even staying overnight, but 

16 just putting a few toothbrushes in there. 

17  MR. HORWICH: We certainly agree that --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: So that's where the problem 

19 is. 

MR. HORWICH: We absolutely agree that --

21 that the shoplifting basis for California burglary does 

22 not correspond to generic burglary. But by the same 

23 token we also agree that the burglary of an automobile 

24 version of California burglary --

3  MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think we're 

4 back to -- I don't think we're back to -- I don't think 

we're back to any real problem here, because the -- the 

6 Court should not be seeking a rule here that turns on 

7 some idiosyncrasy of how State law is phrased or 

8 announced. The Court should be looking --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you take that 

position and advocate the answer you're giving here? 

11 Because you are asking us to determine or to have courts 

12 below determine what are or are not definitions that the 

13 judiciary is applying to means versus mode, et cetera? 

14  MR. HORWICH: Well, we're not asking the 

Court to draw any distinctions among those. I guess 

16 what -- what I'm saying is the government's test is --

17 is that in applying the modified categorical approach to 

18 a conviction entered upon a guilty plea, the Court 

19 should be looking at what the -- what the legal basis 

for the prior conviction was, which is, in the words of 

21 Shepard, "the matters" -- "the factual matters the 

22 defendant necessarily admitted." That's -- that's what 

23 Shepard says. And Shepard -- Shepard draws an 

24 analogy --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Your approach creates its 

36

Official 

1 own idiosyncrasies. I mean, suppose the same plea 

2 colloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of 

3 saying -- you know, the defendant broke and entered, he 

4 had said, the defendant unlawfully entered, right? 

Completely different result under your theory; isn't 

6 that right? 

7  MR. HORWICH: Yes, it is a different result. 

8 But let me explain why that is -- that's not actually 

9 germane to the dispute that we're having here, because 

the prosecutor equally could have said, he broke and 

11 entered one of the places enumerated in the statute. 

12 And that too would have been vague and that wouldn't 

13 have allowed the sentencing court to classify it as 

14 generic burglary. 

That -- the possibility that the Shepard 

16 records are insufficiently precise or they're too opaque 

17 or that they just don't exist because they've been lost 

18 is something that can frustrate the application of the 

19 modified categorical approach regardless of whether we 

are talking about cars versus --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: I think it's -- I think it's 

22 a deeper problem than that, because the defendant is 

23 standing there and he doesn't care at all whether the 

24 prosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered. 

It doesn't matter a whit to him. And so -- and so

6  MR. HORWICH: Well, by the same token, the

9 also cause him to be convicted of the same -- of the 

same burglary offense under California. But they would

14 expand -- this would expand the problem that you've

17 would expand that fortuity to a far greater number of 

18 cases. 

19  MR. HORWICH: I guess I am not prepared to 

make a confident prediction about the relative number of 

21 cases. It certainly would be more cases, but I think 

22 that we would be expanding it that way in an effort to 

23 assure greater sentencing equity. It seems very strange 

24 to me that you could have had someone engage in exactly 

the conduct the Petitioner did, but in another State,

3 burglary, and then it does count, but it doesn't count 

4 in California. For some reason -- for a reason that it 

has --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- I'm not sure 

7 that it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have 

8 two defendants who have done exactly the same thing in 

9 California, and because of the fortuity of what the plea 

colloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another, 

11 when it really didn't matter one way or another in that 

12 situation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other 

13 doesn't. 

14  MR. HORWICH: That -- that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably I 

16 agree that you don't have -- you don't have empirical 

17 evidence. But given how -- it does seem to me that it's 

18 a broad expansion of the category of cases to which you 

19 would apply the modified categorical approach under your 

position. 

21  MR. HORWICH: Well, in part I'm not -- well, 

22 in part I'm not even sure of that. If I can return to 

23 the experience of the courts of appeals in this and give

2 numbered subsections and then they confront cases like 

3 the statutory rape example in our brief, where the State 

4 statute of conviction provides that the victim of a 

statutory rape has to be under the age of 18, but maybe 

6 the generic offense says that the victim has to be under 

7 the age of 16. 

8  Now, that element of age isn't phrased in 

9 the disjunctive, but it seems very strange that if the 

defendant admits to his victim being under -- age 14, 

11 that we wouldn't recognize that. 

12  Or you have the situation in the Seventh 

13 Circuit, that just about a year after it decides the 

14 Woods case in which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems strange to me at 

16 all. He hasn't been convicted of raping or having 

17 intercourse with somebody under -- under 14 or under 15. 

18  MR. HORWICH: Well, the question --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: He's only been convicted of 

having that with someone under 18. 

21  MR. HORWICH: Well, let's imagine for the 

22 moment that his case had been tried to a jury. Now, the 

23 instructions might have said, do you find that the 

24 victim is under the age 18 -- under the age of 18? But 

let's for the sake of argument say that the instructions

1 -- the instructions provided: Was the victim age -- do 

2 you find that the victim was age 14? 

3  Those would be perfectly valid instructions, 

4 and if that was what the jury found then we would say in 

the Taylor sense that that was what the jury was 


6 actually required to find. 


7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not everything the jury 


8 finds constitutes a conviction. They have to find 


9 something that is an element of the charged offense. 


MR. HORWICH: Well, the text --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: If being -- being under 16 

12 is not -- or 14, whatever it is, is not an element of 

13 the charged offense, I don't care what the jury finds. 

14  MR. HORWICH: Well, with respect, Your 

Honor, the text of the statute in this part of it does 

16 not refer to elements. There is a part that refers to 

17 has as an element the use of force or that sort of 

18 thing. But here the relevant text of the statute asks 

19 the Court to determine does the defendant have a 

previous conviction for a crime that is burglary. Here 

21 the defendant has a previous conviction for breaking and 

22 entering a grocery store, that's the basis on which he 

23 was convicted, and breaking and entering a grocery 

24 store is generic burglary. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But breaking and

1 entering -- in your brief as I understand it you are not 

2 relying on the prosecutor's charge that there was 

3 breaking and entering. You're relying entirely on the 

4 plea colloquy. And in this plea colloquy, the 

prosecutor said, he broke and entered a grocery store. 

6 He says nothing. In the typical Rule 11 setting, when 

7 the judge goes through the series of questions, the 

8 judge doesn't take the defendant's silence. The 

9 defendant has to positively affirm. And here we have a 

plea colloquy where the prosecutor says something and 

11 the defendant doesn't respond. 

12  Why is that any kind of a necessary 

13 admission when he said nothing, which he might have done 

14 under the impression that it didn't matter because he 

had the intent to commit a crime? 

16  MR. HORWICH: Well, the -- the defendant's 

17 statement -- well, in the context of this plea, it is 

18 true that the words didn't come out of the defendant's 

19 mouth. Of course, at a proceeding like this one can 

fairly understand, as the Ninth Circuit has and other 

21 circuits do, understand that those factual bases are 

22 adopted by the Court precisely because the defendant 

23 does not say anything contrary to -- and of course --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it be

4 shouldn't the defendant have to say, yes, I broke and 

entered the grocery store? 

6  MR. HORWICH: Because we can treat --

7 because we can treat the proceeding in this colloquy as 

8 the defendant adopting that factual basis offered by the 

9 prosecutor, accepted by the court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Qui tacet consentire 

11 videtur. Why don't you quote the maxim?

14 than mine. But, I expect --

(Laughter.)

17 appears to consent. 

18  MR. HORWICH: Yes. This is at the most --

19 this is -- this of course is at -- at one of the most 

important moments in the criminal process here. This is 

21 essentially the defendant confessing his guilt and 

22 accepting punishment from the court. So it -- it seems 

23 that it's fair to accept that when a basis is offered 

24 for his conviction -- and he is silent --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess it depends on

1 whether the basis has any relevance to the punishment 

2 he's going to receive, which in this case it doesn't, 

3 but put that aside. 

4  Here's one thing that strikes me as odd 

about your position. You said before in response to a 

6 question -- you said if the California Supreme Court had 

7 not decided Gauze, then you would not be up here arguing 

8 what you're arguing. 

9  MR. HORWICH: Well, at least if it was 

different, yes. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, if there were -- if 

12 there were no unlawful entry that counted under 

13 California law --

14  MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- but -- you know, the fact 

16 that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you 

17 can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that 

18 the Court happens to come across that case and happens 

19 to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this 

matter whether or not the California court once decided 

21 that you can't burglarize your own home. What does that 

22 have to do with anything in this case? 

23  MR. HORWICH: Here's -- here's the relevance 

24 of it. It's because at common law, of course, there was 

a strict breaking requirement, and as this Court 

44

Official 

1 recognized in Taylor, and in going back to the LaFave 

2 treatise in -- in Taylor, that requirement had over the 

3 years and into modern statutes been relaxed to include 

4 not only strict breakings, but also entries by fraud, 

entries by threat and so forth. 

6  Gauze -- and the reasoning in Gauze explains 

7 that the California legislature's codification of 

8 burglary simply does that relaxation a little bit 

9 better, by adding essentially one more category of 

Gauze -- taken with subsequent decisions about 

11 shoplifting and such -- explains California just did 

12 that one better by adding another category, which is 

13 entries that exceed the implied consent to enter public 

14 places for lawful purposes. 

So what you're left with here is, this case 

16 exists at the -- the common law core that both 

17 California and generic burglary retain, which is an 

18 entry by break -- an entry by breaking. And it is true 

19 that both generic burglary is dispensed with that 

requirement, in the sense that it allows other things to 

21 qualify, and so, too, California has dispensed with that 

22 requirement, but it hasn't completely eliminated the 

23 relevance entirely of the lawfulness of the entry. 

24 There's still a question there. It's simply easier to 

satisfy it --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Let me quickly ask you this 

2 then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes 

3 clear that in these words of the California statute, 

4 there must be an interference with a possessory interest. 

Now, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it 


6 says the element of generic burglary includes an 


7 unprivileged entry or remaining into a building. You 


8 say now, between those two forms of words, there is 


9 virtually no difference. 


MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: The one possible difference 

12 is shoplifting. 

13  MR. HORWICH: Exactly. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And as to shoplifting, here 

is what I would like to say. This is you, okay? Not 

16 me. 

17  Shoplifting just is not a factor under 

18 California code section 459. Now, you have not added 

19 those last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe 

it is a factor. And if it is a factor, then I'm afraid 

21 I'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big 

22 difference in the California statute in generic 

23 burglary. 

24  But if you could tell me, no, there are

3  MR. HORWICH: Well, I can't --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: You see why I turn back to 

the empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not 

6 possible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare 

7 time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to 

8 look and see what are the real behaviors that are 

9 convicted under section 459. 

MR. HORWICH: I can --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And then advise defendants 

12 who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that 

13 they will know which crimes carry another 30 years. 

14  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

16  MR. HORWICH: Well -- Justice Breyer, I 

17 don't think I can give you a statistical survey. The 

18 only thing I can offer, and I offer it with some 

19 hesitation, is my conversations with California 

prosecutors suggest that they are, at least today, 

21 generally disinclined to charge shoplifting as burglary, 

22 because it's a lot easier, and effectively gets them the 

23 same result in those cases, to charge it as larceny. 

24 Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that --

Official 

1  MR. HORWICH: -- but that's -- that's 

2 anecdotal, at best. I don't have anything better. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to charge it as what? 

4 What's shoplifting? 

MR. HORWICH: To charge it as larceny, 

6 because very often, it will be the completed shoplifting 

7 is very hard to prove they had the intent when they went 

8 into the store. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it -- but it does 

come under this section 459. 

11  MR. HORWICH: It does, but it -- in exactly 

12 the same way that automobile burglaries come under this 

13 statute. The statute is broader as to the place 

14 burgled, it's broader as to the types -- types of 

unlawfulness of entry. 

16  That's not a reason not to recognize that 

17 when the defendant, as Petitioner did here, says my 

18 crime was breaking and entering -- to recognize it as 

19 breaking and entering, which is all we think Shepard 

asks for. 

21  And I want to be clear that you wouldn't go 

22 beyond that. We're not saying that a defendant who's 

23 pleading guilty to criminal trespass who says it was 

24 breaking and entering and I intended to go steal 

something in there, you can't then call that burglary, 

48

1 because the additional admission to intent is not 

2 germane to the conviction for criminal trespass. So you 

3 can't use that and turn that into generic burglary. 

4  That answers the hypothetical that was 

raised about someone who enters a plea bargain to 

6 possession of controlled substances instead of 

7 distribution. That -- that answers a great many of the 

8 parade of horribles that Petitioner is offering. And 

9 that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what 

11 the difference is between entering the garage with 

12 permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and 

13 entering a store with permission and taking an article 

14 of clothing. Are they both shoplifting? 

MR. HORWICH: I -- if in your hypothetical 

16 the garage is a -- is not your own garage and you don't 

17 have the consent of the garage's owner to -- who knows 

18 that you're going to take the wrench, no, they are the 

19 same. Those are the same thing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are the same thing. 

21 So in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit 

22 that under the California definition of burglary, 

23 shoplifting could be charged. 

24  MR. HORWICH: Shoplifting could be charged, 

and someone could plead guilty to shoplifting, and that

1 wouldn't count. The problem here is that --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think your adversary 

3 can speak for himself, and his brief did point to some 

4 convictions for shoplifting under the statute. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes, we agree. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are some. 

7  MR. HORWICH: Absolutely. You can be 

8 convicted of shoplifting. We don't disagree with that. 

9 But what we're saying is that the approach that Taylor 

and Shepard suggests is one that focuses on what the 

11 defendant necessarily admitted in offering the legal 

12 basis for his conviction rather than on hypotheticals 

13 about other conduct he might have committed that would 

14 have resulted in the same conviction. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What seems to me perhaps 

16 clearest about this case and others is that this 

17 modified categorical approach has turned out to be 

18 extremely complicated, and occasionally produces results 

19 that seem to make no sense whatsoever. Was this 

inevitable? Is this really what Congress intended, or 

21 did the Court create this problem by the way it has 

22 interpreted ACCA? 

23  MR. HORWICH: If I may, briefly.

MR. HORWICH: My sense -- my sense is that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN B. JOHNSON 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

12  MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

13  One thing I would like to point. There is a 

14 lot of discussion about shoplifting, as if that's one of 

the only problem areas we have. On page 9 of our reply 

16 memorandum, footnote 5 contains a number of examples of 

17 other -- California burglaries. And I don't -- it's 

18 page 9 of the reply memorandum, footnote 5. 

19  California burglary, it's -- those examples 

are just a few examples how burglary is consensual 

21 entry into homes. That is not an unprivileged entry, 

22 and it's not a trespass. 

23  I think -- I think that -- limiting it to 

24 just saying that -- that shoplifting is the only problem 

we have, I don't believe that's the case.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Johnson, the last 

2 answer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would 

3 be simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical 

4 approach; but the reality is we have a statute. The 

active statute that defines violent felony not with 

6 respect to a felony that involved dangerous conduct, but 

7 as any crime punishable by imprisonment that has an 

8 element that threatened use of physical force. So it's 

9 not what the Court created, it's what the statute 

created. 

11  MR. JOHNSON: I agree with that, and I think 

12 that -- I -- I don't think anything has changed in --

13 since -- in the last 22 years for the Court to step away 

14 from Taylor. In fact, I think the recent developments 

and constitutional law six memo rights to trials on 

16 fact-finding. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does the offense of 

18 burglary have the element of using force or threatening 

19 to use of force? 

MR. JOHNSON: I don't believe it does. I 

21 think the theory is that --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: So the element doesn't --

23 the element language doesn't apply to burglary.

The -- the use or threatened use of force is the

7 matter whether -- whether you threaten force, right? 

8  MR. JOHNSON: Well, again, I think if we get 

9 into the residual, it's going to require the evaluations 

the Court have done on that. But modified -- if you --

11 if you look --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think only -- only 

13 those burglaries that -- that threaten force are covered 

14 by the statute? Certainly not. It's all burglaries, as 

long as you meet the generic definition of burglary, 

16 right?

18 there's other questions, I'd yield the rest of my time.
