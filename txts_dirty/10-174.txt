3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 today in Case 10-174, American Electric Power Company v. 

Connecticut, et al. 

6  Mr. Keisler. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 

11  This is a case in which the courts are being 

12 asked to perform a legislative and regulatory function 

13 in a matter in which the necessary balancing of 

14 contending policy interests is among the most complex, 

multifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now 

16 before the country. 

17  The States ask that the courts assess 

18 liability and design a new common law remedy for 

19 contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying 

a general standard of reasonableness to determine for 

21 each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what, 

22 if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas 

23 emissions ought to be. That would require the courts 

24 not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed 

into law by the other branches, but to make those policy

1 choices themselves. And all of our arguments here -­

2 that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common 

3 law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of 

4 action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable 

political questions -- while all of them represent 

6 distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic 

7 separation of powers principles that establish, we 

8 believe, that the case ought to be dismissed. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's -­

MR. KEISLER: Now, all of these issues -­

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's exactly one 

12 thing that's concerned me. They do all flow from the 

13 same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we 

14 should focus on prudential standing, basically, which 

cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to 

16 dealing with this on the merits. 

17  MR. KEISLER: Well -­

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In either case, your 

19 argument is that this is too generalized for the Court 

to -- to address. 

21  MR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, our 

22 principal argument has not been prudential standing. 

23 The government has focused on the prudential standing 

24 argument. We join that and we'd be happy to see the 

case resolved on that basis, but our principal argument

1 on standing has been Article III standing. And we 

2 actually believe that the Court could resolve this case 

3 and address the issues in any order, with one possible 

4 exception, which is that we do read the Court's decision 

in Steel Co. as holding that the Court has to address 

6 Article III standing before reaching the question 

7 whether there's a valid cause of action. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Keisler, what -- what 

9 good does it do you to have this Court say that there is 

no Article III standing? The suit will just be brought 

11 in State court -­

12  MR. KEISLER: Well -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- under State common 

14 law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not 

ours. 

16  MR. KEISLER: Well, many States, Your Honor, 

17 have similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of 

18 political questions. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: They only need one.

 MR. KEISLER: Well, in any event, Your 

21 Honor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to 

22 dismiss in State court on a variety of grounds, 

23 including -­

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not sure about that, 

are we? So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our

2  MR. KEISLER: Well, I don't -­

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, you know, tapping 

4 the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I 

would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, 

6 probably. 

7  MR. KEISLER: Well, as I said, Your Honor, I 

8 think we would be able to defeat a State common law 

9 claim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate 

cause, on standing and political question grounds that 

11 many States have that parallel these; but in any case, 

12 whichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we 

13 think it's clear that the cause of action can proceed. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if you had a 

State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the 

16 State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground 

17 for recovery? And then we would get to the merits and 

18 see if there is a Federal common law cause of action. 

19  MR. KEISLER: It's -- it's possible, Your 

Honor, although we think they would be more likely to 

21 proceed under State common law. But either way, we 

22 don't think the elements of a State or Federal common 

23 law cause of action under nuisance could be met here, 

24 and we're very confident we could defeat that claim in 

State court as well.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we all -- we all 

2 know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to 

3 see if there's standing. There's a little cheating that 

4 goes on. But -- but in this case it does seem to me 

that you're lacking any clear precedent. When I think 

6 of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon. That 

7 isn't this case. 

8  MR. KEISLER: But the Court has said in 

9 Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate 

that it will benefit in some tangible way from the 

11 Court's intervention. And that's -­

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you have -- if you 

13 have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any 

14 one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough. So 

if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States 

16 would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts 

17 had standing. 

18  MR. KEISLER: Justice Ginsburg, we believe 

19 that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus 

on the particular regulatory context of that opinion. 

21 The Court said that it was addressing standing to 

22 challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when 

23 the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address 

24 a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the 

petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental 

7

1 protection. The Court was very specific about that. 

2 The statutory right was of critical importance, it said, 

3 to the standing inquiry. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keisler, the Court did 

say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual 

6 analysis in the case. When the Court goes through 

7 injury and causation and redressability, the Court never 

8 refers to the statutory cause of action. 

9  MR. KEISLER: But it does, Justice Kagan, 

specifically refer to the regulatory context in which 

11 the case is taking place. The Court said that if the 

12 EPA's arguments there about traceability and 

13 redressability were adopted, it would doom most 

14 challenges to agency action because agencies proceed 

incrementally. 

16  Here we have no statute, we have no agency 

17 proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no 

18 basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of 

19 incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will 

have no material effect on their injury; and they 

21 acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they 

22 specifically said that the relief they seek here would 

23 only constitute these defendants' share of the larger 

24 overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in 

order to have any material effect on climate change or 

8

1 the injuries that they assert. That is an 

2 acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not 

3 provide them any redress except in connection with other 

4 reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we 

think means that this is a classic case in which the 

6 injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct 

7 but of the collective independent actions of numerous 

8 third parties not before the Court. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: But the Court clearly 

understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it 

11 was enough, and I would think under traditional standing 

12 principles the standing there was actually harder to 

13 find because one had to go through the EPA first. One 

14 had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA 

would regulate, and then the question was would that 

16 reduce emissions levels? Here the EPA is out of the 

17 picture. The action is much more direct. 

18  MR. KEISLER: But there, Your Honor, they 

19 were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory 

authority over the entire country. Here they're suing 

21 five separate defendants, each of whom has to be 

22 evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of 

23 them against whom the relief sought would have any 

24 tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs 

claim here. But we also think that Massachusetts is

1 relevant in a completely different respect, which is the 

2 Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its 

3 role was and what it wasn't. The Court said: We lack 

4 the expertise or the authority to second-guess the 

policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to 

6 compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court 

7 interpreted it. 

8  In this case, the States are asking the 

9 courts to play exactly the role that this Court 

disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make 

11 those policy choices in the first instance, and they say 

12 that the courts can do this because the courts have done 

13 this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing 

14 like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has 

held. It's nothing like an instance in which one State 

16 is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into 

17 a body of water that's crossed the border. The case -­

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many States 

19 does it take? I think, you know, if it's three States 

who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how 

21 you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper 

22 and this case. 

23  MR. KEISLER: It's not a question of the 

24 quantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the 

nature of the task that the Court would have to perform, 

10

1 and this task is different because of the global nature 

2 of the phenomenon. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm more receptive to this 

4 kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as 

opposed to standing -­

6  MR. KEISLER: It -- it -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and I recognize that we 

8 slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to 

9 make it difficult on you. But I take it that these 

arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action 

11 on the merits. 

12  MR. KEISLER: Exactly, Your Honor, and 

13 whether the Court should expand the Federal common law 

14 to recognize this. The global nature of this phenomenon 

makes it different because every sector of the economy 

16 worldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no 

17 geographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and 

18 every one of the other nuisance cases, between the 

19 source of the emission and the victim that claims the 

harm. And that changes what the Court has to do. It 

21 means that any court or policymaker thinking about how 

22 to alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here 

23 has to first think what is the appropriate overall level 

24 of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then 

make a comparative judgment about how the reductions 

11

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 that would be necessary to achieve that level should be 

2 allocated among all the different sectors based on the 

3 social good that that sector produces and what 

4 reductions would mean to that social good.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your -- your 

6 first argument when you addressed this issue was there 

7 is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA. So 

8 you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would 

9 be if it was within the court's bailiwick. I thought 

your position was that the function, this regulatory 

11 function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the 

12 courts. 

13  MR. KEISLER: We are making both arguments, 

14 Justice Ginsburg. We don't think there would be an 

appropriate Federal common law cause of action even if 

16 the Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted. But certainly 

17 the argument is even stronger and easier because of the 

18 existence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because 

19 this Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean 

Air Act so that the term "pollutant" specifically 

21 includes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress 

22 has assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the 

23 determinations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make 

24 here: Do greenhouse gases endanger the public, and if 

so, what regulatory consequence -­

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the EPA is given 

2 authority to regulate other pollutants, including those 

3 that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not 

4 prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter 

standards for its -- for automobiles in its State. 

6  MR. KEISLER: Oh, and -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So why should we say the 

8 EPA preempts the Federal common law? 

9  MR. KEISLER: Because this issue, and I 

would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than 

11 preemption, is very different from the question of 

12 preemption of State law. The Clean Air Act has a 

13 savings clause that preserves State authority across a 

14 variety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v. 

Illinois cases specifically distinguished between 

16 displacement of State law and displacement of Federal 

17 common law. It said the -- the presumption is against 

18 preemption of State law because of various concepts of 

19 State sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of 

separation of powers, the presumption is in favor of 

21 lawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and 

22 that means that the standard is very different. It 

23 means that if Congress has addressed the problem, then 

24 Federal common law is displaced.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your best case? 

13

1  MR. KEISLER: Milwaukee v Illinois II. That 

2 was the case in which the Court held that the Clean 

3 Water Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim 

4 by Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said 

because Congress had addressed the problem, Federal 

6 common law had no role to play. Here Congress has 

7 established a process and it's a process in which the 

8 States and the private parties here can participate. 

9 They can file petitions for rulemaking, they can appeal 

EPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be 

11 completely inconsistent with that process if they could 

12 also take a complete end run around it and go to court 

13 and ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has 

14 assigned to EPA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is a merits argument, 

16 right? 

17  MR. KEISLER: Yes, it is a merits argument, 

18 because it says that any Federal common law action would 

19 be displaced by the Clean Air Act.

 Now, the -­

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is the consequence of that 

22 argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal 

23 common law of interstate pollution claims? 

24  MR. KEISLER: I don't think there is very 

much left of any Federal common law of interstate 

14

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 pollution claims, just because the field has been so 

2 heavily occupied by statutes. You know, all the 

3 nuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your 

4 Honor, they were in a completely different time. They 

were at a time when the Court's view of its common law 

6 authority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's 

7 constitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very 

8 narrow. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you're going to 

have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or 

11 later. You're confident you can establish not only 

12 displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption 

13 of State common law, right? 

14  MR. KEISLER: It will ultimately depend on 

the state of the law at the time that such a 

16 hypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the 

17 opportunity, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the inquiry, 

19 part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation 

is? 

21  MR. KEISLER: I don't think so, Justice 

22 Kennedy. I think the question is always what Congress 

23 has done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking 

24 process is. Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or 

destroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said 

15

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 in that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has 

2 addressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry. 

3 And there is no question that Congress has addressed not 

4 just the general problem, but the specific problem here. 

It has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to 

6 regulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have 

7 been defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the 

8 precise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here. 

9  There couldn't be a more specific example of 

Congress having addressed the problem and assigned a 

11 different approach to dealing with it than letting the 

12 courts work it out under Federal common law. 

13  The States' and the private plaintiffs' 

14 argument is that the Federal common law will only be 

displaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that 

16 provides the precise form of relief that they're asking 

17 for. There's no case that says that and that's not the 

18 law. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: EPA couldn't give -­

could EPA give that relief? We're dealing with existing 

21 stationary sources. We're not dealing with new or 

22 modified sources. 

23  MR. KEISLER: We believe that the EPA can 

24 consider, as it's undertaking to do, regulating existing 

nonmodified sources under section 111 of the Clean Air

1 Act, and that's the process that's engaged in now. It's 

2 announced that it will propose standards in the summer 

3 and complete a rulemaking by May. Obviously, at the 

4 close of that process there could be APA challenges on a 

variety of grounds, but we do believe that they have the 

6 authority to consider standards under section 111. 

7  And if the Court has no questions, with the 

8 Court's permission I would like to reserve the balance

18  In the 222 years that this Court has been 

19 sitting, it has never heard a case with so many 

potential perpetrators and so many potential victims, 

21 and that quantitative difference with the past is 

22 eclipsed only by the qualitative differences presented 

23 today. Accordingly, the Court should apply the 

24 prudential standing doctrine and hold these lawsuits not 

fit for judicial resolution. The very name of the

1 alleged nuisance, "global warming," itself tells you 

2 much of what you need to know. There are billions of 

3 emitters of greenhouse gasses on the planet and billions 

4 of potential victims as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, that just 

6 goes to the merits. You make that argument to the 

7 district court that your injunction is meaningless, 

8 equity does not require an idle act. End of case. 

9  GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

think it goes to both. That is, this Court in outlining 

11 what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in, 

12 for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11: 

13 "Without prudential standing limitations, the Court 

14 would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why 

public significance, even though other governmental 

16 institutions may be more competent to address the 

17 questions and even though judicial intervention may be 

18 unnecessary to protect individual rights. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll add a third thing that 

it goes to and that's Article III standing. It's clear 

21 in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here 

22 will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't 

23 have to go to prudential standing. That it seems to me 

24 would deny Article III standing.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

18

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the 

2 Court went to prudential standing first before Article 

3 III. And the reason for that is because this court in 

4 Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability 

prong of what you're asking said that the reductions 

6 that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, "slow 

7 or reduce the problem." 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll think about it, 

9 but Newdow was a case where we thought that this 

particular litigant was not directly injured. Here the 

11 State said it's directly injured. That's the 

12 distinction. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: More than that, Newdow 

14 was a case of a father trying to assert a right on 

behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want 

16 that right nor did her mother. So it seems to me it's 

17 worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing 

18 as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the 

19 generalized grievance was Article III. I thought that's 

what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a 

21 grievance that she shared with everybody in the 

22 populations, so she didn't have standing. 

23  GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, we're not 

24 here saying that this case follows inexorably, 

inexorably from the facts of Newdow or, frankly, from

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: But it seems, General 

7 Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used 

8 this language of generalized grievance as a prudential 

9 matter rather than as an Article III matter. So am I 

wrong about that? 

11  GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that this 

12 Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the 

13 language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential 

14 considerations.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But Newdow -- Newdow quoted 

16 the language of generalized grievance that came from 

17 Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that 

18 language. 

19  GENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree with you, 

Justice Kagan. This is not like a case in which the 

21 government is announcing some rule of standing that 

22 requires the Court to, for example, call into question 

23 previous precedents of this Court that reached the 

24 merits or something like that. It's that this Court has 

never had a case involving this scale and scope, and we

1 think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in 

2 a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law 

3 cause of action in which the Court is already being 

4 asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says, 

an equitable action in which the Court has I think 

6 special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and 

7 not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the 

8 kind of tapestry of different factors. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, General Katyal, how 

about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think 

11 the government came in and made the same argument, that 

12 even though the injury was concrete, it was too 

13 generalized and therefore there should be no standing, 

14 the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to 

Article III and as to prudential standing. 

16  GENERAL KATYAL: Right, and I think Aiken 

17 says that the prudential standing cases thus far have 

18 been about has concrete injury been shown to a 

19 particular person. And we're not disputing that for 

purposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown 

21 to at least one plaintiff, but we think that -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: To that extent you 

23 disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no 

24 Article III?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That is absolutely correct,

1 we do disagree to that extent. We think that prudential 

2 standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in 

3 this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and 

4 literally involving the world, where everyone is a 

potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim, 

6 and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and 

7 32 and 40 states: "If someone contributes one drop to 

8 the nuisance, they can be sued. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't 

usually -- your phrase is exactly what bothers me. We 

11 don't usually base a decision on our general intuition, 

12 and the idea of prudential standing that we have 

13 jurisdiction of the case but we're not going to decide 

14 it is contrary to Chief Justice Marshall's famous line 

that if we don't have jurisdiction, we can't decide it, 

16 but if we do, we have to decide it. 

17  GENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the 

18 prudential standing doctrine generally and the zone of 

19 interest test in particular really do focus on this 

question, Mr. Chief Justice, about whether or not a case 

21 can be cut down to judicially manageable standards. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll give that you 

23 on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with 

24 administrative law and a very narrow proposition. I 

think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the

1 point of his questions, that these issues meld into the 

2 merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the 

3 idea that we are not going to decide a case even though 

4 we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the 

better place to address it. 

6  GENERAL KATYAL: I'll move to that and take 

7 your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice. But before doing 

8 so, I would say that if you're going to give me 

9 administrative law and zone of interest I think you 

should then give me Federal common law, which this Court 

11 is at its height in terms of fashioning who can come 

12 into court and what those rules may be. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why you 

14 assert that the remedy here will not provide the 

relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the 

16 remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right? 

17  GENERAL KATYAL: We acknowledge that the 

18 relief that they are seeking looks like the relief in 

19 Massachusetts v. EPA, which is that it would, if the 

Court -­

1 what the Court said. What the Court said is that it 

2 would allow regulation in the transportation sector, 

3 which would be approximately 1.7 billion tons, and here 

4 they are saying 650 million tons. And so, I agree it's 

less, but I think that the -- and one can criticize the

7 rule of this Court, and I think that as long as a 

8 slowing or reduction -­

think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that 

11 EPA can only regulate the transportation section? 

12  GENERAL KATYAL: That is what the Court 

13 based its redressability analysis on. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the holding of the 

case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the 

16 forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?

18 saying that the -­

Justice Scalia. For that the Court said that this

1 reduction in the transportation sector was sufficient. 

2  If I could take the Mr. -- the Chief 

3 Justice's invitation to address displacement at this 

4 time. We believe that we meet the State's own test for 

displacement, which is found at page 46 of their brief, 

6 which is: "A Federal common law nuisance claim is 

7 displaced when a Federal statute or regulatory action 

8 addresses the nuisance." And here you have not just the 

9 Clean Air Act, you have the Clean Air Act plus, a 

cascade of a number of different actions taken after, 

11 Justice Scalia, the opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: At what point in this -- in 

13 what point in this cascade did the displacement occur? 

14  GENERAL KATYAL: We think that the Court 

doesn't really need to get into it. And for the -- the 

16 reason is this: Displacement actions are extremely 

17 rare, Federal common law actions are rare, so we don't 

18 think you should announce some sort of general standard 

19 for when displacement occurs. It's a more case-by-case 

situation. 

21  Here you have undoubted evidence that it 

22 occurred -- that it has occurred because of a number of 

23 different things. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: We don't know what EPA may 

do down the road, we don't know what Congress may do

1 down the road. So don't we have to have some idea about 

2 when this takes place in order so that this precedent 

3 may -­

4  GENERAL KATYAL: Certainly -­

JUSTICE ALITO: -- be applied to the future 

6 course of conduct? 

7  GENERAL KATYAL: Certainly, Justice Alito, I 

8 think it's appropriate for the Court to look at what 

9 has -- what is happening right now. And here's what's 

happening. First, in December 2009 the EPA issued an 

11 endangerment finding, finding these greenhouse gases 

12 significant pollutants. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General Katyal, suppose 

14 that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment 

finding. Would your argument still apply? 

16  GENERAL KATYAL: I think that that would 

17 present a difficult case, because it would be the one 

18 like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act 

19 alone. And I think that what the States themselves 

acknowledge and what the language of Milwaukee II -­

21 excuse me -- Milwaukee I says in it is that -- and this 

22 is at page 107 of the opinion: "It may happen that new 

23 Federal laws and new Federal regulations may in time 

24 preempt the Federal common law of nuisance. We think 

that both together presents the best and easiest case

1 for displacement," and you have that here. You have not 

2 just the endangerment finding; you have the EPA 

3 regulating all passenger cars, all light motor vehicles 

4 right now.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if I insisted you answer 

6 the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be? 

7 No endangerment finding. Is there displacement? 

8  GENERAL KATYAL: I think that it's a -- it's 

9 a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I 

think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler 

11 suggests. But I -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is it -- I don't 

13 want to make -- try to make a case for you, but why is 

14 it that much more difficult? It's just -- I mean, it's 

sort of like the negative commerce clause, right? The 

16 fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a 

17 particular area means that the ball has passed from the 

18 courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and 

19 they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a 

particular question. 

21  GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I think that 

22 there's a good argument to be made. I imagine the 

23 argument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment 

24 is that the Clean Air Act doesn't look precisely like 

the Clean Water Act in terms of forcing the agency to

1 decide various things. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that would 

3 be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a 

4 displacement question.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that very well may 

6 be. And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

7 had asked before about State common law causes of action 

8 and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the 

9 existence of those would somehow mean that the Court 

should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a 

11 way. And we think that the same arguments that prohibit 

12 the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal 

13 common law cause of action for displacement very well 

14 may be preemption questions as well that could be 

addressed down the road with respect to State common law 

16 actions. 

17  And we don't think the Court should be 

18 troubled by the existence of a potential State common 

19 law cause of action. It's just like Milwaukee II, in 

which the dissenters made precisely this argument. They 

21 said: If you don't recognize it, then the States will 

22 regulate it and it will balkanize and the like. And 

23 what the majority said is: That's a question for down 

24 the road; the question for now is has displacement 

occurred?

1  JUSTICE ALITO: I understand that that's not 

2 the issue here, but does the government have a position 

3 on that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same 

4 public nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal 

common law, would that be consistent? 

6  GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think we have 

7 a position at this time on that. That's I think an 

8 enormously complicated question we can get to at an 

9 appropriate time. Our central -- our central submission 

to you on displacement is this: That there is literally 

11 no precedent for the argument that they are making here, 

12 which is that the Federal Government has to regulate the 

13 precise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they 

14 are seeking before displacement occurs.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have a position on 

16 whether there's anything to be displaced here? Do you 

17 have a position on whether there is, in fact, a Federal 

18 cause of action? 

19  GENERAL KATYAL: Well, we think, again, the 

Court doesn't need to get into that question because 

21 it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law 

22 causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and 

23 there have been two that the Federal Government has 

24 filed since 1970 and three that we can find all together 

in the Federal courts of appeals, all of which have

1 failed for various displacement reasons, and the others. 

2  We think none of those look anything like 

3 the -- the common law cause of action here. And, so, it 

4 would at least require this Court to extend quite 

dramatically Federal common law to cover this type of 

6 situation in which everyone is a potential perpetrator 

7 and everyone is a potential victim. And it would 

8 require the Court, in fashioning relief, to think 

9 through a number of things that the Federal courts 

haven't ever had to grapple with from the nature -­

11  JUSTICE ALITO: So, if there were -- if 

12 there were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that 

13 this suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail 

14 prudential standing, but you don't have a position as to 

whether there would be a claim under Federal common law? 

16  GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. We think 

17 it would still fail prudential standing because of the 

18 quantity and quality of the nature of the problem here, 

19 and the multitude of different policy judgments that 

would be required -- that this Court would be required 

21 to undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of 

22 action in the absence of a statute. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: But I'm sorry, General, 

24 because I was understanding your answer differently, and 

maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no

1 legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal 

2 law cause of action. Is that correct? 

3  GENERAL KATYAL: I doubted that there was 

4 prudential standing.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but as to whether the 

6 cause of action exists under Federal common law in a 

7 case like this, where you said it was so different from 

8 the other Federal common law cases that the Court has 

9 seen.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I -- I think I put it 

11 as we doubt it. I mean, I think that it would require a 

12 dramatic extension, Justice Kagan, of a case like 

13 Tennessee Copper and the other cases that this Court has 

14 heard, which are essentially: A pollutes a river or 

something and hurts B. A here is the world and B is the 

16 world, and that is such a difference in scale and scope 

17 to pose enormously difficult questions as to whether 

18 this Court should recognize such a cause of action. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Same -- same hypothetical, 

assume no Federal statute, and -- and assume no Federal 

21 common law. What about State law? Does State common 

22 law become displaced because it's a matter of Federal 

23 concern? We don't -- we don't -- we don't usually have 

24 preemption of Federal common law.

1 arguments, Justice Kennedy -- I'm not sure if the 

2 premise of your question has a Clean Air Act in 

3 existence or not. There may be some sort of arguments 

4 about displacement or preemption under the Clean Air 

Act -­

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The hypothetical is that 

7 the Federal law -- Federal statutory law doesn't apply. 

8  GENERAL KATYAL: Then I think that again for 

9 purposes of State common law, I think this Court would 

approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee 

11 II, which is to say that's a really separate 

12 policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to 

13 answer the questions about whether a cause of action 

14 should be recognized or whether displacement has 

occurred. But I would point out that the States that 

16 have sued generally have doctrines like prudential 

17 standing, doctrines like political question, that may 

18 very well bar the reaching of these claims in State 

19 courts as well.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be very odd to 

21 say that there's no Federal common law, but also that 

22 there's no -- no displacement of State law. That -­

23 that seems to me odd. 

24  GENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely the 

situation that -- that this Court was grappling with in

1 Milwaukee II, and it said that -­

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we get to -- to the 

3 situation that now exists? They are seeking standards 

4 for existing sources. I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you 

agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new 

6 source or a modified source; we're talking about 

7 existing sources. Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set 

8 standards for existing sources? 

9  GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice 

Ginsburg. Let me say three things about that. First 

11 is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources. To 

12 the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to 

13 increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and 

14 this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then 

those power plants right now are subject to regulation. 

16 Indeed, one has already had to get a permit. These 

17 regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for 

18 existing power plants that seek to modify. 

19  Second, there is a settlement agreement in 

place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how 

21 and whether to regulate existing power sources, the 

22 existing stationary sources. 

23  And third, and I think most fundamentally, 

24 there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that 

the government must regulate the specific industry, the 

33

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for 

2 displacement to occur. Rather, Sea Clammers and 

3 Milwaukee II I think make explicit that that's the wrong 

4 question. And so long as the nuisance is being 

addressed -- and here the nuisance is undoubtedly being 

6 addressed with a panoply of different Federal actions in 

7 the area of global warming, and an executive order that 

8 says that fighting global warming is one of the 

9 government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps 

taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the 

11 400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA 

12 has done with its experts to appropriately regulate 

13 greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common 

14 law court of action doing something which would frankly 

put you all at sea in terms of the complexity, 

16 economics, international nature of the problem. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, could I take you 

18 back on that last point to another threshold question, 

19 which is the political question doctrine? Because a lot 

of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three 

21 from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go 

22 there, that we should instead address this matter on 

23 prudential standing grounds. But the political question 

24 doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of 

arguments you're making. So why not?

2 not going to tarry too long on which different way we 

3 should win this case. I think either is an appropriate 

4 way.

 (Laughter.) 

6  GENERAL KATYAL: But I think that the 

7 prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because 

8 it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including 

9 the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of 

action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first 

11 place, as opposed to the political question doctrine 

12 which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of 

13 the adjudication. 

14  We agree that -- that the political question 

doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case, 

16 but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this 

17 Court can handle this case on prudential standing first 

18 and recognize that this is an unprecedented action 

19 involving literally the world, and it is not suited for 

judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from 

21 the precepts of the prudential standing doctrine. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not an area where 

23 the Court can't go. To take a political question we all 

24 agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the 

impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD 

11  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

12  MS. UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

13 it please the Court: 

14  This case rests on the longstanding 

fundamental authority of the States to protect their 

16 land, their natural resources, and their citizens from 

17 air pollution emitted in other States. It rests on 

18 three propositions: One, the interests of the States 

19 are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as 

the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are 

21 significant contributors to it; and, three, these 

22 defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective 

23 measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would 

24 slow the effects of global warming.

 We will have to prove these propositions, 

36

1 and after we do the district court will have to 

2 determine whether it can frame an appropriate equitable 

3 injunction. That's what discovery and trials are for. 

4 But this Court should not close the courthouse door to 

this case at the outset. The common law action for 

6 public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years, 

7 has been adapted by courts to cover new environmental 

8 threats, and there's no reason why the courts can't do 

9 the same thing here.

 The defendants say there are too many 

11 plaintiffs, too many potential defendants, and that 

12 adjudication of this case will require courts to solve 

13 the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply 

14 not so.

 On the plaintiffs' side, this is about the 

16 States. We are alleging the kind of injury to States 

17 that has been traditionally recognized by this Court; 

18 their lands, their citizens, their businesses are being 

19 injured by pollution emitted in other States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Underwood, the -­

21 the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set 

22 standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing 

23 that EPA does. I mean, Congress set up the EPA to 

24 promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the 

relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district

1 judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, 

2 as a kind of super EPA. 

3  MS. UNDERWOOD: It's not as a super EPA. 

4 It's something much smaller. It's a different question. 

Interstate pollution disputes have historically been 

6 entrusted to the courts, including the determination of 

7 how much is unreasonable, which is -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we just 

9 concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: 

District court, if we pass everything else, you set 

11 emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set 

12 a cap, and then annually you require further reductions. 

13 Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it 

14 sets emission standards.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's also like what 

16 the Court did in Tennessee Copper. That is to say, this 

17 case doesn't ask the Court to decide how much, contrary 

18 to what Petitioners suggest, to decide how much emission 

19 reduction is required to solve the whole problem of 

global warming and then allocate a portion to these 

21 defendants. It asks the Court to do something simpler, 

22 and that is to decide whether these defendants can take 

23 reasonable cost-effective measures that would help to 

24 slow the pace of global warming. So -­

4  MS. UNDERWOOD: Correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There are other -- there are 

6 countervailing interests. So how does the court -- how 

7 can a district court balance those interests? 

8  MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I would say two things 

9 about that. One, it was also true in Tennessee Copper 

that it was not the case that the sulfur emissions could 

11 be eliminated or that the plant was to be put out of 

12 business. The Court in that case ordered a reduction of 

13 sulfur, a quite specific reduction of sulfur emissions 

14 in one season and more in another season. And how 

does -­

16  JUSTICE ALITO: But do you seriously argue 

17 this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more 

18 complicated than that case? 

19  MS. UNDERWOOD: It's somewhat more -- it's 

larger. I don't know if it's more complicated. The way 

21 a court would do that is presumably the way it did it in 

22 Tennessee Copper. That is, there could be expert 

23 testimony, there could also be evidence about whether -­

24 what other emitters are doing, what they do that is 

feasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions.

1 In Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and 

2 the other was subject to an order, and it would have 

3 been available to the Court to look to what the settling 

4 defendant did for some indication of what the 

nonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do. So 

6 there is evidence available from which a court could 

7 conclude what is reasonable. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is the 

9 -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that 

would have to be undertaken to decide what level of 

11 emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of

It's not, any more than it was in Tennessee Copper. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because -- right. 

22 But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of

much you want to readjust the world economy to address

2 to post -- to impose on a district court judge.

4 that the plaintiffs would have to bear. That is to say, 

we have alleged, and are entitled to try to prove -- and

7 determine -- that "the defendants have available to them 

8 practical, feasible" -- I'm reading from the

reducing carbon dioxide emissions without significantly 

11 increasing the cost of electricity to their customers,

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're dealing with 

an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an 

16 area, but certainly a vast area here. And the fact that 

17 they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't 

18 affect their customers is based on the fact that other 

19 power plants that are part of the grid will serve part 

of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some 

21 extent.

1 I understood the question of standards to be a question 

2 addressed to the political question point. And even if 

3 it might be desirable to have an agency set standards, 

4 it is not something that is beyond the power of a court 

to do. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Can the courts set a tax? 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The agency -- the agency 

8 is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another 

9 facet of this case, the potential for conflict. The 

EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it 

11 does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and 

12 it has taken the first steps. 

13  One argument that the EPA -- that the United 

14 States is presenting is the way agencies go about this 

is incrementally, so they're starting with motor 

16 vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and 

17 then they'll get to maybe where you are. But you want 

18 the Court to start with the existing sources, to set 

19 limits that may be in conflict with what an existing 

agency is doing. 

21  Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there 

22 and that it is regulating in this area? 

23  MS. UNDERWOOD: No, we do not ignore that. 

24 This is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to 

arrive in this Court, because what is offered as

1 displacing is something that is said to be imminent, not 

2 something that actually exists, and something that is 

3 imminent may never happen. It was, of course, for that 

4 reason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR 

and we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the 

6 lower courts could deal with the unfolding events as 

7 they occur. 

8  But the case is here now, and there is no 

9 Federal statute or regulation that currently regulates 

the emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified 

11 power plants, like the ones operated by the defendants. 

12 And the Clean Air Act works very differently from the 

13 Clean Water Act. It did not put in place a permit 

14 system for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970. 

Unlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids 

16 all discharges until they're authorized by permit, the 

17 Clean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA 

18 makes findings and imposes restrictions. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I suppose there 

were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and 

21 your suit would override those determinations. 

22  MS. UNDERWOOD: No, our suit is consistent 

23 with those determinations. That is to say, the design 

24 of the statute leaves preexisting law in place until EPA 

steps in.

1  If the Clean Air Act were thought to 

2 displace the common law before any regulation occurred, 

3 that would mean the immediate effect of this 

4 antipollution law in 1970 was to reduce pollution 

control because -­

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much -- how much 

7 regulation do you need before you would admit that there 

8 is displacement? Is it -- is it a preemption analysis 

9 that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: It's a displacement 

11 analysis. I believe it's a displacement analysis. 

12 What -- what we start from is that the States have a 

13 historic right to go to court under the Federal common 

14 law and that to -- to -- to deal with the problem of 

interstate pollution, and that that was a promise that 

16 they obtained, the Federal remedy, in exchange for the 

17 surrender of sovereignty in joining the Union. So there 

18 has to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there 

19 being a Federal remedy.

 Now, when the Clean Air Act was -- was 

21 passed, without any regulations, if it displaced the 

22 Federal common law, there would be no Federal law 

23 applicable at all, because the Federal common law would 

24 be displaced and there would be no Federal regulatory 

law. The States would have recourse at that point to

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, of course, there are 

11 some similarities between the two. In each case we're 

12 talking about whether Federal -- whether one law 

13 substitutes for another, whether one law ousts another. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe you can 

tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is 

16 different from preemption. Tell me in this area you're 

17 going to have displacement but not preemption. Or I 

18 guess it's the other way around, in which there's going 

19 to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference?

 You said in response to Justice Kagan that 

21 if they've made a considered decision that this is the 

22 amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there 

23 would be displacement. In what way is that different

1 on that front. The difference is that with respect to 

2 preemption Congress has to decide that it does -- that 

3 it wishes to override State law expressly. Here what 

4 we're talking about is simply whether Congress or the 

agency has acted. It's a little different. They don't 

6 have to have in mind Federal common law. They simply 

7 have to act in a way that over -- that -- that 

8 substitutes for Federal common law, because the promise 

9 of the republic really for the States was that the 

States would have a Federal law applicable to their

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that they

6 That's not the -- that's not the difference. What -­

8  MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think in this 

9 context they probably work pretty similarly. I would 

just say that in each case the question is, what is 

11 the -- what does the new law do with respect to the law 

12 that it is said to replace? And -­

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're right 

14 that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and 

I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was 

16 that they are two very distinct propositions. 

17  MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, they have different 

18 reasons for existing, that's certainly what Milwaukee v. 

19 Illinois said. That doesn't mean they have to in every 

instance operate differently. The point of preemption 

21 is about the Federal-State balance, and displacement is 

22 simply -- is about separation of powers and the

2 standards for existing sources, the court can be side by 

3 side with the agency; we know that the agency is 

4 beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then 

it's moving forward. But you say as long as the EPA 

6 hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be 

7 conducting a similar function with -- one of many 

8 differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards 

9 they will set -- they will do it through notice and 

comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; 

11 but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the

substituting for the court. That is, the default, the

17 there was an agency, was a common law remedy.

1 program underway. But what they point to is an 

2 agreement by EPA to begin considering whether to 

3 regulate new and existing power plants. That can't be 

4 enough. The Federal common law exists for the purpose 

of giving States a remedy for interstate pollution, and 

6 if it's displaced when -- when the EPA begins thinking 

7 about it, then EPA could think about it for a long time. 

8 They've said when they hope to complete this rulemaking, 

9 but it is not uncommon for delays to -- to enter into 

such processes, and it could be a long time before EPA 

11 actually arrives at a judgment. A lot can happen to 

12 delay or derail the fulfillment of a promise. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: General, do you think that 

14 you have a Federal common law cause of action against 

anybody in the world? Your briefs talk a lot about how 

16 these are the five largest emissions producers, but I 

17 saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five. 

18 Is there something that you think limits it to large 

19 emissions producers rather than anybody in the world?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. I think limitations, a 

21 limitation to substantial sources -- and I'll talk in a 

22 minute about what that might mean -- comes from the 

23 Restatement definition, from garden variety State cases 

24 about -- involving nuisance, and also perhaps from the

they produce amounts ranging from 1 to 3 and a half

1 nuisance claim, and there are various ways to draw the

principle there. 

11  And then beyond the States, plaintiffs would 

12 have to, to bring a common law nuisance claim as well as 

13 to have standing, would have to have a special injury of 

14 some kind that would distinguish them from the 

general -- from the general public. The Land Trusts 

16 here argue that they, because they hold their lands in 

17 trust for the public, they have special standing. 

18 That's -- there's no need to reach that question. This 

19 case could turn and should turn on the right of the 

States to protect their people from -- and their -- and 

21 their land from -- from interstate -­

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, General, much of your 

23 argument depends on this notion that this suit is really 

24 like any other pollution suit, but all those other 

pollution suits that you've been talking about are much

1 more localized affairs. One factory emitting discharge 

2 into one stream. They don't involve these kinds of 

3 national/international policy issues of the kind that 

4 this case does. I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm 

between the precedents you have and this case, isn't 

6 there? 

7  MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know if I would call 

8 it a chasm, but there's a large distance between them, 

9 and -- but I would like to separate two things. The 

international aspects of this are simply, I think, 

11 beyond -- we're not suggesting that this -- this -- that 

12 the Federal common law of nuisance entails relief 

13 against international defendants. It does exist for 

14 interstate -- for conflicts between the States 

essentially. So I would like to put those aside. 

16  And then, in terms of the magnitude, well, 

17 there are many cases, not just one factory, the 

18 Milwaukee v. Illinois itself involved not just the 

19 Milwaukee sewage district that -- that was sued, but 

there were many other contributors to pollution in that 

21 lake. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: In setting these standards, 

23 there would somebody difficult trade-offs, wouldn't 

24 there? Could you just explain in concrete terms how a 

district judge would deal with those? Let -- and just

1 determining the facts is going to be hard enough, but 

2 let's assume all the facts are proven, there's not a 

3 dispute about the facts. So that if a certain reduction 

4 in greenhouse gas emissions is ordered, that will have 

this effect, it will increase the cost of electricity by 

6 a certain amount, and that will produce certain effects. 

7 It will result in the loss of a certain number of jobs, 

8 it will mean that consumers will have less money to 

9 spend on other -- other things. Some people will not be 

able to have air conditioning in the summer. That will 

11 have health effects. 

12  How is the district judge -- what standard 

13 does the district judge have to decide those? It's 

14 just -- what is it, just what's reasonable?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, reasonableness is the 

16 beginning. I -- I've suggested already first that we've 

17 alleged that this can be done without increasing the 

18 cost to the consumers. That may seem -- that -- that is 

19 a subject for proof.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Implausible -- implausible 

21 is the word you're looking for.

23  MS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Justice Scalia.

1 as I suggested, in Tennessee Copper and perhaps in this 

2 area as well, companies that settle this litigation or 

3 companies that don't litigate but instead do adopt 

4 measures that haven't been widely adopted. There -­

there is a practice to examine in the world about what's 

6 feasible and what's cost-effective, and that's not 

7 different from -­

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose 

9 cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but 

you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the 

11 best way to deal with the problem. I would like the 

12 court to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right? 

13 And we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury 

14 that you have, everything's the same, you have 14 

experts who say this is how to get it done. It's 

16 cost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will 

17 actually bring about a world without global warming, and 

18 so let's do it. 

19  Now, does the district judge, in your 

opinion, have the power to enter that order? 

21  MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think so. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: All right, now next 

23 question is going to be, if he does not have the power 

24 to enter that order, which could be proved to be 

extremely effective, and least possible harm to the

1 consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order 

2 you want? 

3  MS. UNDERWOOD: Because the common law of 

4 nuisance is addressed to direct the polluter to abate 

the nuisance. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, this will. This is 

7 addressed to that. It says abate the nuisance, here's 

8 how you're going to do it. You're going to put a $20 a 

9 tax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover 

that nuisance will be abated. And we bring in 15 

11 economists. 

12  MS. UNDERWOOD: Actually, the order we're 

13 asking for is less intrusive than that. We ask the 

14 defendants to abate the nuisance, we ask the court to 

order them to abate the nuisance by some amount, 

16 informed by what information is available about methods. 

17 And then -­

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it less 

19 intrusive -­

MS. UNDERWOOD: Because -­

21  JUSTICE BREYER: -- to try to get into the 

22 details of how an electricity company will in fact run 

23 its operation, than to say all you have to do is make a

product?

1  MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, because we're not 

2 suggesting that the court would get into the details on 

3 our theory, either. It would be the defendants that 

4 would get into the details, that would figure out for 

themselves what the best way was to meet these standards 

6 -- to meet the objective. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish Justice Breyer had 

8 made this argument in the EPA case. I don't think the 

9 EPA case -­

(Laughter.) 

11  MS. UNDERWOOD: And of course it's true that 

12 if you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the 

13 Federal -- and the Federal regulations displace the 

14 Federal common law either now or in the future, then 

under Ouellette, the same Federal statute that replaces 

16 Federal common law will revive source State common law, 

17 because of the savings clause in that statute, because 

18 of a choice Congress made; and that result, while less 

19 -- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing 

Federal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless 

21 leave common law courts in the business that they're -­

22 of attempting to address pollution problems. 

23  The suggestion has been made that the EPA 

24 has entered the field of greenhouse gas, and that's 

enough, but it isn't just one field. It only seems like

1 one because the EPA once said the whole subject was off 

2 limits and beyond their jurisdiction. Once that 

3 obstacle is removed, there still remain a series of 

4 programs under the statute, a series of kinds of sources 

that need to be regulated. The Clean Air Act regulates 

6 by substance and by source. It's a collection of 

7 statutory programs, and taking action under one program 

8 can't displace the common law as it applies to matters 

9 outside that program.

 It may well be that there will be a 

11 regulation soon that displaces, but it would be very 

12 surprising if this Court concluded that the promise of 

13 regulation is enough to displace the Federal common law 

14 as distinguished from the actuality of it.

 The Court has suggested that a court might 

16 impose standards that would conflict with what the EPA 

17 is doing, but there's really no reason to think that 

18 would happen because if what a court sets out to do is 

19 find out what feasible methods there are for reduction 

and then order the defendants to make reductions that 

21 are feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much 

22 less demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately 

23 to make. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the EPA comes up 

with a different number? Would it -- than the one you

3  MS. UNDERWOOD: You mean an emission 

4 reduction?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes. I mean you -­

6  MS. UNDERWOOD: If the EPA -- when the EPA 

7 speaks, the EPA's rule will displace the Federal common 

8 law. We're talking entirely -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And will displace the 

judgment that has been obtained under Federal law? 

11  MS. UNDERWOOD: If -- it would presumably 

12 provide a basis for the defendant to go back to the 

13 court and -- and vacate the judgment or alter the 

14 judgment to comply with regulations, should that happen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And the court says 

16 no? 

17  MS. UNDERWOOD: That's what appellate courts 

18 are here for, isn't it? 

19  (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, just 

21 to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing? Is 

22 it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the 

23 continuing validity of the injunction it entered 

24 previously?

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to be 

4 a displacement of the normal process of administrative 

law, which we would review the agency's determination of 

6 how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions. 

7  MS. UNDERWOOD: On a different litigation 

8 track, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the 

9 EPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a 

judgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary 

11 litigation track to, if -- if intervening events make 

12 equitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the 

13 court and ask the court to modify its injunction. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. And I guess 

that's the central problem. Once you turn it over to 

16 litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards 

17 that would regulate emissions as opposed to the 

18 standards that would apply with respect to an agency's 

19 determination.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's a 

21 different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing 

22 an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards 

23 that are reached are going to be a level of emission 

24 reduction through either process.

1 Federal common law is displaced. When it doesn't, and 

2 during what could be a long period of time when it

12  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER 

13  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

14  MR. KEISLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a few points. 

16  First, with respect to the merits and what 

17 it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan, 

18 it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so 

19 fraught and difficult in international negotiations and 

at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's 

21 because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens 

22 among critical social goods in favor of important 

23 environmental considerations; and the remedies that are 

24 being considered are potentially transformative because 

they involve the way we use and supply and pay for

1 energy. And the problems with courts attempting to 

2 replicate what's going on in those venues are not simply 

3 the matter is complex, although of course it's extremely 

4 complex, but there is no legal principle here to guide 

the decision. It's a question of trade-offs, how the 

6 country wants to balance the projected environmental 

7 risks and benefits against the projected economic 

8 benefits and costs. 

9  If Congress enacts a statute providing a 

standard, then our political question argument goes 

11 away. It's not that this is permanently off limits to 

12 the judiciary. It's that it requires a standard. And 

13 in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often 

14 create an orderly framework for consideration within a 

statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting 

16 the Clean Air Act. 

17  And the final point I would make my friend 

18 and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the 

19 following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this 

is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a 

21 very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't 

22 possibly present justiciability problems, under 

23 standing, political question doctrines; and we say that 

24 the very powerful standing and political question 

obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this

1 are a signal that this is nothing like the historical 

2 cause of action that they've relied on. 

3  To classify climate change as a tort would 

4 trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away 

from the politically accountable branches and to the 

6 courts, which we think would be inconsistent with 

7 separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that 

8 the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case 

9 be dismissed.
