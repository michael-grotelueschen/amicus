 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of 

Iraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case.

 Mr. Franklin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Acting with express statutory authority and 

in furtherance of important foreign policies following 

the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President 

made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of 

law that had applied to countries that sponsored 

terrorism.

 Under the plain language of the statute, 

those provisions included former section 1605(a)(7), 

which was a provision of law that applied only to such 

countries. Because section 1605(a)(7) was made 

inapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's 

determination, it cannot now serve as the applicable 

statutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign 

sovereign immunity and therefore subject matter 

jurisdiction in this case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Franklin, even if you 

are right about that, the legislation was an emergency 

measure with a sunset. It was revived for 1 year, but 

then no more. So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack 

of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back? Didn't 

the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency 

law sunsetted?

 MR. FRANKLIN: No, Your Honor. The language 

of the sunset provision to which you are referring 

states only that the authorities contained in the 

section would expire. That means the authorities to the 

President given to him to act. Congress did not say 

that the effect of what the President had done would be 

nullified once his authority to act had expired.

 And it's important to recognize that the 

President not only made inapplicable provisions of law 

addressed to state nations that had sponsored terrorism, 

but he also suspended the Iraq Sanctions Act under the 

same authority. The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been 

repealed.

 So, if it were correct that the -- that the 

-- everything that the President had done became 

nullified upon the expiration of his authority to act, 

then the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be 

in effect today, but would have been in effect since

September 30th, 2005. And if there's -- that is not 

what Congress intended. The Iraq Sanctions Act has a 

huge panoply of sanctions, both dependent on and 

independent of the legislative determination of Iraq as 

a state sponsor of terrorism.

 But if there's any question about this, when 

Congress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to 

extend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that 

Congress acted, the legislative history said quite 

expressly that the extension was not necessary to extend 

what the President had already done, because that had 

already happened and that was permanent. But it was 

necessary according to Congress for other reasons.

 So both because of the plain language of the 

sunset provision and because of what Congress 

subsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the 

interpretation of the United States on this point, the 

President's actions didn't sunset. It was emergency 

legislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give 

the President the authorities. We were at war at that 

time and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees 

almost overnight away from penalizing the government of 

Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an 

outlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the 

people of Iraq.

And Congress gave the President the broad 

catch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to 

relieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of 

the very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had 

applied to them as a result of the prior regime's 

support for terrorism.

 The President did this in exercise of his 

foreign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq 

could better rebuild their country and establish a new 

democratic government that would in fact prove to become 

one of the United States' most trusted allies in a 

region that has not always had very many of them.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you make of 

the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was 

never its intention, it was never its intention for the 

President to have the authority to -- to do this?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Two things, Justice Alito: 

The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress 

that acted in 2003. This was a subsequent Congress. 

And that statement occurred almost 5 years after the 

legislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after 

the President's authority to act had expired. As such, 

that statement is nothing more than subsequent 

legislative history that cannot be determinative in 

deciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.

That determination should be judged according to the 

statute that was in front of the President when he 

acted.

 But if there's any question at all in the 

Court's mind about the application of that provision, 

the President waived it. He waived its application as 

to Iraq. It is important to remember that the President 

would not sign the version of the NDAA that just had 

that provision in it. He vetoed the bill. He vetoed it 

only because of its effect that it might have on Iraq, 

and he would not sign a replacement until he was given 

the authority to waive any and all of the provisions of 

section 1083 to the extent they may affect Iraq. So if 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Including -- including 

the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7). So that would 

be revived?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, we don't agree with 

that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the 

waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive 

application of extant provisions of law to the extent 

they might affect Iraq. The President wasn't given the 

additional power to reenact statutes, to put a repealed 

statute back on the book. The waiver was just like the 

EWSAA waiver, where the President was authorized to

waiver with respect to Iraq existing privileges --

existing provisions of law. But again, to the extent 

there is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C. 

section 108 answers that conclusively. That section 

provides that even if Congress itself had repealed 

section 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring 

section 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that 

section. And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C. 

108. Obviously the President by exercising a blanket 

waiver authority can't have a better or more effective 

ability to bring back into existence expired statutes 

than Congress itself could have done.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Because technically it's 

just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment. I 

suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival, 

but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, we are talking here 

about a waiver applied to a repeal. I think the 

temporal point here is that the repeal happened 

effective upon the President's signature of the NDAA, on 

January 20, 2008. That was already done. The repeal 

happened. At that point, section 1605(a)(7) no longer 

existed. It was not in the U.S. Code.

 The President was authorized then 

subsequently to waive existing provisions of law. And

here I think that this -- to allow the President to 

re-enact statutes according to a waiver authority is 

contrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also 

common sense as well. He was -- he was allowed to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I agree.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any other 

instance in which a jurisdictional provision is 

withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress 

having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think the closest 

analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the 

precise circumstances we have here, and that is the 

doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity. Prior to the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations 

upon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the 

executive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated 

in the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of 

requiring the courts to, quote, "surrender their 

jurisdiction," even if it had previously attached.

 So here we have the precise situation that 

had always happened. It had always been this way prior 

to the FSIA. The President had always been able to make 

determinations on foreign sovereign immunity that would 

have the immediate effect of divesting the courts of

their ability to hear cases. Now, there were of course 

jurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred 

jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had 

no trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating 

from Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of 

sovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act.

 So this is actually not any different really 

than what had occurred before. We have also cited 

numerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute 

that do depend on executive determination. So there's 

really nothing particularly unusual about that as well.

 I would like to turn at this point, if I 

might, just briefly to our alternative argument in case 

the Court might find it relevant. This is an 

alternative argument. It's not one that the Court needs 

to reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching 

the same result in this case. And that is the simple 

fact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the 

President had done previously to it, was repealed. And 

it was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a 

simultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional 

provision that encompassed every single pending claim 

that was then pending at the time.

 So this is the classic example of a

jurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases. 

Congress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave 

another provision that encompassed every pending claim 

and allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to 

refile their cases.

 Now, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq 

were not able to exercise their ability under the new 

statute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the 

only reason they were not allowed to do that was the 

President's waiver, and the President's waiver was 

expressly made applicable both to pending cases and to 

preexisting claims.

 So, for both of those reasons the 

alternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were there judgments, 

outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments 

outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on 

appeal?

 MR. FRANKLIN: There is at least two that I 

am aware of, two default judgments. They are cited in 

our brief. And the effective ability of those default 

judgment creditors, as it were, to execute on those 

judgments would depend on the application of the new 

statutes that Congress enacted about judgment execution. 

Those are not at issue in this case. But the answer to

your question is yes, there were at least two judgments 

that I am aware of that were default judgments where 

Iraq had not appeared and did not contest the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you're not claiming 

that those could be reopened?

 MR. FRANKLIN: We are not claiming in this 

-- in this proceeding they could be reopened. We're 

actually not claiming -- we haven't claimed in any 

proceeding that they can be reopened. But there is a 

serious question as to whether or not the plaintiffs 

would be able to execute in the United States on those 

judgments. Also, they are default judgments and so they 

are subject to all of the usual rules to the extent 

about reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of 

this sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds 

of reopening of default judgments. So, to the extent 

there are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.

 But we are not -- we are not making -- this 

argument's immunity argument today applies to these 

pending cases and the ability of courts to enter 

judgments, not to existing default judgments, but the 

execution on those judgments may well be affected by the 

arguments we are making today.

 In the final analysis, I think this -- this 

is a case that turns ultimately on the President's

exercise of his foreign affairs powers as delegated to 

him by Congress. The Court has traditionally given the 

executive a fair amount of leeway and deference in this 

field. In this case I think that's particularly 

appropriate, given that these foreign policies are among 

the most significant facing the United States today.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it your 

argument would be no different if this involved some 

other area. It doesn't depend upon the deference under 

the foreign affairs --

MR. FRANKLIN: No, it doesn't depend on it, 

but I do think it's important to recognize that the 

President was acting in that -- in that field when he 

made these determinations, and to also recognize that 

these determinations -- the foreign policy of the United 

States has not changed. It is still towards supporting 

the people of Iraq and it's supporting the ability of 

the people to rebuild their country and also their new 

democratic government, and all of those policies would 

be thwarted or seriously disrupted if the Court were to 

hold that Iraq's sovereign immunity has been abrogated 

in these cases.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I also gather that the 

ability of the President or the United States to seek 

some compensation from Iraq through diplomatic channels

on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by 

this outcome, right?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

That is the way that these kinds of claims have always 

been addressed in the past and these are the way that 

these kinds of claims, particularly between friendly 

allies, ought to be addressed. And I would think that 

in this instance the Court in its Republic of Peru case 

probably said it best and I'm just going to quote from 

the last page of our brief. The Court said: "Our 

national interest will be better served in such cases if 

the wrongs to suitors involving our relations with a 

friendly foreign power are righted through diplomatic 

negotiations rather than the compulsions of judicial 

proceedings."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is before the 

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, right?

 MR. FRANKLIN: That is true, but this case 

involve the doctrine of foreign immunity and it embodies 

the same concerns of reciprocity that were at issue 

then.

 If I might, I would like to reserve the 

remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President 

to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision 

of law that applies to countries that have sponsored 

terrorism. The terrorism exception to the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain 

language of that authority. But if there were any 

question about that, certainly the President's exercise 

of his authority under that statute would be entitled to 

deference.

 Even if one were to add the atextual 

additional limitation that the Acree court majority 

tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would 

stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime 

in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government, 

still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear 

his determination that the threat of billions of dollars 

of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of 

their assets by attachment constituted an immediate 

threat to the foreign policy interests of the United

States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought we were just 

told that because there -- of the limitations on 

enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat 

to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the 

judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is because of 

the authorities that the President exercised under the 

second proviso of 1503. There are exceptions to the 

immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment. 

There is one that specifically applies to countries that 

have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and 

that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq 

pursuant to this same authority.

 And so, again, it is essential to the 

government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these 

judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in 

fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were 

plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the 

very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United 

States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in 

order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the 

immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein 

regime. These critical foreign policy goals would have 

been frustrated had the President not been able to make

our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our 

foreign policy.

 And, of course, the Court in Altmann 

recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an 

expression of our present foreign policy interests. 

That has always been the case. And although Congress 

can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA, 

section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never 

been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy 

with respect to a country as happened in the spring of 

2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of 

sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied 

to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of 

terrorism. On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted 

180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the 

success of the new Iraqi regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is all of this -- I 

won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if 

the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, 

well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's 

no cause of action.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor. 

The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for 

failure to state a claim was because counsel in that 

particular suit was unable to identify a source of law

for their claim. The D.C. Circuit has correctly held 

that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of 

action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when 

pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.

 But numerous district court judgments exist 

where the courts have upheld the availability of 

transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under 

the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the 

law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to 

provide a cause of action. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the wrong occurred 

would have been Iraq.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And 

-- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of 

law analysis. As I said, a number of these judgments 

apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff 

resided. The United States has expressed its view that 

there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a 

State to project its substantive law to a tort that 

occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I 

don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at 

least.

 So plaintiffs have successfully obtained 

judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7). And there 

were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted

against Iraq. And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were 

actively going and trying to seek the actual money that 

the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to 

pay immediate costs of the reconstruction.

 But this does not mean -- and I think 

Justice Scalia's question was critical here. It does 

not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any 

remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on 

the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign 

state that is not on the very small list of designated 

state sponsors of terrorism. Their claims are subject 

to state-to-state diplomatic resolution. And, in fact, 

there have been discussions -- there are ongoing 

discussions -- to establish a framework for resolving 

the claims against the Hussein regime.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't any such 

settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the 

Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and 

probably the worst victims of the terror?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

think that -- that that is one consideration. The 

United Nations has established a mechanism for funding 

many of the victims of the Hussein regime. And -- and 

-- but the United States would have the obligation to 

represent the interests of the United States citizens

that were injured. But, as -- as Your Honor's question 

points out, there are a lot of considerations that go 

into the diplomatic or state-to-state resolution of the 

claim beyond those that would be available to a court to 

consider in just adjudicating the particular plaintiff's 

claims. And that is why these have historically been 

reserved for diplomatic resolution. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't 

doubt, in absence of the waiver, that this is a claim 

that could proceed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity 

Act?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. No, I don't. 

And -- and Congress has established as a means to deter 

further acts of terrorism by states that have been so 

designated --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that claim could 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- the abrogation 

of immunity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the 

waiver, that claim could proceed despite the fact that 

there has been a change in the governing authority in 

Iraq?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. The

1605(a)(7) was that the jurisdiction of the courts would 

continue for any claim that arose from acts committed 

while the state was designated. But the authority that 

the President was given in 1503 was to render those 

statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq. And, of 

course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold 

that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and 

authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to 

1605(a)(7). It would be application of that statute.

 So the only way that one can give full 

effect to the plain language of the statute, "make 

inapplicable," is to say that as soon as the President 

exercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became 

inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising 

jurisdiction over Iraq.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that there 

should be deference to what the executive did because of 

his role in foreign affairs. But in the Foreign 

Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew 

what had been the executive's traditional authority and 

said: President, no more; we are going to set rules of 

how sovereign immunity will operate.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is true. And 

in 1503, Congress restored to the President in a sense a 

very small portion of the authority he had previously

exercised before the FSIA's adoption. 1605(a)(7) on its 

own terms turns on determinations by the executive. 

It's a statute that can be turned on and turned off by 

designating or de-designating a country. It has a 

particular temporal consequence, the rule that -- that 

the Chief Justice alluded to.

 In 1503, the Congress gave the President a 

different authority to turn that statute off, the 

authority to make it inapplicable only with respect to 

one country, Iraq, and in the context of the most 

dramatic transformation of foreign relations that --

that could transpire.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Court will want to have available to it 

the blue brief for the Petitioners and Joint Appendix 

Volume 2, which together reproduce the statutes that are 

relevant to this case. And I do want to talk about the 

text of the statutes.

 And the point that I'm going to make from 

the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General

just correctly described to you what it was that 

Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the 

structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by 

a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and 

that designation changes so that you are no longer on 

that list, then you still have a cause of action under 

the FSIA. The fact that the country changes its ways 

and gets de-designated doesn't change that result.

 Now, what the Solicitor General says is that 

Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate 

in this case: Did Congress when it said that the 

President may make inapplicable various statutes which 

they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the 

basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a 

rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it 

giving the President a special power to remove the 

designation?

 If all it was doing was giving the power to 

the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation 

as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power 

rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) "except 

for Iraq," if it's just a power about rescindment, then 

the rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just 

cited to you, that changing somebody's designation

doesn't affect their liability, would apply here. So 

just put it in terms --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would -- why would 

Congress have wanted to make that distinction?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Let's -- let me take you to 

the reason, and that is in Joint Appendix Volume 2. 

Section 620A of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is 

reproduced at 344. And this is the way that a 

country -- that a statute relating to torture and 

terrorism is made applicable and made inapplicable under 

ordinary processes to a nation.

 So to explain it to you, right now Syria, 

Iran, and Sudan, this statute applies to them. It is 

inapplicable to Libya and North Korea. And the reason 

is that Libya and North Korea were originally designated 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a long section. Which 

part of the section --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I am going to take you 

straight to the text. I am giving you the overview 

right now.

 So, they were de-designated. It works in 

two parts. A is the prohibition. This is how you get 

designated. Prohibition. The United States shall 

not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Where are you?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. I'm at 344, and I'm 

in A, prohibition.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, this is how you get 

designated: "Prohibition. The United States shall not 

provide any assistance under this Act" -- this is our 

principal foreign aid statute -- "the Agricultural 

Trade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the 

Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 

to any country" -- and here's how you get designated "if 

the Secretary of State determines that the government of 

that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of 

international terrorism." So we've designated Syria, 

Iran, Sudan.

 Now, that designation can be rescinded and 

that's usually what happens. But there are important 

restrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the 

enactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision. 

The Congress limited the President's ability to 

immediately rescind the designation: "A determination 

made by the Secretary of State under subsection A not --

may not be rescinded unless" -- and there are two rules. 

It can happen in one of two ways. The first is you get 

a new government: "A, there has been a fundamental

change in the leadership and policies of the government 

concerned." Or number 2, the old government changes its 

ways. That's 2A: "The government concerned has not 

provided any support for international terrorism during 

the preceding 6-month period.

 So here's the dilemma and, Justice Souter, 

this is the complete explanation for why Congress gave 

the President the power it did in section 1503. 

Remember when the EWSAA is enacted there is a whole 

discussion in the first 30 minutes about the new regime. 

There was no new regime. There was a discussion about 

how the Saddam Hussein regime had been toppled. No, it 

hadn't.

 When the EWSAA had been enacted -- was 

enacted, Baghdad had fallen seven days earlier. There 

was no new Iraqi government. We would not recognize an 

Iraqi government until June of 2004.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may have 

not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old 

one either.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. But, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is 

that the President lacked the power under this statute 

that I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also 

the statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President

lacked the power at that time because there was no new 

government and there wasn't a change in policy in the 

old government.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's nothing better 

settled -- well, perhaps that's broad. It is very well 

settled that the President is the one to determine who 

is the lawful and legitimate government that he would 

deal with.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's all that was 

happening here. And it's not just a question of one 

against the other. It's a question of what government 

has survived.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly right --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is under -- and 

under the law something that has always been committed 

to the very large discretion of the President.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I couldn't agree with you 

more, Justice Kennedy. And here's the relevant point. 

In the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this 

statute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government. 

We did that in June of 2004. So my point is, and I 

think this is very clear from the history, Congress 

enacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President 

was powerless under the existing state of the law to

rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state. That's 

what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was -- the text of 

it was not limited to rescinding that designation. I 

mean, that's the problem, it seems to me.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Well, let's go to the 

text, if we could. And that is in the blue brief. It's 

in the appendix to the blue brief. And it's at 4A. And 

it's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven 

lines down.

 "Provided further, that the President may 

make inapplicable" -- that's the language that we are 

going to focus on, Justice Souter -- "make inapplicable 

with respect to Iraq" -- and then it identifies the 

statute -- "section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act 

of 1961 or any provision of law that applies to 

countries that have supported terrorism."

 Now, we are putting aside the debate of 

whether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law. We are 

assuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is 

given the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7). 

He isn't just given the power to rescind the 

designation.

 And the question just -- the term "make 

inapplicable" doesn't appear in this context anywhere

else in the U.S. Code. We have to figure out what it 

means. And the way that laws that apply to countries 

that have supported terrorism apply or are rendered 

inapplicable, there is a method in the U.S. Code for how 

they are made applicable and inapplicable.

 So, to return to my examples. If you were 

to ask the United States or Mr. Franklin -- so this 

statutory scheme of laws -- sanctions that apply to 

nations that support terrorism applies to Syria, to 

Iran, it applies to Sudan. It is inapplicable to Libya, 

North Korea, Guinea-Bissau, Britain, France. How is it 

that they apply to some and not others? It's through 

designation. That's the process for taking something 

that applies and make it inapplicable. And I can give 

you a lot of other --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute 

specifically short-circuits that process. It says the 

President may at once make inapplicable. The very 

purpose of it is that the normal process is going to 

take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an 

emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, the de-designation 

becomes effective immediately. What -- the distinction 

that I am drawing is that there is a strong version of 

the words "make inapplicable," and there is a more

modest version of the words "make inapplicable."

 Iraq and the United States say that when he 

made it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it 

out of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says 

"except for Iraq." We say that "make inapplicable" in 

this context is a term of art that deals with 

designation and rescindment. And that process is all 

that Congress was trying to do, was to allow the 

President to immediately --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's -- let's 

assume --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- for the sake of argument 

that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and 

against the point you've just made are evenly balanced. 

We are on the fence. Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't 

we resolve this in favor of the President's position, 

simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're 

talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act, the President would have had under the 

foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop 

suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the 

position that that should be the result? So that if in 

doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently 

with the traditional foreign policy authority of the

President, in which case we get off the fence and we go 

in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I would say, no, because 

that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes, 

has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the 

FSIA. We adopted a different --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's been profoundly 

changed if we accept your argument. I mean, at the 

moment the question is whether it has been profoundly 

changed or not. We've got a statutory mess. And in a 

case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to --

to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with 

tradition?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Well, I do want to 

come to whether we are in equipoise in just a second. I 

do think the fact that Congress changed the model so 

that we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model.

 Second, remember, Justice Souter, that this 

isn't a return to that model. What used to happen 

before the FSIA is the President would come into court 

and say I think that this nation has immunity and the 

court would decide on the basis of that case by case. 

But it was the President making the determination, case 

by case. This is something unknown. This is very 

different, if I could just explain how on their --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the President, 

quite apart from the immunity designation, the President 

had the authority to compromise suits.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, fine, and if that is 

espousal power continues to exist, then the President 

can attempt to exercise it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether it 

continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument, 

and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of 

this argument. I'm simply saying that if it is 

otherwise unclear, given that that power was 

traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not 

construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to 

that point, in the President's favor rather than your 

favor?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So the -- two 

reasons, the first is this is not an attempt at 

espousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that. 

Remember the President hasn't set up some sort of 

mechanism for resolving these claims. He is simply 

saying that they are --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he hasn't set it up 

because he thinks he has got the authority under this 

statute or had the authority under this statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, it wouldn't

work like that. If the President were engaging in an 

act of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism 

for resolving the claims.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: 

that.

Oh, I -- I quite agree with 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: So can I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So I suppose the first step 

in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on 

now.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the President 

purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six 

years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I 

think he would have.

 But can I just then just come to the premise 

of whether we are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why shouldn't 

we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 

Act said Congress is setting the rules. But why doesn't 

this emergency measure effectively restore to the 

President under these special circumstances the power 

that he once had? Congress ceding back to the 

President back to the President for the purposes of 

dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control 

authority he once had?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. So let's -- if I

could accept the premise that -- and not try to combat 

the premise of what we would do in the case of 

equipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute 

really means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise. The 

Court generally has not assumed that emergency 

appropriations measures issues, particular their 

provisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal 

courts, much less give the President the power to change 

the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. And it has in 

related context taken language like "any provision" and 

said well, we are looking for a clear statement of law 

by Congress to make sure it has confronted this 

situation.

 When it attempts to -- when the argument on 

the other side is that the Congress has passed a law 

that shifts the balance of power between Congress and 

the legislature and the executive in cases like 

Atascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all 

cases that had said statutes that said "any," and the 

Court said well, because this a -- a relatively strange 

thing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations 

measure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear 

statement. So that would be one reason that we are not 

in equipoise.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But as a practical matter,

isn't this closely associated with appropriations and 

with foreign aid? The issue is billions of dollars were 

going to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake 

of the war and the money could be provided directly by 

the United States through foreign assistance, which is 

part of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly. 

And the argument is that this is closely related to it, 

because it freed up other money that would be used for 

reconstruction. So why is there anything odd about this 

being in an appropriations provision?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because this -- well, 

because what Congress was doing was confronting an 

emergency. There is not a breath, in either the 

President's transmittal of the statute, the legislative 

history of the statute, or anything else that says that 

Congress was dealing with the sort of medium to 

long-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi 

government or the Iraqi economy. It didn't -- one thing 

you would have expected if that was Congress's intent is 

that Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam 

Hussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this 

wouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't 

been discussed never much.

any other provision of law? You know, Congress could

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I mean, just to add to 

that --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It said under 620A of 

Foreign Assistance or any other provision of law. 

Clearly they are going beyond, it seems to me, the --

the premise which your argument rests on, the argument 

that you've just made.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Oh, Justice Souter, I don't 

think that that -- let me, if I could take the 

two points in turn. In cases like Atascadero, Will, 

Raygor, it's the same language; it's "any." And the 

Court has said we require a plain statement when 

Congress is going to do something that would change the 

balance in the relationship between the branches of the 

government or between the Federal and State governments.

 And Justice Souter, we don't deny it goes 

beyond section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act; it 

goes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi 

government. What it doesn't do is reach pending --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Fine. But there is 

no textual basis for drawing the line once you get 

beyond 620A at the point you want to draw it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I actually do disagree and 

believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the 

sense that the word "any" means "every," that is true. 

But if you look at what Congress was trying to 

accomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the 

immediate economic impact of the need to begin 

reconstruction in Iraq right away.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Goldstein, could I ask 

this question? You are reading into it the exception, 

of the words "any other provision of law." And I can 

understand your argument one of two ways, and I want to 

be sure which. Are you saying it means any other 

provision of the law, except those that affect the 

jurisdiction of courts? Or are you saying any other 

provisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I am saying that except for 

those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the 

kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal 

with correctly.

 The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in 

the first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a 

statute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of 

the Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- I would like to 

follow up on Justice Stevens's question. Think of three

categories, A is the category which you could see that 

other questions of law apply to. B, is this case, and 

C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it 

might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd 

to apply them to that. All right, what's in category C?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If it's anything, it would 

be the export of military hardware. In the immediate 

wake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new 

government, right? There is no replacement regime. If 

you read "any" to mean literally "every" then you could 

ship munitions, nuclear materials and the like when 

there is no state there and it's silly to think that 

Congress intended that. Its reasons for enacting the 

statute had to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. After Saddam 

Hussein falls --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and we have a new 

government --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: We don't have a new

nobody over there to pay for them? You are worried 

about -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping 

goods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is 

going to pay for them? I mean, that's absurd.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it's not -- it's not 

entirely clear there is still a government in Iraq.

other than that?

other including this case.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Breyer, in --

the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and 

Raygor. "Any" means "every" except for the States. In 

that example.

 But can I just make quite clear, we have two 

lines of argument. And I think it's important to 

recognize that. We have the debate over what any other 

means and does that include section 1605(a)(7). That's 

what we have been discussing here, and the idea that any 

means every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's 

what we have.

 But we have the other incredibly important 

arguments of what it means to make a sanction 

inapplicable. Which is separate and independent of that 

point, and the question of whether the statutes sunset 

as the Acree court did. And I want to return First to 

those point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute 

that applies to nations that have supported terrorism. 

And I want to return to the statutory text and explain 

why our more modest reading of "make inapplicable" is 

the right one.

 So the statutory text again is at 4a. Here 

are, I think, the strong statutory indications that we 

are right, that what Congress was trying to do was to

allow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as 

a terrorist state.  First, there is a direct parallel 

between the language "a statute that applies to 

countries that have supported terrorism" and the 

directive that the President can make it inapplicable. 

That tells you, look at how it is that these statutes 

apply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art 

is to do the reverse. Take something that applies and 

make it inapplicable.

 And something that applies to an -- statutes 

apply to countries that have supported terrorism under 

American law only in one way, through designation. And 

what happens is that the President was allowed to 

rescind it.

 The second textual reason for our more 

modest reading of make inapplicable is reference to 

section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. So we know 

one thing: even if we debate and disagree, Justice 

Breyer, about what any means in this context, we know 

the Congress told the President he could immediately 

make inapplicable section 620A.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why did -- why did he need 

the statute to do that? In other words if the President 

had the power to designate in the first place, normally 

that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right, but 

that's the point. When I took you to the text of 620A, 

which was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2, 

Justice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right 

away. Remember, Baghdad falls; there is no new 

government; and the old government hasn't changed its 

ways. So he lacks the power to remove the designation. 

And I can prove that to you. It wasn't until there was 

a new government that the President actually did 

formally rescind the designation pursuant to the Foreign 

Assistance Act. It wasn't until 2004. After --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- that's 

just a belt-and-suspenders act. I mean, he -- he has 

the authority here, and he -- although it may look 

difficult, he has to envision there may be people who 

challenge that -- his interpretation of the law. So 

there's the other provision that will make it 

inapplicable under that as well.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I disagree, but we will 

accept that. Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey, 

look, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise 

his de-designation power. My point is different, and 

that is the fact that he didn't do this under the 

Foreign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication 

that he couldn't do it before. If he could have done it

before, he would have.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it may also be an 

indication that he thought he had effectively 

accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this 

statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- I don't understand, 

Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new 

government is recognized, suddenly decide to 

de-designate Iraq. There wasn't any -- the only --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't know, either. 

I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an 

interpretation that is quite possible consistent with 

the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting 

under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do. 

Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know, 

I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't 

know. But it would be consistent with the assumption 

that he had the authority here.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, it -- I agree it would 

be consistent with the assumption that he had the 

authority here. That's -- I'm not trying to negative 

that. What I'm trying to say is that the authority 

under 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a 

strong indication that that's -- it's not the only 

possible reading, but it's a strong indication that

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Goldstein, 

before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what 

you think about the claim for relief. The D.C. Circuit 

said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it 

doesn't provide a private right of action; the new 

statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq. So, what 

was the source of the claim -- what is the source of 

these plaintiffs' claim for relief?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The Solicitor General has it 

right. Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of 

claims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and 

that has been recognized as providing a substantive 

cause of action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- which State law?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The State law generally of 

the home State of the plaintiffs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that -- by that 

reasoning, people all over the world could sue the 

United States in their courts alleging that the United 

States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with 

respect to their nationals. The same theory would apply 

-- use the law of the state where the national comes 

from. So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be 

Yemen -- any place. So -- but the claim you are saying

exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the 

United States could use it, any other place in the world 

could, too.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that is clear -- well, 

in -- in terms of whether or not a foreign country would 

look to our law and say, well, we're just doing the same 

thing as you do, that would arise from -- also from new 

section 1605A.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Looking to their own 

law.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, I understand, 

Justice Ginsburg. Section -- for example, section 

1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA, 

creates an affirmative U.S. cause of action. There is 

always going to be an underlying domestic cause of 

action that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law 

or instead it's Federal law. That is a -- a debate 

about whether the FSIA is a good statute or not, but 

it's one that Congress has resolved --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, it's 

also a debate as to whether the call on that question 

should be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there 

are all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits 

that are allowed under 620A. And you are saying that,

beginning, the statute says the President may suspend 

the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions 

Act, which is the kind of power that they are talking 

about, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the 

term of art, we think, "make inapplicable" in the 

context of these statutes is the narrow power to 

de-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror.

under the Constitution as well. So if we were to accept 

your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he 

had the power under the Constitution.

is presented here. It could have been an argument that 

was made, but I don't believe it's presented by this 

case.

seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has 

the argument that he has this authority under the 

Constitution.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I agree he has that 

argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case --

in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the 

cert petition, I should say, in the question on this 

Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari.

 I think to decide the debate, Justice 

Souter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the 

debate about whether or not the power was grand or 

instead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the 

question of what it is that Congress intended to do in 

this proviso to this emergency appropriations measure. 

Was it confronting a very specific moment in time at 

which Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get 

emergency -- emergency aid to Iraq? Or was it, instead, 

fundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally 

despite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi 

government there? Was he given -- was Congress giving 

the power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently 

from liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist 

with respect to our closest allies, Britain and France? 

That is a significant over-reading of what --

"permanently"?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Just under -- just under 

this statute, if he makes inapplicable, he can rescind 

the action that made it inapplicable.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't understand how, 

Justice Souter. The -- the powers of the President 

expired. This statute sunset. Their whole point is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- no, but during the 

period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know 

of any reason why he cannot change his designation of 

inapplicability. So that the argument of a permanent 

change in the foreign policy of the United States or the 

-- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the 

United States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's fine while it was in 

effect, but it's not anymore. Their point is that they 

permanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the 

Foreign Assistance Act in 2008 and 2009 inapplicable, 

and that would be incredibly unusual. Why would we give 

that power with respect to Iraq when we don't to our 

very closest allies? Remember the statute expired, and 

they say it's still in effect. That's their answer to 

the sunset. It makes no sense at all.

it in its context of being a modest attempt to deal with 

an immediate problem. And section 1605(a)(7) says what 

happens when you deal with that immediate problem. If 

you change the designation of a state -- if they become 

an ally, if they change their ways -- they are still 

liable for the acts of torture they committed while they 

were designated.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think -- I think what 

they say is that the designation remains in effect. I 

don't think they say that the power to undesignate 

disappears.

them, but I'd be surprised if it's --

authority under the "capital A" statute to undo the 

designation?

the question is whether he would have had the authority 

to undesignate or -- or to rescind the designation of 

inapplicability if he had wished to exercise the 

authority under the "capital A" statute.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I have no -- I'm not aware 

of any provision of the 2008 NDAA that would have given 

the President any such power. They say that on the day 

the President exercised his -- his powers that the 

Foreign Assistance Act, section 620A, became 

inapplicable to Iraq, that sanction, and that that 

inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in 

2005. How it would come back -- how it would come back 

and continue to apply in Iraq in the case of a regime 

change in Iraq, I have no idea at all.

redesignated. We believe that is also the position of

position that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you'd say that.

 MR. FRANKLIN: It is our position that it 

will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now 

a very strong ally of the United States in the fight 

against terrorism, not a sponsor of it.

 Just a few other points based on the 

argument that just occurred. They are interpreting the 

statute apparently now to say that the President only 

had the power to rescind the -- the previous 

designations, but that's not what the statute says. If 

that's what Congress had meant, they would have done 

that. They said "make inapplicable." And their entire 

case depends on that statute being applicable today 

because it serves as the abrogation of Iraq's sovereign

immunity, and it serves as the predicate for subject 

matter jurisdiction.

 It cannot be both applicable and having been 

made inapplicable.

 The other point that was mentioned -- and 

also I would also say in this regard that our foreign 

policy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy 

towards other former state-sponsored terrorism. Libya, 

for example, was taken off the list, but there was an 

express requirement that Libya answer to the claims that 

were before it. And, of course, that was because the --

the government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the 

Khadafi Government, was still in power.

 Here we had gone into the country with U.S. 

military force aided by our allies, and we have ousted 

the regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its 

efforts to rebuild.

 There was a point about the de-designation 

that was done in 2004. The Secretary of State -- and it 

is cited on page 25 in the blue brief. The Secretary of 

State said in the de-designation that it was largely 

symbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said 

it was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA 

determination. However -- and this is relevant to 

something else that occurred. The de-designation was

also necessary to allow military exports to Iraq because 

under the proviso 3 of the EWSAA, military exports were 

specifically exempted from the President's authority.

 That also shows that Congress knew how to 

make exceptions to the President's power when it wanted 

to.

 And, finally, I would say that we do agree 

with the analysis that Justice Souter has -- has 

posited, and that is that this involves a lesser power 

than the President could have exercised on his own 

authority to -- to completely espouse the claims. It, 

therefore, fits entirely within what is normally done in 

these kinds of cases.

 And, Justice Ginsburg, it is also the 

position of the Government of Iraq that Iraqi victims 

ought to be included in any state-to-state diplomatic 

negotiations. But that is a matter for the two 

governments to resolve between themselves, and that is 

one of the reasons why these kinds of claims have always 

been resolved in that manner in the past. They are 

reciprocal, bilateral concerns that affect two very 

close allies. Those governments ought to be negotiating 

and resolving those claims, whatever claims there are on 

both sides, between the two of them.

 If there are no further questions, thank
