3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams. 

Ms. Brenan. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. BRENAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court: 

A fairly presented claim has been 

11 adjudicated on the merits when a state court issues a 

12 decision denying relief unless it has made a plain 

13 statement to the contrary. And this is especially true 

14 where the state court has grappled with the substance of 

the alleged error. 

16  And this rule is correct for three reasons: 

17  First, state courts discharge their duties. 

18 They are sworn to uphold the Constitution. Therefore, 

19 they must adjudicate claims that can -- that allege 

constitutional violations. So when a state court issues 

21 a decision denying relief, it must necessarily have 

22 considered and rejected all of the claims. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens when there 

24 is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state 

law ground on -- on a Confrontation Clause ground, and

1 all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary 

2 rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation 

3 Clause is based on a different theory? 

4  Are we to assume, in the light of that kind 

of decision, that the court actually grappled with the 

6 Confrontation Clause? 

7  MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, we would assume 

8 that there the state court, through its denial of 

9 relief, did adjudicate the presented Confrontation 

Clause -- claim. And that would be because --

11 for a number of reasons. 

12  First, the presumption of regularity that 

13 judicial officers do do their job, and it can only be 

14 rebutted by clear evidence. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Am I to make that 

16 assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, 

17 state courts generally had held that if hearsay was 

18 admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was 

19 the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge? 

Is a Federal court supposed to continue with 

21 that presumption in light of an undisputed state's 

22 statement that their rules are consonant with the 

23 Confrontation Clause. 

24  MS. BRENAN: In that situation, if the state 

court rule is consonant with the Confrontation Clause, 

4

1 we would have certainly an adjudication of the 

2 Confrontation Clause. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's assume it's 

4 not after our -- we render our decision. 

MS. BRENAN: And if it were -- if it were 

6 different, we would still hold that in that situation, 

7 as this Court -- in relying on Richter, in that 

8 situation it would be more of a summary denial on the 

9 confrontation analysis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If one --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we can continue and 

12 probably should talk about this broad theory that you 

13 want us to adopt. 

14  Really, in this case, the court of appeals 

in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in 

16 turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a 

17 Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, 

18 you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the 

19 Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by 

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. And it seems to me 

21 it’s very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal 

22 Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood. 

23  So it seems to me that you're -- you have a 

24 very strong argument that they did adjudicate the 

Federal claim anyway. I know you want us to maybe reach

Official 

1 the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays 

2 it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the 

3 argument, that you don't strongly make, although you 

4 don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the 

state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the 

6 Federal standard was the basis for the entire 

7 jurisprudence. 

8  MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, we agree that 

9 in our situation it just so happened to be that the 

state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth 

11 Amendment jurisprudence because it -- it was citing U.S. 

12 v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the 

13 -- the Sixth Amendment cases. In our case, it just so 

14 happens that it does. 

But we posit also that our case shows why 

16 this is illustrative as to why this Court should adopt 

17 the broader rule that, in situations where a state court 

18 has denied relief or a claim has been fairly presented, 

19 that this Court and all Federal courts should assume 

that the state courts did their job by adjudicating 

21 claims --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Irrebuttably? 

23  MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, in -- we have 

24 suggested that -- that it can be rebutted by a plain 

statement, if the state court says that it is not

1 reaching it or, more particularly, if a state court 

2 imposes a procedural bar. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see exceptions to that 

4 already. There are cases where the state court reaches 

one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go 

6 to the second. 

7  MS. BRENAN: Yes --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you really can't say 

9 in that situation that you can assume they reached the 

second, can you? 

11  MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, I posit that 

12 those Strickland cases are different. And they are 

13 different because in all of those cases of Wiggins v. 

14 Smith and Rompilla, that there the courts -- what the 

State court did was follow exactly what this Court has 

16 said of how a Strickland claim may be answered entirely 

17 by only addressing the one prong of Strickland. 

18  And so there they're doing exactly 

19 adjudicating everything through the analysis of one. 

Additionally, in those cases, by doing so, 

21 the courts are not in any way suggesting that the State 

22 courts failed to do something. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that the --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Brenan, we are 

straying pretty far from this case. And correct me if

Official 

1 I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was 

2 made under State law, and then Williams said there was 

3 an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the 

4 Sixth Amendment was violated. 

So there really isn't any 


6 independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent 


7 Sixth Amendment right. It's State law was violated and 


8 therefore the Constitution was violated. 


9  So it seems to me if we just look at the 


position that Williams was taking, that these two, the 

11 State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together. 

12 And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some 

13 other case that might come before us some day would not 

14 be wise. 

MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, I completely 

16 agree with the view that here Williams did present a 

17 completely dependent Federal claim; and, therefore, the 

18 State's analysis -- the State court's analysis would 

19 have fully adjudicated that. 

However, we suggest that this case does 

21 illustrate why that broader rule is important. And it's 

22 important because, otherwise, other Federal courts may 

23 not view it as this Court did, of seeing it as a dependent 

24 claim --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the court of 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the 

2 Respondent to present a separate State claim and a 

3 separate Federal claim, correct? 

4  MS. BRENAN: Exactly. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the predicate 

6 to the whole question we have before us, right? 

7  MS. BRENAN: Exactly, Your Honor. 

8  So --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you this 

hypothetical. The brief filed with an intermediate 

11 State court of appeals contains 25 pages of argument on 

12 a Federal constitutional claim. Let's say it's a Brady 

13 claim. And then it also has two other claims, two other 

14 arguments. They are State law claims, and each one is 

dealt with in two pages. And then the State court, 

16 intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that 

17 addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing 

18 about the Federal constitutional claim. 

19  You would say there that -- that it's 

conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal 

21 constitutional claim? 

22  MS. BRENAN: Yes, Your Honor, in that 

23 situation we would. One, because of the presumption of 

24 regularity; two, because of what this Court has said in 

Richter, where we could view it as a summary denial; 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 and, third, what underlies that is – is the view that 

2 if it's not written in the opinion, that it has been ignored. 

3  But that's not what this Court said in 

4 Castillo, where it said, if a court chooses to ignore in 
its opinion, which should be read as in its opinion 


6 writing, means that that claim has been impliedly 


7 rejected. 


8  So, therefore, just because a State court 


9 chooses not to write about it in its opinion does not 

mean that it didn't consider and reject that claim. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it necessary to go so 

12 far as to require a plain statement? Why wouldn't you 

13 protect the same interests if you had a rule that said 

14 that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated 
the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if 

16 there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a 

17 very strong inference that they overlooked it. 

18  Then you wouldn't have situations like the 

19 one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or 
the one that I just mentioned to you. 

21  MS. BRENAN: Sure, Your Honor, but the 

22 reason why there should be a plain statement is because 

23 it's long been held that in order to rebut that 

24 presumption of regularity, you need clear evidence. 
And, really, the only clear evidence that one could have 

10

25

Official 

1 would be a plain statement. 

2  And this Court reinforced that when it said 

3 in Richter, it talked about an indication or other State 

4 procedural bars, and it cited Harris v. Reed. And 

Harris v. Reed is a case that talked about plain 

6 statements. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that in --

8 in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue 

9 for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was 

enough indication that the court did not consider it or 

11 not, right? And every year is a reduction of sentence, 

12 so to speak. 

13  MS. BRENAN: Exactly, Your Honor. And 

14 that's -- that's why having a broader rule with this 

presumption --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- I 

17 suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the 

18 State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp 

19 which just says, we have considered and rejected all 

constitutional claims, then there would be no problem? 

21  MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, they really do that 

22 when they say "affirmed" at the end of the decision. It 

23 really adds nothing. 

24  If it were a stamp, it would be merely 

reflexive, and therefore would in the end give you no

1 indication whether an argument had been considered or 

2 not. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any idea based on 

4 your experience how many separate claims are typically 

raised in a capital case of this sort? 

6  MS. BRENAN: If -- this was not a capital 

7 case --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. 

9  MS. BRENAN: -- but an LWOP case. However, 

in a capital case there can be hundreds. And we -- or 

11 hundreds of pages of documents -- or hundreds of pages 

12 in an appellant's opening brief, and, therefore, if one 

13 were to slip in, in a phrase an apparent claim, and that 

14 the State court happens not to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There would be a lot of 

16 good debate over whether it was presented clearly 

17 enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to 

18 require the court to answer it. I can see a whole --

19 you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful 

subject, a whole new area of law. Has the -- has the 

21 State supreme court overlooked something that was 

22 clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication 

23 that the State court has overlooked it? I mean --

24 that's the problem. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of the circuit

Official 

1 courts basically have a rule close to the one announced 

2 by Justice Alito, don't they? 

3  MS. BRENAN: Your Honor, if they happen not 

4 to mention one particular claim? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of them have 

6 essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form 

7 of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this 

8 circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable 

9 presumption. 

I'm sorry. Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh. 

11  MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor -- the 

12 Eleventh Circuit and, I believe that, the Sixth Circuit as 

13 well. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not as absolute 

as the Eleventh. 

16  MS. BRENAN: True that the Eleventh Circuit 

17 has a broader rule. And we believe --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a -- you know, I 

19 mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception 

that abuses it. It's the nature of human nature. 

21  Do you know what the total number of habeas 

22 petitions there are and what the percentage that are 

23 actually granted? 

24  MS. BRENAN: I don't have that figure off 

the top of my head, Your Honor.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you be willing to 

2 accept that it's -- in relationship to the total 

3 granted, it's very, very small? 

4  MS. BRENAN: Yes, I believe that is true, 

that there is a small number of granting of petitions, 

6 yes. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So whatever the abuse of 

8 the system is, it hasn't halted justice. 

9  MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, the thing is 

that -- and I think that Justice Scalia has adverted to 

11 this -- is that if we were to -- to require only an 

12 indication, it would create a situation where there 

13 would be all this litigation. And that's why this 

14 Court, when it does -- has accepted conclusive 

presumptions in other cases, for example in Coleman v. 

16 Thompson, talked about we will accept these conclusive 

17 presumptions because they work in almost all of the 

18 cases, and we will accept the small number of errors in 

19 exchange for the reduction workload. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why can't they just 

21 do what we used to do? Many district judges do this 

22 and -- because there sometimes thousands of 

23 petitions of different kinds. A lot go to the staff 

24 attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments, 

and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side: 

14

Official 

1 Any other arguments that are made are rejected. All 

2 right. 

3  Now, that serves one purpose. A human being 

4 has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking: I've 

looked this over pretty carefully. And if it's a staff 

6 attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't 

7 want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he 

8 or she has really looked with some care. 

9  And so it serves a purpose. It means they 

don't do it just as a form. They could turn it into a 

11 form, but they shouldn't. And so if -- let them write 

12 that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into 

13 play these presumptions, et cetera. 

14  MS. BRENAN: Justice Breyer, I would 

disagree with -- with that proposal because it is in the 

16 end just -- could become reflexive --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, anything. Judges can 

18 not do their job. But -- but when you write something 

19 like the word "denied," which is all most district 

judges write in respect to many motions, they read the 

21 motion, they think about it, that's their job. 

22  So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a 

23 judge who is going to have to write certain words will 

24 want to do his job or her job, and they will do it. 

So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that 

15

1 isn't a big deal. 

2  Now, this case, they didn't write that for 

3 some reason. Many do. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the -- doesn't the 

word denied at the end of the order say the same thing? 

6 We've considered --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: No. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- all of the points made, 

9 and we have denied them. 

And wouldn't it be the case that if you 

11 require such a statement, but you have a situation where 

12 a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and 

13 the court only addresses explicitly the state things, 

14 the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have 

considered all the other claims, presumably including 

16 the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed, 

17 would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again 

18 arguing the same problem? 

19  MS. BRENAN: I think we could be arguing the 

same problem. I think, as Your Honor's noted, that the 

21 inclusion of the word denied, or, if you're affirming a 

22 conviction in a direct appeal, the word affirmed covers 

23 that. It says exactly, we have considered all those 

24 other claims. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Brenan, can I ask you 

16

Official 

1 what you mean by a plain statement? Because you've said 

2 a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary. 

3  Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have 

4 given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, 

but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong 

6 inference that there was no adjudication of the 

7 particular Federal claim alleged. 

8  You said that's not a plain statement, even 

9 though it seems as though there is a strong inference. 

So what would be a plain statement? 

11  MS. BRENAN: A plain statement would be a 

12 procedural bar, or if there were -- a court were to say, 

13 we're not, for some reason, going the reach the 

14 constitutional claim, that they really need to say it 

out loud. I don't know why they would say that, but 

16 that's what would be required. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I don't know why they 

18 would say that either. Well, by the way, we're not 

19 adjudicating this, you know. So if that's your test, 

your test is an irrebuttable presumption. 

21  MS. BRENAN: No, Your Honor, I would 

22 disagree, because there is the possibility of having --

23 having the procedural bar. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the 

brief raises five arguments, and the opinion says the

1 appellant has raised four arguments, is that a plain 


2 statement that the fifth -- the fifth argument was 


3 overlooked? 


4  MS. BRENAN: I would say that it possibly 


could be if it were in that situation. However, I 

6 would -- I would still go back to -- to really, the 

7 Richter presumption of saying that that word at the end, 

8 denied, denied is denied is denied, and it covers every 

9 fairly presented claim. 

JUSTICE ALITO: That's not a plain 

11 statement? What if there is one Federal claim -- one 

12 Federal argument and five state arguments, and the 

13 opinion says, this appeal raises only issues of state 

14 law, is that a plain statement? 

MS. BRENAN: Possibly it could be, 

16 Your Honor, but here we don't -- we don't have that 

17 situation. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about the 

19 underlying claim here? It is quite troublesome. I 

think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen 

21 charge; is that right? 

22  MS. BRENAN: Correct. Correct, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the possibility of 

24 getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this 

way is -- is really troublesome.

2 the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the 

3 judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss 

4 that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome. 

MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, the thing is 

6 that here we have a trial court who is looking at this 

7 juror and makes the determination that the juror is 

8 biased. And, therefore, if there was to be anything of 

9 any sort of constitutional violation, it would be to 

keeping that juror, a biased juror, on the jury. That 

11 would be a violation of the Sixth Amendment. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I have to -- I mean, 

13 this takes us into the merits, which is really 

14 interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there, 

but, as long as we're there for a minute, I agree with 

16 Justice Ginsburg. I've never seen a procedure like 

17 this. 

18  And I looked -- I looked at this -- the 

19 Federal cases, Brown and Thomas, that the Cleveland 

court cited. Those -- and Wood was voir dire, was not 

21 mid-jury. 

22  I just hope this doesn't happen with much 

23 regularity. And the fact that the trial judge is upset, 

24 that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone, 

it seems to me. I think it's very troublesome.

3 is not that we're trying to get -- that the trial judge 

4 is feeling to get rid of this juror because he's the 

hold-out juror, but it's because through the voir dire 

6 he determines that this juror is biased, and that is the 

7 bias, and that's what makes it different. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That the person is not 

9 guilty is a bias? 

MS. BRENAN: No, Your Honor, that's 

11 certainly not it. It’s the bias comes from what he was 

12 saying of his disagreement or -- that he just really did 

13 not believe with the felony murder rule. Therefore, 

14 it's that -- that under any evidence, whatever evidence 

was presented, that he would not be able to convict 

16 because he disagreed with the very basis of the law. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's -- that 

18 may be your strongest point, but most of what he said 

19 was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence 

has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has 

21 to be clear enough for me to be convinced. Is that a 

22 biased juror? 

23  MS. BRENAN: That is not a biased juror, but 

24 that's what he said to the court. 

But what comes out through the voir dire of

1 the other jurors is not that he was using a reasonable 

2 doubt standard, but that he was using a no doubt 

3 standard, an absolute doubt standard. 

4  And that's where he's not following the law, 

and that's where he's biased. And that's where he 

6 becomes a biased juror who has no right to be on that 

7 jury. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I must say that, like 

9 Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges 

intrude in the deliberative processes of juries. 

11  Most of the time when we're assessing bias, 

12 we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous 

13 evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire 

14 and is now either a convicted felon or introduced 

extraneous circumstance. 

16  But the degree of being convinced is the 

17 very essence of jury deliberations. This case is 

18 troublesome. 

19  MS. BRENAN: Well, Your Honor, I believe in 

this situation it's one where the judge was presented 

21 with possible misconduct, and therefore had to do 

22 something. Had the judge done nothing, we could have 

23 possibly been in the same situation. 

24  And under -- under California law, it's 

where this -- this examination cannot be so intrusive.

1  So we maintain that it was not. It was only 

2 to the degree in which we are finding that there was a 

3 biased juror. At that point in time, the Sixth 

4 Amendment required that that juror be removed. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, 

6 to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I 

7 understand what you're arguing now. 

8  In your brief, you talked about focusing on 

9 the error. So if evidence was admitted, you would say 

it doesn't matter that there were three different 

11 theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; 

12 you should just look at the fact that we're talking 

13 about the admission of evidence. Now, is -- is that 

14 what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the 

states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you 

16 know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and 

17 one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, 

18 you would still apply the same rule? 

19  MS. BRENAN: What we're saying is that, at 

the very least, in our type of situation where -- where 

21 the court discusses the alleged error, there is an 

22 adjudication on the merits, but that plays into the 

23 larger and broader rule. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why does your theory 

make any sense? I mean, we're supposed to be

1 interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim 

2 was adjudicated on the merits. Usually when we speak of 

3 claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief. We don't 

4 look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know, 

what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you 

6 seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we 

7 should use. 

8  MS. BRENAN: Yes, in -- especially if you're 

9 going to look at the state courts, which are -- must 

decide both the Federal and state questions. So their 

11 interpretation of what a claim is does not necessarily 

12 mean what it eventually becomes when it's in Federal 

13 habeas. 

14  And the Federal habeas courts are limited by 

their jurisdiction to only be Federal law theories, and 

16 a Federal petitioner can only bring such claims. 

17  So, for that reason, it's -- it's not the 

18 good fit for the state courts to limit them in that way. 

19 And that's why we're saying, at least in a situation 

where a state court has grappled with the substance of 

21 the error, that it has adjudicated the claim, which it 

22 could have viewed, as was here, sort of a single claim 

23 independent, or it could have state law theories and 

24 Federal law theories that it puts together.

4  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KURT D. HERMANSEN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

6  MR. HERMANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

7 it please the Court: 

8  The rule this Court should adopt is the same 

9 rule that the consensus -- the consensus rule of the 

courts of appeals. When they look at an opinion, a 

11 reasoned opinion, they look at what the opinion says, 

12 the text of the opinion. And if the opinion grapples 

13 with the bulk of the claims that are in the prisoner's 

14 appellate brief but omits to address one of the claims, 

then there is an inference that the claim has not been 

16 adjudicated on the merits. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just the way 

18 you phrased it, if it addresses the bulk of the claims, 

19 under your theory it has to address every claim, 

correct? 

21  MR. HERMANSEN: If -- under my theory, if 

22 there is a Federal claim that's overlooked or omitted, 

23 then the inference --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Not 

overlooked or omitted. Not discussed.

1  MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not analyzed in the 

3 opinion. 

4  MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. Here it's Sixth 

Amendment, so the Sixth Amendment was not mentioned. 

6 The Sixth Amendment was not -- there is no indication 

7 from the opinion itself that the Sixth Amendment claim 

8 was adjudicated. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that if --

if this was raised when your friend was at the 

11 lectern -- if the court at the end said, not only 

12 denied, but said, I considered all other arguments not 

13 addressed, denied, then you have no case, correct? 

14  MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. And that's the 

recommendation of the NACDL brief. Is that, and we do see 

16 that a lot. There is -- where there are opinions that say: 

17 We've reviewed and considered all claims raised and 

18 reject them. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would mean that if 

you prevail it would just become routine. Justice 

21 Kennedy mentioned the stamp that says: We considered 

22 all of the questions raised, those not discussed on the 

23 merits --

24  MR. HERMANSEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as

2 fair to assume that a judge who is looking at an 

3 appellate court brief is going to do their job and look 

4 at the briefs. So that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're not 

6 willing to assume that when the judge says "denied." 

7 You're willing to assume that when the judge says: I've 

8 looked at everything, denied. 

9  MR. HERMANSEN: Right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me if 

11 you give them the presumption of regularity in the one 

12 case you ought to give it to them in the other. 

13  MR. HERMANSEN: And I don't think the 

14 presumption of regularity should apply here, just as 

this Court in Smith v. Digmon looked at the opinion and 

16 looked at what was argued and said: All the courts 

17 below made a mistake; it was fairly exhausted. 

18  And I would like to address Justice Scalia's 

19 concern about the whole area of litigation that might 

occur. That won't happen for one reason: In the habeas 

21 context the claim must be fairly presented, period. If 

22 the Federal constitutional claim is not fairly 

23 presented, you're not in Federal court. And so there is 

24 already a whole body of law talking about what a claim 

is.

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it fairly presented 

4 here? 

MR. HERMANSEN: It was fairly --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Given that the argument 

7 was abuse of discretion? 

8  MR. HERMANSEN: It was -- yes, Justice 

9 Ginsburg, it was fairly presented. And in the red brief 

at page 39 I talk about that, and also at page 43 of the 

11 red brief I indicate that the attorney general conceded 

12 that the claim was exhausted. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, again this is 

14 fact-specific to the case. It doesn't address the rule 

that we want to address and was the reason for us taking 

16 the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate 

17 court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it 

18 also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit 

19 court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment. 

It seems to me that the Federal 

21 constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and 

22 controlling of the procedural matters that the court 

23 discussed. I just don't see the case is here even on 

24 your theory. 

MR. HERMANSEN: Justice Kennedy, I'm glad

1 you brought that up because I do want to address your 

2 concern on that, and it's Dye -- this Court's opinion in 

3 Dye takes care of the intertwined argument. In Dye this 

4 Court said that as long as the claim, the Federal nature 

of the claim is presented, even if it's presented under 

6 the same heading, it's fairly presented on a habeas 

7 claim. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but that's the state 

9 court. Here didn't -- would you disagree that the 

California Supreme Court in Cleveland correctly or 

11 incorrectly adopted a rule that it believed was 

12 consistent with the Federal Constitution? 

13  MR. HERMANSEN: If that were the case, then 

14 we would have a different case. But in Cleveland, the 

California Supreme Court explicitly rejected or declined 

16 to adopt the Brown, Symington, Thomas --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: And were they under any 

18 obligation to agree with Federal courts of appeal as to 

19 the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment? 

MR. HERMANSEN: They were not. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they -- isn't the --

22 isn't the reasonable reading of Cleveland that we're 

23 adopting this rule, this is our State rule, it's based 

24 on a very broadly worded State statute, it is informed 

by our understanding of the Sixth Amendment, and we

1 disagree. We mention the Federal courts of appeals 

2 decisions on this issue and we respectfully disagree 

3 with their interpretation of the Sixth Amendment. 

4  MR. HERMANSEN: Correct. So if the -- if 

Cleveland were to come before this Court, then there 

6 would be a clear indication from the opinion that they 

7 had considered the Federal standard, but didn't adopt 

8 it. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't the -- I'm sorry. 

MR. HERMANSEN: But this case isn't 

11 Cleveland. In this case what happened was --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure how you can 

13 say that. I mean, I think the simplest statement of the 

14 State rule is that the State believes that if you remove 

a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the 

16 Sixth Amendment. They said it in Cleveland. They were 

17 presented with the argument in this case by the briefing 

18 that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth 

19 Amendment was violated. And they ruled to say he was 

biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that 

21 they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated 

22 because he was biased. 

23  MR. HERMANSEN: There -- the problem with 

24 that determination is that there's the Federal standard 

on what is -- what the Sixth Amendment standard is. So

1 under Thomas, Symington and Brown --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different 

3 question. That question is whether the California 

4 Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that 

a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the 

6 removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth 

7 Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of 

8 Supreme Court precedent, not circuit court precedent? 

9  MR. HERMANSEN: This gets to the -- my 

friend's argument about how their argument is upside 

11 down. They are saying that we're trying to incorporate 

12 into 2254(d)(1) what is contrary to and what is the 

13 United States Supreme Court law, but we never get to 

14 (d)(1)'s United States Supreme Court law limitation 

because, looking at the text of 2254(d), you start with 

16 was the claim adjudicated on the merits? That's the 

17 threshold question. 

18  So if the claim was not adjudicated on the 

19 merits you don't get to the United States Supreme Court 

law limitation. Instead --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry. 

22 Go ahead. 

23  MR. HERMANSEN: Instead you look at Brown, 

24 Thomas, and Symington, and they say that if the juror's

3 views on the case, then the Sixth Amendment has been 

4 violated. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What Supreme Court 

6 precedent commands that result? 

7  MR. HERMANSEN: Supreme Court precedent 

8 doesn't command it, but because it's de novo review and 

9 because -- because it's a quid pro quo. 2254(d), 

Congress said States are going to get deference and they 

11 are going to get a limitation on the law that the 

12 Federal courts can look at, the United States Supreme 

13 Court law. But for that quid pro quo to happen, for the 

14 States to get that deference and limitation on the law, 

they have to have adjudicated the claim. Because 

16 that's --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the --

18  MR. HERMANSEN: -- the main event is 

19 supposed to be in State court. That is where the bite 

of the apple is supposed to be, in State court. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The discussion 

22 you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice 

23 Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is 

24 that the court is going to have to decide in every case 

whether or not State law is coterminous with Federal

1 law. And there was -- I don't know that the Ninth 

2 Circuit got that question right in this case or they got 

3 it wrong, but in every case, or many of the cases, the 

4 claim will be made on the part of the State, well, yes, 

they just said State law, but it's the same as Federal 

6 law. And the Ninth Circuit recognized that as an 

7 exception to their rule. Isn't that really going to 

8 cause all sorts of collateral litigation? 

9  MR. HERMANSEN: And it's not because this is 

the rare case --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry? 

12  MR. HERMANSEN: I'm sorry. It's not, Your 

13 Honor. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it's not. 

MR. HERMANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, this case 

16 is a rare case where, looking at the opinion, we can't 

17 tell if they adjudicated the claim on the merits. And 

18 it appears, every appearance and inference is that they 

19 overlooked it or didn't adjudicate it. So that's a rare 

case. Normally, just looking at the opinion you can 

21 tell if they adjudicated the Federal claim. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except in a case 

23 like Harrington v. Richter. 

24  MR. HERMANSEN: Harrington v. Richter 

created a very simple, straightforward, and appropriate

1 presumption, because when you have a unexplained order 

2 it makes sense that, in that context, that they have 

3 adjudicated everything on the merits. And to give the 

4 greatest respect to the State courts in comity and 

federalism is to look at what the order says, and if 

6 it's a reasoned opinion to take it at face value. It 

7 says what it says; it doesn't say what it doesn't say. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I may be just 

9 repeating some of my colleagues here, but I think if you 

take this opinion at face value, it cuts against you. I 

11 mean, it's a -- they're applying Cleveland. Cleveland 

12 is a constitutional decision. It's a Federal 

13 constitutional decision. 

14  The concurrence makes that completely clear. 

California has made it completely clear in other cases 

16 post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth 

17 Amendment. 

18  Whether it's applying a correct 

19 interpretation of the Sixth Amendment is unclear, but 

it's also completely irrelevant. It thinks it's 

21 applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a 

22 Constitutional judgment, isn't it? 

23  MR. HERMANSEN: No, Your Honor. 

24 Cleveland -- a careful reading of Cleveland shows that 

the majority does not adopt the Federal standard. So

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: You're quite right, it does 

4 not adopt the consensus standard. It specifically 

rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do 

6 that. As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision 

7 that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different 

8 view of the Sixth Amendment. I'm just repeating what 

9 Justice Alito here said. 

And that's what it's doing. It's saying, 

11 we're applying the Sixth Amendment, we're applying it 

12 differently from the way these other courts have done so 

13 because we think they're wrong. 

14  MR. HERMANSEN: And so two points on that. 

First, is the concurrent chides the majority for not 

16 being concerned about the Sixth Amendment. 

17  The second is the -- my friend cites People 

18 v. Allen with an ellipse and doesn't give the full 

19 context of Allen. So when they cite more recent law, 

2006, that talks about how the demonstrable reality 

21 test, which is just a notch up above substantial 

22 evidence, is designed to protect constitutional rights 

23 of due process and Sixth Amendment, what they don't say 

24 is in People v. Allen, they only reached the statutory 

issue, they never reached the constitutional issue. So,

2  And the California Supreme Court has never 

3 held -- has never addressed the issue of when is the 

4 Sixth Amendment violated when a juror is kicked off in 

this fashion? And instead, they -- their role is we 

6 allow free intrusion into the deliberative process. We 

7 don't adopt Symington and Brown and Thomas when they say 

8 that -- when a juror's views on the merits of the case, 

9 questioning should stop. Instead, we think 

that questioning should -- should be free to continue. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: The -- section 1089 is very 

12 broadly worded; isn't that right? The section that was 

13 being interpreted in Cleveland? 

14  MR. HERMANSEN: Section 1089 -- I don't --

JUSTICE ALITO: All right. You think that 

16 the California Supreme Court said, we're announcing a 

17 rule of state law, and, you know, we've been told that 

18 this rule is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment, but 

19 we don't care, and we're not even -- we're not going to 

worry about what the Sixth Amendment requires, we're 

21 just going to adopt this rule as state law; do you think 

22 that's what they did? 

23  MR. HERMANSEN: In People v. Collins, the

possible juror bias. And that -- that's still good law. 
That hasn't changed. 

So that's why Justice Werdegar, in her 
concurrence, was saying, we need to be worried about the 
Sixth Amendment. And the only reason she joined in the 
opinion was it used to be, well, if there's just 
substantial evidence that the juror is not deliberating 
as a juror should, she wasn't satisfied that that was 
sufficient; but, because there had to be a demonstrable 
reality from the record that the juror wasn't 
deliberating, she signed on in Cleveland. 

And in Cleveland, they reversed under 1089. 
And this case should have been reversed under 1089. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- Can we go back a minute, 
please, to 
Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a). 

I read the court of appeals' opinion. Most 
of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts. 
Then they discuss the law. The legal discussion is on 
page 104(a). It's approximately 30 lines long. More 
than half of it concerns Federal law. 

I mean, they don't just cite that Federal 
case. They say, "In assessing whether a juror is 
impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal 
constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme 
Court has said," da, da, da, then they quote it all.

4 here, they took this man off the jury. That violates my 

rights to Sixth Amendment right. It says it over and 

6 over and over. I have no doubt you raised it. 

7  And now they give an answer. And the answer 

8 that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines 

9 consist of Federal law. 

So -- so what's the problem? 

11  MR. HERMANSEN: The problem --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: The remaining 14 lines do 

13 consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say 

14 they didn't consider the Federal issue? 

MR. HERMANSEN: Because Nesler doesn't talk 

16 one iota about kicking off the holdout juror. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: No, they didn't quote --

18 Nesler doesn't. What they did in Nesler is quote a 

19 Federal case. And what they do here is not just say 

Nesler, they quote the Federal case. 

21  MR. HERMANSEN: And that Federal case has 

22 nothing to do with kicking off a holdout juror. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe it doesn't.

1 about that one. 

2  But what I don't see is how when they spend 

3 14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they 

4 believe sets the standard for impartiality and 

partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the 

6 Federal issue. 

7  MR. HERMANSEN: You hit the nail right on 

8 the head, Justice Breyer, because they are talking about 

9 impartiality. That's all they're talking about. 

They're looking at a Federal case to see what the 

11 definition of impartiality is. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: For Constitutional 

13 purposes. And this guy was kicked off the jury because 

14 they thought he was not impartial. 

MR. HERMANSEN: The bottom line is they did 

16 not apply the Federal rule. And the Federal rule is 

17 that if the juror's views on the merits of the case have 

18 been revealed, then the juror should not be kicked off. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then your claim over 

in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider 

21 it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no

1 thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or 

2 everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to 

3 be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue 

4 when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or 

wrongly. 

6  MR. HERMANSEN: Respectfully, 

7 Justice Breyer, they don't -- they're just talking about 

8 a definition of one word, of what actual bias is. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Which happens to be the 

issue in this case. 

11  MR. HERMANSEN: The issue in this case is 

12 can you kick off a juror who has expressed 10 or 15 

13 times -- and this came out right out of the bat -- the 

14 foreperson was called out, asked about some notes and 

said, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said, I don't 

16 think there's sufficient evidence. So that's different 

17 from whether we look at Federal law to -- for the 

18 definition of actual bias. 

19  My -- I think it's a reasonable position to 

say that you can't infer from this discussion of Nesler, 

21 only talking about what the definition of actual bias 

22 is, that the actual Sixth Amendment claim -- and even 

23 the trial attorney was arguing in Symington, Your Honor, 

24 please don't question these jurors. The foreperson, 

right out of the box said that Juror No. 6, 10 or 15

1 times, has already said that he thinks there isn't 


2 sufficient evidence. 


3  JUSTICE BREYER: No. Now, what the court 


4 says about that argument, what the court of appeals 


says, is that the argument of your client not only 

6 misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but 

7 they're criticizing -- and then he says, "It ignores the 

8 trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror 

9 No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased." 

So this court of appeals thinks the issue is 

11 whether he had shown sufficient bias. You think the 

12 answer to that is clearly no. The Government thinks 

13 it's yes. And I can understand the differences of 

14 opinion, but I'm back to my question. 

It seems to me in 14 lines they do address 

16 the Federal constitutional question of bias. And 

17 that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue, 

18 et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it 

19 correctly. 

But you see what's bothering me. And so 

21 I've listened to the answer. Do you want to add 

22 anything? 

23  MR. HERMANSEN: I would respectfully request 

24 that, read -- that reading this whole thing in context, 

it's clear that the California Court of Appeals is

1 dealing with 1089. They are not dealing with the 

2 Federal standard that we're grappling with here, which 

3 is if a juror's views on the merits of a case have been 

4 expressed, can you then interrogate all the jurors --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is this -- is this a 

6 holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a 

7 biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts 

8 about the sufficiency of the evidence? 

9  MR. HERMANSEN: No. If there is good 

cause --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, answer my question. 

12 Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased 

13 juror? 

14  MR. HERMANSEN: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, if the 

16 Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased 

17 juror, then why is it that the state court's finding 

18 that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding, 

19 that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased? 

The logic is almost inescapable to me. 

21  MR. HERMANSEN: Yeah, right. So for a 

22 minute we'll get into the issue that wasn't certified, 

23 but what happened in this case was the judge -- the 

24 Ninth Circuit found that the finding of bias wasn't good 

cause under the Federal standard because the --

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the California court 

2 find the juror was biased? 

3  MR. HERMANSEN: Yes. Because he was 

4 applying too high of a standard because he said very 

convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and there was a 

6 quibble about what does the word very add to beyond a 

7 reasonable doubt. And the jury very eloquently 

8 responded that very convinced beyond a reasonable doubt 

9 is the same as convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. 

And so that doesn't show bias when 

11 someone --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: That was one of the things. 

13 Then they go through in those four pages about six 

14 other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge, 

Juror No. 6. 

16  Then the prosecution calls about eight other 

17 jurors, and they come up with quite a different story 

18 about what he was telling them in the jury room and --

19 that I'm not going to convict him. Well, he didn't 

quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking 

21 about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person 

22 for -- make him return the slave. 

23  I mean, they talked about a lot of things. 

24 And he went through all that, and then concludes he was 

biased. And your point was he wasn't biased. He was

1 going to decide it fairly. 

2  Okay, I'm listening. 

3  MR. HERMANSEN: But the threshold issue is 

4 when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning, 

says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't 

6 think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning 

7 should have stopped at that point, because there was no 

8 indication of bias. 

9  But -- and how do we know that there --

there's a possibility that he's being kicked off because 

11 of his views on the merits of the case? We know that 

12 because the prosecutor filed a motion saying, let's 

13 reopen questioning. And that -- then the judge said, 

14 okay, yeah, let's reopen questioning. 

But the foreman had already said, I think 

16 your response to the jury note has satisfied that; I 

17 think it will be fine. Yet, the prosecutor filed a 

18 motion to reopen because the prosecutor knew that this 

19 juror had reasonable doubts. 

And so that's why there's clear evidence in 

21 this case that the motion to dismiss the juror was based 

22 on the juror's views on the merits of the case. 

23  And -- and, also, this is not a capital 

24 case, it's just a -- an LWOP case. 

And if there are no further questions, thank

3  Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining. 

4  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

6  MS. BRENAN: Thank you. 

7  I would just like to make about four points. 

8  First, my friend discussed the case of Smith 

9 v. Digmon. And I think I would like to point this Court 

to the words that were used in Smith v. Digmon, which is 

11 where the state court chooses to ignore in its opinion. 

12 And as this Court later said in Castille talking about 

13 that, that's an implicit rejection. 

14  So, really, the way it should be interpreted 

is, if a state court fails to mention in its opinion 

16 writing, it's implicitly rejected, not that it's been 

17 ignored. 

18  Secondly, I'd just like to agree that, yes, 

19 California believes that 1089 is Constitutional under 

the Sixth Amendment. And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit in 

21 Miller v. Stagner said that it was facially 

22 constitutional. 

23  Third, I would just like to agree with 

24 Justice Sotomayor that here, where the trial court made 

the finding of bias, that answered the Sixth Amendment 

44

1 question. 

2  The entire argument below and throughout was 

3 a disagreement as to whether the juror was biased, or 

4 was he just having -- harboring doubts about the 

sufficiency of the evidence. Those were the 

6 counter-arguments. 

7  The trial court, by making the determination 

8 that there was bias, necessarily answered that question. 

9  Secondly, as to that point, I would just 

like to also point this Court to the language in People 

11 v. Cleveland that talks about agreeing with Thomas, and 

12 Brown, and Symington that you cannot dismiss a juror 

13 based on his views of the evidence. And that's at 21 

14 P.3d at page -- 1236. 

So it couldn't have -- in order to have good 

16 cause in California, you couldn't have gotten rid of him 

17 for his views of the evidence. 

18  Finally, I'd just like to say that 

19 Mr. Chief Justice is correct that this would increase 

the litigation. We would have courts, Federal habeas 

21 courts all the time trying to decide whether there was a 

22 sufficient indication or not by deciding whether state 

23 law is coterminous with Federal law. 

24  As we've already seen in California, 

following the issuance of this decision that's exactly

1 the type of arguments that we're getting all the time 

2 now. And for that reason, this Court should adopt the 

3 rule that where a fairly presented claim has been 

4 rejected by a state court, it has denied that claim, 

adjudicated that claim on the merits.
