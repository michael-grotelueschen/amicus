(10:03 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first in Arlington Central School District Board of 

Education v. Murphy. 

Mr. Kuntz. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND G. KUNTZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The statute awarding attorneys' fees as part 

of the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clear 

rule, imposes a certain obligation. It should not be 

expanded to include fees for expert witnesses. 

This is a case of statutory construction. 

Under longstanding rules, statutes are construed by 

first looking at the words of the statute. Is the 

meaning plain? If so, the inquiry stops there. 

This statute is unambiguous. Expert fees are 

not a part of attorneys' fees. Expert fees are not 

costs. The statute contains no reference to expert 

fees. They are not shifted to the school district when 

the parents prevail. 

It's our belief that the lack of compensation 

for experts is an intentional exclusion and omission

from the statute. Congress knows how to add expert 

fees in a cost-shifting statute, and that omission is 

telling here. 

In that context, I think it's important to 

draw the Court's attention to the origin of the 

statute. It was in response to this Court's decision 

in Smith against Robinson. At the time that Smith 

against Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted 

onto other causes of action as a pleading device to --

in an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to 

the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case. So 

cases were brought not only under the -- the Education 

for All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of 

the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well 

of -- on the theory that these were equal protection 

claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment. In 

Smith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that 

the avenue that had to be followed by the parents was 

exclusively that of -- of the remedy provided under the 

Education for All Handicapped Children Act. 

In response to that decision of the Court, as 

my opponent points out in his brief -- I think it was 

19 days later -- bills were introduced into Congress to 

remedy what Congress at that point saw was a -- a lack 

of coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing

parties in cases under the -- under the act. So it's 

no -- no great surprise that what Congress did in that 

instance was to take the language that appears in 

section 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it into 

the -- into the act, into what we now call the IDEA. 

And it's very clear that in doing so, it 

limited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, and 

that right does not include the expert fees advocated 

by the Respondents here this morning. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think the right 

includes any costs other than statutory costs, any 

expenses? 

MR. KUNTZ: No, it does not, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: How do you explain the 

reference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which 

quotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizing 

a report to be made, a report authorized under? They 

shall include data about the specific amount of 

attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. Why do you 

suppose they put the word expenses in? 

MR. KUNTZ: Well, it said attorneys' fees, 

costs, and expenses. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. KUNTZ: And it's a direction to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the expenses must be

something other than attorneys' fees or costs. 

MR. KUNTZ: Well, they could be expenses of 

the attorney. But if they were to be -- be set aside 

separately, that's no indication that -- that Congress 

intended that expenses of other individuals be shifted 

to the cost -- shifted, rather, to the school district. 

It's a direction to the GAO to acquire data --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. KUNTZ: -- for future reference by -- by 

Congress. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about -- may I 

just take the question one step further? I think it's 

in a subsequent clause in that same section requiring 

the GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forget 

whether -- the expenses of consultants. Why was the 

word consultant in there? Because as -- as I 

understand it, a consultant would not be covered by the 

costs -- the general costs statute. 

MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I believe that's 

correct. That's in -- in subdivision (B). 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it? Is it? I thought 

the -- there was a reference to hours of consultants, 

but not expenses. 

MR. KUNTZ: There are two subdivisions: 

subdivision (A) and subdivision (B). Subdivision (A)

says attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses -- expenses, 

and in subdivision (B), it refers to consultants. But 

there isn't any --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I would have thought 

that your answer would be that the Congress was 

interested in finding out the cost of this act, and 

it's very clear that school districts hire consultants 

to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to 

know the amount they were paying to the consultants. 

And that's also why it used the word personnel, which 

-- which is a word usually reserved for a government 

agency. 

MR. KUNTZ: I -- I believe Your Honor is 

correct in that it -- it's a direction by the GAO to 

acquire data. And I believe we argued that point in 

our brief, just as Your Honor has expressed it. We 

think that that direction to the GAO, however, does not 

relate back particularly and -- and certainly doesn't 

inform this Court or inform the statute that expert's 

fees are to be included and shifted over to the -- to 

the school district. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But does it make it possible 

to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to 

do that, but I guess you could read it to do that, 

couldn't you? I mean, you said the word cost wasn't

ambiguous. 

MR. KUNTZ: Under this statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you might be right, 

maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? How is 

it not ambiguous? It might cover -- it might cover the 

fees of consultants. It might be that the argument you 

made is right, but it also mightn't. 

MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I think this Court 

has looked at that issue in -- in two separate cases, 

and one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the 

other is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which involved this statute? 

MR. KUNTZ: Well, it didn't involve this --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, I mean, we 

have a statute and they're using the word costs in the 

statute, and whatever they used in some other statute 

they might have meant something different in this 

statute. And my question is simply how do we know they 

didn't by just reading the word five times, 

particularly since, in fact, if you look at another 

part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost 

to include number of hours spent by personnel, 

including consultants, and the expenses incurred. I 

mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says 

the word costs couldn't include that?

 MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, it -- it could, but I 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, once you say it could, 

then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress 

Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look 

at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly 

clear. Isn't it? Because both the conference report 

and the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they 

intended this kind of expense to be used, which is why 

the GAO went out and did all the studies to include it. 

MR. KUNTZ: But we come back to the 

historical derivation of how this statute came into --

into being, and it did come in in response to Smith 

against Robinson. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the GAO study 

included not just the -- the hours worked and the --

the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part 

of the parent challenging the school board action, but 

it also included those hours and those costs expended 

by the school. 

MR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor, it does. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: In which case it could not 

possibly have been directed to what items are 

compensable. 

MR. KUNTZ: We think that's a separate

section. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: On its face, it covers at 

least half of the items that are not compensable. 

MR. KUNTZ: That's true, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's true, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that the 

provision I referred to refers to the specific amount 

of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the 

prevailing party? So it's definitely referring to 

expenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff. Isn't 

that true? 

MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I -- that's correct. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 


MR. KUNTZ: But I think there are expenses 


that -- that the attorney bears in -- in the routine of 

a -- of a -- of handling the client. Those are 

expenses --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying the word 

expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by 

counsel, which of course would be normally 

reimbursable. 

MR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm not -- I'm 

not sure that you don't have a further answer to 

Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B).

(3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the 

prevailing party. (3)(B) says, for the same sample the 

number of hours spent. 

MR. KUNTZ: They're talking about -- the same 

sample refers to a -- a designated number of States, a 

representative number of States. So the sample refers 

to the States surveyed, not to those --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's certainly possible. 

I just wonder why don't we look and see what they 

intended, since they told us. In the conference 

report, they say the conferees intend the phrase, 

attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable 

expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the 

reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is 

found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent 

or guardian's case in the action or proceeding. So why 

are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress 

intended when they told us what they intended? 

MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, I don't think it's so 

much a question of metaphysics or philosophy -- maybe 

perhaps of philosophy. 

JUSTICE BREYER: My question is why don't we 

just look and see what they intended since they wrote 

it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is 

read it?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did Congress say that, Mr. 

Kuntz? 

MR. KUNTZ: No, Congress didn't say that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it did. I thought 

that the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference 

report precisely what they intended. 

MR. KUNTZ: Your Honor, if I might respond to 

that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I'd like you to respond 

to it. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. KUNTZ: It's -- it's a longstanding rule 

of statutory construction that Congress' intent is best 

found in the language that Congress actually puts into 

the statute. And as we pointed out in the brief, there 

were previous versions of this act which included 

experts' fees which did not make its way to the final 

version approved by both the -- the Senate and the 

House. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: There's no doubt that the 

best evidence is the text of the statute, but at least 

the people who drafted this, even if they were not the 

conferees themselves but were just staff members, they 

apparently thought the language was subject to that 

reading.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which would mean it would

MR. KUNTZ: The rule that we look first to 

the -- yes, Your Honor. Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The rule that you refer to 

that you cannot look at legislative history -- of 

course, we always start with the plain language. 

That's clear. But the rule that you cannot look at 

legislative history didn't really get any emphasis till 

after 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986. 

MR. KUNTZ: But that -- in -- in the 

retrospective view that the Court looked at in -- in 

the -- the Casey decision, it went back and it traced 

the origin of a number of -- of statutes and looked 

essentially to similar language, and it found that 

experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and 

it found that experts' fees were not a part of -- of 

costs. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also found that 

there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't 

Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on 

for a couple of pages, including footnotes? I think it 

was over 30 that did mention experts. It mentioned 

attorneys' fees and expert fees.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was this language, by the 

way -- I'm not clear. It always cited to the House --

the House conferees. Was -- was this language in the 

-- in the Senate conference report? 

MR. KUNTZ: No, Your Honor, I don't believe 

it was. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So we don't really know --

MR. KUNTZ: It emanates -- it emanates solely 

from the House conference report. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only half of 

the Congress, isn't it? Even if --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought it was a joint 

explanatory statement. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even if everybody in the 

House agreed with that, which we don't really know. 

What about the President? When he signed it, 

did -- did he indicate any interpretation? 

MR. KUNTZ: His -- Your Honor, the -- the 

President's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of 

the statute, and he noted that in his signing 

memorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.

one house that said -- that said that, that thought it

MR. KUNTZ: Yes, Your Honor. And it isn't 

all that unusual that the congressional history of a 

particular statute might point one way and the actual 

plain meaning point another way. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: How do you explain the 

title, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of 

the Conference? Doesn't that speak for both the House 

and the Senate? 

MR. KUNTZ: It -- yes, Your Honor, it does. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So it's not correct it's 

just for one house. It's -- what I have is the Joint 

Explanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on the 

part of the House and the Senate. 

MR. KUNTZ: It -- it does say that, Your 

Honor.

And is there some rule -- I don't know what 

this rule is you can't refer to legislative history.

MR. KUNTZ: There was no evidence of that, 

Your Honor, in our review. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which ones are voted on? 

I've not heard of that. I mean, they might be, but it 

used to be that the -- they circulate the report to all 

the Members and the Members read it, and if a Member 

disagrees with it, they note their dissent. Maybe it's 

changed. But I guess --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you cite an example of 

a conference report that was voted on by the Congress? 

MR. KUNTZ: I -- I cannot, Your Honor, and 

that's why I -- I responded as I did, which is that I 

know of no evidence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think we have said that 

conference reports are more valuable than the reports 

of a single house. I think we have said that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are voted on when the 

-- when the conferees make changes, which they 

sometimes do. Then -- then, of course, they have to be 

voted on. So it's frequent. It's frequent that 

they're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were 

no changes made and it wasn't voted on.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have examples of 

conference reports being voted on, don't you? 

MR. SALMONS: I do not, Your Honor. I -- I 

do not dispute the representations that have been made 

about that practice. 

But let me begin by saying, thank you, Mr. 

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 This Court should give the attorneys' fee 

provision of IDEA the same construction it gave the 

nearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and 

hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the 

cost does not include expert fees. 

Respondent's sole argument is that expert 

fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as 

this Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford 

Fitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a 

well-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited 

to those -- that modest category of costs that may be 

awarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say 

about expenses? Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common 

practice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his 

experts and pay them and then bill the client for --

for whatever he's paid for the experts? I mean, if 

that is the -- this has been a long time since I've 

practiced law. So maybe that isn't the way it's done 

anymore. But it -- it certainly has been done that 

way, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't 

it make sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses 

would include those kinds of expenses? 

MR. SALMONS: No. No, I don't think so, Your

Honor. Now, first of all, just to be clear, the -- the 

fee provision that's at issue here is identical to the 

fee provision that was at issue in Casey, and it makes 

no reference to expenses. It says attorneys' fees as 

part of the costs. 

Now, in this separate section instructing the 

GAO to do a report --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's the GAO reference. 

You're right. 

MR. SALMONS: -- it says to look at the --

the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees, 

costs, and expenses. We don't think the term expenses 

in -- in that provision can fairly be read to somehow 

dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase, 

attorneys' fees as part of the costs. We think it's 

much more naturally to read that as just a reference, 

as this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of 

including out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for 

things like copying costs and -- and necessary travel 

expenses and things like that as -- as also being 

compensable. And so we don't think that that -- that 

term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning 

of the statutory provision at issue here. 

And as far as subsection (B) of that 

provision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that

it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases, 

and is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about 

the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and 

others on both sides in these cases because Congress 

was very concerned about the amount of litigation and 

the expense of that litigation and the diversion of 

funds away from the core educational services of the 

schools. As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one 

of the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in 

the more recent amendments to the act. 

And we think, in fact, that the -- the fact 

that Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if 

anything, more consistent with the idea that Congress 

decided not to legislate on the question of expert 

fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had 

the benefit of that study at a minimum. 

Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salmons, there's one 

difference, a marked difference, between this statute 

and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these 

cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, 

perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. There's not a 

case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is 

in the front line. Even in this very case, wasn't it 

true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the

parent and there was no lawyer on the scene? 

MR. SALMONS: That -- that is correct. 

During the administrative proceeding and in the -- and 

in the district court, there was no attorney here. 

But -- but I think there's one important 

thing to keep in mind about that is that that's --

Congress expected that that would be the result. This 

is not a statute where Congress didn't think about the 

role of experts. Among other things, section --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you 

say about the legislative history, which has been so 

prominent in the discussion this morning? The 

conference report. 

MR. SALMONS: Sure. Well, I think the 

conference report clearly represents the view of the 

author of the conference report with regard to the 

meaning of the language. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, don't you suppose it 

represents the view of the House and Senate conferees? 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I mean, I think -- I 

think what that points to is the perils of -- of using 

committee reports and statements --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- I realize that, 

but I mean, an --

MR. SALMONS: -- from the legislative history

when the text is clear. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an argument, a perfectly 

fair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find 

it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a 

committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as 

a literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the 

actual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee, 

let alone a whole house. 

But when we're talking about a conference 

report that has been hammered out between two sets of 

conferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the 

conferees know exactly what is in that report and would 

take exception to it if it didn't represent their 

views. Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for 

saying that whatever you may think of reports in 

general, the conference report probably has a -- a 

superior authority? 

MR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

and let me try to explain why. 

First of all, this Court made clear in Casey, 

dealing with the exact same language, it took -- you 

know, that's at issue here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The text or --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Language in the statute but 

not in the conference report.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was there a conference

MR. SALMONS: No. That's right. And I'm 

referring to the statutory language here, that this 

Court considered this exact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And would you agree, if the 

statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference 

report? 

MR. SALMONS: Well, but my point, Your Honor, 

is that what this Court said --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my 

question? 

MR. SALMONS: Yes. If the Court thinks the 

statute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the 

conference report. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And why is it not ambiguous 

if the author of the conference report read it that 

way? 

MR. SALMONS: For, among other reasons, Your 

Honor -- this is what I was trying to -- trying to 

state because this Court in Casey, dealing with this 

exact same language, said the following. It said where 

the statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous, 

attorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly

accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial 

practices -- again, this Court in Casey tracked through 

the -- the usage, the history of the usage of this 

language and the way courts had responded to this over 

time -- that when that's the case, we do not permit it 

to be expanded or contracted by the statements of 

individual legislators or committees during the course 

of the enactment process. We think that holding in 

Casey is equally applicable here --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, one thing here --

MR. SALMONS: -- and it be would wrong to 

look to that. 

Now, if the Court did, I think the thing that 

the Court should take away from it, if you're going to 

look at what Congress intended here -- and this is 

undisputably true. Everyone agrees on this. The 

primary purpose of this legislation was to respond to 

this Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson. And prior 

to this Court's decision in Smith, section 1988 had 

provided the means by which courts had awarded 

attorneys' fees in cases under IDEA's predecessor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the gravamen --

MR. SALMONS: Smith foreclosed those fees --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does the gravamen --

well, I'll let you finish your answer.

 MR. SALMONS: Sure. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the gravamen of the 

argument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous? 

MR. SALMONS: That -- that is certainly our 

first argument, absolutely, Your Honor. The point I'm 

making now is that if you look at the context in which 

this language was used, Smith foreclosed the award of 

section 1988 fees. Congress responded shortly 

thereafter by -- by adding the precise language of 

section 1988 to the language in IDEA's predecessor. 

Now, however anomalous it would normally be to give the 

same language in two different fee provisions different 

meanings -- and it would be quite anomalous -- to do so 

here with section --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that at 

the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of 

this kind that the Court would look at the conference 

report to ascertain the meaning of the statute? At 

that time, in 1986. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was there any case that 

said you can't look at the conference report at that 

time? 

MR. SALMONS: There are plenty of cases, Your 

Honor, that -- that point out --

point out, even -- even I think beforehand, that the 

language is the primary basis to look. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the best evidence, but 

not the sole evidence. 

MR. SALMONS: And that even when it's 

unambiguous, that's the end of the matter. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, even in -- in those 

benighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever 

would use the conference report when the statute was 

not ambiguous. I thought it was always a rule that --

that --

MR. SALMONS: We certainly agree with that, 

and I would just add that I'm not aware of any decision 

of this Court that would suggest that the type of 

statutory construction tools the Court would use would 

depend on what was in place at the time that the 

statute was enacted. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Of course --

MR. SALMONS: I mean, this Court applies the 

rules that it thinks are appropriate at the time it 

issues its decision. 

Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can't use red if the

statute says green. Green doesn't include red. I 

understand that. And that's why, in fact, I wondered 

if the presence in this bill of the GAO section 

suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the 

word cost means something special. And if that's so, 

then I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to 

the legislative history. It's not like using the word 

red and arguing it includes green. 

MR. SALMONS: Two responses to that, Your 

Honor. The first is that we don't think it's ambiguous 

at all, and we think when -- even if you look at the 

GAO provision, you don't get the kind of ambiguity that 

would allow you to otherwise deviate from the -- the 

clear meaning of this language when it's -- when it's 

been consistent with statutory usage over time. As 

this Court noted in Casey, more than 34 statutes use --

expressly state attorneys' fees in addition to expert 

-- expert fees in addition to attorneys' fees, and 

there would be no point to those. 

But -- but moreover, I think the important 

thing to keep in mind is that it's not just this fee 

provision. If you want a further indication of 

Congress' intent, let me refer you to some other 

provisions of the statute itself, again, the language 

of the statute. Among other things, section 1415(d)(2)

expressly details the content of the notice that has to 

be given to the parents about the procedural safeguards

different things that States have to explain in full to 

the parents. The -- the 12th and the 13th items on 

that list are the parents' ability to bring a civil 

action and their right to bring, quote, attorneys' 

fees, no mention whatsoever of expert fees. 

Thank you, Your Honors. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Salmons. 

Mr. Vladeck. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. VLADECK 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. VLADECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Murphys' principal submission in this 

case is that the text of IDEA authorizes courts to 

award prevailing parents the costs of the experts who 

assist them in IDEA hearings which are typically held 

before State administrative tribunals and in Federal 

court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Vladeck, let me 

just give you a purely hypothetical situation. Let's 

suppose that the conferees can't agree whether expert

fees should be included. Some think they should; some 

think they shouldn't. And somebody suggests a 

compromise. The compromise is we won't put it in the 

statute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let 

the courts figure it out. 

What should happen in that situation? 

MR. VLADECK: Thank you so much, Your Honor. 

I think -- I think that if the statutory text was 

clear, which -- and I believe this text is clear in the 

other direction -- I think we would lose that case. 

But that is not this case, Your Honor, and let me 

explain why. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if that's not 

this case, what in the world prevented the conferees 

from putting something as important in this context as 

expert fees, as I understand it, probably more 

important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them 

from putting that in the statute if that clearly was 

their intent? 

MR. VLADECK: Without being flippant, Your 

Honor, I think that the conferees thought they had put 

it in the statute. Remember, this statute was passed 

back in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th 

Congress that enacted this provision, the word cost did 

not have the term-of-art meaning that was later

ascribed to it in this Court's opinion in Casey. 

JUSTICE ALITO: As you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say it 

certainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal 

court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial 

Code. 

MR. VLADECK: I understand that, Your Honor, 

but Congress thought it was adding -- that the use of the 

word cost and its breadth was a way of -- of including 

the cost. And -- and this is important, Your Honor. 

The language --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get past Casey, 

Casey didn't invent this as a definition. Casey said 

it has always meant this in innumerable Federal 

statutes. Casey was relying on a longstanding practice 

which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, at the time Casey 

was -- at the time this case was -- excuse me -- at the 

time this statute was enacted by Congress, for example, 

costs were routinely read to include expert fees in 

title VII cases, for example. So I don't disagree with 

Your Honor's point. 

I am simply saying that the lens through 

which this statute must be judged is the understanding 

of the 99th Congress, and every indication in the

legislative history here is that Congress used the word 

cost for its breadth, not as a term of art. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Vladeck, why -- if 

that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you 

explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey 

that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees? 

MR. VLADECK: My only explanation, Your 

Honor, is that the -- the Members of Congress who wrote 

this provision were unaware of the difference this 

Court would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not later ascribe. I mean, 

Casey was relying on --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Casey -- Casey is very 

clear in saying the judicial background against which 

Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the 

statutory background, and it says the judicial 

background was that expert fees were quite different 

than attorneys' fees. They were not a subset of 

attorneys' fees. 

MR. VLADECK: Even -- even conceding all of 

that, which I -- I think is -- let me take a step back. 

Even if you reject that submission, the next provision 

of the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the 

Handicapped Children's Protection Act, which was 

enacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(B), and

if you look at that provision, it is clear that

Section 4(b)(A) directs the General 

Accounting Office to study --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that set 

forth? 

MR. VLADECK: I'm sorry? That's page --

excuse me. Page 4 of the red brief, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. 

MR. VLADECK: That directs the General 

Accounting Office, first, to study the amount of 

attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the 

prevailing party. In this statute, only the parents 

could be the awarding -- the prevailing party because, 

unlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street and 

provides only for awards to parents. 

And secondly, it says that for -- for the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck, 

may I stop you there? Because the parents are always 

the plaintiff. It's not the child. The parents are 

representing the child. 

MR. VLADECK: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So prevailing party is 

identical to parents. The parents are the ones who

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the word 

consultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute. 

MR. VLADECK: Right, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that specifically 

refers to the State educational agency and local 

educational agency. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it uses personnel, 

which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private 

experts hired by an attorney. You don't talk about 

them as personnel. 

MR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, this 

provision, up until the last part which says, and 

expenses incurred by the parents, the -- the last 

clause of this provision was added in the conference. 

And the conference report makes that clear at page 7. 

The conference report makes it clear that the House --

the Senate recedes to the House bill. The GAO study 

provision was only in the House bill, with an amendment 

expanding the data collection requirements of the GAO 

study to include information recording the amount of 

funds expended by local educational agencies and State

education agencies on civil actions and administrative 

proceedings. That clause was added, Your Honor, in 

conference. Prior to the conference, the provision was 

very much the same as it is today. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Vladeck, my -- my 

problem with the argument you're now making is -- is a 

little more basic. Assuming, which I think is a -- is 

a major assumption, that expenses refers to expert 

fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in 

another part of the statute, the statute says, fees, 

costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that 

we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as 

part of costs. How does it help your case that --

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that elsewhere they go 

out of their way to add and -- and expenses? It seems 

to me that hurts your case. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, I don't believe 

that this is an inoperative part of the statute. I 

believe that -- that -- this direction to GAO makes no 

sense if all Congress sought to authorize was 

attorneys' fees and the costs that are historically 

available under section 1920 and section 1821. This 

provision makes no sense. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it really the

point not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a 

question? It creates the question, which -- which we 

have in mind when we say the statute is ambiguous, and 

it is in answering that question, that you then turn to 

the legislative history, which has a pretty unequivocal 

statement in your favor. Isn't -- isn't that the --

the way to analyze it? 

MR. VLADECK: I -- it certainly can be read 

that way. I read it as more of an affirmative 

statement by Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if you 

conclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do 

with the Spending Clause problem? We've said that when 

you're imposing conditions in Spending Clause 

legislation, you have to do that unambiguously. It's 

what the Court said in -- in Pennhurst. 

MR. VLADECK: That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's ambiguous, if 

the availability of expert fees, which is the big-

ticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees, 

States are not unambiguously on notice that they're 

accepting that liability when they take the funds. 

MR. VLADECK: With all respect, let me 

quarrel with one of the premises in your question, 

which is that the -- the expenses for experts are,

quote, a big-ticket item. If you look at page 28, 

footnote 17 of our brief, we've tried to compile all of 

the reported cases on the amount of expert fees that 

are awarded. They tend to be exceedingly modest, Your 

Honor. They run from a few hundred dollars to a few 

thousand dollars. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's before the 

Magna Carta you're asking for in this case which would 

establish a whole -- a whole --

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- new profession of 

experts. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, that is not the 

case. The -- the rule that we seek to preserve has 

been the way courts have interpreted this provision 

since 1988. That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even if it is 

not the big-ticket item --

MR. VLADECK: So -- so these are modest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it still has to be 

-- it still has to be unambiguously set forth in 

Spending Clause legislation. 

MR. VLADECK: Right. And -- and if the Court 

finds that the legislative history adds the clarity 

that the statute otherwise needed -- is needed, I do

not see why that would not comply with the Spending 

Clause, particularly since, Your Honor, this statute 

has been on the book for 20 years. There are dozens of 

opinions finding that expert fees are compensable. No 

Spending Clause argument has ever been raised in this 

kind of issue even though the statute has been on the 

books for 20 years. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Under your reading of 1415, 

may a court award to parents any costs that they incur 

in connection with the litigation, or -- or would you 

just add expert fees to the attorneys' fees? 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, there is a body of 

law on that issue that already exists because courts 

have interpreted this provision since 1986. By and 

large, the costs that have been awarded under the 

statute are costs that are normally associated with 

litigation, copying costs, computer-assisted research 

when there's a lawyer involved. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about testing? Isn't 

testing --

MR. VLADECK: The cost of testing and 

evaluation, which is -- which is a crucial component of 

the statute -- those costs have been awarded. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But if costs is not a term --

is not a legal term of art, if it really -- if it means

just the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it 

include things like travel expenses or lost wages to 

attend the court proceeding? 

MR. VLADECK: The -- the way the courts have 

addressed that issue, Your Honor, is they -- they have 

looked to the -- the initial phrase of the statute, in 

an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs 

not sufficiently closely enough related to the action 

or proceeding to justify an award. 

And also courts have applied the rule 54 

reasonableness standard in ordering costs under this 

provision, and therefore, expert costs have been 

reduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the 

general requirements of rule 54. 

I would like -- I would like to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you read the phrase 

from the conference report as a limitation? That is, 

that -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress 

meant by the phrase costs. It says it means includes 

reasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and 

reasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's 

necessary. So then is that -- have the courts read 

that as a -- as a limitation? 

MR. VLADECK: Yes, Your Honor, but they've 

also imposed limitations that are generally -- that

generally constrain the awards of costs in cases. They 

have not done what -- what I understood Justice Alito 

-- his question to -- to get to, was to use this as --

as a broad, open door. 

I'd like to talk about the legislative 

history, and particularly I'd like to respond to 

Justice Scalia's comment about the conference report in 

this case. 

This statute was changed dramatically in 

conference. It does not reflect either the House bill 

or the Senate bill. If one reads the conference report 

in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of 

the Conference, which is three pages long, one will see 

that there were dramatic and substantial changes made 

because there were substantial disagreements between 

the House and the Senate, not on the question of 

reimbursement of expert costs. That -- that provision 

-- that understanding was shared on a bipartisan basis 

in both houses. But the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why were the earlier 

versions that included that expressly then not -- why 

didn't they make it through to the final version? 

MR. VLADECK: The -- the version that -- that 

was referred to earlier, Your Honor, came out of the 

Senate bill. The Senate bill contained a number of

very controversial features. It was pared down, and 

the word cost was substituted, as the drafter of the 

language made clear on the floor of the Senate before 

the Senate voted on its version of the bill, and 

Senator Weicker's explanation of what the word cost 

means could not be clearer, and he -- he --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, we've slid back 

from the joint statement to the statement of one Member 

on the floor now. 

MR. VLADECK: Well, I'm happy for you to rely 

on the joint statement, Your Honor. 

My only point is, is that the understanding 

in the House report is expert fees were included in the 

House bill, which referred to costs and expenses. 

Senator Weicker explains precisely the question you 

asked, which is what happened to the Senate bill. And 

Senator Weicker's explanation, which was made before 

the Senate, immediately before the Senate voted on the 

bill, makes clear that expert costs are included. 

Then, of course, you have the bill going to 

conference. There were many changes in the bill, 

including the language of section 1415. Prior to the 

conference, it did not say attorneys' fees as part of 

costs. It said attorneys' fees in addition to costs. 

That language was changed in conference to accommodate

this Court's decision in Marek v. Chesny, which had to 

do with the applicability of rule 68. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, speaking of that -- of 

that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as 

part of costs, does that suggest -- it doesn't say 

directly that costs may be awarded. Does that suggest 

that the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as 

another element of costs that -- that may be awarded 

under the costs statute? 

MR. VLADECK: I don't believe that Congress, 

when it used the word costs, was adverting to section 

1920. If that is your question, I do not believe that 

that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then where is the 

authorization? I think that's what Justice Alito's 

question goes to. You have to come up with some 

statutory authorization to pay expert fees. Now, 

attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any 

costs. It just says whatever costs are otherwise 

authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that. 

MR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, it says --

it's part of the cost to the parents. And unlike 

section 1980, this language is not, contrary to the 

previous submissions to the Court, identical to the 

language in 1988. It says that a court may award

attorneys' fees as part of the costs to parents, and 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the authorization to 

pay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees? 

All -- all this section says is they may award 

attorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs are 

presumably elsewhere authorized. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But where is the 

authorization to pay? 

MR. VLADECK: Under -- under that reading, no 

statute would authorize the -- the payment of costs. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Under that reading, wouldn't 

-- wouldn't you have a problem in a State court? 

Because doesn't this same provision govern in a State 

court, so that if the State did not have a separate 

cost statute, it would -- it would authorize nothing. 

Isn't -- isn't that the problem you'd run into. 

MR. VLADECK: That is correct. 

Let me make one last --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any State that 

doesn't have a cost statute? 

MR. VLADECK: I have not -- I've not looked 

at them to see whether they correspond to 1920, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Vladeck, you have --

you referred to the section on GAO reporting --

MR. VLADECK: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as an assist to help 

you include consultant fees in -- in costs. But how do 

you explain the -- the provision in this very statute 

that says attorneys' fees can be reduced? Congress 

explicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys' 

fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word 

about reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting 

fees. 

MR. VLADECK: Well, Your Honor, all costs are 

subject to the general requirement in rule 54 of 

reasonableness, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why -- then it would 

be unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees. 

MR. VLADECK: Here's the reason, Your Honor. 

At least, here's the reason that -- as I understand 

it. Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out --

takes place outside the confines of Federal court. 

Most of the litigation takes place in State due process 

hearings. And what I believe Congress was interested 

in making sure were the general rules, like rule 11, 

the general rules that punish parties for engaging in 

vexatious or frivolous litigation would have some

analog in these proceedings. 

And therefore, what the court -- what -- what 

Congress did was to authorize a Federal court, in 

reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred 

before a State-administered tribunal, because that's 

where the action takes place in these cases, to -- to 

be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was 

misconduct by the parent or -- or the lawyer, 

misconduct in the sense of trying to protract 

litigation or multiply proceedings. 

And interestingly, Your Honor, the -- the 

conference report addresses this issue and does explain 

-- and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the -- of the 

conference report, the joint explanation -- that the 

court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys' 

fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they 

determine that this misconduct had taken place. So I 

think that at least in the conference report, Congress 

is signaling that if there were other costs that were 

incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers 

protracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be 

subject to the same reduction. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's effective too, as 

though it were written into the statute, because one 

committee of Congress said so. That's effective.

Congress before they voted on the final bill.

MR. VLADECK: That is correct, Your Honor, 

though the vote technically, of course, is a vote to 

approve the conference report. That is the final vote 

Congress took on this legislation. The vote was a vote 

to approve the conference report, which contains four 

pages -- three pages of text and three pages of 

explanation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the -- did the final 

bill say we adopt the findings of the conference 

report?

MR. VLADECK: It was not, Your Honor.

him?

Senate or the House either before or after suggesting 

that they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert 

fees? 

MR. VLADECK: Not at all, Your Honor. And 

one of the points that I would like to make -- and I 

would like to return to the language of 1415 -- is this 

statute is all -- the IDEA is a statute all about 

protecting parents and children with disabilities. One 

provision of IDEA we have not mentioned, but I think is 

an important one, is the general guarantee that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could 

interrupt you. As I understood it, this gets back to 

where you started. Your position is that if this same 

scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986, 

that your position would not be the same. In other 

words, you said -- your suggestion was that it was the 

legal context at the time in '86 that governed what 

Congress thought the effectiveness of its statements in 

committee reports would be. Maybe I'm ascribing one of 

the Justice's views to you. 

MR. VLADECK: If -- if you're -- and -- and 

forgive my -- my lack of knowledge of the exact history 

of this, but if 1988 is a date upon which the Court 

begins to be reluctant to look at legislative history, 

I would concede that my case would be different post-

1988. It is quite clear that the Congress that enacted 

this bill assumed, and rightly so, that this Court and 

reviewing courts would rely on legislative history. 

Indeed, when this Court issued its opinion in Casey, 

footnote 5 of Casey says that this case may be 

different because of the conference report. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what date in -- I 

mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting 

statutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative 

history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use 

legislative history? 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that -- that's what 

you're suggesting, isn't it? 

MR. VLADECK: What I am suggesting is that 

the Court's role, as I understand it, is to be the 

faithful agent of Congress, and if the -- if the 

expectation of Members of Congress is that language in 

committee reports will -- will garner respect from the 

Court, it is hard to then change the rules on Congress. 

The operative question here is what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason one does not use 

legislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't 

-- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect 

it to be used, but because Congress does not have the

power to delegate to one of its committees the content 

of -- of its statutes. The Constitution provides that 

legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by 

the President, and the problem with legislative 

history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is 

this amounts to a delegation by Congress. 

It's not a matter of what Congress expected. 

I don't care what Congress expected. It can't do it. 

It can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill 

in the blanks in a statute. That's the problem, and 

that has nothing to do with expectations. 

MR. VLADECK: Your Honor, my only point is 

that the Congress that enacted this statute, the 99th 

Congress, thought -- and this -- this view is expressed 

repeatedly in the legislative history, and I believe it 

-- it is reflected in the statutory language as well --

that the word costs here would be given a broad meaning 

to ensure that parents were made whole when they have 

to fight against school boards to secure that which 

IDEA guarantees their child, which is a free and 

appropriate public education. 

This Court has repeatedly in Township of 

Burlington, in Tatrow, in Florence County said that 

provisions of IDEA should not be interpreted in ways 

that detract from this fundamental guarantee. There

would be no more clear detraction from that guarantee 

than requiring parents to bear the expense, which for 

many of these parents is enormous, even though Chief 

Justice, it may amount to only a few hundred or a few 

thousand dollars, to retain an expert, to do battle 

with school boards who have experts on staff. 

Earlier this term, this Court decided 

Schaffer v. Weast. Post Schaffer, parents cannot hope 

to meet their burden of production, let alone their 

burden of proof in IDEA hearings without expert 

assistance. To force parents to bear those expenses, 

even when they prevail, will detract from IDEA's core 

guarantee that the -- that the education provided to 

the child is both appropriate and free. Those 

provisions are in the statute to avoid having parents 

being compelled to make the Hobson's choice: a free 

education that's inappropriate or an appropriate 

education that is not free. 

This Court repeatedly instructs lower courts 

to interpret statutes consistent with the statutory 

context. I would urge that in looking at section 1415, 

you take a look at -- at -- there are now eight 

sections of the statute that reinforce this guarantee. 

It is hard to imagine a statutory guarantee more 

deeply embedded in an act than the guarantee of a free

and appropriate public education than is embedded in 

the IDEA. Permitting parents to recover their expert 

costs --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- if the 

parents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's 

not going to be free. I mean, the -- the statute gives 

them --

MR. VLADECK: But -- but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a right to oppose the 

school board's choice, and if what you say about making 

it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told 

it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get 

your fees. 

MR. VLADECK: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

they lose only when the school board is providing, in 

fact, an education that is appropriate. But where the 

parent prevails because the school board was not 

providing a free and appropriate education, the act's 

guarantee would be seriously eroded unless parents can 

recover the costs of their expert -- of their experts. 

If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Kuntz, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KUNTZ: Thank you, Your Honor. 

Shifting the costs to the school district of 

experts' fees will also shift scarce public resources 

away from the point where it's most effective, at the 

stage when the parent meets with the IEP team to 

resolve the differences. 

When Congress has revisited this statute, as 

it has since 1986, time and time and again, it's --

it's spoken to the -- to the goal of reducing 

litigation and -- and reducing the costs associated 

with litigation. If -- if as the Respondents claim, 

it's central to the fulfillment of this statute that --

that Congress be seen to have shifted the costs of 

these so-called experts to the -- to the school 

district when -- when they prevail, I -- I call to the 

Court's attention that the reality is that the school 

district has no staff of experts as Respondents 

intimate. It has no staff of consultants. 

What it has are the people who actually 

provide the services to the child, and when they come 

to testify at the hearing, typically they're -- they're 

scared or nervous because it's the first time that 

they've been at such a hearing. They're not 

professional experts. They're not testimonial experts.

 Those are the kinds of experts that the Respondents 

are talking about and asking this Court to see in the 

statute. 

One needs to ask the question if Congress 

really intended expert fees to be a part of this 

statute, what stayed Congress' hand from writing those 

words into the statute? It's very clear that Congress 

knew how to do that when it became appropriate, in its 

judgment, for it to do that. To sort of see it here 

lurking in the shadows in -- in sort of the backwaters 

of -- of the act and to intimate from there that the 

plain language of the statute has meaning that needs to 

be expanded and enlightened by the congressional report 

doesn't make a lot of -- of sense. If -- if it's that 

important, it should have been there. The -- its 

absence is very, very telling. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't the school boards 

have some consultants and experts in this area other 

than the teachers? 

MR. KUNTZ: Typically they do not, Your 

Honor. The typical IEP team meeting has the school 

psychologist perhaps, has the -- the teachers of the --

of the child. Those -- some of those are required 

members. It has the parent of a handicapped child. It 

might have the -- the service providers like the speech

pathologist. And when -- when it comes to a trial, 

comes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who 

come and testify as to what they know about the child, 

the test results they have. There are no typical 

consultants or testimonial experts that appear for the 

school district. 

So the -- the central part of this statute, 

its -- its revolution, where it brings parents of 

children who are disabled into contact with the -- with 

the school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling 

the promise of this statute. Energizing the litigation 

aspect of this by transferring those costs to the 

school district will -- will take away and will detract 

from the -- the true meaning of the statute, which was 

to build a partnership between the parents and the 

school district, not to let it dribble off into 

litigation. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kuntz. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
