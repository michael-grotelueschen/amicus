3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning in Case 11-1347, Chafin v. Chafin. 

Mr. Manely. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. MANELY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court: 

United States courts have the power to 

11 effectuate relief in the Hague Convention cases under 

12 circumstances presented here in this international 

13 treaty. 

14  Sergeant First Class -- First Class Chafin's 

appeal from the district court's decision is not moot 

16 because reversal of the district court's judgment could 

17 grant Sergeant Chafin relief in three ways, each 

18 sufficient to preclude mootness. 

19  First, a reversal would mean that the United 

States is the child's habitual residence. Second, the 

21 district court or court of appeals should order 

22 Ms. Chafin to bring the child back to the United States 

23 and overturn the monetary award. And, third, it would 

24 effectuate relief in the ongoing Alabama case and the 

Scottish case by, one, letting Alabama courts proceed to

1 determine custody and, two, cause the Scottish court to 

2 stay or dismiss its proceeding. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it make any 

4 difference? Once -- once the decision -- the district 

court decision is vacated, then the State court can go 

6 forward. There is nothing that inhibits it from doing 

7 so. There is no Federal court order. So your third 

8 point, I think, is --

9  MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. Under the 

UCCJEA, which is what the State of Alabama would use, 

11 there is a home State requirement that the child must be 

12 presently -- six months before the action is commenced. 

13  Not so much from the district court order, 

14 but coming down from the Alabama Supreme Court, but 

premised upon the original district court order, it was 

16 determined that Alabama was not the home State of the 

17 child. So it's sort of like the traffic light that we 

18 talk about in our brief. It would allow the Alabama 

19 courts to say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, I don't understand 

21 that. The child is now in Scotland. 

22  MR. MANELY: Yes. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So how would these six 

24 months be satisfied? 

MR. MANELY: It would toll because the

1 child, we would argue, is wrongfully in Scotland based 

2 upon an errant district court --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can argue that on 

4 the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague 

Convention order. You -- you're not inhibited by 

6 anything, as far as I can see, that the Federal court 

7 has done. Since it's been vacated, it's as though it 

8 never happened. 

9  MR. MANELY: Except for the fact that there 

is an error in the determination of habitual residence. 

11  And I understand what you're saying, but 

12 the -- the res of the controversy needs to be brought 

13 back here. That -- that would be the appropriate remedy 

14 here, so that we have not only the habitual court -- or 

habitual residence determination in the district court 

16 because of reversal, but that we have the child brought 

17 back here. And then that six --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have -- you 

19 don't have that individual -- the residence -- habitual 

residence determination because it's been wiped out. 

21  MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. I understand. 

22  What our argument is, is that there is an 

23 ability to grant a remedy here, and that is the reversal 

24 of that determination, so that we go back to habitual 

residence in the United States. That's what avoids 

5

1 mootness in this case. There is a remedy that can be 

2 provided here. It is not impossible. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't the Alabama --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you're saying is 

the return of the child, essentially, back to Alabama? 

6  MR. MANELY: Bring the child back. Yes, 

7 Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so once the child is 

9 back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court 

would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to 

11 determine the habitual residence. 

12  MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whatever the State --

14 well, presumably, the child only comes back if you win. 

MR. MANELY: Yes. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So presuming you win, 

17 the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could 

18 then seize the custody determination. 

19  MR. MANELY: Right. Proceed under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Alabama court would 

21 not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully 

22 removed? 

23  MR. MANELY: The Alabama --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you're saying? 

MR. MANELY: No, the Alabama court would

1 have jurisdiction under the UCCJEA presently, unless 

2 this Court should determine that it is moot when a child 

3 is removed from the boundaries of our -- of our nation. 

4 The Alabama --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait. The 

6 opinion below has been vacated. 

7  MR. MANELY: Yes, sir. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's -- there's 

9 nothing which says that this child -- this child's 

habitual residence was -- was in the U.K. 

11  MR. MANELY: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That being the case, the 

13 only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even --

14 assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence 

was in Alabama, would it proceed, even if the child had 

16 been taken out of the jurisdiction? And I understand 

17 that it would. 

18  MR. MANELY: If there never had been a 

19 district court determination in the first place, 

certainly --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: There hasn't been. There 

22 hasn't been. It's been vacated. It's as though it 

23 never happened. 

24  MR. MANELY: The posture below is that the 

Eleventh Circuit vacated the opinion in February; but,

1 as recently as July of this year, the Alabama Supreme 

2 Court said, well, since the matter was determined moot, 

3 then only the divorce can proceed. 

4  What we hope to do is, by going back down to 

the Eleventh Circuit, obtaining a reversal --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's bad law. I 

7 mean -- you mean the Alabama court is bound by a vacated 

8 decision of a Federal court? My goodness, I never heard 

9 of anything like that. 

MR. MANELY: Yes, sir. It goes --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was their reasoning that 

12 the child was initially removed properly because there 

13 had been an order permitting the mother to go? 

14  MR. MANELY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it was a lawful 

16 removal at that moment. 

17  MR. MANELY: At that moment, yes. And by --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what they're saying 

19 is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the 

order, but it didn't make her action illegal? 

21  MR. MANELY: Correct. And by reversing, 

22 then we're going back to what was argued to make the 

23 case moot in the first place. We can bring the child 

24 back, and we'll reverse --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say, "bring the

1 child back," there's an impediment to that because now 

2 this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child 

3 stays here. There's an order that the child not be 

4 removed from Scotland, and there is also -- doesn't the 

mother have -- wasn't this mother deported? 

6  MR. MANELY: The mother --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if she -- she -- if 

8 she -- the mother comes back into the United States, 

9 she's committing a criminal offense. 

MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. Absent -- and 

11 she was present at the trial in the district court. So 

12 there are provisions that would allow her to return for 

13 that particular reason. And, of course, she can 

14 reapply, I think, after something like five years. She 

was deported because she had overstayed her visa. 

16  But --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the order 

18 of the court in Scotland? 

19  MR. MANELY: The order of the court in 

Scotland, we would refer to on a State level, as being a 

21 standing order. And what it does is tell Sergeant First 

22 Class Chafin that he can't remove the child. There is 

23 no prohibition to the mother. There is no sense that 

24 Scotland has assumed authority over this child -- should 

become a ward of the country.

1  It's more that, since the mother has filed a

3 the child from Scotland. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's a stand-still order 

there. 

6  MR. MANELY: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long has the child 

8 been -- now since -- since the return, pursuant to the 

9 Federal court's order, how long has the child been 

residing in Scotland? 

11  MR. MANELY: October 13th of last year, I 

12 believe, so approximately 14 months now. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: What if the Alabama courts 

14 were to conduct a custody proceeding? Since the child 

has now been in Scotland for over a year, would they 

16 consider the child's habitual residence to be Scotland? 

17  MR. MANELY: The Alabama courts --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: And if they did that, 

19 wouldn't they defer to the Scottish courts for custody 

determination? 

21  MR. MANELY: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

22 so. Again, applying UCCJEA, which all of the States 

23 have, but for one, they are to look at Hague orders in 

24 the same way that they would apply UCCJEA, and there is 

a tolling provision. If a child has been wrongfully

1 removed from that jurisdiction, then the child is still 

2 presumed to have retained a home State status with 

3 Alabama. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is a 

judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000 

6 or so? 

7  MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you break down 

9 that figure? 

MR. MANELY: The lion's share of it is 

11 attorneys' fees, but, also, within the Hague, there is a 

12 mandatory provision for costs; not just costs of court, 

13 but the costs of mother's flying over here from 

14 Scotland, staying here for approximately a week and a 

rental car. So while that isn't the predominant share 

16 of the $94,000, it was a substantial portion of that. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So have the State 

19 proceedings been dismissed? Or are they in suspense? 

MR. MANELY: Neither, Your Honor. Where 

21 they are is the trial level court is waiting to grant a 

22 divorce, but that is kind of effectively held up by the 

23 parties, in hoping that we can use Alabama Rule of Civil 

24 Procedure 60(b)(5); that, if we get a reversal from the 

Eleventh Circuit saying habitual residence is the United

1 States, we can reopen the custody matter. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it would be your 

3 position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction 

4 over the child and the mother? 

MR. MANELY: Certainly, if the Eleventh 

6 Circuit reverses, yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that cost that 

8 you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was 

9 mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the 

monies you have to pay? 

11  MR. MANELY: It still is, Your Honor. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you win on this 

13 appeal, is that wiped out? 

14  MR. MANELY: We believe that it is. The 

energy of our case is thrust into having habitual 

16 residence determination reversed and bringing the child 

17 back; but we think that when -- the provision of ICARA 

18 that allows for the costs, the travel costs and the 

19 attorneys' fees to be awarded, is also obliterated. So 

that is also --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that done in a 

22 separate judgment? The --

23  MR. MANELY: It's a separate order, same 

24 case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is there any problem 

12

1 about the time to appeal from that having run? 

2  MR. MANELY: We don't think so, but, again, 

3 that's not the thrust of our case. I understand the 

4 government's argument, and we certainly agree with that. 

Our energy, all along, has been spent exclusively on 

6 reversing habitual residence determination. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, as far as mootness 

8 is concerned, if you have not appealed from that order 

9 and the time has run from your appeal, you can't rely on 

that to avoid mootness. 

11  MR. MANELY: Your Honor, I believe I 

12 understand your question, and I -- and I think you're 

13 correct. If we're talking about a determination that 

14 the United States loses power over children when they're 

removed from our borders, then the rest kind of falls in 

16 line. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what's -- what 

18 happens --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your 

answer. 

21  MR. MANELY: I'm sorry. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: What is your -- I don't 

23 understand that answer. Are you -- are you saying 

24 that -- that your failure to appeal that in a timely 

fashion makes it impossible for the Court of Appeals to

2  MR. MANELY: No, sir. And it may be --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's what 

4 I thought the question was. 

MR. MANELY: I apologize. And it may be 

6 just the -- the tunnel vision that we have in this case. 

7 We're solely focused on reversing the district court 

8 order on habitual residence and returning the child. 

9 The rest is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then retain 

11 your tunnel vision. And don't say that the case remains 

12 non-moot simply because of this other issue. The other 

13 issue is either in the case or out of the case. Now, is 

14 it part of your case? 

MR. MANELY: We agree with the government's 

16 position that it keeps this case alive, and it is not 

17 moot. But I certainly understand the -- the issue, 

18 particularly since our focus on the case is otherwise. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you -- if you could 

take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of 

21 the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to 

22 be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the --

23 the judgment for costs? I don't understand why that 

24 would be a separate order -- why that would be something 

that has to be appealed separately. Why wouldn't that

1 be included with the final order in the case? 

2  MR. MANELY: Yes, Your Honor. I agree. And 

3 the -- allowing the child to leave was the linchpin that 

4 allowed the costs. Removing that impediment also 

removes the costs. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's 

7 lovely, but -- so you are saying that you don't have to 

8 appeal that separately; is that what you're saying? 

9  MR. MANELY: I'm saying I trust that that is 

the resolution of this; but, again, our focus is on the 

11 child, not costs. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you've got to answer my 

13 question. 

14  MR. MANELY: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have to appeal that 

16 separately or not? If -- if the way you answered 

17 Justice Alito's question was -- was the way you did, you 

18 are saying that it's unnecessary to appeal that monetary 

19 aspect of the judgment separately, that it goes -- it 

goes with the rest of it. Is that -- is that your 

21 position? 

22  MR. MANELY: Your Honor, I think that it is 

23 correct that if the -- the basis for the award is 

24 removed, then the award is removed; but, if the basis 

for the award remains, then it would be difficult to

2  I don't think there is any great answer. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're saying it 

4 doesn't have to be appealed separately. 

MR. MANELY: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what's 

7 happening -- what is the status? Given the vacated 

8 return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish 

9 court ever determine habitual residence? 

MR. MANELY: The Scottish court has no need 

11 to determine habitual residence because that was 

12 determined by the -- by the district court. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that order has been 

14 vacated, so can they revisit that question is really 

the -- the issue. 

16  MR. MANELY: I don't -- they wouldn't 

17 revisit within the context of a Hague proceeding, unless 

18 a Hague proceeding were brought there. Within the 

19 context of their own custodial determination, like the 

Alabama court would in the divorce, there is a 

21 determination of -- of jurisdiction over the child. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could bring a Hague 

23 proceeding there, right?

proceeding there.

2 there having been no decision in the United States, we 

3 want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we 

4 think it's the United States. You could do that. 

MR. MANELY: We could do that. The problem 

6 with that is that we're talking about different points 

7 in time. 

8  For our Hague -- actually, the mother's 

9 Hague proceeding, she's the one that filed it -- for the 

mother's Hague proceeding, the time period that we're 

11 looking at was February of 2010 until the child left in 

12 October of 2011, that is the time frame we'd really like 

13 to stay with. That's an important time frame. 

14  If we go to Scotland, we're talking about a 

different time frame. It's a different animal. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you said 

17 that that time period was tolled -- the period that she 

18 was in Scotland would be tolled. 

19  MR. MANELY: From a United States 

perspective, more specifically an Alabama perspective, 

21 yes. Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Scotland, it's --

23 it would be a custody proceeding. Forget about the 

24 Hague. The child is there. The mother is bringing a 

custody proceeding. And the question for that court is

3 what was it then. 

4  MR. MANELY: Yes. Yes. And -- and the 

Scottish court -- our -- our briefs are filled with the 

6 citations of authority, but the Scottish court -- there 

7 is no reason to believe that the Scottish court wouldn't 

8 honor what the United States court has said about 

9 habitual residence, the case brought by the mother in 

the Federal district court in Alabama. 

11  So that if that was the linchpin to allow --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was only for 

13 determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague 

14 Convention is out of it, then there is a custody 

proceeding. The idea of the Hague Convention is just to 

16 get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to 

17 decide the custody question, right? 

18  MR. MANELY: Yes. Custody is the second and 

19 crucial element of the Hague Convention as well. 

If -- if there are no further questions, I'd 

21 like to reserve the balance of my time.

2  MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3 please the Court: 

4  Put simply, this case is not moot because an 

appellate decision on the merits would matter. What the 

6 Court has been discussing today is there are various 

7 ways in which the appellate decision might matter. 

8 There are ways that there would be a judgment that the 

9 father either did or did not wrongfully retain the 

child. 

11  Part of the wrongful retention determination 

12 is the 900 -- or the $94,000 in money damages. There is 

13 a question of whether the child might remain in the U.K. 

14 or be brought back to the U.S. And then there's the 

question of which courts are going to decide custody, 

16 Alabama or Scottish courts. 

17  And we don't need to know precisely -- and 

18 this Court doesn't need to figure out all of the 

19 different details of Alabama State law or of custody law 

under the Scottish proceedings. All the Court needs to 

21 decide is that the appellate court's decision would make 

22 a difference here. And it's -- it's just not the case 

23 that you could say it's moot because it doesn't make a 

24 difference.

4 to say it might make a difference, and that's enough, 

right? 

6  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, this Court has said 

7 that, as long as there's any possibility of effectual 

8 relief, that the case is not moot. So --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should put it 

that way, then. It doesn't -- you don't know that it 

11 makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right? 

12  MS. SAHARSKY: That's what I would say is 

13 that you don't have to know. 

14  But just, if there is nothing else but a 

declaratory judgment that the father either did or did 

16 not wrongfully retain the child in the U.S., that is a 

17 piece of paper in the world that has consequences to 

18 these parties. It has consequences in terms of the 

19 money judgment that's been entered, and it has 

consequences in terms of where custody will be 

21 determined. 

22  The whole point of bringing a Hague 

23 Convention case is to get the child in the place of 

24 habitual residence, so that those courts, under their 

own law, can decide custody.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I 

2 mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to 

3 stop this shuttling the child back and forth. But, 

4 because of this unfortunate situation we have, where the 

district judge wouldn't give a stay, you're -- what 


6 you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this 


7 Convention was meant to stop. 


8  This child has been in Scotland for 14 


9 months. Now, you say bring it back to the United 


States, and we -- we start over. The whole object of 

11 the return procedure is so that you get the child to a 

12 place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't 

13 that right? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. We share your concerns 

about not wanting the child to be shuttled back and 

16 forth. And we think that the way to accommodate those 

17 concerns are by stays in appropriate cases, where the 

18 four factor test that -- with respect to a likelihood of 

19 success on the merits and a balancing of the equities is 

met; and that, when stays are put in place pending 

21 appellate proceedings, that those proceedings be 

22 expedited, the decisions made quickly. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And would you go further 

24 and say that, if a stay is not in place, that that still 

does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to

2  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. That's what we would 


3 say, that the case is not moot. The court of appeals 


4 should be able to go forward with the case. 


But if the case for a stay has not been made 

6 by the losing party, then the child should be returned 

7 to the country of habitual residence because a 

8 determination has been made that that's the country 

9 where the child should be, and there's not a good 

argument that the other side has put forth for a stay. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You agree that the 

12 ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite 

13 agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending 

14 appeal and an expedited appeal. But there is no rule 

that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that 

16 sensible procedure be put in place? 

17  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we think that just, 

18 under the normal court appellate rules, that that 

19 effectively is what happens using the American stay 

standard for a four factor test, not that there would be 

21 a stay in every case, but, when the showing -- the 

22 appropriate four factor showing is made for a stay, that 

23 then a stay would be appropriate, and an expedited 

24 appeal would be appropriate. 

But you can't ---

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's lovely, but 

2 there wasn't a stay here. So what do you do when that 

3 procedure hasn't been followed? That's the issue that 

4 we're presented with. 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: And do we even know that a 

7 stay would have been appropriate here? 

8  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the district court 

9 denied a stay, and Petitioner did not go to the court of 

appeals, so we don't know --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: So presumably, a stay would 

12 not have been appropriate. 

13  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, then, if that's the 

14 case, but -- but it -- but this decision actually went 

to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals 

16 reversed on the merits. It would be up to the district 

17 court on remand to determine how to fix its prior 

18 erroneous decision. And it would use the equitable 

19 authority that it has in every case to fix a wrong 

decision and determine what the right thing is --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we wouldn't go back 

22 to what should have happened, that is, the district 

23 judge applying the four factor test -- or did the 

24 district -- there was an application for a stay. It was 

denied, right?

Official 

1  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. And the district court 

2 entered a brief order; so the district court did not go 

3 through the various factors, but, presumably, that is 

4 the standard the district court would have used. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask a question? 

6 Does it matter? Meaning, whether a stay is granted or 

7 not, you are, I don't think, taking the position that 

8 only if the stay is granted is the court of appeals 

9 seized of jurisdiction. You're saying the case is not 

moot, correct? 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. The 

12 mootness question and the stay questions are two 

13 separate questions. And you don't want to have to say 

14 the person has to get a stay in every single case; 

otherwise, their case becomes moot. They lose their 

16 appeal. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, under 

18 the Convention, if the child -- if it goes back to the 

19 district court now to fashion a remedy, it could order 

return, it could decide under the Convention that 

21 bringing the child back after 14 months presents a great 

22 risk to the child under the Convention and not order the 

23 return, correct? 

24  MS. SAHARSKY: We don't think the Convention 

addresses that; but the district court could make that

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we just don't know 

3 what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is 

4 possible. That's why you used the word "possible." 

MS. SAHARSKY: That is exactly -- that is 

6 exactly our position. We don't know what the courts 

7 would do. We're glad to discuss the possibilities with 

8 the Court; but the standard is the possibility of 

9 relief, it doesn't need to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they have the power, 

11 if they choose it, but they don't have to choose it; 

12 that's the bottom line, correct? 

13  MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. The 

14 position of the other side is that there is absolutely 

nothing that the courts can do in these circumstances 

16 once the child leaves. And we just think that the 

17 Convention doesn't say that. It doesn't mandate that. 

18 It's a question of U.S. mootness law. And this Court 

19 has said, as long as there's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you aware of -- I 

21 happen to be because I know this area very well -- the 

22 English courts have an amici filed with us yesterday, 

23 and they are sort of sensibly keeping track of what 

24 we're doing and trying to adjust their proceedings

2  Is this common in the custody area? Is 


3 there discussions between courts about what they're 


4 doing and the why of it? 


MS. SAHARSKY: Well, in the Convention, 

6 there is kind of two aspects of this. One is in child 

7 custody proceedings, under the UCCJEA, and one is in the 

8 context of the Convention. 

9  The UCCJEA, which deals with competing 

States and potentially competing countries' custody 

11 determinations, has specific provisions that address 

12 cooperation and communication. They are, like, Section 

13 110, 111, and 112 --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And it's required. 

There is a whole system set up now, right? 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: There is a whole system for 

17 that. 

18  In the Convention, that type of comity and 

19 cooperation typically occurs through the Central 

Authorities. Each country has a Central Authority that 

21 communicates with each other. So, for example, if the 

22 U.K.'s Central Authority would like something to be 

23 brought to the U.S. courts' attention, it might enlist 

24 the help of the U.S. Central Authority in, for example, 

getting the parties to --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, that's very 


2 nice. What does that have to do with this case? I 


3 don't understand that. 


4  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the question is just 


what -- what might happen in this case, in terms of if 

6 there would be competing court orders or whether the 

7 courts would -- what the courts would do in response to 

8 each other. 

9  And I think the point, at least, that I was 

getting from Justice Sotomayor's question is that there 

11 is a measure of cooperation here, so that the Court need 

12 not be particularly concerned about parallel proceedings 

13 or competing proceedings in other countries. 

14  The way that, for example, this case has 

played out is that, while the Hague Convention dispute 

16 has been litigated in Federal court, the Alabama custody 

17 court has appropriately stayed its hand, as it's 

18 required to do under Article 16 of --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you 

agree with your -- with the Petitioner, just reading a 

21 sentence from its brief, that "mootness requires that 

22 relief be impossible"? Do you think that's the right 

23 standard? 

24  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we -- we think that the 

Court essentially said that in Knox, that it said --

27

25

Official 

1 that asked whether there is a possibility of relief, if 

2 the question is one of literal impossibility, we don't 

3 think that the Court needs to ask --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What this Court --

Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry 

6 under standing, and it said that it's not supported by 

7 injury that is speculative or conjectural. It seems to 

8 me, when you start talking about, well, the Scottish 

9 court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this, 

that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural. 

11  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think the Court has 

12 made those comments more in the context of the standing 

13 inquiry at the beginning of a case, as opposed to the 

14 mootness inquiry after a case has gone on for a while, 

and the burdens there are different. 

16  At the standing -- at the beginning of a 

17 case in the standing inquiry, the party coming into 

18 court really has a burden of showing that this case --

19 that there's something to be adjudicated in court. As 

the case continues, it's the party who doesn't want the 

21 case to be in court anymore to show that there's nothing 

22 the court can do; that even though the court has put 

23 those resources --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the burden is 

different, but I don't agree that the standard changes.

1 It's just who has to prove it, one side or the other. 

2 But I --

3  MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And our position with 

4 respect to the standard is simply from language taken 

from this Court's decision, going back to Mills, but 

6 also repeated in Church of Scientology and Knox, is 

7 there any effectual relief, whatever; is it possible to 

8 grant relief? Relief can be partial, it doesn't need to 

9 be complete. That's things that the Court has said. 

You know, we don't interpret that to be a --

11 you know, literal impossibility standard. We just 

12 understand that to be asking the question, is there 

13 something the courts can do, even if it's not 

14 complete --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So do you think 

16 it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of 

17 things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough 

18 that, if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court 

19 might do something as a result of that? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think that the Court 

21 issuing an opinion has effects in America, regardless of 

22 what happens in Scotland, because you have a declaratory 

23 judgment that sets out the rights of the parties. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought one of the

all connected because -- can I finish the sentence? --

6 you have a judgment in the United States about the 

7 rights of the parties. It affects the money judgment. 

8 It affects what might happen with custody. I mean, it's

17  Mr. Chief Justice, the effect that any

19 court, nothing. There is nothing a court can -- can do 

in this judicial process --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why can't they order the

1 first. The answer to that is, no, they cannot. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not? She was here. 

3 She submitted to the court's jurisdiction. Doesn't 

4 her -- jurisdiction over her now continue until the end 

of the case? 

6  MR. CULLEN: Well, the case did end because 

7 there is one remedy, and one remedy only, in this 

8 treaty, and that is return. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't matter. 

The question is, isn't she seized -- doesn't the court 

11 have jurisdiction over her until the case ends? The 

12 case doesn't end until there has been an appeal and a 

13 judgment and the judgment affirmed or reversed. That 

14 hasn't happened. 

MR. CULLEN: No, that's not correct. I 

16 can't agree with that because then we're ignoring 

17 Article 3 and the constitutional doctrine of mootness 

18 because that's where the constitutional doctrine comes 

19 into central --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are suggesting that 

21 the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been 

22 ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not 

23 because of mootness, but because the Convention takes 

24 away a fundamental right to appeal? 

MR. CULLEN: No, the Convention says you

explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished, 

6 that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting 

7 treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you? 

8  MR. CULLEN: No, they're not. There are 88 

9 countries, and this is a very, very good convention. It 

works. It works for the countries, Justice Sotomayor, 

11 that do immediate enforcement, and it works for the 

12 countries that don't do immediate enforcement, pending 

13 an appeal. 

14  But the -- the question presented here is 

what a court could do in this country once the sheriff 

16 court in the Hamlet of Airdrie is seized with 

17 jurisdiction because what this treaty has done is -- has 

18 taken jurisdiction from the United States and said, 

19 Scotland, you now have jurisdiction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing -- one 

21 thing the Court can do is give him back $94,000. 

22  MR. CULLEN: No, it cannot. It cannot. I 

23 was very --

2  MR. CULLEN: It's gone in this case, 

3 Mr. Chief Justice, because, in the Joint Appendix, pages 

4 16 and 17, you'll see -- I believe it's docket entry 52, 

on page 16, an appeal was taken off those fees. 

6  If you go on -- I believe it's page 17 of 

7 the Joint Appendix, docket entry 57, you'll see that the 

8 Petitioner voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the fees. 

9 So having taken an appeal of the fees and having 

dismissed, there is nothing left for any appeal court 

11 now to do with respect to fees. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except he might have 

13 assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if 

14 the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits. 

MR. CULLEN: Right. So --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he -- he was just 

17 trying to have a single appeal. 

18  MR. CULLEN: Right. But the test that the 

19 Court would apply in -- in that hypothetical fees 

determination is totally different from the test the 

21 appeal court would apply in looking at habitual 

22 residence. All it would look at is, is it --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, appellate courts all 

24 the time have issues where they apply different 

standards to multiple issues in the case.

Official 

1  MR. CULLEN: Right. So if we assume that 

2 the fees survives -- they can pursue the fees issue. 

3 The problem, Justice Kennedy, is that there -- there is 

4 no habitual residence to be determined back in time. 

What this treaty does is it exercises a one-way return. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that, of course --

7 on your premise, that's right. On their premise, it's 

8 wrong, that -- the issue of custody is still alive under 

9 their perspective. That's what we are arguing about, so 

you're just assuming your own premise. 

11  MR. CULLEN: Well, the premise, though, is 

12 based in the purpose of this treaty because, back in the 

13 '70s, before this treaty, Justice Kennedy, there was 

14 chaos. And, in fact, the government is suggesting we 

should go back to possibly competing custody orders 

16 between Scotland and Alabama, but --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think that's --

18 you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the 

19 habitual residence of the child is Scotland. So if they 

appeal, they might win one that says that was wrong, the 

21 habitual residence was the United States, but the child 

22 is in Scotland. 

23  You understand Scottish law better than I, 

24 but they are also bound by this treaty. So I would 

imagine a Scottish court, just as we would do, when they

1 are trying to decide what's the habitual presumptive

3 look at what the United States courts decided. 

4  They are not absolutely bound by it. But 

just as we, in the last case we had, were very 

6 interested in what the Chilean courts said. Of course, 

7 it was relevant to us what the Chilean courts had held 

8 was the proper law of Chile in respect to that child. 

9  Wouldn't the Scottish courts do the same? 

Wouldn't it matter to a Scottish court, after all, 

11 that an American court had decided that the residence 

12 was not bound? I'd certainly give it – won’t they 

13 give it consideration? 

14  MR. CULLEN: With -- Justice Breyer, with 

respect to the lower court's opinion, there is, as 

16 Justice Ginsburg said, there is no opinion. There is 

17 nothing. There's --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm assuming they win. The 

19 reason that they want to appeal is they want to win. If 

I were looking at the case as you present it, I would 

21 say, of course, you'll win, don't worry. What are you 

22 worried about? 

23  But -- but they have a different view. So 

24 they think they are going to win. Now, it means nothing 

if they lose. But if they win on appeal, they then have

2 residence was the United States. And my question is 

3 where we started, armed with that piece of paper, they 

4 walk into the Scottish court and they say, oh, Scottish 

judge, please read this paper. 

6  Of course, he will read it, and I would 

7 think that that judge would take it into account in his 

8 decision. That's what we do with the foreign -- similar 

9 foreign orders of other foreign courts, and I think we 

should do that, and I think the Scottish courts should 

11 and will. Now, you tell me where I'm wrong in that. 

12  MR. CULLEN: Justice Breyer, the sheriff in 

13 Airdrie would say, why are you handing me a finding 

14 about what habitual residence was 2 years ago? The 

child's habitual residence 2 years later is clearly 

16 Scotland, and we -- we don't look back in time with 

17 respect to that. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Or -- then argument as to 

19 why they shouldn't give in to this hypothetical American 

judgment. That isn't my question. My question is won't 

21 they consider it and give it -- and the Scottish courts, 

22 to my knowledge, are not so narrow-minded. I think they 

23 would pay attention to what other courts have said.

Breyer is posing, would they look at it; they would say 

6 it's irrelevant. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: They would? 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because what her habitual 

9 residence was then doesn't matter one whit to us. We 

want to know where she is residing now, and that's the 

11 reason why the Scottish court would say it's not 

12 relevant to the question before us. Their question is 

13 not a treaty question. Their question is custody of 

14 this child. 

MR. CULLEN: Justice Ginsburg, that's

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I am -- I am quite 

4 surprised that you would say that prior residence can 

never bear on present residence. In custody disputes, 

6 this happens all the time. The child spent 5 years in 

7 this country, 4 years in that country; now, for the last 

8 2 years, the child has been in this country -- the 

9 previous experience of the child has a tremendous 

bearing on custody. 

11  To say that it's only now, prospective only, 

12 after the child has been removed, I just think is wrong, 

13 as a matter of custody law. 

14  MR. CULLEN: Well, with respect to custody 

law versus Hague law, Justice Kennedy, there -- there is 

16 a difference. The relevance of the Hague determination 

17 2 years in the past is not, Justice Breyer, helpful, but 

18 I agree. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Unless there is some 

accommodation here, what worries me is this: If you win 

21 this case, it's not going to be better. Maybe for your

23 it's not going to be better. 

24  And what's worrying me, to put it on the 

table, so you can respond, is that, in similar

1 situations, district judges will think this child 

2 belongs in England; this child belongs in France; this 

3 child belongs in China, wherever they belong. But in 

4 the back of their mind will be the possibility that they 

are wrong, and they know there is a right to appeal. 

6  And so instead of being able in these 

7 border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able 

8 to send the child back home, they will think, I've got 

9 to keep the child here, so that the other party has the 

right to appeal. Now, it seems to me, in general, that 

11 would be bad for the child. It would be -- and it's bad 

12 for our system. 

13  And it would be better to work out a system 

14 that you can send the child back, and then if you're 

reversed on appeal, it does matter to the other 

16 country's courts. 

17  MR. CULLEN: But, Justice Breyer, if -- we 

18 say, as you know, you can't have conditional returns, 

19 but you can have, with respect to stays, there is a 

panoply of different types of stays. Now, what's 

21 happened in the district court in this instance --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that -- that 

23 actually is not accurate. The Convention is full of 

24 conditions for the return, the safety of the child, the 

support of the parent who is returning -- there is a

1 whole set of conditions that have to be met before the 

2 child is returned. 

3  MR. CULLEN: Justice --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I happen to think 

that -- that one could argue that returning back to the 

6 court that had -- was making the decision after an 

7 appeal is raised, that that's an inherent condition of a 

8 return order. But that -- you're arguing against that. 

9 But there are plenty of conditions that could be 

imposed. 

11  MR. CULLEN: We don't -- we don't agree with 

12 that, Justice Sotomayor. There are affirmative 

13 exceptions that can be asserted by a respondent, but 

14 there are no conditions. In fact, Article 19 of the 

treaty, as you know, says you cannot, as a Hague court, 

16 step into any sort of custody determinations at all. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. You can't -- the 

18 Court can't order custody issues, but it can set 

19 conditions for the nature of the return. It could say 

the father pays the cost, the father has to pay for 

21 certain expenses in the country the child is being sent 

22 to. Those kinds of conditions can be imposed. 

23  MR. CULLEN: Those would be limited 

24 undertakings. As you know, Justice Sotomayor, those 

limited types of undertakings came about because of the

1 13B exception and the 13B exception only, where a judge 

2 felt there was some risk in the return, but the risk did 

3 not rise to the great risk. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cullen -- Mr. Cullen, 

it's often true, in international litigation, that 

6 enforcement is very difficult. I mean, take a 

7 commercial litigation case where somebody is going after 

8 assets and the assets are not in the United States, and 

9 somebody looks and says, well -- you know, a court can 

do whatever it wants, but nothing is going to happen 

11 afterwards. 

12  So why is this case any different from --

13 you know, a very frequent problem in international 

14 litigation, which is, sometimes, judgments are difficult 

to enforce? And if you look at it practically, it 

16 may -- may never be enforced, but we don't put courts to 

17 the job of saying, oh, well, let's check out the various 

18 enforcement options and make predictions about who's 

19 going to do what. 

MR. CULLEN: Justice Kagan, not to state the 

21 obvious, but this is different because it's a child. 

22 It's a child in question, and that has to be a 

23 consideration in this treaty. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's different -- that 

might be -- it's certainly different in terms of the

1 interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason 

2 for Congress to step in and try to fix this system, so 

3 that you don't have children shuttling back and forth. 

4 But -- you know, at the risk of sounding hard-hearted, 

in terms of the law, what is different? 

6  MR. CULLEN: Well, what is different is --

7 and I need to answer the question -- two Justices have 

8 asked me about these stays, and I need to answer that, 

9 so I can answer your question. 

The -- the district court was presented with 

11 a single request for a stay in this case. The request 

12 was we may or may not file an appeal. We haven't filed 

13 a notice of appeal, so give us a stay, so we can decide 

14 what we want to do. 

What should have happened and what usually 

16 happens is you say, give us a stay, but if you're not 

17 going to give us a stay, give us a temporary stay. Give 

18 us 48 hours, to see if we can get a stay from the 

19 appellate court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 

21 quite fair to say we -- we haven't decided whether we're 

22 going to appeal. I mean, the -- the stay motion was 

23 made immediately upon the determination of the merits by 

24 the district court, and the district court said no. So, 

I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done

1 to -- to get a stay? 

2  MR. CULLEN: No. It was a peculiar 

3 halfhearted request for a stay. The stay was we don't 

4 even know if we're going to appeal this. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's out of 

6 respect to the district judge, who's just issued a 

7 ruling on the merits. I mean, saying -- you know, we 

8 have to consider your -- your ruling, not -- you know, 

9 we're taking you up right away. 

MR. CULLEN: Right. And this was a 

11 Wednesday. And what should have happened is, at a 

12 minimum, a 24-hour or 48-hour request for a temporary 

13 stay. And, Mr. Chief Justice, this happens all the time 

14 in Hague cases. Hague practitioners ask for stays and, 

if a stay is not going to be granted, ask for a 

16 temporary stay. 

17  The notion presented to -- to this Court 

18 that there was some rush to justice here is not what 

19 happened on the ground in Alabama. That is not what 

happened. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me --

22 and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my 

23 colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things 

24 up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and 

then have to be brought back, particularly if you have

1 situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. 

2 And I think most appellate courts would appreciate 

3 the -- the benefit of that. 

4  It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct 

that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a --

6 there is going to be a rush to judgment by the 

7 individual that wants to take the child away. 

8  MR. CULLEN: No, we don't agree with that, 

9 Mr. Chief Justice, because that doesn't take account of 

the four factors any district court judge is supposed to 

11 exercise in her discretion, in determining whether a 

12 stay should be granted or not. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, you're just 

14 assuming that the district judge is right, but that's 

the whole issue. And as the Chief Justice indicates, 

16 under your position, we give a premium to the very sort 

17 of precipitant action that the Hague Convention is 

18 designed to avoid. 

19  MR. CULLEN: Justice Kennedy, no, what we're 

doing is we are following the letter and the text of the 

21 convention and the implementing legislation in this 

22 country. 

23  Time and again, this peculiar word 

24 "forthwith" is used. It means right now. Time and 

again, the treaty tells us you must act expeditiously

1 because the idea, Justice Kennedy, is we avoid competing 

2 litigation in countries. We must have one country that 

3 is deciding this. And it's --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So are you arguing that the 

effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which 

6 uses "forthwith" and all of this, is to, in effect, 

7 require that, unless there is a motion for a stay 

8 pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out? 

9  MR. CULLEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you think the -- the 

11 mere word "forthwith" in the statute is enough to alter 

12 our normal process of appeal? 

13  MR. CULLEN: It's the -- as a treaty, it's 

14 the supreme law of the land. It says, if you decide to 

issue a return, the child is to be returned forthwith. 

16 And the plain meaning of those words is you must act 

17 immediately. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But I can't -- I don't 

19 understand why you want a treaty where the best 

interest of the child is what's at issue, and you 

21 interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with 

22 the child, where you have parents from both nations, 

23 pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations 

24 are saying. 

I mean, my experience out of that is Chile,

1 where, of course, we wanted to know what the law of 

2 Chile was and how the Chilean domestic relations judge 

3 understood the relations between the parents. That was 

4 important. 

And similarly, I think the Scottish judge 

6 should want to know the same thing about the courts 

7 deciding in the United States. And the same thing is 

8 true of the United States judge wanting to know about 

9 Scotland and so forth. 

I don't see how we're going to get harmony, 

11 in other words, unless you let appellate processes go 

12 forward, too. And -- and I don't know what the treaty 

13 drafters would have had in mind if they wanted some 

14 other regime. 

MR. CULLEN: Justice Breyer, it's not that 

16 we enter into these communications and agreements with 

17 any country. 

18  By ratifying this particular treaty and by 

19 the United States saying, we are going to ratify it with 

the United Kingdom or Scotland or Brazil, we are saying 

21 much more than there's no comity here. We are saying we 

22 trust this other country to do the right thing. 

23  And that's, Justice Breyer, why we lodged 

24 the Scottish papers because the Scottish papers should 

satisfy you that Scotland was very satisfied there was a

1 valid return. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: I trust Scotland to do the 

3 right thing. And I think, to help Scotland do the right 

4 thing, it would be nice for Scotland to know what 

American judges have decided. That's all. And the 

6 reverse is equally true. 

7  MR. CULLEN: But the -- but it doesn't 

8 matter, Justice Breyer, because there's been a vacatur. 

9 There is no underlying decision. The child is back in 

Scotland, and now, one court can proceed. 

11  And in fact, by continuing -- Justice 

12 Breyer, by continuing the litigation, the effect of that 

13 is to undermine the treaty because the idea behind the 

14 treaty, particularly for military families, was to 

enable mobility. 

16  And by having ongoing litigation in the 

17 United States, the only thing we can guarantee this 

18 Court is this child is not coming to America until the 

19 litigation is over. So now, we're talking two, three, 

four years. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, can I just --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cullen, may I ask -- I'm 

23 trying to figure out what exactly your argument is. So

One -- you can tell me it's neither, I 
suppose. But one is this case is moot because there's 
no practical way to enforce any relief that's ordered by 
the Eleventh Circuit, all right? That's what I came in 
thinking your argument was. 

The second is -- is just no, it's just 
improper for the Eleventh Circuit to enter any order 
granting relief. 

So which is it? Is it that it's improper to 
enter any order at this point? Or is it -- you know, 
you can enter an order, but it's just not going to be 
enforced, and, therefore, this case is moot? 

MR. CULLEN: Justice Kagan, I'm going to 
take your third non-offered offer. 

(Laughter.) 
MR. CULLEN: And the answer is because the 

Constitution tells us there is no case. We cannot -- we 
cannot -- and I see Justice Alito --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't understand the third 
option. 

MR. CULLEN: Because -- because Article 3 
says we have to be able to grant some effectual relief 
in the judicial process. And since the Mills case in 
1895, right up to the Knox case this year, this Court 
has always said it's effectual relief in this judicial 
process.

1  So I have to pose the question, Justice --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then you seem to be 

3 saying that if the -- if the law does not permit the 

4 issuance of a particular kind of order, and that's what 

the -- THE plaintiff is seeking -- or that's what the 

6 appellant is seeking, then the case is moot. Is that 

7 your argument? I thought that's a merits question, not a 

8 mootness question. 

9  MR. CULLEN: It is a mootness question 

because it goes -- it's not -- it goes to the heart of 

11 Constitutional mootness. It goes to the issue of this 

12 may be uncomfortable, and this may be inconvenient, but 

13 once we've effected a remedy -- the only remedy, Justice 

14 Alito, under this treaty -- and once it's been carried 

out and once that child is home in Scotland, no matter 

16 what another court does in this judicial process, it can 

17 have no effect on the Scottish custody proceeding --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cullen, are you 

19 saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no 

rereturn order? Is that what you're saying? Whether 

21 the -- whether the return order was wrong or right, 

22 there can be no rereturn? 

23  MR. CULLEN: There can be no rereturn. 

24 There was a lawful order returning the child to the 

jurisdiction of Scotland.

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: And there could be no 

2 rereturn by the terms of the treaty. So this is an 

3 argument that hangs on what the treaty's terms say; is 

4 that correct? 

MR. CULLEN: Well, it is -- it is very 

6 textual, which is, of course, what surprised us so much 

7 in the government's position in this case because, as 

8 you know, Justice Kagan, the last time the government 

9 presented this position, they said exactly the opposite 

in Janakakis. Now, they tried to deal with this, 

11 Justice Kagan, in this footnote in their brief saying, 

12 well, we touched briefly on this point before. They 

13 didn't touch briefly on it. 

14  They said, in absolute terms, that nothing 

in the Convention -- so this is our government talking 

16 about the text, and we may give some compelling 

17 deference to -- to the government on text, but we don't 

18 give any deference to them we say or what the founding 

19 fathers meant. 

But with respect to this Janakakis case, the 

21 government said nothing in the Convention requires 

22 courts or other authorities -- and this was in Greece --

23 to give binding effect to any judgment --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: It does equate, but now, 

you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength.

Official 

1  MR. CULLEN: Good. 

2  (Laughter.) 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: And I think it was back 

4 just as well, let me see, because Justice Ginsburg -- I 

see the point of her answer now. 

6  It's really fact-specific to this case that 

7 you're talking about. So it just happens that the child 

8 has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months. 

9 And so the question of current habitual residence where 

they have been there for 18 months is a question of 

11 what's been happening over these 18 months, and what 

12 happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to 

13 do with it. 

14  And the most that the court of appeals could 

say is that it was resident in America 18 months ago, 

16 and that's no more relevant than saying that the cow 

17 jumped over the moon or some other thing. Is has -- is 

18 that the point? Is that the point? Is that the point? 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought 

that's what you were saying. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the point -- yes, 

22 that is the point. Okay. If that's the point --

23  MR. CULLEN: I would say it is the point 

24 because the Convention says it's the point. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the Convention

1 doesn't know whether it's 18 months or 6 months or what 

2 counts as habitual residence, does it? 

3  MR. CULLEN: The Convention says you look to 

4 the place where the child was located immediately prior 

to the --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but you have 

7 to decide whether that's the habitual residence. And it 

8 seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that 

9 what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do 

with whether the child is now a habitual resident of 

11 Scotland. 

12  And what I want to know -- and I'm not going 

13 to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's 

14 not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12 -- but I 

want to know what source I look to, to show that you're 

16 right and that what happened 18 months previously has 

17 nothing to do with the child's habitual residence as of 

18 the place where he has lived for 18 months. 

19  MR. CULLEN: Well, habitual residence being 

fact and law --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Fact. 

22  MR. CULLEN: Right? 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Yours is fact. I want to 

24 know what I look to, to find out that fact.

1 the Mills decision, and the Mills decision that tells 

2 you, under Article 3, a case is moot when the issues 

3 presented are no longer live and the parties lack a 

4 legally cognizable interest in their -- the live issue 

of habitual residence 18 months ago is dead. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So everything turns, 

7 under your view, on whether or not the district court 

8 gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the 

9 mother in this case decides to stay in the United States 

until the U.S. proceedings are done. 

11  The incentives if you prevail are for the 

12 custodial or the parent with control over the child to 

13 leave immediately. Even after a motion has been 

14 filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's 

not a stay. Get on the first plane out, and then you're 

16 home free. That seems, to me, to be a very unfortunate 

17 result. 

18  MR. CULLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, we don't 

19 agree, and here's why: We don't agree because, 

initially, the district court judge did not order the 

21 instantaneous departure of this child. She only did 

22 that after considering the motion to stay. It was 

23 not --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I know, but 

the point is that the other side says that the decision 

53

1 was wrong. 

2  MR. CULLEN: And it's --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- you know, 

4 most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to 

immediately say, after they have issued a decision, 

6 well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and 

7 therefore, I'll issue a stay. 

8  (Laughter.) 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there has to be 

at least a period before somebody can go up to the court 

11 of appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's 

12 happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the 

13 parent with control of the child is trying to find the 

14 first flight out, and once she does, it's all over. 

MR. CULLEN: It is all over once -- once the 

16 doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in 

17 Scotland, unless the plane turns around and comes back 

18 again, it is all over. And it --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I understand your 

answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on 

21 the proposition that, under the Convention, that once 

22 the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer 

23 has any power to order the child to come back; is that 

24 right? 

MR. CULLEN: Yes, Justice Alito.

4 There is no discussion in either of those opinions of 

the -- how the Convention -- what the Convention says on 

6 this question. 

7  MR. CULLEN: Well, the Beckier case goes 

8 back to Mills and relies on Church of Scientology and 

9 Mills --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, no. This is not a --

11 this is not a question about our general standard of 

12 mootness. This is a question of the meaning of the 

13 Convention. As I understood your argument to Justice 

14 Kagan, your position is dependent on a particular 

interpretation of the Convention. And I don't see any 

16 discussion of that interpretive issue in either of those 

17 opinions. 

18  MR. CULLEN: Well, this is the -- this is 

19 what makes constitutional mootness uncomfortable because 

it's an answer that Justices and judges typically don't 

21 want to hear, but it is the answer. The answer is there 

22 is nothing left to be done. The one remedy has been 

23 effected, Justice Alito, and what -- what brings all

other sending countries involved could order the child 

6 back, this case would not be moot; is that correct? 

7  MR. CULLEN: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: And you -- but you say that 

9 the Convention, in effect, says exactly the opposite; 

once the child leaves, there can't be an order requiring 

11 their return. 

12  MR. CULLEN: Right. And there would be a 

13 problem, Justice Alito, if we didn't have the motion to 

14 stay concept, if we didn't have all of the alternatives 

for district courts to enter different types of motions 

16 to stay. What -- what at least will happen from the

2  MR. CULLEN: The mother can get on the plane

4 particular case, probably because she had to come in 

under humanitarian parole, there was considerable 


6 urgency in this case. And it was a very young child, 


7 and the Scottish court was ready to beseize the 


8 jurisdiction.

treaty was telling her to do? Get the child back to 

11 Scotland, I found habitual residence in Scotland, and 

12 let's let Scotland move forward.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

17  MR. MANELY: Thank you, Your Honor. 

18  With that, I'd like to touch on four points. 

19 First of all, these courts have inherent authority to 

order the child be brought back. It is a way of 

21 reversing the wrong decision of the district court. 

22 When we are talking about the object of the Convention, 

23 it is, in part, rapid return, but that is kind of 

24 putting the cart before the horse. 

The critical issue is where is the

1 appropriate habitual residence of the child, and that is 

2 the place that then needs to make the custodial 

3 decision --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what he says is that, 

after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will 

6 decide where is the habitual residence of the child. We 

7 are now in August of year 2, and what happened before 

8 January of year 1 is now totally irrelevant. So even if 

9 the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 

the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the --

11 when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual 

12 residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any 

13 attention at all to that American decision because it is 

14 not relevant. 

That, I take it, to be his argument, which 

16 depends on the long time, 18 months. So what is your 

17 response? 

18  MR. MANELY: I think that may well be his 

19 argument. I disagree with it entirely. As was pointed 

out earlier, courts are quite used to having children 

21 have to transfer from one place to another. The closest 

22 case on point I can think of --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was the purpose 

24 of the Convention, was to cut that out. That's the 

whole reason for the Convention, that they wanted to

1 stop the shuttling of children. 

2  Do you -- are you aware of rereturn? 

3 Your -- your thesis is that the -- that, now, the court 

4 of appeals could tell the district judge, you were 

wrong. And then the father, armed with that, can go and 

6 get a rereturn order from the Scottish court under the 

7 Convention. 

8  Have there been instances under the 

9 Convention, was this question of rereturn -- is rereturn 

authorized, assuming that there was a valid return 

11 order, at least valid when it was entered and when the 

12 child was returned --

13  MR. MANELY: Your Honor --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the incidence of 

rereturn under the Hague Convention? 

16  MR. MANELY: There are no cases because we 

17 don't run into this problem, quite frankly. And -- and 

18 rereturn is a catch phrase that was created here. 

19 Bringing the child back would be a part of the court's 

inherent authority -- part of the district court or the 

21 court of appeals' inherent authority, and it's the basis 

22 upon which Scotland has the child in the first place. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there a Spanish 

24 case? 

MR. MANELY: I'm sorry?

3  MR. MANELY: There is a Scottish custody 

4 case pending --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not a Scottish, Spain, a 

6 case from Spain. 

7  MR. MANELY: A Spain -- a Spanish case, yes, 

8 Your Honor, there is. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where the child was, in 

fact, returned when --

11  MR. MANELY: The child was sent to Poland 

12 based upon the trial court's decision in that case, and 

13 the child returned from Poland, based upon the Supreme 

14 Court of Spain's decision in that case. So there is a 

confusion between --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the child returned? 

17 Or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be 

18 avoided? Was the child returned by Poland? 

19  MR. MANELY: Well, I don't know, ultimately, 

if the child was returned from Poland, so much as the 

21 Supreme Court --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- see, that's the 

23 whole problem, is that you -- you're going to have rival 

24 decrees of two countries, which is what -- exactly what 

the Convention was meant to avoid.

1  MR. MANELY: Except that we never have. 

2  I mean, this is a fairly young convention. 

3 We haven't had it that long. But we never have had that 

4 problem before. 

It's been easy enough -- Ohlander v. Larson 

6 out of the Tenth Circuit is a great case to look at, for 

7 where the United States has been very giving in sending 

8 children back. We have not had this problem before. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is an 

amici brief here that says that the Scottish courts will 

11 not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child 

12 at the time of the removal. The amici brief that was 

13 filed with us yesterday, if I'm reading it correctly, 

14 suggests that the court believes that hasn't been 

settled in English law; is that correct? 

16  MR. MANELY: That's my reading of it as 

17 well, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That that -- so that 

19 proposition is not as settled as the amici suggests? 

MR. MANELY: Correct. I think they are 

21 waiting to see what -- what we want to do. 

22  So you've got Villamonte v. Marquez, where 

23 the issue there is it's not moot because it's possible 

24 an extradited person could one day voluntarily return, 

so it's not moot.

1  But in this case, there is nothing 

2 preventing the mother, who filed the case before the 

3 district court and is still a party to the case, from 

4 voluntarily returning. That enough is -- is enough to 

survive this --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that sounds 

7 awfully speculative and conjectural. That doesn't 

8 sound -- whether you're analyzing it under standing in 

9 the first instance or mootness later, that doesn't sound 

to be the sort of concrete injury that's required. 

11  MR. MANELY: The concrete injury has to do 

12 with the habitual residence determination in the 

13 district court, which switches if the appellate court 

14 reverses and grants habitual residence here and orders 

the child be brought back. That is the concrete 

16 interest. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

18  The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
