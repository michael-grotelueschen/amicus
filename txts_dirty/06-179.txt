 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-179, Riegel v. Medtronic, 

Inc.

 Ms. Zieve.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether Section 

360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendment to the Food, 

Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts State law claims seeking 

damages for injuries caused by a device that received 

pre-market approval. Medtronic's view of the pre-market 

approval process is that it results in an FDA decision 

that a particular device must be designed, labeled, and 

manufactured in a particular way. This view is 

incorrect, and so I want to talk -- begin by talking 

about what pre-market approval is and what it isn't. 

PMA is FDA's permission to market a Class 3 device. The 

manufacturer PMA device develops the design and chooses 

the -- choosing it on its own. After the company 

submits the application, the FDA evaluates it, based on 

information submitted, but it does no independent

testing, no product development, no comparison with 

other products to see if this one is as good as or 

better than existing products -- or even if it's the 

best that it can be.

 If the information submitted by the company 

meets the statutory standard, reasonable assurance of 

safety and effectiveness, the FDA grants PMA, thus 

permitting the device to be sold. So the FDA approves 

the design and labeling chosen by the manufacturer, but 

the agency doesn't require the manufacturer to choose --

to make those choices.

 Once on the market, a PMA device may prove 

to be unsafe, because very often problems and hazards 

come to light only after the device is in widespread 

use. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that situation 

addressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert 

the FDA to new information and at least file annual 

reports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market 

approval if they think these problems require it to do 

so?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, yes and no. The 

requirement about submitting adverse event reports and 

the annual report are intended help the FDA to monitor 

the device after it's on the market. But the

responsibility and the opportunity to improve the design 

or labeling or to initiate a recall is really on the 

manufacturer in the first instance, because the 

manufacturer is the first one to learn about the 

problem. The FDA has a more passive role. The FDA 

receives the information that the manufacturer sends to 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the manufacturer 

wants to make what you call an improvement? Can it 

simply market the product with that improvement without 

further FDA action?

 MS. ZIEVE: Depending on whether it is a 

design or labeling change, the answer is different. For 

a labeling change, some changes can be made prior to FDA 

approval. For design changes, any change that affects 

safety and effectiveness can't be made without a further 

submission to the FDA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it is designed to 

improve safety and effectiveness?

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right. And in that way a 

PMA device is no different from the 510(k) device that 

this Court considered in Lohr, because with respect to 

those devices as well, any change that would have a 

significant effect on safety and effectiveness has to 

await a new submission and a new --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right, but those devices 

had not been -- they were just grandfathered. They had 

not been specifically approved as safe and effective by 

the FDA. Right?

 MS. ZIEVE: Right. But the question isn't 

what the level of pre-market scrutiny is. The question 

is what requirements are imposed on the manufacturer at 

the end of the process when the device enters the 

market.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, before that decision 

is reached, let me ask you this -- under State law, 

either generally or specifically under the law of the 

State that you are trying to invoke here, does the jury 

-- does the finder of fact weigh the potential risks of 

injury and illness against the probable benefits to the 

health of the patient? Is that one of the things the 

jury does? In other words, suppose this was a very 

important device, but it had a one percent risk. Does 

the jury consider that when it determines whether that's 

been negligently sold?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, the standard in New York 

is whether the product is unreasonably hazardous. I 

think the term unreasonably --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Alright, now isn't that 

exactly what the FDA measured in the PMA process? The

FDA is specifically charged with weighing the risks 

against the probable benefits.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right. And in that way, 

the State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the jury is doing the 

same thing that the FDA did.

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. And as this Court said in 

Lohr and in Bates, when the State law mirrors the 

Federal law, there is no preemption.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that was under 

the expedited 510(k). That's different than PMA, 

because in PMA there's a specific weight.

 MS. ZIEVE: What the FDA does before the 

product reaches the market is different in the PMA 

context as opposed to 510(k). But when it comes to 

comparing the State and Federal requirements -- I think 

is what you are getting at -- Lohr's analysis and the 

analysis in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, Inc. didn't turn 

on how rigorous the FDA requirements are, but are they 

parallel to the State requirements.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the State 

requirement there? I mean, what was the Federal 

requirement there? It was simply that the device had 

been on the market before the law became effective. 

Right?

MS. ZIEVE: The design requirement in Lohr?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MS. ZIEVE: It had to be substantially 

equivalent, safety and effectiveness, to a device that 

was grandfathered in, that's right. But Medtronic 

argued in that case that it couldn't change the design 

of that product without filing another submission to the 

FDA, and that that was why there's preemption, and 

that's the same argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the point is that 

the -- to follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, the 

point is that the FDA in Lohr had never made a 

determination of weighing the risks against the 

benefits, as they do for the issuance of PMA's. And so 

the jury was not replowing the same ground that the FDA 

had already plowed in Lohr.

 MS. ZIEVE: I don't think that goes to 

preemption under 360k(a) which looks for a specific 

Federal requirement, a State device requirement, and 

then looks at -- compares the two to see if there are 

counterparts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how does it -- how 

does it compare with another process that the FDA looks 

at very closely, I think even more closely than new 

devices -- new drugs. New drugs also go through a very

long testing period. Is there -- and the FDA gives its 

approval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it 

has risks people didn't understand and there's a tort 

suit. Is there -- is there a defense to the 

manufacturer, "I followed to the letter the permission 

that the FDA gave me"?

 MS. ZIEVE: Under the common law of most or 

all States, compliance with Federal law is a defense on 

the merits, and it is not usually dispositive, but in 

some States -- in some States it is.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would certainly be 

at least the same here, right? That compliance with the 

Federal law would be a defense on the merits.

 MS. ZIEVE: Absolutely. I don't think that 

the PMA is irrelevant to the tort suit. It's just not 

sufficient for preemption --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a reason -- as I 

understand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect 

to new drugs. Is there a reason to treat the two 

differently? For new medical devices and the new drugs?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, there is no express 

preemption provision in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 

with respect to drugs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's the difference. 

So the question -- what does the express preemption

provision mean?

 MS. ZIEVE: Right. But I think in trying to 

figure out what the express preemption provision means, 

it's actually useful to consider why there's none for 

drugs and there is one for devices. And the reason is 

because drugs were regulated by the FDA since 1938. 

Devices weren't regulated until 1976. So, in those 

intervening 38 years, States had stepped in and started 

to do some regulation on their own to fill that 

regulatory void.

 California is the most notable example, and 

the one discussed the legislative history. So, when 

drafting the medical device amendments and coming up 

with the system for pre-market scrutiny, the question 

arose, well, what about California? What about other 

States that are regulating good manufacturing practices? 

Or California had a PMA scheme of its own. And so the 

legislative history makes clear that Congress, faced 

with this dilemma, decided California shouldn't be able 

to continue to regulate devices in that way. It 

shouldn't be able to pre-screen devices once the FDA had 

stepped in and filled the Federal void.

 And that's why you didn't need an express 

preemption provision for drugs. The States weren't 

doing that in 1938, but because the government -- the

Federal government waited so long to regulate devices, 

it was necessary to say what are we going to do about 

these State regulations?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that mean that, under 

the Food and Drug regulation, the States can issue their 

own regulations that contradict the Federal approval?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, they couldn't issue 

regulations that contradict the Federal approvals 

because of the express preemption provision. But 

without it, California --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. I'm talking about 

drugs. Not medical devices. You say that --

MS. ZIEVE: That would be a conflict 

preemption question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, you can 

comply with both. It's just additional -- you have to 

go further to comply with the State rule, so there's no 

conflict. It's easy to --

MS. ZIEVE: Well, if there's no conflicts, 

then there would be no preemption.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then the States can issue 

regulations that go beyond -- beyond what the FDA says 

in drug matters? I would be surprised if that's the 

case.

basis for preemption with respect to drugs is conflict 

preemption. So, if your question incorporates if 

there's no conflict, then there would no preemption. 

But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that the only basis 

here? Conflict -- there's no conflict? It's all okay 

under the Medical Devices Act?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, here, if there is not a 

specific Federal requirement that is the counterpart to 

a State requirement, there is no preemption. That's 

what -- that's the language that Congress wrote and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They can add additional 

requirements so long as -- and I suppose they can do 

this by regulation -- so long as these additional 

requirement dos not prevent complying with the Federal 

requirements? So long as there's no conflict, the 

States can add additional requirements under the Medical 

Devices Act? That's not my understanding of it.

 MS. ZIEVE: No. That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is field preemption, 

isn't it?

 MS. ZIEVE: No, I don't think so. The --

when the FDA has spoken directly to a question, then the 

State cannot impose requirements that are different from 

or in addition to what the FDA has said.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Take a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Take a concrete situation 

where the FDA is asked: We'd like to make this 

improvement. And the FDA says no, we don't think that 

enhances safety. And then there's a tort suit based on 

the failure to make that improvement. Wouldn't the FDA 

rejection of permission to make that improvement --

wouldn't that at least be preemptive?

 MS. ZIEVE: If the -- if 360k(a) ever 

preempts tort claims, I think that would be a situation, 

but if -- only the tort claim is -- is specific in that 

way, that you -- that the company failed in its duty of 

care because it didn't design the device in the specific 

way that the FDA had rejected.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not the way I 

would -- the jury has to say that?

 I mean, in fact --

MS. ZIEVE: Well, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In fact, that's what's 

going on, but it could have been safe if -- if they had 

made the change that the FDA rejected. But the case 

goes to the jury and that's, in fact, what's going on.

he -- had he made this change, it would have been safe, 

but he didn't make the change and, therefore, you, 

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, should hold the 

company liable.

 MS. ZIEVE: But if that's the theory of the 

case, I think that's basically the one-inch/two-inch 

hearing aid fix of Justice Breyer's example in Lohr.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it just --

MS. ZIEVE: But most tort claims --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It just has to be the 

theory of the case. We have to look at each jury 

verdict and decide whether that was the basis on which 

the jury made the decision.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, it's -- it's not actually 

that hard, because most tort claims are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your response 

was it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no, 

you cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you 

must make it in order to make this device safe.

 I thought your answer to me was that the FDA 

regulation -- the FDA's action in refusing to allow the 

change to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't 

give it to a jury to second-guess that determination by 

the FDA.

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. That's right. And I

thought, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's under State law, but 

you -- you don't say that Federal preemption requires 

that; you say that by the grace of New York State, that 

may be the situation, but New York State can change that 

law, as far as you're concerned, right?

 MS. ZIEVE: Can -- I'm sorry. Can change 

which law?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: New York State can let it 

go to the jury, despite -- despite what the FDA has 

done. You've said that it's simply a defense under New 

York State law and the law of most States. But it 

doesn't have to be a defense under New York State law.

 MS. ZIEVE: I think that's a different 

point. Generally --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that's the point 

Justice Ginsburg was implying.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I was asking you, if it 

was -- as a matter of Federal law, if the FDA says --

rejects.

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a proposed change, can 

a State court say, well, we think the FDA was wrong in 

rejecting that, so we're going to let it go to the jury.

Federal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA 

says you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer 

wants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. In a situation where the 

FDA has said you are required not to market this 

specific device and the State -- the plaintiff is 

seeking to impose a common-law duty that you must market 

that specific design, then you would have counterpart 

State and Federal regulations, but the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the --

MS. ZIEVE: The relevance of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another variation -- the 

FDA says you must include X in this device or we won't 

give you the pre-market approval. And so the 

manufacturer puts X in, and then there's a lawsuit that 

wants to charge that putting X in made the device 

dangerous.

 Would the FDA's insistence that X be put in 

take X out of any State court's tort litigation? That 

is, wouldn't -- if the FDA says you must have it, a 

State court couldn't put to a jury whether you should 

have eliminated it?

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. I think that's Justice 

Breyer's two-inch hearing aid fix, when the Federal 

government says you must and the State law duty says

that you cannot.

 But the -- that's not how tort claims are 

litigated as a general matter. First of all, PMA's 

don't say you must have this design feature. There's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I thought 

that was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced. 

In other words, they don't require you to market a 

particular catheter. And you -- what I understood you 

to be arguing is that there may be a better design and 

that it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a 

particular design, even though they're allowed to; they 

don't have to.

 MS. ZIEVE: Exactly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They should have 

made the change to make it safer, right?

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right.

MS. ZIEVE: And if you look at --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if that's what 

happens, what, as a -- what's going to happen for 

patients at a time when your theory comes up, the 

manufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a 

better device; we don't want to risk these tort suits, 

so we're going to stop selling our old device that's 

been approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval

of the new device and that might take forever or at 

least a year, let's say. And what happens to patients 

in that year? They've got no device.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, first of all, if the 

device is reasonably safe and effective, then the 

company is just not going to stop marketing it because 

of tort suits. And we know that because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your theory is 

that although this device has been approved, here's a 

better one. And it's negligent on the manufacturer's 

part to market a device, even though approved by the 

FDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the 

risks.

 MS. ZIEVE: Right. But we know that 

manufacturers don't respond by taking devices off the 

market, because PMA has coexisted with tort suits since

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you want 

them to do if you think it's negligent for them to 

market the approved product? Don't you want them to 

take it off the market?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, I -- they should make 

their devices as safe as they can be. And if a tort 

suit points out that this device is not reasonably safe, 

then the manufacturer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not that it is 

not reasonably safe. It's that another design would be 

safer. And you think that's a basis for negligence 

because you say, yeah, the FDA approved it, but that 

doesn't mean they required the manufacturer to market 

that device.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right. And 360k looks to 

requirements. It's not a matter of policy what the 

effect of tort suits is. The question is what are the 

requirements imposed by the PMA, what requirements are 

imposed by State law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this is all a 

little unrealistic. It is not as though some expert 

agency of the State has conducted a very scientific 

inquiry and decided that there's something safer than 

what the FDA approved or that it's negligent to issue 

what the FDA approved.

 What's going on is simply one jury has 

decided that in its judgment, there was a safer device 

that should have been used; and because of the judgment 

of that one jury, the manufacturer is placed at risk in 

selling a device that scientists at the FDA have said is 

okay.

 I find that extraordinary.

drawn the line differently. But the line Congress drew 

was when there is a specific Federal requirement, we 

looked for a device counterpart State requirement. And 

where they don't exist, there is no preemption.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought that was 

something a little different than that. The question 

that I have which might be helpful to me, if you can 

answer it, is -- that's being serious about it -- I'd be 

helped by knowing what the specific design defect is 

that you claim? That is, in what respect was this 

catheter -- and I'd like you to refer to the details of 

the catheter -- in what respect, what material or what 

shape or what -- what it is about this catheter that you 

as the plaintiff think was designed defectively, if you 

can tell me?

 MS. ZIEVE: There's not a lot of discovery 

about the design of the catheter.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know. But you must have 

a theory.

 MS. ZIEVE: The general theory is that the 

design was unreasonably safe because the catheter should 

not have -- should have been strong enough --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is it about the design 

that you are saying is not safe? That is, you can't go 

into the court without having in your mind, as the

counsel, that some kind of specific thing that was wrong 

with this catheter, other than just using the words 

"design." I mean, how was it designed badly? What part 

of the design is not right?

 MS. ZIEVE: The strength of the balloon and 

the way in which --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are saying the material 

of the balloon should have been of a different material 

or a different thickness; is that right?

 MS. ZIEVE: Or designed to burst in a 

different way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What does that mean? How 

do you design something to burst?

 MS. ZIEVE: I don't know how you design a 

balloon. But there --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you don't know how to 

design the balloon, what are you basing the design claim 

on?

 MS. ZIEVE: As I said, the design claim in 

this case was not significantly developed. Perhaps it 

would help to talk about the design claim in Horn v. 

Thoratec, for example, which is another PMA --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the label --

that you're pressing? So you said you really don't know 

what the design defect was. How about the label? That

would be the other thing.

 MS. ZIEVE: The labeling claim is that the 

label was -- inadequately warned or was misleading 

because although at one place it lists among 12 

precautions not to inflate the balloon above the rate of 

burst pressure, which was eight, at another place it 

says to -- it has a chart that shows inflation up to 13 

atmosphere, and at another place in the instructions, it 

says inflate to the nominal pressure, which is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's just like 

a car speedometer. I mean, the speedometer goes up to 

120 miles an hour, but that doesn't mean you are 

supposed to drive it that fast.

 MS. ZIEVE: But the car doesn't come with a 

chart that shows you safe usage of up to 100 miles 

either. And the instructions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was Medtronic free to 

alter this label without the FDA's consent?

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. Under 814.39, Medtronic 

could make changes to strengthen the warnings or clarify 

the instructions without prior approval. And there's 

one other part of the label that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the citation for 

that?

 MS. ZIEVE: 21 CFR 814.39(d).

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me tell you why I asked 

my question, because I don't want to leave -- you to 

leave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your 

issue without your having a chance to see.

 What's worrying me is that, of course, it's 

a terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of 

accidents. And the lawyers are trying to help. So the 

lawyers will think, look, there's a problem here. There 

must be. My client was seriously hurt. And he's not 

supposed to be.

 And then they'll work backward from that and 

say well if he was hurt, there must be something wrong 

with the design.

 So every time there is an accident or 

something bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim 

and they gear up discovery.

 And in my mind, could Congress have intended 

that kind of thing when what they're trying to do is 

have a group of experts really look into this and decide 

whether it should marketed or not. That's what's 

bothering me. And that's why I would like you to 

respond to that.

 MS. ZIEVE: Of course, it -- I freely admit 

that at trial if the plaintiff couldn't articulate the 

design theory any better than I did here, the plaintiff

is not going to lose on the design claim. But there are 

other cases where there is quite a clear theory about 

what the design defect is.

 There are cases where the products have been 

recalled because of a design defect; and in those cases, 

could Congress have really intended to protect the 

manufacturer from liability? After all, the Dalkon 

Shield disaster where tons of people were hurt 

because -- women were killed and injured because of a 

design defect, was just infamous for the bill.

 I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think that the key central focus of this 

case was touched upon by Justice Kennedy's question. 

Congress made a decision that it wanted to balance 

reasonable safety and effectiveness of lifesaving 

devices with the availability of lifesaving devices to 

the public.

 They did so by vesting this responsibility

in the experts, the expertise, the judgment, and the 

processes at the FDA.

 And preemption of potentially conflicting, 

confusing, and burdensome State law requirements is 

essential to this scheme.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why, Mr. Olson, is it 

more essential to this scheme than the new drugs? I 

would think that if everything that you said about new 

devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs, 

because the testing procedures are much longer, are they 

not?

 MR. OLSON: They're similar, but they're 

also quite different, Justice Ginsburg. The principal 

difference is this preemption provision that is the 

fundamental issue in this case. Section 360k(a)(1), 

that similar provision was not put by Congress in the 

new drug --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there's an argument 

that what it was intended to do was to cut out State 

pre-market approval, where States like California came 

in when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't 

let the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like. 

Let's have a pre-market approval.

 And the argument is, as you well know, which 

was presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we

meant to do with the preemption provision. Nothing 

more.

 MR. OLSON: If there was such a State 

pre-market approval process, it would be something like 

the Federal process which would involve a very detailed 

application which would have everything about the 

design, the manufacture, and the warning labels in it. 

Then California would come up with different 

requirements, presumably or potentially, than what the 

FDA had decided was a reasonable balance between safety 

and effectiveness and availability. And so therefore, 

there would be different requirements.

 And, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his 

concurring and dissenting opinion in the Lohr case, if a 

State jury or a State court comes up with those 

different requirements, it is the same problem: 

Different States, different requirements under different 

circumstances.

 And it would be quite anomalous for Congress 

to have given more power to juries in individual ad hoc 

cases which don't do the weighing, Justice Kennedy --

they can't do the same amount of weighing because their 

focus --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the FDA 

hasn't done it? How are newly discovered flaws dealt

with? I mean, say where you have this catheter, and the 

FDA didn't look at the possibility of allergic reactions 

to the balloon plastic, and all of a sudden it turns out 

to be a serious problem.

 How can you say that that's preemptive?

 MR. OLSON: This is a continuous process. 

Information must be given by the manufacturer. There is 

a process by which doctors report consequences to the 

FDA. Citizens may report information. This is a 

continuous jurisdiction --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the manufacturer free 

to continue to sell the device after newly discovered 

risks --

MR. OLSON: Yes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- pending the FDA's 

acting on the same information?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy. And let 

me explain why I think that is important to this case.

 If the -- that information is then in the 

possession of the FDA. The FDA can suggest to the 

manufacturer -- it can require the recall. It can 

change warnings. It can do all of those things. But 

what it is doing, because it's continuously involved in 

the process --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It takes time for the FDA

to act. Let's assume that we know it's going to take 

six months for the FDA to do this. The manufacturer 

knows that there's a real problem. He can continue to 

sell in the face of the knowledge of the real problem?

 MR. OLSON: What I'm suggesting is that the 

FDA can act as promptly or as slowly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was asking you about the 

manufacturer's duty pending the FDA's action.

 MR. OLSON: It's dependent upon the 

manufacturer providing information to the one 

centralized agency --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, suppose the 

manufacturer did not provide information. Would the 

preemption nevertheless exist?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens, because in 

that case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: At least as a theoretical 

possibility, there could be a newly discovered risk that 

the FDA never knew about. And, nevertheless, the claim 

would be preemptive.

 MR. OLSON: Yes. And that's a judgment that 

Congress made, because with the -- the manufacturer then 

would be violating the law, failing to tell the FDA what 

was going on, perhaps comitting fraud, and be subject to 

criminal penalties, recall penalties, civil penalties,

and that sort of thing.

 The choice is, Justice Stevens, in that 

situation -- is to allow the agency that has the 

expertise, that has spent 1200 hours or so on this 

particular device, according to your opinion in the Lohr 

case, to make a judgment with respect to whether this 

product should be on the market or not.

 Because as I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, that still 

leaves the -- sort of the hiatus that Justice Kennedy's 

question was addressed to. And I -- I don't think I 

understand your answer to it.

 His question was what if the manufacturer 

has learned that there is -- that there's a problem that 

somebody hadn't anticipated? The manufacturer has told 

the FDA, and the FDA has not yet acted.

 Leave open the question of whether the FDA 

is slow or whether it just takes time, but there's a --

there's a hiatus here. And an injury occurs because of 

marketing that took place during the hiatus.

 Does preemption still apply?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it does.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. OLSON: And the reason for that, Justice 

Souter, is that someone must make a judgment. That --

the information that the manufacturer may have learned 

may be -- have some aspect of the safety or 

effectiveness of the device, but it still might be the 

best product available.

 As the government points out in its brief, 

there are some devices that are used in situations where 

a child might die.  There's a 50-percent mortality rate 

even with using the device. So there's got to be 

individual judgments with respect to variations of risk 

and safety and availability.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you know whether the PMA 

process in this case considered the design defects that 

the Petitioner seems to be relying on?

 MR. OLSON: Well, all -- no, I don't know 

the answer to that specifically, Justice Alito. But I 

do know -- and this is the application, itself, which is 

not, unfortunately, in the record, but is available 

through the FDA. It goes into elaborate detail with 

respect to the burst pressures. This device -- the 

label on this device -- and that is in the record at 

A-174 of the court of appeals appendix -- specifically 

says it shouldn't be inflated higher than a burst 

pressure or atmospheric risk pressure at 8 atmospheres. 

This one was inflated to 10 atmospheres, notwithstanding 

the label requirements.

So what -- what I am saying is that the 

elaborate nature -- everything in the label has to be 

approved by the FDA. The safety indications, the 

precautions, the hazards, the counter --

counterindications, and that sort of thing, there's a 

professional judgment there.

 My colleague says that well, it's not the 

FDA's not imposing requirements, because this is a 

design submitted by the manufacturer. Of course, it's a 

design submitted by the manufacturer. That's how 

devices are made.

 But the FDA examines every little part of 

that design -- the way it's manufactured, the way it's 

labeled, the way it's marketed, the way it's going to be 

used.

 And it can say no, change that part of it, 

or have you considered this? It's a dialogue between 

the manufacturer and the FDA.

 And then when the FDA is satisfied that it's 

reasonably safe and effective -- and the word 

"reasonable" is important. Nothing is perfectly safe. 

You can make a car weigh a hundred tons, and it might be 

perfectly safe, but balances have to be made, the same 

with drug devices. So --

PMA proceeding after it is concluded, can you tell 

exactly which design features and which risks the FDA 

has considered?

 MR. OLSON: No, I don't think you can. What 

you can do, Justice Alito, is examine -- and Justice 

Breyer's example of the two-inch versus one-inch wire in 

the Lohr case is a good example.

 The FDA will have examined, and presumably 

done its job, with respect to every aspect of the 

design, manufacture, and labeling and marketing of the 

device.

 Now, the choice is between that -- and I 

think Congress made this judgment quite consciously, 

because if a -- if a jury comes along in a particular 

case, examining a particular infant or a particular ill 

person and the facts of a particular situation, and says 

well, the device should have had a one-inch nail -- a 

wire, or it should have had a different tensile strength 

of the balloon, or something like that, then the 

manufacturer is in this dilemma.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't there -- to --

to take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA 

says this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be 

brought. But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a 

category of suits that is simply saying: Manufacturer,

you didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval?

 So we're kind of a backup to not doing 

anything in conflict with the FDA's approval. We're 

simply saying you didn't follow the labeling 

requirement, or you didn't follow the design submission 

that you --

MR. OLSON: I think if there's a violation 

of the requirements -- now, it's no -- there's no 

question that there are requirements, because every 

aspect of this approval incorporates the design and all 

of those things.

 If the manufacturer fails to comply with 

those requirements, that's a parallel suit that may be 

brought.

 Now, in this case, the negligent 

manufacturer -- a claim was made. It was dismissed on 

summary judgment, which was affirmed by the Second 

Circuit because there was no evidence to support it. So 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you agree 

that that was not preemptive.

 MR. OLSON: That was -- we agree that was 

not preempted, and -- and the court of appeals came to 

that same conclusion, but affirmed the district court 

that dismissed it on summary judgment because there was

no evidence to support it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would say the same 

thing for -- for design and labeling if the manufacturer 

did not do what the FDA approved?

 MR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 Now our -- the statute, I think, could not 

be more clear with respect to every aspect of what the 

Court talked about in the Lohr case. And I think that 

the analysis that this Court articulated in the Geier 

case having to do with the air bags, although that was 

an implied preemption and conflict preemption case and 

this is an express preemption case, is very 

illustrative.

 The Court went through an analysis of what 

manufacturers might do if they were required to put an 

air bag in the car when the Department of Transportation 

had decided that it wanted a little bit of play in the 

marketplace with respect to different types of 

restraints of individuals.

 And the Court made it very clear that if a 

trial court in Kansas or some other place decides that 

cars must be manufactured in a certain way, that's what 

would happen.

Transportation, which was considering all of these 

things and wanting to encourage innovation with respect 

to restraints -- the same thing is true here.

 We want in this country for devices to be as 

safe and effective as they possibly can be. But we 

don't want to discourage the marketing of products that 

might save our lives. And these are -- Class 3 devices 

are all in the category of life-threatening or 

life-saving devices here. So we want those available. 

They may not all be perfect. They may work in some 

situations and not work in other situations, but some 

expert, centralized, that can take into consideration 

all of those factors should be the place where that 

decision is made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, what about the 

argument that once you've got this very valuable 

pre-market approval, even though you could make that 

device safer, you have no incentive to do that. You 

have permission to market this product as is. Even if 

you know that there's a better way to do it, there's a 

disincentive to try to go through the process and make 

the change. Why should you, when you have carte blanche 

to continue without making the change?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think the real world 

answers that question. The manufacturers of these

products are always trying to produce better products 

that will be safer. They of course have to go through 

the process to justify to the experts at the FDA that 

they are indeed safe, or -- and the FDA then may make a 

judgment that the reasonableness -- if there is a much 

safer device that doesn't have the risks of the previous 

device, they can -- they can withdraw the approval of 

the previous device.

 But the FDA may at the same time say well, 

this one device might be safer under some circumstances 

but less safe under other circumstances. It might work 

in this critically ill patient, but not in this 

critically ill patient. So the marketplace of doctors 

and patients deserves to have more than one product out 

there, even though someone might decide this one is 

safer than the other one. That is the way Congress made 

this judgment. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the manufacturer finds 

just from its own laboratory experiments and not because 

of any data it's received from doctors and patients that 

there's a better way to do this, does it have the 

obligation to notify the FDA?

 MR. OLSON: I don't think so, 

Justice Kennedy. I think that there may be marketplace 

incentives and other things that would cause a --

someone in the marketplace to say I found a better way. 

Someone in the marketplace might say well, it might be 

better, but it might be prohibitively expensive. There 

are all kinds of those judgments, and I think that 

illustrates the point.

 The FDA is the right place for these 

decisions to be made and this balancing process to 

occur, because an individual ad hoc -- not 

scientifically trained jury that is not required to 

consider the consequences for the marketplace as a 

whole, cannot make those judgments.

 As conscientious as a jury might be, that 

judgment is in for that case and for that patient and 

might say well gee, it should have been done differently 

in this particular situation; a one-inch wire might have 

been better in this particular case. But the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, I'm 

looking at the Government's brief on page 4 which says 

that in the annual reports, the -- the manufacturer has 

to disclose unpublished reports of data from clinical 

investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies 

involving the device.

 So presumably that includes any nonclinical 

laboratory studies that the manufacturer itself 

conducted.

MR. OLSON: Yes. I believe that's true, but 

I think that was a slightly different point than 

Justice Kennedy's one; what was -- if it is the same 

point, I agree with you, that there is an elaborate 

process of information exchange from the manufacturer 

and from doctors and from all over with respect to these 

medical devices. It's described in considerable detail 

in about six pages in the court of appeals decision, and 

the Government's brief describes it quite thoroughly as 

well.

 That same balancing, the Government filed a 

brief last week in this Court in the Warner Lambert 

case, that this Court will be hearing, I think in 

January, which describes in even greater detail than it 

does in the brief filed here about that balancing 

process and the importance of the centralized --

for me on that? Is that a -- as soon as they get the 

information requirement, or is it an annual requirement

was referring to was an annual requirement --

requirements -- and I haven't -- can't give you the

exact citation, there's a lot of subparagraphs in these 

sections -- with respect to information that comes into 

the possession of the manufacturer that's pertinent to 

adverse consequences or effects of the device that must 

be given promptly to the FDA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, the other side 

says well, you know, these are all horribles but, in 

fact, we have had tort suits and manufacturers haven't 

taken their products off the market. This is all just a 

Chicken Little kind of a --

MR. OLSON: Well, I don't agree with that, 

Justice Scalia. In the first place, I don't think we 

know. Secondly, there are six of the seven circuits 

that have considered this case, found that those tort 

suits were preempted. So to the degree to which they 

are out there, there is one circuit in which they might 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But of course the FDA took 

this contrary position some years ago.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it did, and it -- and it 

learned from experience -- the unique experience that 

you described the FDA having, in your opinion in the 

Lohr case, has been brought to bear in this case; and 

there's a reasoned explanation for the FDA's -- the

position then -- there were some proposed regulations 

that are no longer on the table -- but there's a 

reasoned explanation by the agency that you said and 

quite correctly in my judgment had a unique experience, 

and unique capability of determining the effect of 

take -- State court suits on the process that it's 

involved in, and that's reflected in the Government's 

briefs that are filed in this case just earlier.

 The fact is that there are specific detailed 

requirements with respect to every aspect of the device 

that's approved by the FDA; and any jury, just like any 

regulatory body, Justice Breyer, will impose a different 

requirement. The fundamental that you asked about, 

what's the basis of this suit, there was some answer to 

it, but the fact is there's some effort to explain why, 

if it was designed according to the approval, by the 

FDA, that wasn't good enough.

 There was something wrong with that design 

that was approved. Something wrong with that label that 

was approved. And a jury at the end of the day will be 

expected then to render a different requirement by 

saying you are liable for damages because you did it the 

way the FDA approved.

 That is a State requirement which is a 

counterpart to the Federal requirement, and this -- and

Congress made it explicitly clear that any requirement 

that is different or in addition to the Federal 

requirement is preempted if it has to do with safety or 

effectiveness of the device.

 And if juries require products to be 

changed, they will by definition be either less safe or 

less available than the FDA has determined is in the 

best interests of the public according to the 

responsibility vested in them by Congress.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think it might be useful to begin by 

focusing on the consequences of Petitioner's argument 

that the PMA approval of an application does not result 

in requirements that are preemptive for purposes of the 

preemptive provision. Under Petitioner's view, the day 

after the FDA gave PMA approval to a particular device,

State legislatures or State regulatory agencies could 

adopt laws or regulations that would direct the 

manufacturer to manufacture or design the product or to 

give labeling that would conflict with what the FDA had 

just approved. And we don't think that Congress could 

have intended in enacting the express preemption 

provision here to allow State regulatory agencies or, 

even more so, individual juries that could very within a 

State --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that you 

conceded that there would be conflict preemption, that 

the States could not -- either through a State agency or 

through a jury -- come up with a requirement that would 

conflict with an FDA requirement.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But we think that the express 

preemption provision embodies that very important 

conflict, or maybe in this context it is best to 

conceptualize it as field preemption, of the things that 

are included within the application that is submitted to 

the FDA and the labeling.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Additional requirements are 

not necessarily conflicting requirements. You 

can comply with --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, that is -- that is 

definitely true.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is clear that Congress 

didn't want additional requirements.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's entirely 

correct, and if I could just elaborate on that --

JUSTICE BREYER: How are they not 

conflicting? Go ahead; go ahead -- elaborate.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, what I was going to say 

-- to elaborate on the point that I made, Petitioner 

concedes that if there is an FDA PMA requirement, the 

State may not impose its own PMA requirement; and that 

has to be correct, because in the State PMA approval, 

the State could withhold its approval unless the 

manufacturer changed the device or changed the labeling 

in some way to get it cleared through --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Everybody agrees that 

far, that the States were not to be in the business of 

issuing PMA's. The question is does the preemption 

clause mean any more than that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: But it's important to 

understand why. Congress was not concerned about the 

PMA in the abstract or as a process; it was concerned 

about what the consequences of requiring the 

manufacturer to go through the PMA process were. And 

that was precisely because the result of the State PMA 

process could be to impose different requirements. The

labeling should read differently --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it -- isn't it --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- the product should be 

differently.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you compared drugs, 

which -- I think you will -- you will concede -- go 

through a very arduous process, new drugs, why -- maybe 

you think that the same preemption applies there, 

although there's no preemption clause.

 MR. KNEEDLER: There is -- there is no 

express preemption clause there. One -- one possible 

explanation might be is that a -- that a device is a 

tangible concrete item, an item of commerce that is --

that has extensive design and planning and blueprints in 

a way that a drug doesn't quite have that same -- that 

same characteristic. I mean, like other -- like 

automobiles or something, that they have a tangible 

aspect and a long lead time in the design and 

manufacture.

 That may be one explanation for why Congress 

wanted to be especially firm about imposing preemption 

with respect to Federally approved devices.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was also a different 

Congress.

 MR. KNEEDLER: It was a different Congress.

preemption clause was put in the new Medical Device, did 

the government -- when was the government change? Was 

it 2004? The government's position, the FDA's position,

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the government filed a 

brief in -- in late 1997 taking a position that PMA 

approval did not -- did not have preemptive effect. 

That was issued together with FDA's issuance of a 

proposed rule to the same effect. FDA withdrew that 

proposed rule 7 months later. The government did not 

address this question again until 2004 in the brief 

you're referring to in the court of appeals.

entitled to considerable deference, FDA recognized that 

there would be a serious undermining of FDA's approval 

authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits, 

if a State jury could reweigh those -- the balance that 

FDA had struck in the new Medical Device --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a label is 

approved in a very specific form under PMA, and then a 

year later, it turns out, unforeseen by anyone, that 

doctors are just -- many good doctors are just reading 

it the wrong way and it's dangerous.

 Can the manufacturer continue to sell new 

devices with the same label pending the annual report?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I mean, let me just 

clarify.

 If the -- if the -- there are incident 

reports that -- that a manufacturer is supposed to give 

to FDA. There is often a difficult judgment as to 

whether the injury that is associated with a device is 

some problem of the device or whether it's some problem

as misleading for some reason. In that event, the 

manufacturer should apply to -- should submit what's 

called a supplemental PMA and request that the labeling 

be changed to clarify that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you could -- and the 

manufacturer continued to sell the device knowing that 

the label is being misconstrued by very good doctors 

pending FDA action?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Ordinarily, yes. If there 

was -- if there was a very serious risk to health and 

safety --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it's very serious.

 MR. KNEEDLER: In that event, FDA has 

variety of tools that it can take and so does the 

manufacturer. One of them is what's sometimes called a 

"Dear Doctor" letter, which is notification -- this is 

provided for under 360h(a) of the Act -- is a 

notification to physicians or other users of a product 

that there may be some previously unrecognized problem 

or misrepresentation or what could be misconstruction of 

the label.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the failure to give 

that notice subject the manufacturer to liability if the 

manufacturer continues to sell the device?

State tort liability, no. If there was -- if there was 

a situation where the manufacturer knew of a serious 

problem and did not report it to it FDA, that could 

subject the manufacturer to criminal penalties with 

respect to FDA for either misrepresenting or withholding 

information. But that's really the Buckman -- this 

Court's Buckman decision, that that's the relationship 

between FDA and the manufacturer, and that's the 

incentive.

 I think someone asked about what incentives 

does the manufacturer has. The manufacturer has a 

powerful incentive because of the criminal penalties and 

other sanctions that can be taken by FDA if -- if the 

manufacturer does not report something to the FDA. 

Plus, manufacturers have an important reputational 

interest, that they don't want to be seen to be flouting 

possible problems.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Kneedler, let me ask 

you to -- a textual question which perhaps would be 

better directed to counsel for the Petitioner, but let 

me get your take on it.

 If the only objective in the -- in the 

preemption clause were to preclude State PMA in addition 

to Federal PMA, there would have been no reason to 

include the phrase -- would there have been any reason

to include a preclusion of a requirement that is 

different from in addition to a preclusion of something 

which is in addition to?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- if it was just -- I 

think that's a good point. If it was just a question of 

going through a duplicative State PMA process --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "Addition to" would be --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. Right. Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. KNEEDLER: And also I think the FDA 

regulations promulgated when this was put out, soon 

after the '76 amendments were passed, I think reinforced 

the conclusion that -- and, in fact, there was a 

regulation that specifically talks about the application 

of general adulteration standards in a way that might 

require a specific label change to be made by a 

manufacturer, and we think that's basically precisely 

this lawsuit. It's the application of general tort law 

that would require the manufacturer or a standard of 

care under common law that would say that what the 

manufacturer had done specifically approved by FDA was 

-- was improper as a matter of State law. We think that 

that is in the teeth of the preemption provision. I 

think Justice Alito asked the question about the issue 

of whether FDA focused or didn't focus on a particular

aspect of the design. We don't think that a preemption 

test can really realistically turn on that. That would 

require extensive and intrusive inquiry into what FDA 

had done. We think that the best way to look at this is 

what the end product was; what was the application that 

was finally approved and the labeling associated with 

it, much like the filed rate doctrine. You look at what 

was put before the agency and what was approved, not 

what might have gone into -- into consideration.

 MS. ZIEVE: First of all, it's not our

requirements that were preempted to the extent they were 

different from or in addition to the Federal

it's -- it is broader than just --

line between those instances and the ones that you say 

are not preempted?

 MS. ZIEVE: Those were specific requirements 

for devices, and they had counterparts --

requirements, in other words, of positive law? They 

were State regulations?

 MS. ZIEVE: Addressed specifically to 

devices, and they had --

simply enactment of positive law versus jury award?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't the Court --

Lohr?

 MS. ZIEVE: The holding of Lohr didn't 

reject it. Five justices disagreed with me, and I don't 

think you need to agree with me on that point to find 

for me here. We talked about some examples that Justice 

Ginsburg offered, in which a State common-law duty could 

become so specific that it effectively imposed a State 

device requirement.

 I also want to correct the point that 

manufacturers can't make labeling changes without FDA 

approval. Again, 814.39(d) allows them to do so. And 

so the catheter's label, where it says "inflate the 

balloon gradually to higher pressure up to the rated 

burst pressure or until the stenosis resolves," the 

narrowing resolves, to me that's ambiguous as to whether 

you can go above the rated burst pressure. Medtronic 

could have clarified that instruction without running 

afoul of any FDA regulation.

 As for the FDA's current views, it is not 

actually correct that in Lohr the government gave weight 

to the FDA's amicus brief. The government gave weight 

to the FDA's regulation, 808.1(d). That regulation is

since Lohr was issued.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do I read in order to 

verify your statement that the -- that manufacturers can 

cure the label without FDA approval? Where do I find 

that?

 MS. ZIEVE: Without prior approval?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MS. ZIEVE: 814.39(d).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 MS. ZIEVE: After FDA approved the PMA, any 

of the listed changes can be placed into effect prior to 

the receipt of a written FDA order approving the PMA 

supplement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could -- I'm 

sorry -- I've been thinking about your example of 

ambiguity. You're saying it is ambiguous when they say 

you can inflate it up to the bursting pressure or until 

the blockage is cleared?

 MS. ZIEVE: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that 

obvious mean if the blockage is clear, you don't keep 

inflating it to the bursting pressure. You think that 

doctors read that as saying you can inflate it past the 

bursting pressure unless -- if the blockage isn't

cleared?

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. It says either one. It 

doesn't say up to a maximum. There is testimony from 

the doctor in this case that he thought that the label 

showed testing up to 13. And that based on the 

directions, he thought that going up to 10 was fine and 

that it was standard use among the cardiologists.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the 

label said eight is the bursting pressure?

 MS. ZIEVE: The rate at burst pressure, 

yeah.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MS. ZIEVE: I also want to mention -- we 

don't come to this case on a blank slate. We come to it 

in light of Lohr. The Court has already interpreted 

Section 360k(a). In finding no preemption in Lohr of 

any of the claims, the Court looked to the labeling 

regulation 801.109 was applicable to the device there. 

That is the same exact regulation that is applicable to 

the device here.

 If Medtronic's PMA device complies with 

801.109, then it is deemed to be not misbranded, but 

that is a moving target. What is adequate instructions 

for use changes as the manufacturer learns about use of 

its product in the real world. The same process for

Official - Subject to Final Review 

making design changes exists in this case as existed in 

Lohr.

 And on the State law side, we really are 

talking about identical State duties of care, which this 

Court said their generalities majority held that the 

generality of these duties left them outside the 

category of requirements that 360k envisioned to be with 

respect to the device.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Zieve.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m. , the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
