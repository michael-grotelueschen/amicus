 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-5306, Bowles versus Russell.

 Mr. Mancino.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MANCINO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner is before this Court because he 

followed an order of the district court. He filed his 

notice of appeal within the time authorized by the 

district court. It was only when the matter came before 

the court of appeals was it raised that the district 

court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day 

extension, although it specified a specific date rather 

than the 14 days in connection with the case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, it was authorized by 

the district court in the sense the district court put 

it on a piece of paper. It wasn't authorized because 

the district court had no authority to extend that.

 MR. MANCINO: The district court put it on 

there. When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a 

handwritten entry. There's no way of telling from the 

handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on

the docket on the same date because all you have is the 

handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by 

February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because 

normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't 

get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to 

file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with 

this. So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a 

directive from a court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you knew that 14 

days was the maximum because the motion asking for it 

cited and quoted from the rule.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, that -- we did cite from 

the rule. That is correct. When the order came out --

well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to 

allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just 

looking at the date, something had to be done. And Of 

course, we filed on one day before the end date --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if, what if the 

District Court gave you an extra month? Would your 

argument still be the same, that that -- because the 

court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, then you get into 

certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the 

circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant 

rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the

court gave to it. But here certainly this order is not 

unreasonable. It's certainly within the confines. And 

you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal 

by this date.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't a reasonable 

lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I 

made this motion for extension of time. The rule said 

14 days; this judge obviously made a slip. He 

miscalculated.

 Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule 

clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, 

say the judge probably made a mistake? So I better, if 

I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, looking back, that is 

probably correct. But looking at the order, and the way 

it came out, and the fact that you know, the -- the rule 

allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at 

the end date of the order, make sure the notice of 

appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that 

the party who is adversely affected by it may object on 

that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do 

this, what are you doing in connection with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't -- this is 

just a notice of appeal. Why would you -- why not file 

it the same day? In terms of looking at it from some

equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward 

the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the 

difference between the 14 days and the days allowed.

 What -- why, why would you delay filing the 

notice of appeal?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, the only reason for 

delaying it is obviously workload. And you don't want 

to get all briefs due within a short period of time, 

once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular 

case, because you have time limits for getting the 

record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of 

appeals going out -- not in this Court, but you know 

there were a number of appeals going on.

 And my normal practice is you know, file 

your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable 

appeals time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make -- does 

it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve 

provision? In other words, you've got the 30 days to 

file; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety 

valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've 

got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 

days. And now it seems to me that you're asking for a 

safety valve on top of a safety valve.

 And I wonder if there's some point where you

cut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I suppose at some point, 

someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to 

do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be 

unreasonable in connection with that. I think the safer 

thing is just to put the order down, say application, 

reopen the appeal time, granted.

 And then it would cause someone to go you 

know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is 

allotted under the rule in connection with the case. 

But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these 

circumstances we're only talking about three days to do 

an act. The act was done in two days.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but as soon as 

you start talking about an exception from the provision 

in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of 

applications and there are going to be a lot of 

different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last 

day. Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an 

indeterminate ruling.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, this is an equitable 

rule in itself. Because it allows something where an 

appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the 

circumstances, one, you were not notified, which 

obviously the court did. The other side's prejudiced --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well it is an equitable 

rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, that's -- that's once 

it's granted. It's not, the time limit is 180 days or 

the seven day after you received or became aware actual 

notice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but 

Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical. In other 

words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to 

provide a safety valve. But they also appreciated that 

you can't have it open-ended. So they did impose limits 

on the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to 

the 30-day rule. And it seems to me that you sort of 

restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if 

you allow further equitable departures from their, their 

rule.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I think in past cases 

the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but 

there are exceptions to deadlines. And the most 

compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at 

this particular time. And you know, it's coming from a 

judicial officer, it's not coming from someone 

miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time 

when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10 

days run in connection with the case. Because in civil

litigation you are not given any specific time to do an 

act. Criminal cases are a little bit different. You 

are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed 

in connection with a case. You do not have in civil, 

when you get your final order -- you know you have 30 

days to do it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mancino, your position 

here is that this rule is not jurisdictional.

 Now, what -- what are the consequences of 

that? I take it that that would mean that the court of 

appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether 

the matter has been filed too late?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I believe --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right? If the parties 

don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can --

can take a late, a late filing?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I think when the court 

of appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they 

should advise the parties in advance that they we're 

considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of 

time, and would you like to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, but I'm asking 

whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that? 

If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of 

appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?

MR. MANCINO: Correct. Because I think 

they've waived any -- the other side obviously has 

waived or forfeited any right to object to the -- you 

know, to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection 

or else it's, it will be okay?

 MR. MANCINO: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you need an objection 

or else it will be all right?

 MR. MANCINO: Yes. The objection in this 

case came -- you know, in the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That means that a rule --

that -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion 

of the district judge. If the district judge feels like 

giving a little more, this would be no control, unless 

the opposing side objects; is that right?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I -- I believe it does 

call for a timely objection by somebody to say 

something, rather than to just sit back and let it 

expire, knowing that someone did something that they 

should not do in connection with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you have problems 

at home. I don't know, you have an illness at home. 

And you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know 

it's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days?

Right? And opposing counsel being as friendly as they 

are nowadays --

(Some laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the other, the other 

side would say sure, take 20 days. Okay? So you 

prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs 

off on it, gives you 20 days. That's okay then, right?

 MR. MANCINO: Well I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the other side's 

agreed. He won't object on the court of appeals. And 

suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the 

rule says 14.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, there you have somewhat 

advance knowledge that you're doing something possibly 

contrary to a rule. But then you have the issue of once 

you do it, are you forfeiting your right to object and 

claim a deficiency in the process.

 Here you're only -- what you're doing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, that -- that 

may, that may be true of this stage; but 

Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what 

do we do if we write this case? How do we formulate 

this rule? And if we say that it's not jurisdictional, 

not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow 

the hypothetical that he puts to you.

MR. MANCINO: Well, I believe you can come 

up with all sorts of scenarios. What I think is the 

thing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why we're wondering 

how to write the opinion.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MANCINO: And where did the litigant 

reasonably rely upon an order of the court, which 

apparently the court had authority to issue, regardless 

of the court making a mistake or doing something 

intentionally --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the person who did the 

reliance was you, I guess?

 MR. MANCINO: Yes, that's correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it correct that --

who -- was this litigant represented by counsel during 

the period when he didn't get the notice of the 

September 9 order?

 MR. MANCINO: Yes. I filed the habeas 

petition. I did anything in connection with the case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So neither the, neither 

the prisoner nor you received any notice of the first 

goof up?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, the first -- well, we 

received notice of the judgment on the merits. Then we

filed a motion to alter judgment or for a new trial. It 

was not, the order overruling the motion to alter or 

amend judgment or the motion for a new trial date was 

not received. And the clerk's docket showed it wasn't 

mailed out.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.

 MR. MANCINO: But in the, in that court, 

there was a transitioning to this electronic filing, 

which not everybody was set up at that particular time; 

so apparently the order may have only gone to -- on the 

electronic filing system to those who were set up, and 

we were not set up on that thing. But the court still 

had the obligation to send it out. The court found that 

the clerk did not send it out. The clerk found that, or 

the court found that we did not have notification. And 

the court found that the other side is not prejudiced by 

any application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would your -- would 

your proposed exception, does it work the other day? I 

mean, let's say the district court entered this order 

and set a date certain for you to file the notice of 

appeal, and only gave you seven days on his count rather 

than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other 

words within the 14 days given under the rule.

 Would you be out of luck because of what the

district court set out in its order as what's binding, 

as opposed to what the resume says? Or could you rely 

on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?

 MR. MANCINO: Well I would believe you could 

then argue that the rule says that, the judge was wrong 

in -- you know -- in truncating your appeal time to file 

the appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why wouldn't the 

same approach work the other way? The rule says 14 and 

the judge was wrong to give you more?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, because the exceptions 

to all of these time deadlines, you have cases from this 

Court where people untimely file a motion for a new 

trial. A new trial motion by rule has to be timely 

filed in order to toll your time. And there have been 

cases where the motion for new trial has been untimely 

filed. The other side didn't say anything. And then 

when the ruling is made, the appeal is filed within the 

appropriate time.

 And this Court has sanctioned that procedure 

in connection. I see no difference here, where a 

litigant before a court, the court issues an order, you 

look at the order. And you abide by the order in 

connection with the case.

 They do have a reasonable reliance in the

case. And in looking back later on, in connection with 

the -- the issue, in connection with the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know sometimes, 

sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case 

that they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.

 MR. MANCINO: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes in reliance 

on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to 

the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no 

jurisdiction here; too bad.

 MR. MANCINO: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the court said 

it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the 

district judge. District judges make mistakes.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, that's a whole -- I 

believe that's a whole different scenario than presented 

here. That goes to the subject matter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's even worse, it seems 

to me. I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial 

and so forth.

 MR. MANCINO: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But if it's jurisdictional, 

we have to say, you know, too bad. Yes, you were misled 

by the judge. In reliance on the district judge, you 

expended a lot of time and money, but there was no

jurisdiction. And that's the end of the matter.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, the rule I always 

remember from law school is that parties cannot 

voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not 

have it. And the court, at any point, if they do not 

have subject matter jurisdiction, is free to dismiss the 

case whether it's at trial level, the appeal level, or 

whatever.

 This is not that situation. Obviously, the 

court by the rule could look into this matter. The 

court by the rule could grant relief in connection with 

this matter. It's a question whether the three days --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I know I could find this 

out by looking at a calendar. Do you remember what day 

of the week February 24th was, or 26th?

 MR. MANCINO: I believe --

JUSTICE STEVENS: We don't have a weekend 

problem, do we?

 MR. MANCINO: I believe it was not -- I 

don't believe it was a weekend, no.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked at this. There's 

a time start. And I think it might be the time stamp 

when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal.

 But -- but something you said at the outset 

prompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the

time runs from $14 days after the date when the district 

court's order is entered.

 MR. MANCINO: When it's entered. That's 

correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And was there a submission 

or an implication in your remarks that you thought that 

the order was not entered until three days later?

 MR. MANCINO: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an entry -- is 

there a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?

 MR. MANCINO: No. It's a handwritten one 

that doesn't say anything --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that it's a 

handwritten one. But that that -- that shows how long 

he has to appeal. is there a date when the order was 

put on the docket? Does that show on this sheet?

 MR. MANCINO: No. There's nothing from the 

clerk indicating -- on the docket there is, but nothing 

on the document that was sent, because the document only 

was sent -- it was just handwritten over the -- on top 

of the motion, so there was no way of telling when it 

was entered. Because you look back at the history of 

this case, when the court dismissed the original 

petition, the court had a date on it. It was only 18 

days later that it was actually entered by the clerk,

mean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my 

calendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was. You 

don't remember. 2/10, February 10, 2004, what day of 

the week was it?

 MR. MANCINO: That I cannot answer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It looks like it was the 

middle of the week. So maybe there were one or two 

weekends. So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he 

didn't know how to count the weekend rule.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, what I think was done --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which may not be 

jurisdictional, the weekend rule.

 MR. MANCINO: What I believe is that this 

was sent out by mail. So they had, you know, the 

three-day mail rule, and that's how you came to the 14 

days in connection with the -- put in the 17-day limit 

on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe Arabic numerals 

aren't jurisdictional either.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They're not. A numeral is 

not jurisdictional.

What's -- what's -- what's the three-day 

mail rule?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, normally if you are 

allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you 

can serve a party and then you have three days to file 

with the court as part of the Civil Rules. I sort of 

think that's what the judge -- because this was going 

out by mail -- he probably didn't get -- I wish I would 

have saved the envelope, but I don't have the envelope, 

but it probably didn't get to my office for three days 

anyway.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Speaking of the three-day 

mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this 

was that it actually was entered, took effect as of 

three days later.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, there's really no --

looking at the document, there's no way of telling that. 

That is correct. There's no way of telling that, and I 

believe that was probably the reasoning of the court 

that, you know, it took three days to get mail because 

you didn't get -- it wasn't sent out last time, 

obviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he 

added the three days, and then you have the 14 days to, 

you know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get 

it to the court in this case.

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of that might 

have -- all those things might have been going on in the 

judge's mind, but you don't contest that the 14-day 

period was not complied with? You don't have an 

argument that you complied with the 14-day period?

 MR. MANCINO: No, I do not. We're relying 

to the exceptions, and there's a number exceptions on 

deadlines that have come out. We have the equitable 

tolling, we have the waiver, forfeiture issue. And, you 

know, in this case, specific assurance by a court which 

in a past opinion seemed to control the date, where a 

judge gave you a specific assurance that you could do 

something in connection with the case.

 The old Harris Truck case is where the 

lawyer was on vacation. The judge said well, I'll give 

you some extra time. Even though they knew of the 

judgment, they knew the time would run, he said I'll 

give you extra time to file the appeal because you want 

to contact the lawyer who was on vacation. The court of 

appeals then said well, the rule didn't apply because 

you knew of the order, so -- but that was overlooked 

even though by time calculation, everybody was out of 

time.

 The Eberhart case, they were out of time

because the motion for new trial was filed untimely, 

which under the rule required a timely filing of a 

motion for a new trial in order to toll your appeal 

time.

 So this, obviously the motion to reopen was 

timely filed, was filed within the 180 days required by 

the rule. The other side was served. The other side 

had no objection to it and didn't oppose it. The real 

issue when you look at an equitable -- sort of an 

equitable rule like this, is the other side prejudiced, 

and obviously they are not prejudiced.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the things I 

think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that 

there would be a point at which the prevailing party in 

the district court could know with certainty there 

wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and 

that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that. 

It's not open-ended.

 Under your rule where the actual time for 

filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never 

really quite have that assurance, would they?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, unless the court 

specifically granted to the litigant a specific period 

of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do 

not ignore what the court says.

At least I think as, you know, anyone -- if 

this court said that, you have a right to reasonably 

rely on what the court said. And it certainly wasn't an 

unreasonable period of time that the court was giving in 

the case. It wasn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what would be 

an unreasonable period of time if the two or three days 

is not? Would another 10 days?

 MR. MANCINO: Well, if you go back to the 

rules, you're going into the six months, 180 days, and 

then, you know, you would say something. Or if the 

court, you know, gave you a year or something by 

mistake, you know, it would -- you know, that something 

does not sound right here. And then you would look at 

it. At least if that were the case, you could probably 

go in and get the court to reconsider, bring it to the 

attention of the court. Your Honor, we did not have all 

of this time. Did you make a mistake? You can always 

correct mistakes. But that was not done here, it was 

not done by the respondent in this case because they 

didn't -- the respondent did not object to the 

application to reopen the appeal, did not say anything 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the respondent said 

he had no reason at that time to believe that you

wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days. 

So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put 

down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say 

that's premature.

 MR. MANCINO: Well then, the judge may have 

said well, I don't -- look at the rule. I don't have 

it. I'm going to redraft the order, vacate my order and 

put a proper order on in connection with the case. It 

would seem to me that at some point in the appellate 

process, because when you look at the history that the 

Sixth Circuit in this case -- at least when the court 

then granted a certificate of appealability, you would 

think the respondent would -- what are -- why are you 

granting a certificate of appealability when you told us 

we have no jurisdiction over this case, or at least from 

the two orders anyway, they said they had jurisdiction 

over the February 10th order that -- on the appeal. And 

the -- then the certificate of appealability was denied, 

and normally that would end the case.

 The court granted the -- my motion for 

reconsideration, and then granted certain issues that 

could be briefed on the merits. But once the court 

granted the certificate of appealability, it seemed to 

me that the other side, well, what is happening here?

what you are really proposing is sort of a rule that if 

-- if counsel could reasonably be misled to overlook the 

mistake by the court, that your reliance upon the 

court's mistake should -- should, in fact, be respected. 

It's kind of a rule of reasonably misleading; is that 

about right?

 MR. MANCINO: I believe so.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that's how we 

distinguish your case on your view from the case in 

which you get 180 days instead of 14?

 MR. MANCINO: Right. Sort of, you know, 

reasonably reliant, is it fair.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think we should 

have a rule of reason rather than a per se rule.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MANCINO: That's the prior case, because 

they made that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question: 

Is the order on page 151 of the joint appendix, just 

those three lines, that's the entire order that the 

judge entered? It just says granted, and motion --

MR. MANCINO: That is what's handwritten on 

the original documents. That's it.

findings that the rule requires?

because the judge found in our favor. The judge denied 

the motion to vacate part of it but granted the 

reopening to vacate, and of course on the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the motion 

requires --

30 days to appeal.

make three specific findings which he did not make.

assume that the judge did by granting the motion, and 

nobody else said anything about it anyway.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. MARSHALL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day 

statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is 

fatal to his case for three reasons.

 First, the 14-day period is mandatory and

jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have 

the power to enlarge this time period.

 Second, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by 

the state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua 

sponte in any event.

 Third, even if there could be some sort of 

limited equitable exception to the 14-day time 

requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of 

demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary 

relief.

 Let me explain why. The petitioner's claim 

that notice of appeal time requirements are not 

jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice, 

countless lower court decisions, settled congressional 

understanding as to the meaning of its governing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What type of jurisdiction 

are you speaking of? It's certainly not Federal 

jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter 

jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal 

law. What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think it is its 

own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way 

that final judgments on appeals are subject matter 

jurisdiction. And the reason why is that notice of 

appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in

that they transfer the locus of the case from one court 

to another. In the appellate system, there's actually a 

changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal 

is that triggering mechanism. And in that sense, it is 

classically jurisdictional and different from the other 

kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in 

Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place 

within a particular court system, the district court 

system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction 

triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the 

other.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that just a word game? 

It's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction 

from one court to the other. Why should that be -- why 

does that make it jurisdictional?

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

the same way that final judgments are. I mean, final 

judgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer 

from one case to another.

 The second reason, Your Honor, by the way, 

is congressional, is the congressional reenactment of 

the notice of appeal time deadlines, which 

also indicates that Congress treats these --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of anything 

that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?

MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor, but when 

there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150 

years of practice where Congress has enacted against 

that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional. 

And I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's 

jurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for 

certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because 

there is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated 

them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because 

there is not a statutory underpinning.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the latter suggest 

that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from 

one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the 

latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily 

have to be. That is correct.

 However, that Congress and this Court can 

treat such a thing because it is in a -- because it is 

a -- because it does transfer the case from one to 

another. I think that the criminal -- that in the 

certiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be 

an indication there that there might be some relation. 

But I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari 

practice, you've already -- you're already in the 

appellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction

between trial courts and appellate courts.

 But the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I 

don't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly 

it can be jurisdictional. And for 150 years, this Court 

and Congress has treated this particular division as 

jurisdictional.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it seems to me that's 

what we're back to, that it's long been treated as 

jurisdictional. But you just said that it's not 

sufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's 

not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court 

to another.

 So we're back just to history, right?

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, it's more 

than just history, because I think Congress reenacting 

2107 against this background for 150 years, that this 

issue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress 

behind this as well. But here it's also, 150 years is 

not a matter of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The provision of, is it 

2107?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does that appear in 

the judicial code? Does it appear under the provisions 

concerning jurisdiction?

MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. 2107 does 

not itself mention jurisdiction. However, that is also 

true with 2101 in respect to this Court's certiorari 

jurisdiction in civil cases. The word jurisdiction is 

not mentioned specifically but it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is under the 

heading procedure, court procedure, right?

 MR. MARSHALL: It's time for appeal to 

court to proceed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that's under a 

chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to 

jurisdiction.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But this 

Court in Barnhart suggested that in determining whether 

something is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the 

context of the particular location. Here this Rule 21 

-- excuse me. Here this statute, 2107, has been enacted 

and reenacted against the background of this Court 

consistently saying it's jurisdictional and treating 

this rule as jurisdictional, and that's since cases as 

far along as Edmondson.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You know there have been 

a spate of cases that said the word "jurisdiction" has 

been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings. And 

you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is

subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity, 

is there a federal question?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor, in the same 

way that amount in controversies are also subject 

matter.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But amount in controversy 

is in 1332. Congress putting it right there together. 

It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in 

controversy, all in 1332. Here the limit appears in a 

statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. But that 

statute has been enacted against, as I keep 

reemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the 

Edmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own 

motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and 

because the time period had not been complied with 

dismissed the appeal.

 The question essentially isn't whether we're 

going to call it jurisdictional or not. The question is 

the effect of the particular rule. Some of the lower 

courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a 

prerequisite to jurisdiction. The question is what the 

treatment of this particular requirement is and the 

treatment of this particular requirement consistently 

for over 150 years has been that it is mandatory,

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What characteristics are

this case?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Number one, it can't be 

waived, right?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Number two --

MR. MARSHALL: It's non-forfeitable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The court of appeals has to 

inquire on its own, right?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything else?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. There's no 

equitable exception to it. There is no equitable 

exception to it as well if it's jurisdictional. So all 

of those three attach to the term "jurisdictional." But 

I also think they could equally attach to the notion 

that, even if we don't want to call it jurisdictional, 

if we don't view it as fitting easily within this 

category of subject matter jurisdiction.

matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which 

is not jurisdictional. That's the one of the three 

characteristics that I think we have always attached the 

word "jurisdictional" to, I think.

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, in Day 

versus McDonough in dealing with a habeas, with a habeas 

statute of limitations, this Court approved the court of 

appeals raising that issue sua sponte, although they --

although in that case the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It may.

 MR. MARSHALL: It may.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But not must.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not must. And truly with 

things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. However, if 

the lower courts wanted to play with the language a 

little bit and call it necessary for the invocation of 

jurisdiction or a prerequisite --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We could call it 

"quasi-jurisdictional." You wouldn't object to that?

 MR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. As 

Shakespeare might say, it's not the name. We are 

interested in the effect, and the effect here has been 

traditionally enforced over 150 years of court practice.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what do you think is 

the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How far do you take it? 

Suppose this ^ slip is not noticed in the court of 

appeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some 

clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was 

filed in 16 days instead of in 14 days. Would the court 

then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. I think it 

applies in the same way that lack of diversity would 

apply or lack of a Federal question could apply, as in 

the Mottley case. Even if it was in front of this 

Court, if it was recognized in front of this Court, at 

that time it would -- it must be dismissed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's take it a step 

further. Let's assume it isn't recognized. Assume he 

gets his habeas relief, and three years later some eager 

beaver is culling through the records and says, this guy 

never should have been in court. Do they rearrest him 

and put him into prison?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, collateral 

attacks for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not 

normally sustained, if that's what the -- if I 

understand your question correctly. So that, for 

example, in a diversity case, if two years or three

years after it proceeds to final judgment somebody 

realizes that both parties were from the same State, the 

collateral attack would normally not allow to change 

that, to change that result. And I would think that the 

same thing would happen here. If the case had proceeded 

to final judgment, if there were an error of this type, 

as with other types of errors in subject matter 

jurisdiction, there would not be an opening for 

collateral attack.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about something here I 

hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances 

doctrine. This Court in Osterneck said this: Where a 

party has performed a act which if properly done would 

postpone the deadline for filing his appeal -- and 

indeed that's what happened here; he postponed the 

deadline for filing his appeal -- and has received 

specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act 

has been properly done -- and here he did receive 

specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act 

was properly done -- in those circumstances, you can 

make a little exception in the interests of justice.

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the unique 

circumstances doctrine doesn't apply here because there 

wasn't an act which if requested could have been

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes, the act was that 

he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen 

postponed the time of appeal. And two things have to 

happen with that act. One is you have to get the 

district judge to agree; and second, you have to file 

the paper.

 So that's the act which if properly done 

would, in fact, have led to the appeal.

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree there were two 

parts to it or two acts, if you want.

 MR. MARSHALL: But, Justice Breyer, in this 

case I think that what would have had to happen is that 

the Petitioner would have had to move for 17 days in 

order for the act to be properly done. He moved for 14 

days.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought what we were 

talking about was that if the order had said 14 days 

instead of 17, then the act would have been properly 

done. That is, the only reason that -- the 16 days, 

according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days 

was the judge authorized that. If the judge hadn't 

authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded 

and he would have filed in 14 days.

 MR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the judge

-- our argument is in part that the judge had no power 

to authorize it. If I understand your question, with 

respect to the unique circumstances doctrine, this 

doesn't fit in because in the unique circumstances 

doctrine the litigant actually has to seek a particular 

type of relief and get granted that relief. The 

Petitioner here did not seek leave to file his motion of 

appeal within 17 days. The Petitioner here sought, 

which is the only thing he could do under the rules, is 

seek to reopen for 14 days.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he hasn't 

received, just quoting from Osterneck, he hasn't 

received assurance that the act has been properly done?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, if 

he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or 

something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it 

might come under that provision. But this is just --

prospectively, he could have filed this timely even 

after the judge issued the order. In other words, he 

could have filed it on the 14th day. He didn't have to 

wait until the 17th day.

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why does that matter? I 

mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case

that took place on Tuesday. This case took place on 

Thursday. I mean, I grant you the language literally 

you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what? The 

purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very 

narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what 

to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo 

and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing 

and you didn't get it right.

 Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the 

language is very close, so why not follow it?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the purpose of 

the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a 

license to litigants to rely on district court errors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the 

very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique 

circumstances doctrine.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I notice the court applied 

it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique 

circumstances.

 MR. MARSHALL: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question. 

Supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order 

had been entered on February 10 or February 12. Say his 

handwriting was illegible. Would that be a dispute that

would remain open throughout the appellate process?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, the question is 

when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry 

of judgment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If he'd entered this order 

on February 12 or 13 -- I forget which day it was -- the 

appeal would have been timely?

 MR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just -- and the 

order was defective because it didn't make findings 

required by the rule. And I'm just wondering, supposing 

it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered. 

Would the party then be entitled to rely on the date, 

February 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty 

to investigate and find out exactly when the judge 

signed the order?

 MR. MARSHALL: I think the key question, 

Your Honor, I think is when the -- when the order is 

entered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of 

course. I think that is the triggering time.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: My question is what if 

that's somewhat ambiguous? A busy court, he handed it 

to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the 

docket. You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about 

that.

MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, that's a 

different case. The beginning time period is a 

beginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. I'm just 

wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve 

that kind of dispute? Should that be a dispute that 

remains open throughout the appellate process/ There's 

a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.

 MR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. Again, the 

factual dispute is when the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If he had written here, 

instead of "2-10," he had written down "2-12," then the 

prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the 

wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?

 MR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, I think the 

question at that point is what is the time period 

entered into the formal docket, and what is the actual 

judgment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's ambiguous, I'm 

saying. That's ambiguous.

 MR. MARSHALL: If for some reason the court 

records are jumbled for some reason or another and 

nobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's 

a different case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In that case, you then

rely on the February 27 date in the order? Then it must 

be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27? 

In such a case it would be okay.

 MR. MARSHALL: Again, Your Honor, the 

critical thing with the rule period is the time period 

from the entry of judgment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know, and I say it's 

hard to figure out when the order was actually written 

down in the docket.

 MR. MARSHALL: I think that the question 

that would be required then was for whoever was filing 

the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the 

docket is. If that's ambiguous, I think it's obligatory 

on the litigant to err on the side of caution, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And not rely on the 2-27 

date.

 MR. MARSHALL: I would certainly suggest 

that a litigant argue on -- err on the side of caution 

if at all.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Breyer quoted 

from the Osterneck case. There was another statement of 

the rule which goes like this: There is a sharply honed 

exception covering cases in which the trial judge has 

misled a party who could have and probably would have

taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct 

rather than incorrect information. This case fits right 

into that description, doesn't it?

 PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL: No, Your Honor. The 

case that they're citing to is Thompson, and in Thompson 

what occurred in that case is that the litigant in that 

case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The case that I'm reading 

from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against 

United States. It does cite Thompson.

 MR. MARSHALL: Thompson is the case, 

Thompson -- this Court has not relied on the unique 

circumstances doctrine in 40 years. Buy in Thompson 

what occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial 

untimely, but was told by the court that they had timely 

requested a new trial. Because they were informed that 

they were entitled to a new trial, they did not do 

something else, which was file the notice of appeal. So 

the court basically sent them down the wrong avenue. 

Here there was no wrong avenue that the court -- that 

the litigant was being sent down.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they would have filed 

that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, 

your motion for a new trial is untimely. It seems to me 

the same as in this case. The judge said: Your motion

is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much 

later. Fine. If the judge had said, your motion is 

untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of 

appeal in sooner rather than later. Similarly, here the 

judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later.

 If the judge had done right and said the 

14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed 

within that period.

 MR. MARSHALL: But, Your Honor, there is 

nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant 

here from filing on time. There was nothing that would 

have prevented the litigation here from filing within 

the 14-day period.

 And when --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nothing in 

Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.

 MR. MARSHALL: Except in Thompson, Your 

Honor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a 

motion for new trial. If he had -- Your Honor, I see 

that my time is up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

answer.

 MR. MARSHALL: In Thompson, Your Honor, the 

difference is that -- that the litigant was sent down a 

different road which was inconsistent with his filing a

Mr. Marshall.

 MR. MARSHALL: Thank you, Your Honor.

 THE COURT: We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, 

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MR. STEWART: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court.

 For four basic reasons the deadline for 

filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be 

treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable. 

First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107 

directly implicates the concerns that underlie the 

special treatment of jurisdictional issues. It's a 

fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal 

courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating 

cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so. 

Or to put it another way, our legal system has 

presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of 

jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the 

misapplication of law in cases that a court is

authorized to adjudicate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, do you think 

this is subject -- that question is subject matter 

jurisdiction?

 MR. STEWART: We would -- we would 

characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction. 

That is, this Court has often said that it's the 

fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is -- when 

doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction 

and that of the court from which the record comes. And 

that division presupposes that there are cases over 

which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, 

over which this Court would not have appellate 

jurisdiction.

 For example, situations sometimes arise, 

particularly in cases that are adjudicated by 

three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute 

as to whether a particular district court order is 

directly appealable to this Court or should go instead 

to the court of appeals. And if somebody comes to this 

Court and this Court determines that the appeal should 

have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is 

characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction. This 

Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even 

though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a

whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of 

the district court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, that's one 

those interesting examples. We lack jurisdiction of the 

case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate 

the order and have it refiled, don't we?

 MR. STEWART: That is an anomaly. The Court 

has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate 

jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the 

case except to vacate the order. And I think that's a 

court that I'm not going to try to explain.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STEWART: But I think Mr. Marshall has 

identified the second example, namely the final decision 

requirement of 28 USC 1291. That is, that's universally 

conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has 

nothing to do with whether the district court had 

subject matter jurisdiction over the case. It is simply 

whether this particular decision over -- for which 

review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction 

of the court of appeals. And our point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, should we 

repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?

 MR. STEWART: I don't think you need to -- I 

think you should repudiate any conception that Federal

courts have freewheeling authority to excuse 

noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking 

appeals.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the unique 

circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which 

courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think actually 

both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other 

grounds. And may even be correct in more limited ways. 

For example, Harris --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But on the grounds for 

which they have been taken as authority, is it your view 

that we should repudiate those grounds?

 MR. STEWART: Yes. With respect to civil 

cases for which the time for taking an appeal is 

specified by statute, it's our view to the extent that 

Harris and Thompson would otherwise support the 

proposition that district courts may excuse 

noncompliance with the time limits, those cases should 

be repudiated.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- in criminal.

 MR. STEWART: In criminal cases the time for 

taking an appeal is not specified by statute. It's 

imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). 

But there's no statutory basis for it. There was up

until 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, 

Section 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to 

promulgate rules that would establish the time for 

filing a notice of appeal --

JUSTICE BREYER: But in -- though of course, 

you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that 

doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into 

the rule. So there is a statute and you read the 

statute as saying well there could be very some very 

narrow circumstances that Congress would have been 

willing to make an exception. For example it is a 

couple of days and the judge tells you, "do it" or lets 

you do it. It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?

 MR. STEWART: Well I think it makes a 

fundamental difference that there is a statute in place. 

And certainly with respect to circuit certiorari 

petitions coming from the court of appeals to this 

Court, this Court has recognized that distinction to be 

fundamental.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're sure habeas 

cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather 

than criminal?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, there's no -- no dispute 

about that. And indeed if the -- if this case were 

classified as civil for purposes of -- I mean, as

criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an 

appeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal 

Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b). Indeed the authority 

of the district court to have granted the reopening 

period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the 

criminal context.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Looking at the rule, 

it does require these findings. Has that been 

interpreted to require that they be written on the 

record or is that simply something that's supposed to 

guide the district court?

 MR. STEWART: I think the courts of appeals 

have not required that they be written on the record but 

have required that there be a basis appearing in the 

record for those findings. So, for instance, if 

Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to 

reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had 

not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if 

the court had granted the reopening, that could be set 

aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support 

in the record for such a finding. But I don't believe 

the courts of appeals have required there be explicit 

findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the 

grant of the reopening.

certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1 

imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all 

cases. It is not divided between civil and criminal. 

But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has 

a very different status is criminal cases than in civil 

cases. That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court 

states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out 

of time, the clerk is directed not to file it. And Rule 

13.2 cites USC 21.01(c).

 So the clear implication is that the Court 

recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil 

cases to be a jurisdictional limit. And the crucial 

point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word 

jurisdictionally. It's that it gives an instruction to 

the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether 

any other party objects. It's the very type of thing 

that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction, 

as to matters over which it has an obligation to take 

cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection.

 In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day 

rule applies under the rules, but the Court has 

recognized that it retains the authority to grant 

petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where 

the other party objects.

and it's -- part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the 

Government's brief. In the last full paragraph of page 

16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar 

cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that --

and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as 

otherwise provided in this section.

 And then it goes on to say no appeal shall 

bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or 

proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals 

for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 

days.

 And the significance of this provision, this 

language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal 

must be filed within 30 days. Language like that would 

conceivably leave open the question of what happens if 

the notice of appeal is untimely filed. This language 

actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within 

30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it begins with the 

exception as provided in subparagraph (c).

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. So we're not 

saying that the 30-day limit is absolute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah.

 MR. STEWART: -- but we're saying that the 

rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are

not complied with, the appeal will not bring -- I'm 

sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order, 

or decree before the court of appeals. This is 

specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of 

the reviewing court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think, if we 

did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a 

fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a 

case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, 

your -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though 

it wasn't; it was out of by two days. While here, we 

have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered 

with a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you 

have till the 27th to file.

 MR. STEWART: Well, are two things we would 

say about Thompson. The first is that as this Court 

explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn, 

it's long been recognized that a timely motion for 

reconsideration will suspend the finality of the 

judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal. And 

the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that 

under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for 

reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge 

appropriately considers it on the merits.

 And Thompson can be explained as holding

simply that where the Government does not object and the 

district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as 

timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend 

the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has 

to read -- has to be read to stand for a broader 

equitable principle.

 The other thing I'd say about Thompson is 

that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in 

opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the 

cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied 

exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the 

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. Therefore the 

Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with 

congressionally imposed limits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Stewart.

 Mr. Mancino, you have four minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. MANCINO: If this were a case where 

someone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think 

we would be talking. We are talking about a case where 

a judge properly found, properly ruled that notice was 

not given and had the authority to reopen the case. And

we talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case. 

All that were involved in this case is how is the case 

moved from one court to another.

 And the -- was it moved properly in this 

case? The unique circumstances, I think you cannot find 

a more compelling case for unique circumstances.

 Did the party rely upon the court? Here you 

have a handwritten notation from the court, signed by 

the judge --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Mancino, does the 

record tell us how you got notice of that order?

 MR. MANCINO: No, it doesn't. But I mean, I 

did get notice of it. It came in the mail, but it 

doesn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You, you got that order in 

the mail?

 MR. MANCINO: In the mail, correct. And 

that's why I believe the three days was added, thinking 

of the mail rule that we have three additional days to 

do it in connection with the case. And that's how I 

believe the, how the 17 days came up.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I asked this once 

before: Did the document you received show the dates 

that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the 

14 days was running from?

MR. MANCINO: No, the only information it 

had was the printed -- the printed date by the judge. 

Did not show it was entered that same day.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but in the -- in this 

thing, it says entered on February 10.

 MR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. The 

docket does show that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But how did you find out 

it had been entered on February 10? Because you did 

know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.

 MR. MANCINO: Well, I just went off what the 

date on the -- the handwritten date on the pleading we 

received from the court. It said February 10, so we 

just put it in there. Didn't go to the actual docket to 

see if, in fact, it was entered. As you can see, orders 

were not -- in this case were not entered on date that 

the judge signified anyway.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is, this is all at 

the top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right? 

That's the that entire thing.

 MR. MANCINO: That is the -- well, it is 

printed on that. But I mean, if you look at the 

original document --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was 

handwritten --

MR. MANCINO: It's a handwritten --

handwritten by the judge in, in the case. So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says when it was 

signed by the judge. It doesn't say when it was entered 

on the docket, when it was entered by the clerk.

 MR. MANCINO: No. It says when the judge 

signed it. That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it says it in the 

index, it says -- it says docket entries. 2-10, it says 

entered 2-10, on page 11. On page 11.

 MR. MANCINO: Yeah, that's correct. But 

that's from the docket --

JUSTICE BREYER: Received. So-

MR. MANCINO: But the document we received 

from the Court just has -- you know -- the handwritten 

notation on it, file your appeal by --

JUSTICE ALITO: What would you, what would 

you have had to have done to find out when it was 

entered on the docket? Could you have accessed that 

electronically? Or would you have to go to the court, 

to --

MR. MANCINO: Well, probably I could not 

have -- at that time, I mean I could do it now, but at 

that time you'd have to go over to the courthouse, just 

like we walked on orders of appeal over to the

figured that was the end of it and we were on our way to 

the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. Thanks.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
