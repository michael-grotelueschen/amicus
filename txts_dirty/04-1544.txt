CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 04-1544, Vickie Lynn Marshall v. E. Pierce 

Marshall. 

Mr. Richland. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This is a bankruptcy case, but it is a 

bankruptcy case in which the Ninth Circuit has made --

come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Federal 

bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction over the chief 

assets of the bankruptcy estate. That asset, a -- a 

tort cause of action, was to be the main source of the 

payment to the creditors. And the Ninth Circuit came 

to this conclusion because it gave a very broad 

interpretation of the so-called probate exception to 

Federal jurisdiction. 

As I will explain, the Federal bankruptcy 

jurisdiction statutes are incompatible with the concept 

of having adopted a probate exception to Federal 

jurisdiction, particularly to Federal bankruptcy 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Any exception whatever. 

MR. RICHLAND: That's correct, Your Honor. 

There is no exception to that. The -- the statute 

itself is structured in such a way that its 

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court depends on the 

relationship of the matter to the bankruptcy estate. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So if -- if the contention 

in the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will 

which has been probated by the State probate court is, 

in fact, not the true will and that under the true 

will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think 

the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction 

to probate the will. 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the 

question is, of course, that's an attack on a probated 

will, I believe, and I think that this Court's 

jurisprudence also supports the notion that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Well, I'm 

willing to -- to move it back. I mean, that's --

that's even harder for you. But let's assume that the 

will is in probate but has not yet been probated. Do 

you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to 

decide which will is the true will? 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, the -- the bankruptcy 

jurisdiction statute states that --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or no. 

MR. RICHLAND: The answer is yes, it does--

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 MR. RICHLAND: -- and it must have that power 

to be able to do so because the bankruptcy jurisdiction 

statute states that the court has jurisdiction, in rem 

jurisdiction, exclusive in rem jurisdiction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What if the rem --

MR. RICHLAND: -- over all assets of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what if the rem is in 

another court before the bankruptcy begins? What if 

the res is within -- is in another court? 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

28 U.S.C., section 1334(e) states the bankruptcy court 

shall have exclusive jurisdiction, in rem jurisdiction, 

over the bankruptcy estate, and that has been 

interpreted by the courts as meaning that it has 

paramount jurisdiction in the sense that the normal in 

custodia legis doctrine does not apply where it is a 

bankruptcy court case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So even -- even if 

property is in the custody of another court in the 

probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes 

later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever 

assets are before the probate court into the

bankruptcy. 

MR. RICHLAND: That -- that is correct, Your 

Honor, and there have been courts that have held that 

with respect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to stand on this 

position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser 

position --

MR. RICHLAND: Well, it's certainly not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that might cause 

you to win? Because --

(Laughter.) 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, it certainly is not 

necessary, of course, to -- to -- for us to prevail in 

this case. However, I think it is an important 

principle to interpret the -- the bankruptcy 

jurisdiction statute, look at the language of that 

statute, and determine what Congress intended from 

that. And -- and I think it also is a dangerous thing 

to get into, implying exceptions into that statute. 

But -- but let me state this. Obviously, in 

this case we have an action, the -- the in rem 

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chosen 

action, that is -- is miles away from the probate of --

of a will. The particular cause of action involved 

here was an interference with an inter vivos gift. And

I think it's important to realize that that was 

intended to be a gift that would be complete during the 

lifetime of the decedent. That fact means that this 

case really has almost nothing to do with probate or 

probate jurisdiction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you did file a 

challenge to the probate of the will, didn't you, in 

Texas? 

MR. RICHLAND: There was a challenge filed to 

the probate of the will originally by the -- the 

brother of the respondent in this case, and eventually 

yes, our client did join that some years later after it 

was first filed. So that would have been an 

alternative. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And wasn't the ground 

for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter 

vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy 

court proceeding? 

MR. RICHLAND: No, that was not the case, 

Your Honor. The -- the grounds for that was the belief 

that there had been undue influence with respect to the 

will. But the inter vivos gift claim -- a tortious 

interference with inter vivos gift claim -- that was 

added only many years later in the year 2000. That was 

3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was

pending in the bankruptcy court. And the only reason 

it was raised at that time was that respondent went to 

the Federal court and said -- and interposed the 

probate exception and argued at that time there is no 

jurisdiction here. Therefore, out of an excess of 

caution, our client went to the Texas probate court and 

said, well, I will -- I will make this -- this claim 

here. 

In fact, once there was success in the 

bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I 

have made a determination on that claim, our client did 

dismiss that claim and dismissed all affirmative claims 

with respect to the probate estate. 

I think the important thing to realize here, 

with respect to both this particular claim and with 

respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in 

particular, is that the -- that the breadth of the --

what that statute does is, it -- it announces that 

rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there 

will be preclusions based on abstention. It has broad 

abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed 

section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstention 

JUSTICE BREYER: You like this -- apparently 

you like this argument, although you say you're miles

away from probate. Well, if you want to get into that 

argument, I guess the strongest argument against 

keeping it -- for keeping it is bankruptcy 

jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted 

differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other 

statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is 

such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress 

implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic 

relations exception. Therefore, if we are going to 

find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and 

overrule that case and a lot of other water that's 

flowed over -- under the bridge or wherever the water 

flows. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: And we ought to take what's 

given as given, whatever the true meaning of 

ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain 

probate matters or not in the 18th century. 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, if one looks 

at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself 

contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction 

under circumstances where there was no diversity 

jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question 

jurisdiction. So it -- it certainly is true that 

rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is

the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have 

before it matters over which there would be no 

diversity jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you could say the same 

thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress 

contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction 

where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no 

Federal question jurisdiction. I mean, I don't see 

what that proves. 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, excuse me, Justice 

Scalia, but what I think it does prove is that when 

Congress enacted in 1978 the rather comprehensive 

change that it made to the bankruptcy statutes, that it 

intended to exercise as broad a jurisdiction as 

possible so that the bankruptcy courts would be able to 

control the bankruptcy estate and make determinations 

as to how the creditors could best be protected. 

Let me -- let -- yes. I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm just saying no more so 

than -- than when Congress enacted diversity 

jurisdiction. It intended it to apply, you know, 

uniformly. 

MR. RICHLAND: To -- to apply very broadly 

according to its terms. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. RICHLAND: And, of course, this Court in 

-- first in Lear v. Armstrong said, yes, this applies 

very broadly. However, there is an exception and the 

exception is purely the probate of a will -- the 

probate of a will and that alone. And this Court has 

really hewn very closely to that very narrow limitation 

since that point in time. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. 

MR. RICHLAND: I do think that it's 

important, however, to realize that if one examines 

this Court's probate exception jurisdiction over the 

years, it has consistently determined that the -- the 

narrowness of that exception must be confirmed, and as 

late as the Markham case, this Court has held that --

that Federal courts have jurisdiction to decide all 

kinds of issues with respect to wills, all kinds of 

issues with respect to trusts. Certainly this Court 

has said that it can determine questions such as how to 

interpret the provision of a will. It has even held 

that Federal courts can determine whether a will is 

invalid. It can make that determination if the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But none -- none of this has 

to be done for you to win this case, does it? 

MR. RICHLAND: You are absolutely correct.

to this case. 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, I'm happy to do that, 

Your Honor. This case is an outlier. I believe that 

is true. This case is so far from the potential of any 

probate exception that, although I felt that it was 

important to be able to explicate the -- the principles 

involved here, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to look moderate. 

MR. RICHLAND: Oh --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does this case involve 

anything more than the enforcement of an in personam 

tort judgment if you are to win? 

MR. RICHLAND: It -- it would not. That is 

all that's involved. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it did involve, at 

least the bankruptcy court thought, the judgment 

invalidating the inter vivos trust. Was that necessary 

to the decision? Or am I -- correct me if I'm --

MR. RICHLAND: I -- I don't believe --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- correct me if I'm wrong 

about that. 

MR. RICHLAND: That is -- that is incorrect, 

Justice Kennedy. It did not invalidate the inter vivos 

trust. What it held was that as part of the evidence 

that it was considering, in terms of the intent, the

donative intent, that one portion of that inter vivos 

trust, an amendment to it, had been forged, but it did 

not invalidate it. In fact, it -- it expressly held 

that the -- the inter vivos trust is valid, and that 

was a basis for its conclusion that, indeed, this 

particular claim was also valid. This claim was a 

cause of action for interference with an inter vivos 

gift. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess what you're going to 

hear in 5-10 minutes --

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- you might as well deal 

with it now --

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. Why not? 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is that the inter vivos 

-- a -- a claim for a -- the Texas tort of interference 

with inter vivos gift, according to Texas law, must be 

brought at the time of the probate proceeding. And for 

that reason, it is bound up with probate, and for that 

reason, they didn't have jurisdiction. 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, A -- A, we do not 

interpret Texas law as so providing. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, let's 

suppose you're --

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- suppose they're right

MR. RICHLAND: Assuming that they're right 

for that -- by their interpretation, this Court has 

repeatedly said that it -- that a -- a State court 

cannot -- by simply assigning matters that otherwise 

would be heard by Federal courts to the probate court, 

that it can, in effect, shield those --

JUSTICE BREYER: And the strongest case for 

you on that is? 

MR. RICHLAND: Oh, I think Hess --

JUSTICE BREYER: You said this Court has 

repeatedly said. So what --

MR. RICHLAND: Said it over and over, but 

Hess v. Reynolds from 1885, which says that merely the 

convenience of a -- a State court to, you know, assign 

matters to -- to its probate court. That was a case in 

which a debt --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but this case 

involves a lot more than convenience. It involves a 

substantial amount of assets that is either going to 

pass to one person under probate or is not going to be 

available for passing to that person because of the 

inter vivos gift. That seems to be more closely 

related to the core probate matters.

 MR. RICHLAND: Well in fact, Chief Justice 

Roberts, I don't believe that's the case. Nothing 

passed by way of probate in this case. The -- there 

were no assets in the probate. What happened here was 

that all of the assets -- and the record shows this, 

and I don't believe it's -- that there is any dispute 

here. All of the assets had passed to the respondent 

in this case before the will and the trust were 

actually submitted to the probate court. 

Once again, this is a tort claim and it's a 

tort claim only for an interference. If those assets 

had never gone to respondent in this case, there would, 

nevertheless, still be a good tort claim. If, for 

example, those assets had been passed to respondent's 

child or to another brother, the interference itself --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Richland --

MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me, Justice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what seems to me to be 

involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal 

system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the 

same or closely related subject matter. It is not 

infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in 

Federal court and State court, and then the one that 

gets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the 

other. And as I understand it, the probate proceeding

MR. RICHLAND: Justice Ginsburg, you're quite 

correct that issues -- that -- that the principles of 

preclusion ordinarily would deal with the kinds of 

issues here, and -- and we think that that -- those --

that should be what governs this case. 

But I don't believe that it is correct to say 

that the probate court judgment preceded that of the 

bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court judgment came 

first. A year later the probate court judgment then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming 

-- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that the 

bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion. It doesn't 

become a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the 

district court. 

MR. RICHLAND: Unless it's a core matter. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. RICHLAND: And here we claim that it is a 

core matter. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it isn't a core 

matter. I think you lost on that in the district 

court. 

MR. RICHLAND: If it isn't a core matter, 

then in any event the district court here held that

 First, the probate exception to Federal 

jurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not 

apply beyond the context of wills to other types of 

will substitutes like inter vivos trusts. 

Second, even with respect to wills, it is a 

very narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the 

rights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or 

determining the testator's intent. 

There are only three things under this 

Court's precedent that a Federal court cannot do. The 

first is to probate a will, that is, to determine the 

formal key requisites of the validity of a will; 

second, to annul an already probated will; and three, 

to take in rem jurisdiction over a res over which a 

State court has already taken in rem jurisdiction. But 

that is it, and none of those are applicable here. 

The justifications for the probate exception 

do not apply to will substitutes. The -- the probate 

exception is based on the peculiar nature of a will, 

that is, that unlike inter vivos trusts, unlike the 

current modern will substitutes, a will is not valid --

it has no legal effect. This Court's opinions have 

said that on several occasions -- unless it is 

probated. Therefore, a will must be probated even if 

there is no dispute about its validity before any title

can pass. Not so with trusts. In fact, that is the 

whole point that people engage in the modern world 

substitutes is to avoid the necessity to go to the 

probate court in order to have their assets passed to 

their heirs. 

The second ground for this Court's probate 

exception is a historical one based on the Court's 

understanding of the limits of the equity courts in 

England. Whatever the merit of that historical 

analysis, it has no application to trusts, which have 

always been the problems of equity. 

The Federal Government has a strong interest 

in the Court not expanding the Federal exception -- the 

-- the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction, 

particularly in the sweeping manner that the Ninth 

Circuit has done. It is not uncommon for the tax 

consequences of an estate planning instrument, such as 

a trust, to turn on whether or not the trust is valid 

or invalid. And the Congress has provided Federal 

jurisdiction to the United States to bring its -- most 

of its disputes in the Federal court system. 

Secondly, more generally, Congress has 

determined what types of disputes should be in the 

Federal courts and has passed broad statutes providing 

the courts with Federal jurisdiction that the courts

have an obligation to exercise, if it exists. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Except if it's a will 

-- will-specific. In other words, you -- it seems to 

me you're in for a penny and in for a pound. You 

recognize the existence of this exception in certain 

cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well, 

Congress wrote the statutes broadly. The latter 

argument disproves your first point. 

MS. MAYNARD: I don't believe it does, and 

perhaps I'm -- I'm -- I wasn't making clear what my 

argument is. The Court has adopted a very narrow 

probate exception with respect to the probating of the 

will and annulling a probated will, but that is it. 

And that analysis was based on a -- the historical --

the Court's view of the historical limits of courts of 

equity and therefore was an interpretation of the 

Federal diversity statute. Under the logic of 

Ankenbrandt, one can assume -- one may -- the Court may 

assume that's carried forward. 

But certainly that -- for the reasons I've 

said, that rationale, those justifications, for that 

narrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have 

always been the province of equity, and especially 

given the questionable historical underpinnings of the 

exception, even the narrow exception that does appear

to exist, there's no justification for expanding that 

beyond its current confines. 

As this Court recognized in Ankenbrandt, the 

lower courts had taken the -- the so-called domestic 

relations exception beyond this Court's very narrow 

limits, and this Court brought -- brought it back to 

its origins. And -- and the Federal Government 

believes that -- that the same would be appropriate 

here with respect to the probate exception. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, it's my 

understanding that a lot of this law developed out of 

the dicta in the Markham case. Do you think the dicta 

in the Markham case was an accurate description of the 

prior history? 

MS. MAYNARD: It was probably not a very 

precise history, Justice Stevens. I do think one can 

read Markham, however, especially if one reads it in 

the context of the cases it cites for its principles, 

to hold what we are saying now, which is that Federal 

courts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters, 

that is, no jurisdiction to probate a will. And its 

interference language, I believe, was its statement of 

the in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in 

fact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at 

all.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean by no 

jurisdiction to probate a will? Could -- could -- does 

that exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court 

deciding for itself where there are contested wills 

that in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will 

is a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy 

estate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund? 

Is that probating the will? 

MS. MAYNARD: The -- the United States hasn't 

taken a position on the broader argument about whether 

or not the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that isn't 

probating a will, the exception for probating a will 

doesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it? 

MS. MAYNARD: If -- if the question you're 

asking me is what does it mean to probate a will --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MS. MAYNARD: -- the -- the probate of a will 

requires determining that it has the appropriate formal 

prerequisites, which in most States is appropriate 

number of signatures that the testator was coherent, 

competent to make a will and that there was no undue 

influence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and that this is --

that this is the -- the last will and testament and

that there is not some other one. 

MS. MAYNARD: That's true, yes, that there's 

no competing will. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Now, can -- can the 

bankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that the 

proper will and testament of this decedent is this one? 

We're not probating it. No, no. 

MS. MAYNARD: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't pretend to probate 

it. We're just saying that this happens to be the true 

will and testament. 

MS. MAYNARD: It's conceivable that if that 

determination went to a -- an element of, for example, 

a tort claim and that the person were not -- were not 

seeking to take under the will, it is possible. This 

Court's precedent doesn't address that precise 

question. The United States hasn't taken a position on 

whether or not bankruptcy jurisdiction, ala the logic 

in Ankenbrandt, encompasses the narrow probate 

exception that we concede exists because it's not 

necessary to decide this case. The -- the petitioner's 

claim is far beyond anything that the probate exception 

has ever applied to.

overriding interest in having one forum resolve all

probate-related disputes. This Court has repeatedly, 

for over 150 years, rejected that exact proposition --

Justice Breyer, Payne v. Hook, Hess v. Reynolds, 

McClellan v. Carland, which this Court cited last term 

in Exxon Mobil -- and it was the basis of Markham's 

reversal of the Ninth Circuit decision that the Federal 

jurisdiction is not determined by the scope and extent 

of the State's decisions with respect to where to send 

its own citizens with respect to disputes that don't 

otherwise have a basis for Federal jurisdiction. The 

only place in this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Maynard, you said at 

one point it's not necessary for you to decide this, 

but there is vast confusion in the lower courts about 

the extent of the probate exception. And so I take it 

that your -- what you began -- what you began with is 

-- I wrote them down. That's it? 

MS. MAYNARD: That's what the United States 

believes the limit of the exception is, and the -- let 

me be clear. The United States has a strong interest 

in having this Court clarify the exception. That is 

where the confusion lies in the court of appeals. That 

is where the United States feels like its interests are 

at risk. So although the petitioner's claim is well 

outside the exception, the United States' interests lie

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in addition to 

Markham, what other case of this Court do you think 

spells out the proper bounds? 

MS. MAYNARD: I -- I think the -- Waterman 

has a -- has a good summary of the -- of the limits. I 

think even the two cases on which the respondent 

principally rely, Sutton and O'Callaghan, lay out the 

proper scope of the rule. Those -- both of those cases 

involved a claim that depended on having a will that 

had been probated declared invalid, and that is within 

the narrow confines of the exception. But it is a 

will-specific rule. 

The -- and, Justice Stevens, back to your 

question. The one thing about Markham is that there's 

no general interference principle, and that's where the 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You know there are a lot of 

scholars who think that Markham is the source of most 

of the confusion, and so that's why I was asking 

whether you think we should -- to clear up, which 

you're suggesting we should do, we should reexamine 

some of that dicta or we should just stick to the

MS. MAYNARD: I would -- I would -- you can

meant in Markham. I think the holding in Markham is 

correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With -- with new 

dicta of our own? 

(Laughter.)

to -- to rule on the case, to make some holding about 

what the scope of the exception is, Your Honor. And 

the -- the -- but, Justice Stevens, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We could just say whatever 

its scope is it ain't this. I mean, couldn't we do 

that? 

MS. MAYNARD: The Court certainly could 

resolve it that way, Your Honor. 

But, Justice Stevens, the -- the -- Markham, 

I do think, makes clear what interference is and is not 

by its holding. And on page 494 of Markham, it says, 

where the final judgment does not undertake to 

interfere with the State court's possession, save to 

the extent that the State court is bound by the 

judgment to recognize the right adjudicated by the 

Federal court. So that is not the type of interference

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The probate exception exists precisely to 

prevent what happened in this case, a Federal court 

enjoining ongoing probate proceedings in the middle of 

a probate trial, a Federal court determining that the 

decedent's estate plan was invalid, a Federal court's 

reallocation through a damage claim of the decedent's 

assets, contrary to the value of the estate plan, a 

Federal court's creation of a novel cause of action --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it 

correct -- I just want to be sure I follow you -- that 

they determined that the estate plan was invalid? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Stevens. At 

petition appendix 123 to 126, the district court 

determined that the -- that J. Howard's living trust 

was a forgery, that there were pages that were 

substituted --

JUSTICE BREYER: But this is all -- this has

nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently 

-- different understanding than I do of this case, and 

I did read Judge Carter's opinion. I thought that case 

simply held that because your clients had interfered 

with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few 

millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of 

that interference, they had committed the tort of inter 

vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay 

damages. 

Now, they said a lot of things by way of what 

the evidence was. Indeed, they did say, as you point 

out, that your clients forged three pages of the will. 

But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and 

it did not invalidate anything in the probate 

proceeding, as I read it. 

Now, what have I said that's not right? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, the answer to 

your question, I think, depends upon the fact that 

opposing counsel has studiously avoided actually 

revealing what his claim is. I think we have to focus 

on the -- her exact claim. As a matter of fact and as 

a matter of law, she did not prevail --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in what 

he said. I'm interested in what Judge Carter said --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because that, it seems to 

me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was 

wrong in this respect? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Judge -- Judge Carter 

understood quite clearly that in order for her claim to 

proceed as a matter of fact and as a matter of law, he 

had to invalidate her living trust. And let me explain 

why that was so. 

That was so because her claim is that J. 

Howard intended to give her a catchall trust. The 

argument is that Pierce blocked the catchall trust from 

being funded by rendering the living trust irrevocable 

in July of 1994. Judge Carter found that the catchall 

trust was drafted in December of 1994. 

She can only have a claim -- now, all of J. 

Howard's assets were in the living trust. She can only 

have a claim -- the catchall trust could only have been 

funded or prevented from being funded if the living 

trust was, in fact, validly rendered irrevocable. To 

prevent -- to -- to counter that, she says, no, the 

living trust was invalid. As a matter of fact, she can 

have no claim unless the living trust is rendered 

invalid. Judge Carter understood that and he expressly 

concluded that it was a forgery. 

Now rendering--

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't it the case 

that she can have her claim and she can prove her 

claim, but she may not be able to collect the judgment 

unless the living trust is invalid? But that's not 

what we're litigating here, is it? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, as a matter of 

law, she cannot have her claim because the two cases we 

rely on, Neill v. Yett and Thompson v. Deloitte, the 

two Texas cases, establish as a predicate to any 

tortious interference claim, she must demonstrate that 

the estate plan, the living trust, was invalid as a 

matter of Texas law. And that is exclusively under 

Texas law for the Texas probate court to decide. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does she have to show 

that is invalid as distinct from showing that another 

trust, favorable to her, was not created and it was not 

created because of the tortious conduct of your client? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, under 

Texas law when the -- the probate court determines the 

validity of an estate plan, it forecloses, as a matter 

of law, all expectancies contrary to those that are 

part of the estate plan. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me stop 

you there because this is something I didn't understand

in the brief. You speak of the Texas probate court

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

court determined the validity of a will here. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It determined the validity 

of -- of a pourover trust. Is that correct? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor, it did. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: The living trust. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. 

Isn't it the case that the two Texas 

determinations can be respected and still, in the 

Federal court, enter a judgment for tort liability 

against your client? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, and the 

reason why is because her cause of action is a State 

law cause of action, and under Texas law, putting aside 

the fact that no Texas court has ever recognized a 

cause of action for tortious interference --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's in -- you may be 

right on that, but that's not what -- what we're here 

for.

under Texas law -- and the Deloitte case and the Neill 

v. Yett case conclusively established this, and there's 

no contrary decisions in Texas -- that once the probate 

court determines an estate plan is valid, it 

conclusively determines the universe of persons with 

legitimate expectancies. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But when you speak of estate 

plan, you are -- you seem to be talking in global 

terms; i.e., that there could have been no other 

disposition of assets by the decedent or on behalf of 

the decedent except those which the Texas court is 

recognizing, the trust, the will. Is that what the 

Texas court does, or does the Texas court say, the will 

is good, the trust is good? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: The Texas courts have 

conveniently described for us Justice -- Justice Souter 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, is it 

preclusive of everything else? That's what I'm getting 

at. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, exactly so, Justice 

Souter. And in the Thompson case itself, the -- the 

Texas court says, when the probate court admitted the 

1989 will to probate, it necessarily found that Mr. 

Thompson signed the will with testamentary capacity and

that it reflected his intent, was not the result of 

coercion or under influence, and was valid. And the 

court continued, as a matter of law, the final probate 

court judgment bars any claim that appellees tortiously 

interfered with any inheritance--

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that sounds to 

me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not 

preemption but, you know, res judicata. 

But just out of curiosity or -- because I 

think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have 

in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the 

district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing 

that there was an intent to create the catchall trust? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer. Everything

MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Breyer. 

Everything the district court had and more was examined, 

adjudicated in the 5-and-a-half-month jury trial in the

Justice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of 

preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of 

jurisdiction?

probate exception has always been jurisdictional, and 

the reason why it can't be subsumed by res judicata or 

collateral estoppel -- we believe we win on those 

grounds, but the reason why the probate exception can't 

be subsumed within those doctrines is because it 

applies even before you have a State court judgment. 

It prevents a Federal court from determining an estate 

plan from being invalidated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it? The 

probate exception is court-created. Congress passed no 

law that said it. Congress gave the Federal courts 

jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and 

expected them to exercise that jurisdiction. Since our 

jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was 

made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as 

narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it 

because it lacks any statutory basis? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, the probate 

exception, like the domestic relations exception, is 

best conceived as a presumption that when Congress 

establishes a font of Federal jurisdiction, it does not 

intend that jurisdiction to be extended to interfere 

with probate proceedings. That is properly a 

jurisdictional doctrine in this case because it is 

never appropriate for a bankruptcy court to invalidate

or validate a will and -- or an estate plan. And that 

is a necessary element of Vickie's claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say -- you say an 

-- an estate plan. Most people would think insurance 

policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's 

alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the 

beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is 

that within the Texas probate court jurisdiction? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, no. Here we 

have -- when I say estate plan, I mean the living trust 

and the will operating together. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's -- there's a 

further irony here in that revocable trusts are always 

promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of 

probate. And now you're -- you're insisting that it 

has to be in probate. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

living trust here did two things that a will does. It 

provided for the succession of J. Howard's property 

upon his death, and it provided for the payment of his 

last -- last illness expenses and his -- his debts. It 

is quintessentially a will substitute in the sense that 

it also provides for the succession of his property. 

In this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it isn't probated.

That's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute. The whole 

purpose of doing it is to avoid probate. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: But in this case, Justice 

Scalia, the will and the -- the living trust acted 

together. The probate court had exclusive jurisdiction 

over both of them and the challenges to them. Vickie 

challenged the living trust, even before J. Howard 

died. Those proceedings continued on in the probate 

court, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as Justice Breyer 

indicated, can't you just, for purposes of 

understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie 

Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is 

valid, we will assume the will is valid? All we're 

saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be 

liable to us in tort. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Kennedy, 

again, a critical element of her cause of action is 

the invalidity of the trust as a matter of fact and 

law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? Why? That is to 

say, what the finding is, is that there was a different 

matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go 

draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in 

the value of my property during the 13 months we're

married, do it, and they never did it. Now, that seems 

to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or 

with the will. It just happens that those are 

evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely 

happened with the catchall trust. 

So I don't see why those are necessary. I 

don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I 

don't see whether or not those are barred, those 

particular facts have anything to do with this, as far 

as jurisdiction is concerned. 

Now, explain to me why I'm wrong. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Justice Breyer. 

First of all, Texas has the right to prescribe the 

elements of its own causes of action, and under Texas 

law, her cause of action depends upon two critical 

things, a legitimate expectancy J. Howard intended to 

do this for her, and the second, tortious conduct of 

some kind. Her claim -- she tries to meet those two 

critical elements by showing two things. One, that J. 

Howard intended to give me this -- this gift in the 

form of this -- this trust, and that it was tortiously 

interfered with because the living trust was rendered 

irrevocable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's just one of the 

things.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Among other things that went 

on were they hired private detectives to go after 

her, to keep her from the bed. I mean, you've read that 

opinion and there are like about 30 things in there. And 

I grant you that one of those things is the fact that 

three pages of the living trust, according to the judge, 

were created after the event of that trust and slipped 

in without his knowledge. I mean, it's quite a story. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Of course, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I -- but as I 

read it, there were many, many, many things involved 

here, and this is just one of them. So how can Texas 

say that you have to prove this particular one as -- as 

opposed to proving a lot of others? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, of course, as 

an aside, we went to great pains in the Ninth Circuit 

to demonstrate why all those findings were clearly 

erroneous and not based on the evidence. 

But assuming them to be so, which we dispute, 

again, looking at her claim, that is the critical 

element of her claim. If, in fact, there -- if, in 

fact, the living trust was made revocable, then at any 

point in time, he could have funded, if -- if he had it 

as revocable until his death, he could have funded her

gift that she alleges and she would have no damage 

claim. It is because of the trust becoming irrevocable 

that he was prevented from doing it. That is her 

claim. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but her claim is assume 

it's been made irrevocable. I just want some money 

from this guy. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's all she's saying, as 

I understand it. She -- she can -- as I understand her 

cause of action, it can proceed on the assumption the 

will is valid, the -- the trust is valid. Just give me 

the money that I would have had. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, as a matter of 

Texas law, she cannot establish a legitimate 

expectancy. Again, once the probate court -- and the 

probate court alone has the right to determine the 

validity of an estate plan. Once the probate court has 

determined that as a matter of Texas law, all claims 

about expectancies contrary to those provided in the --

in the plan are foreclosed. That's the Thompson case 

and the Neill case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're arguing a 

preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought 

it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say

about Texas law. There's no finding in this record of 

what Texas law is other than what you have just told 

us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not. 

But the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed 

to this probate exception, and that's what we're here 

to decide. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, preclusion 

will also not work. Res judicata and collateral 

estoppel will also not work because the parties in the 

Federal proceeding are merely a subset of the parties 

in the probate court. The probate court's judgment is 

unique because it has a binding-against-the-world 

effect. Federal courts cannot pull chunks of the 

critical issues into the Federal court because doing 

so creates an inconsistency of judgments potentially. 

Where the Federal court only has part of the parties 

before it, the Federal court has all -- the probate 

court has all the parties before it. The probate 

court's judgment is binding against the world --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it -- it may be 

that there's another side to that story. For example, 

I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first. 

Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court. Whether 

the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get 

full faith and credit. That's one argument.

 Another is perhaps you can explain to me how 

this all started because I thought that it was a claim 

made against her in the bankruptcy court for 

defamation. Then the claim that she asserts is a 

compulsory counterclaim. She has to make it there or 

she'll lose it. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, the 

claim was not a compulsory counterclaim. The action 

which was -- that Pierce commenced in the -- in the 

bankruptcy court was merely to ask the bankruptcy court 

to decide that if he had a debt against -- if he had a 

claim against her she owed him money, it would be 

nondischargeable in bankruptcy. She then used that 

opportunity to pursue this tortious interference claim 

against Pierce that she was already pursuing in the 

probate court. So because there was a prior pending 

proceeding where she had made the claim --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't understand 

the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be 

nondischargeable. I thought he made a claim. He made 

-- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy 

proceeding. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, Pierce did 

not ask the bankruptcy court to decide the claim. He 

only -- he only asked for the bankruptcy court to

decide whether it was nondischargeable or not. 

But even so -- even so, I think it's 

important to recognize --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He would have to say I 

have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going 

to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim. He has to 

at least assert I have a claim. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: But bankruptcy judges do that, 

Justice Ginsburg. They decide only the 

nondischargeability aspect of claims rather than the 

claims themselves. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has to be a real claim. 

It can't be if I have a claim. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg, because 

the nondischargeability jurisdiction in bankruptcy is 

unique. You allow the claim to be determined in a 

proper court of competent jurisdiction, and then the 

bankruptcy court decides whether it's nondischargeable 

or not. That's how it should proceed particularly 

where, as here, her claim requires, as -- in order for 

it to -- to be valid, to determine the validity or 

nonvalidity of J. Howard's estate plan. 

Now, the United States --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't -- I 

don't see how the interference with the probate court

that you're articulating is any greater than the 

interference in Markham. In Markham, it was a decision 

by a Federal court that these claimants were not 

going to claim under the will. Why is -- isn't that 

even greater than the interference you're complaining 

of? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Chief Justice Roberts. 

You can readily divide the Court's precedents into two 

categories, those where there was impermissible 

interference and therefore no jurisdiction, and those 

where there isn't. On the impermissible interference 

side, you have a case like Federal court cannot 

determine the validity of an estate plan, Armstrong, 

Gaines v. Chew. A Federal -- a Federal court cannot 

determine --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it an estate plan or a 

will? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: In Sutton --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you -- you -- you're 

stretching the probate concept from determining whether 

the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the 

will to also determining what goes into the probate 

estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and 

so forth. That to me is -- is something quite 

different from probating a will.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, the probate 

exception protects the integrity of the succession 

process. If the documents you're looking at deal with 

the succession of the property, as the living trust and 

will do in this case, it is encompassed within the 

probate exception in the Sutton case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't -- I don't see 

your -- your logic there. Of course, it protects the 

succession process, but it does not follow that 

everything that implicates a succession process falls 

within the probate exception. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct. Correct, Justice 

Souter. But here the succession was determined under 

the living trust, and in Sutton v. English, that's 

exactly the same scenario. Moses Hubbard left a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if there had been a 

joint bank account, the succession would have been 

determined based on the validity of the joint bank 

account, and that certainly wouldn't have fallen within 

the probate exception. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the joint -- where you 

have the equivalent of tenancies in the entirety, I'd 

say that's a separate issue. 

Here, however, the living trust performed all 

the functions of a traditional will, unlike a joint

bank account. In the Sutton case, you had both a will 

and a trust, just like in this case. There, Moses 

Hubbard left a will and a trust. Mary Jane Hubbard 

enjoyed the benefits of the trust for her life. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- does Texas law 

provide that a -- a living trust must be executed and 

administered with the formalities of a will? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite the same, Justice 

Souter. Not quite the same. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you have to get 

beyond our probate exception cases to cover the living 

trust. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: But in Sutton v. English, 

there was both a will and a trust, exactly the same as 

here. The plaintiffs were just going after the 

property. We just want the assets. We're saying we're 

not touching the trust and the will. This Court held 

-- this Court held, wait a minute. Only the Texas 

probate courts may determine whether these instruments 

are valid or not. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but she's not --

she's not even going after the assets in this case. 

She's asserting an in personam claim against the 

individual. Correct? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: She is, but that's exactly the

same as Broderick's Will, Chief Justice Roberts, an in 

personam claim against the beneficiaries of the 

allegedly invalid estate plan to impose a constructive 

trust on them to get the money. No matter how you dice 

it or slice it in this case, she is doing an end run 

around the probate proceeding. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they're going 

to impose a constructive trust, are they? All -- all 

they're going to say is pay her the money. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: But why are they going to say 

pay her the money? 

JUSTICE BREYER: They're going to say it 

because they make a finding that through a whole 

variety of various devices, all of which were listed, 

that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through 

something called the catchall trust was prevented in 

about 15 ways. And even if you're right that there's a 

Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped 

in, well, how do we know? Maybe it was a valid GRAT 

trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J. 

Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have 

figured out what had happened before he died and he 

would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out. Do 

what I want. Revoke it. But all that is just 

hypothetical. I'm just using that to show you why I

think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the

MR. BRUNSTAD: What's not evidentiary, 

Justice Breyer, is the fact that in order to prove a 

legitimate expectancy, she must establish that the 

validated estate plan is in fact invalid. And under 

Texas law, that can only be done in the probate court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the cite on that that 

I -- that I need for --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, in our brief we cite to 

many, many cases, Your Honor. I would -- I would 

specifically refer you to --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying you can't 

bring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos --

interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas 

unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Your Honor, 

and those are the Neill v. Yett and the Thompson --

Thompson v. Deloitte cases, which I was reading to 

before. And the Court said as a matter of law, the 

final probate court judgment bars any claim that 

appellees tortiously interfered with any inheritance 

expectancy because, in light of the final invalid 

probate court judgment, appellant has --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- but that's res

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Scalia, it is not res 

judicata for the following reason. Not only may a 

Federal court not determine the validity or invalidity 

after the probate court, it may not do so before the 

probate court has had a chance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that, but that case 

doesn't say that. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: That case doesn't say that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what case do you 

have that says that? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: The cases -- there is no 

specific case where someone has tried to litigate a 

tortious interference claim in Federal court before the 

probate court has had -- has had its say. 

Under Texas law, however, because of the 

preclusive effect of that determination, Vickie would 

be able to come to the probate court and say, look, J. 

Howard intended to give me this. It's a finding of 

intent. That's preclusive on the probate court. The 

probate court would be perhaps prohibited from saying, 

oh, I can't determine under -- that the valid estate 

plan gives the intent to somebody else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the mere fact that you

if -- if some other court says the same thing first, 

you won't be bound by that. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, though, Justice 

Scalia, is that the probate court is supposed to make 

that finding in a judgment good against the world. But 

all of a sudden, part of the world who has done an end 

run around the probate proceeding has now gone to some 

other court for a critical determination of fact that 

the probate court must decide and always must decide in 

determining the validity of an estate plan --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you are suggesting 

an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to 

preclude other courts from dealing with related, not 

identical matters, and that's just not the way our 

system works. You can bring duplicative proceedings in 

different courts. One will finish first and that will 

bind the others. But I -- I never heard of a State 

court being able to say, because we are a probate 

court, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case 

someplace else. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only court 

I've heard of that can do that is the Federal

bankruptcy court. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Just as a Federal bankruptcy 

court is in rem and executes and enters some judgments 

good against the world with respect to some issues, a 

probate court does the same thing. You have exactly 

the same reason why the probate court does it as in the 

bankruptcy court. 

Now, this Court has recognized in Tilt v. 

Kelsey, for example, that the State has a sovereign 

interest in deciding the scope of its probate procedure 

that the State may, this Court said in Broderick's 

Will, provide for the probate court to enter a judgment 

good against the world, whether the person was a party 

to the proceeding or not. If a -- if a Federal court 

can predetermine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the definition of 

an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam 

judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain 

old money judgment. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: But in a race to judgment, 

Your Honor, if the Federal court gets to decide this 

critical issue of intent before the probate court, it 

preempts the probate court from doing its core probate 

function of validating or invalidating an estate plan. 

That would render our probate system unworkable. That

is why --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Brunstad --

MR. BRUNSTAD: -- this is a jurisdictional 

doctrine. 

Yes, Justice Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you two 

questions? First, if there were no such animal as the 

probate exception, would there have been bankruptcy 

court jurisdiction over your claim? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: We argue no, Justice Stevens, 

because as we argued in the Ninth Circuit, there was 

not even bankruptcy jurisdiction because the other side 

never responded to our argument that the outcome of 

this case would not result in any money going to 

creditors of her estate. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- you would 

prevail even if there were no probate exception in your 

view. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: That's our argument. The 

Ninth Circuit did not address that ground, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And my -- my second 

question is I noticed you quoted from a Minnesota Law 

Review about 250 cases, and the -- your opponent 

pointed out that the -- the next sentence of the 

article said the holdings don't support the

generalization. And I would just like to ask you, 

apart from the Markham case, what is the case -- what 

holding of a case lends the greatest support to your 

probate exception argument. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that 

the Sutton case is the closest. The next closest is 

Broderick's Will. Sutton again involved both a trust 

and a will and was a construction of Texas law, which 

we say the Court has already decided in Sutton, and 

Texas law, which is undisputed, has the effects which 

we say it has in the brief. They did not contest, 

Justice Ginsburg, our construction or interpretation of 

Texas law. 

I think also that the Court's decisions in 

Tarver and Fouvergne and also Ellis and O'Callaghan --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking you to rank 

them. I don't want a list of cases that have a lot of 

dicta because some of these cases went off on laches, 

some went off a lot of different grounds than purely --

than -- some of them don't even mention probate. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think that 

it's -- it would be helpful if I could give you a 

thumbnail sketch breaking down, what I was trying to do 

earlier, between those where there's impermissible 

interference and those where there's not impermissible

interference. The United States' characterization I 

think is incorrect. 

For example, again, this Court has determined 

there's no jurisdiction for a Federal court to 

determine the validity of an instrument. That's the 

first case in Armstrong v. Lear and also Gaines v. 

Chew. 

Also, this Court has determined there's no 

Federal jurisdiction to determine the invalidity of an 

estate plan. That's Tarver, Fouvergne, and 

O'Callaghan, Broderick's Will, Sutton, and Ellis. 

This Court has determined that Federal courts 

do not have jurisdiction to administer the probate 

estate. That's Byers v. McAuley. 

This Court has determined that there is no 

Federal jurisdiction to take possession of the assets 

in the probate court. That is also Broderick's Will. 

I'm sorry. That is Byers v. McAuley. 

This Court has determined one may not impose 

a constructive trust on the beneficiaries as, in 

essence, a way to get property to them. That's 

Broderick's Will and Sutton. 

This Court has determined there's no 

jurisdiction to recover property from the beneficiary 

because of an alleged invalidity of a will. That's --

that's the Ellis case. 

This Court has determined there's no 

jurisdiction for the Federal court to direct an 

accounting from the administrator. That's the Waterman 

case. 

This Court has determined there's no 

jurisdiction to interfere with the State court's 

possession of the assets, again Waterman, Williams, 

Yonley, and Borer. 

Now, no jurisdiction. It's always been a 

jurisdictional doctrine. 

And for the same reasons this Court refused 

to recharacterize the -- the domestic relations 

exception as a abstention doctrine, the Court should 

also decline to do so here under the probate exception. 

Now, the other side of the schema is, when is 

it permissible for a Federal court to undertake a 

probate-related matter? Well, if the State allows the 

claim, particular claim, to be brought outside its 

exclusive probate system, then Federal courts may 

entertain jurisdiction as well. 

JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, in Texas if you 

have to go through all this probate stuff and 

everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my 

mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that

precluded to bring that tort action when the person 

who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about 

it? 

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, all claims of 

incomplete gift, which Vickie's claim is here, compete 

with an estate plan. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, in other words, if 

it -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives 

a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when 

they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, 

nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore. You have to go to 

the probate court. 

MR. BRUNSTAD: If in fact the ring passed 

under his valid estate plan, yes. Because the ring 

passed under the valid estate plan, you have to 

overturn the estate plan before you say the property 

goes somewhere else.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Thank you, Your Honor.

whether the Texas court had all of the material before 

it that was before the bankruptcy court, the answer to 

that can be seen at page 45 of the appendix where the 

district court judge says that there were 400 boxes of 

documents. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but did those documents 

-- did those boxes contain the key documents --

MR. RICHLAND: They did. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- about the catchall trust? 

MR. RICHLAND: They did. They contained the 

-- perhaps the most key documents, which were the 

billing records that showed that that trust was 

actually drafted. The trust, of course, never saw the 

light of day, but those billing records reflected that. 

And none of that was in front of the Texas probate 

court. 

In addition, Justice Breyer, you mentioned 

that there were a number of other instances of tortious 

misconduct that were found by Justice Carter, in 

addition to the forging of the -- of the irrevocability 

point. Indeed, Justice Carter found that there were 

massive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce 

Marshall in his last days, and those asset transfers 

were made in exchange for notes that were payable years 

in the future. This was after J. Howard had been

diagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a 

heart attack. Annuities were used to pay for those as 

well. So that he was essentially stripped of all of 

his assets by the time he was dead. There was -- there 

were no assets in the probate estate at that time. 

Justice Ginsburg, I would refer you to 

appendix page 42 where the -- the district court 

indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary 

complaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the 

bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused, 

several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be 

filed in a response. 

Mr. Brunstad indicated that what happened 

here was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it 

was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably 

because there was some dissatisfaction on Ms. 

Marshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was 

going. In fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very 

specifically the fact that the first time that the 

tortious interference with gift claim was made was in 

the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim. 

And I would just conclude by stating that the 

cause of action that was at issue here was really a 

very common one. It's the -- not in and of itself, but 

it's common to make a claim against the estate in debt

or that a gift was given, and that may, indeed, 

diminish the estate that is eventually passed. But 

that doesn't invalidate any of the estate planning 

documents. It simply means that something that might 

otherwise have been within the estate was not included 

in the estate. 

That's really all that happened here. The 

claim was for tortious interference with gift. That, 

indeed, may have diminished the amount or may not have 

since J. Howard was actually quite an active man at the 

time that he made this -- this gift or intended to make 

the gift, and was still doing business deals. He may 

have increased his -- his assets enormously at that 

point in time. 

But in any event, what it certainly does not 

do is, it does not invalidate an estate plan. It does 

not invalidate a will, and it certainly didn't 

invalidate the trust or the will in this case. 

If there are any further questions, I'd be 

happy to answer them.
