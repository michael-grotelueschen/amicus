3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-820, 

Roselva Chaidez v. United States. 

6  Mr. Fisher. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  In the more than 20 years since this Court 

12 decided Teague v. Lane, it's had more than a dozen cases 

13 in which people have sought habeas relief based on 

14 ineffective assistance of counsel, but this Court has 

never once held that applying Strickland in those 

16 divergent factual settings constituted a new rule. 

17  For two reasons, this Court should reject 

18 the government's argument to do so for the first time 

19 here. 

First, Padilla was dictated by precedent; 

21 that is, like other Strickland cases that came before 

22 it, this Court in Padilla simply applied Strickland's 

23 formula of assessing attorney performance according to 

24 prevailing professional norms to a new set of facts. 

The second --

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a surprise to 

2 the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other 

3 way? 

4  MR. FISHER: No, I don't think so, 

Your Honor. Two -- two things about the lower courts. 

6  The first is, there are only three lower 

7 court decisions that postdate the 1996 act that the 

8 government can cite that came out the other way in terms 

9 of the question presented here. 

And the second thing is, even within those 

11 cases and within those courts, they didn't distinguish 

12 between deportation advice and other kinds of advice. 

13 They distinguished between acts and omissions; that is 

14 to say, it was a uniform rule in the lower courts at the 

time this Court decided Padilla that misadvice 

16 concerning the right to -- I'm sorry, concerning 

17 deportation consequences of a plea did violate 

18 Strickland. 

19  So the distinction in lower courts was not 

between deportation advice and other kinds of advice; 

21 the distinction was between acts and omissions. 

22  And in Padilla itself --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So maybe it 

24 was -- maybe it was a surprise to the members of this 

Court that disagreed with that --

1  MR. FISHER: No --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- with the ruling 

3 in Padilla. 

4  MR. FISHER: Well, obviously, there was a 

dissent in Padilla, but this Court has held before that 

6 new applications of Strickland did not constitute a new 

7 rule, even though there were dissents. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher --

9  MR. FISHER: In Williams --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what -- what about the 

11 argument that Strickland doesn't come into play unless 

12 the Sixth Amendment includes the collateral consequences 

13 in counsel's obligation to defend a defendant in a 

14 criminal case under the argument that up to -- up to 

Padilla, only advice relevant to guilt or innocence and 

16 sentencing was required, not collateral consequences? 

17  MR. FISHER: Well, that was obviously the 

18 argument that the State of Kentucky made in that case, 

19 and this Court dealt with it in part two of Padilla. 

Now, remember, Justice Ginsburg, the Court 

21 did not extend Strickland to collateral consequences in 

22 Padilla. It actually reserved that question. What it 

23 held is that deportation consequences are not removed 

24 from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment. 

So, remember, Strickland --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's also a question 

2 if -- if conviction meant loss of a professional 

3 license, that would be an open question? 

4  MR. FISHER: I think -- I think that's an 

open question after Padilla. 

6  What this Court held in Padilla -- and this 

7 is the second to last sentence in part two -- is that 

8 advice concerning deportation consequences of a guilty 

9 plea are not categorically removed from the Sixth 

Amendment. 

11  So what I understood the Court to do in 

12 Padilla was take the ordinary Strickland formula of 

13 prevailing professional norms and simply apply it to 

14 this criminal case. Remember, Padilla itself was a 

criminal case. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's always the case. 

17 I mean, we -- we never come out with a decision that 

18 doesn't rely upon some preexisting principle. We always 

19 cite some preexisting principle. Does that mean that 

every case of ours is -- is not new law? 

21  MR. FISHER: Of course not. The question 

22 this Court asked under Teague is whether it broke new 

23 ground. And I think what this Court said in Padilla is, 

24 we reject the artificial restriction on Strickland that 

the lower courts have created; so, therefore, this Court 

6

1 simply reaffirmed Strickland. It didn't --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Fisher, think 

3 about this in an AEDPA context. I mean, assume that you 

4 have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that 

the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along 

6 and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA 

7 context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction --

8 we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law 

9 is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held. 

Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy 

11 case that the AEDPA standard had not been met? 

12  MR. FISHER: I think you -- you may well 

13 find that, Justice Kagan, but the reason why is because 

14 you'd find that there was not an unreasonable 

application of preexisting law. What you would not say 

16 is that the clearly established law is any different. 

17  So, remember, this Court -- this case, 

18 because it's a Federal case, raises only the first 

19 question under AEDPA, in a sense, which is what's the 

clearly established law? And this is the Chief -- I 

21 think this is responsive to the Chief Justice's question 

22 about the dissent. 

23  There was a disagreement on this Court about 

24 how to apply Strickland, but the question's whether a 

new legal rule was created, not whether there was an 

7

Official 

1 unreasonable application --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why pick on Strickland? I 

3 mean, you could say that about any principle of law that 

4 we rely on: The dissent thought that that principle 

applied a different way here. 

6  What is different about Strickland that it 

7 enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing 

8 to any principle of law? 

9  MR. FISHER: Well, I think the best response 

is what this Court said in Williams, which is Strickland 

11 provides sufficient guidance to resolve virtually every 

12 ineffective assistance claim. 

13  So what this Court said in Williams is we do 

14 not make new law when we apply Strickland. 

I think Justice Kennedy --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any -- Mr. 

17 Fisher, is there any application, you call it application 

18 of Strickland, that would qualify as a new rule, any 

19 application at all, or is just Strickland never a new 

rule? 

21  MR. FISHER: I think so long as you simply 

22 applied Strickland, you wouldn't create a new rule. 

23  If you for example, said, a certain kind of 

24 claim does not need to have a prejudice showing, that 

would be a new rule.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that a 

2 really skilled attorney, after negotiating a plea 

3 bargain, or even representing a client at trial but then 

4 losing, is very skilled in ensuring that the defendant 

can go into the general population, not into solitary 


6 confinement; but also a skilled trial attorney, he's 


7 just not very good at that, so the defendant goes to 


8 solitary. 


9  Could -- if there was an evolution of the 


law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court 

11 later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a 

12 part of the attorney's -- skill and competence in 

13 representation, that that would be retroactive? 

14  MR. FISHER: Justice Kennedy, it wouldn't be 

enough to have a later evolution of prevailing norms 

16 because Strickland is a backward-looking device. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that there are then, in 

18 answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, some cases in 

19 which there could be a new rule of ineffective 

assistance of counsel under Strickland? 

21  MR. FISHER: Well, I think the answer to 

22 that question is yes, and, as I said, something like a 

23 scenario where this Court --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't understand 

how that works with my hypothetical.

20

25

Official 

1  MR. FISHER: Well, let me -- let me try to 

2 work with your hypothetical. I think what I hear your 

3 hypothetical to say is that prevailing norms change, and 

4 they evolve to a certain point where certain kinds of 

advice is required, which is much what this Court said 

6 in Padilla about -- about deportation advice. 

7  You would have -- you would not have a new 

8 rule to simply recognize that at the time that attorney 

9 gave advice, that -- that Strickland was violated. 

It would be a new rule, I think, 

11 Justice Kennedy, to say that Strickland requires relief, 

12 even though at the time the advice was given the 

13 prevailing norm had not yet crystalized into the degree 

14 that this Court requires. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only new law is not a 

16 new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of 

17 before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an 

18 evolution of mores; is that it? 

19  MR. FISHER: No, I think what I'm trying to 

say is --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought you 

22 said. 

23  MR. FISHER: -- Strickland -- Strickland 

24 sets up a two-part test, and we're only talking about 

the first part, which is attorney performance. And 

10

25

Official 

1 that -- that question is keyed to attorney performance 


2 at the time judged by reasonableness according to 


3 prevailing professional norms. 


4  Now, those prevailing professional norms 


are, in a sense, a factual question, an empirical 

6 question that --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher, it would seem to 

8 me that this case presents a kind of threshold question. 

9 Before you get to the question of what are prevailing 

professional norms and whether they have been complied 

11 with, there is the question of whether the Sixth 

12 Amendment applies to collateral consequences at all and, 

13 if so, which collateral consequences. 

14  And that’s the question on which Padilla 

opines, and that's the question that seems, you know, 

16 very different from anything that Strickland’s discussed, 

17 not just an application of Strickland. 

18  MR. FISHER: Well, let me give you two 

19 answers to that, because I think that's the government's 

main argument here. 

21  First is, as I've tried to say before, 

22 simply saying that an exception that the lower courts 

23 created doesn't exist -- doesn't create a new rule. 

24 Imagine this Court said -- laid down a rule that covered 

all cars, and the lower courts devised an exception to 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

1 that rule for convertibles. And when the Court -- when 

2 the issue came to this Court, this Court said, well, no, 

3 when we said all cars, we meant all cars. 

4  To me, that doesn't create a new rule. And 

I think that's what this Court said in part two of 


6 Padilla, is that this artificial restriction that the 


7 lower courts have devised simply can't be grounded in 


8 Strickland --


9  JUSTICE BREYER: How many had? 


MR. FISHER: Pardon me? 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: How many had? I mean, I 

12 would have thought it was common sense that a lawyer 

13 should tell the client the terrible things that are 

14 going to happen to him if he pleads guilty, those things 

that the lawyer knows or should know about and the 

16 client may not. Alright. That's a very general rule 

17 at that level. 

18  But some courts have said, no, that isn't 

19 true. That isn't true unless -- if it's -- as Justice 

Kagan said, if it's a collateral exception, if it's a 

21 collateral consequence. How many had? Was it only 

22 Kentucky, or was it fairly widespread, this exception? 

23  MR. FISHER: Only three federal circuits 

24 had had a ruling like that after the 1996 act --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there aren't that 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

20

25

Official 

1 many. There are eleven, and two of them are 

2 specialized. 

3  MR. FISHER: Well, if I can finish my 

4 answer, only three had rulings like that after the 1996 

act, and all three of those relied on pre-'96 act 

6 rulings. And as court of appeals judges said, that's 

7 just not quite enough for us to be entitled to overturn 

8 our prior circuit precedent. 

9  So while the government comes here today 

and suggests that ten circuits and all these state 

11 courts had ruled, in a sense, in its favor, you know, 

12 it's almost more accurate to say none had had this issue 

13 cleanly presented to them after the 1996 act. 

14  And, Justice Kagan, if I --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but even before the 

16 1996 act, deportation -- there were deportation 

17 consequences. Those consequences were enhanced by the 

18 1996 act; but, even before that, a reasonable lawyer, 

19 you might think, would have a conversation with his 

client about the deportation consequences of a 

21 conviction. 

22  MR. FISHER: That may well be true, Justice 

23 Kagan, but I'm saying in the '96 act, as this Court said 

24 in Padilla, whatever prevail -- whatever doubt there may 

have been about prevailing professional norms 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 crystallized at that time because of the severity. 

2  And I think that's the second answer I 

3 wanted to give to your question about this so-called 

4 threshold question in Padilla, is that even if there is 

some question as to whether the Sixth Amendment applies 

6 beyond, as the government puts it, criminal jeopardy, 

7 this Court had already answered that question in St. Cyr, 

8 where this Court said, in the text around footnotes 48 

9 and 50, that any competent lawyer would give his client 

advice and a warning about deportation consequences of a 

11 plea. 

12  So even if you needed more than Strickland 

13 itself, St. Cyr gave that to you in 2001, which is 

14 enough to decide this case; it was enough to decide 

Padilla. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: If a court -- if this Court 

17 were to decide in a future case that effective 

18 assistance of counsel requires an attorney to advise the 

19 client of all collateral consequences, potential loss of 

a professional license, etc., would that be a rule that 

21 was dictated by precedent? 

22  MR. FISHER: I think it would -- I doubt it, 

23 Justice Alito. I think it would depend on what the 

24 prevailing professional norms looked like. 

I take it what this Court said in Strickland 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 and what it reaffirmed in Padilla is, we're not going 

2 to -- we're not going to micromanage effective 

3 assistance of counsel. We're going to leave it to 

4 prevailing professional norms. 

I seriously doubt that prevailing 

6 professional norms would require the holding that you 

7 described; but, to the extend they did, I don't think it 

8 would be a new rule. To the extent they didn't and 

9 this Court said, we're going to push the Sixth Amendment 

beyond that, you would have a new rule. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I suppose you 

12 are right, I'm sure you're right that the mere fact that 

13 there was a dissent in the case that adopted the rule 

14 does not necessarily make it a new rule. But you, on 

the other hand, would agree, would you not, that those 

16 who dissented from that case would regard it as a new 

17 rule? 

18  MR. FISHER: That's a tricky question to 

19 answer, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's an easy 

21 question to answer. 

22  MR. FISHER: Well, I think I could answer it 

23 one of two ways. One is I could say yes, they did -- to 

24 the extent they did regard it as a new rule, I think the 

dissent was, with all due respect, slightly mistaken

1 about what the holding in Padilla was, which was not 

2 to --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fair. That's fair. 

4 The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying. 

MR. FISHER: Well, I think that the way the 

6 dissent put it was -- is that advice is now required 

7 beyond criminal cases and criminal jeopardy. 

8  The way that I think Padilla -- majority 

9 described its holding was that this is a criminal 

defendant in a criminal case entitled to advice from his 

11 criminal lawyer, and the most important piece of advice 

12 as to whether to take a plea or not involves deportation 

13 consequences. 

14  And, Justice Scalia, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it just seems to me 

16 that the predicate question that we decided in Padilla 

17 was that Strickland applies to matters not within the 

18 control of the trial judge. That it seems to me was a 

19 holding the Court had not addressed before and that 

other courts had not addressed before. 

21  MR. FISHER: Well, it had to be more than 

22 that, Justice Kennedy, because, of course, there is lots 

23 of --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, this is --

MR. FISHER: -- ineffective assistance 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 cases –-

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a predicate question. 

3  MR. FISHER: Well, no, no. But I'm saying 

4 there are lots of ineffective assistance cases before 

Padilla that involved matters beyond the judge, that 

6 turned on what the jury did, of course. And I could --

7 I may be able to think of others beyond those two 

8 scenarios, but there's no language to that effect in 

9 Padilla. 

What the Court said is that we have never 

11 created artificial distinctions about what an attorney 

12 has to do. As this Court put it in Strickland, 

13 Strickland itself, the client is advised to his lawyer's 

14 advice about all important decisions. And as this Court 

said in St. Cyr and other cases, the most important 

16 consideration as to whether to plead guilty is whether 

17 somebody will be deported. 

18  And so you put that together and you had all 

19 of the law you needed, certainly by 2001. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you've 

21 been -- you've been asked this, and I'm not sure I got 

22 your answer. Give me an example of something that --

23 like the consequences in Padilla that would not be 

24 covered by your argument? 

MR. FISHER: Well, some sort of consequences 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 that -- that prevailing norms didn't require a lawyer to 

2 advise his client on. 

3  So, for example, I would expect that a 

4 lawyer is not necessarily required to give detailed 

advice about future employment opportunities to a client 

6 depending on whether he pleads guilty. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You answered that 

8 question when I asked it, you said that removal of a 

9 professional license would not fall under -- wouldn't --

would be at least an open question. 

11  MR. FISHER: It -- I think it would be an 

12 open question as to how Strickland would apply. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you had --

14  MR. FISHER: I simply don't know what the 

prevailing professional norms are in that situation. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you had that 

17 case, what would you rely on in arguing in favor of the 

18 habeas petition? 

19  MR. FISHER: Well, I would start with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would start with 

21 Strickland, and you would talk with -- Padilla, right? 

22  MR. FISHER: Yes, that's what I would do. 

23 And I would look to prevailing professional norms. 

24  And I think, if I could give a generic 

answer, the question would be whether or not that kind 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 of advice is so important to the client's decision 

2 making -- and that's the word the Court used in 

3 Strickland -- that prevailing norms require the lawyer 

4 to give that kind of advice. 

If the answer to that was yes --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you want us to write 

7 this opinion in support of your position, and to begin 

8 by saying, prevailing professional norms do not change? 

9  MR. FISHER: No, no, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that 

11 you're -- that the defense bar generally would want to 

12 say that prevailing professional norms change, but 

13 that -- that hurts you in this case. 

14  MR. FISHER: No, I don't think it does, 

Justice Kennedy. I agree with your premise, I think, 

16 that prevailing professional norms can and do evolve. 

17 And so the question this Court asked in Strickland is, 

18 as of the time the advice was given, did the prevailing 

19 norms require that? 

The advice was given in this case almost at 

21 the identical time of the advice in Padilla and, indeed, 

22 far after St. Cyr. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I notice -- I'm not sure 

24 it was cited in the brief, but the ABA comment in 1999 

said, now the ABA standard applies to professional 

19
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

1 standards, and that goes beyond the constitutional 

2 minimum. So that doesn't seem to me to help you, 

3 either. 

4  MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure that's what 

the ABA said. I believe the ABA, quite rightly, said, 

6 we don't make constitutional law in this body; we leave 

7 that to the courts. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It said, it should be 

9 stated that these standards do more than enforce the 

constitutional minimum. 

11  MR. FISHER: Well, I think there may be 

12 elements of the standards that did. 

13  But, remember, we're not just talking about 

14 the ABA here. As this Court noted in Padilla and as one 

of the amicus briefs from NACDL notes in this case, 

16 there's a wide --

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm talking about 

18 the -- I'm talking about the ABA here, if you want to 

19 give some other authority; but, I say that, it seems to

21  MR. FISHER: Well, then I'll rely on just 

22 the overall body of professional norms, which is what 

23 this Court looked to in Padilla and what it's always 

24 said it has to look to under Strickland cases.

1 to talking about the -- the nature of the 

2 backward-looking effect of Strickland, I think there is 

3 an important second question in this case, that if this 

4 Court were inclined to hold that there was a new rule, 

you'd be forced to confront. And it's a very serious 

6 question involving this Court's administration of 

7 criminal appellate procedure. And that is whether 

8 Teague ought to apply at all in this context. 

9  We believe that under the system this Court 

established in Massaro for handling IAC claims, it 

11 simply doesn't make any sense to apply Teague here and, 

12 indeed, would throw a gigantic monkey wrench into the 

13 way things are -- have been done for the last decade 

14 after that decision. 

And -- and for two reasons: One, in 

16 theory --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fisher, before you get 

18 to the reasons --

19  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- the government says that 

21 you forfeited this argument. Could you address that? 

22  MR. FISHER: Sure. We didn't forfeit this 

23 argument. It's fairly included within our question 

24 presented. We raised it at the first available 

opportunity in the Seventh Circuit because we were

1 foreclosed by circuit precedent from raising it. So we 

2 raised it before an en banc court. 

3  And in our cert reply brief, lest there be 

4 any doubt, when the government suggested that we would 

be restricted to arguing the new rule question in this 

6 case, we put a footnote in our cert reply brief which 

7 expressly told the Court, no, we view this question 

8 presented as including this additional argument, whether 

9 Teague applies or not. 

So I think we gave fair notice to the Court. 

11 And if you have any doubt --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you haven't presented 

13 this argument to any court before; is that right? 

14  MR. FISHER: We made the argument in an 

en banc petition to the Seventh Circuit, which we 

16 couldn't make it to a panel because Seventh Circuit law 

17 had already held that Teague applied in this context. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Is it relevant that this is 

19 a coram nobis proceeding, rather than a habeas 

proceeding? 

21  MR. FISHER: No. I think we agree with the 

22 government that it doesn't -- matter. 

23  The way we see this is it's a first Federal 

24 filing. It's a first post-conviction filing, and it's a 

timely filing. The government is not challenging the

1 timeliness of this filing. 

2  So the question you have to ask yourself is, 

3 under a system where this Court has said that IAC claims 

4 should not be brought on direct review, but rather 

should be brought on collateral review, whether you can 

6 apply Teague at the very first instance that somebody 

7 has to make a constitutional claim, and we think not. 

8 On theory --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: On that question, before 

you -- not in relation to the Massaro argument, but in 

11 relation to the Teague argument, you think the rule in 

12 coram nobis is the same, that the Teague rule applies 

13 fully in coram nobis in the same way that it applies in 

14 habeas? 

MR. FISHER: Well, that's the way the whole 

16 case has been litigated, and I think that's a fair 

17 assumption. 

18  The reason that we're on coram nobis instead 

19 of --

JUSTICE ALITO: Have we ever held that? 

21  MR. FISHER: No, you haven't. And so if you 

22 want to be extra careful, you can -- you can say the 

23 parties haven't challenged that. 

24  Remember, the reason that we're on coram 

nobis is Ms. Chaidez was not in custody. And so if

1 somebody -- so it's, in a sense, interchangeable with a 

2 2255. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, yes, I understand 

4 that, but the consequences of a retroactive application 

in coram nobis are more severe than they are in habeas, 

6 aren't they, because of the lack of a statute of 

7 limitations? 

8  MR. FISHER: More severe in the sense -- I'm 

9 not sure I understand in what sense. 

JUSTICE ALITO: You -- well, in -- under --

11 under the current Federal habeas statute, you have a 

12 rather short statute of limitations to file the habeas 

13 petition. 

14  Under coram nobis, if you prevail, then 

people who were -- who were convicted of offenses 

16 decades ago can raise the Padilla claim, can they not? 

17  MR. FISHER: I'm not sure they -- I'm not 

18 sure they could, Justice Alito. At Pet. App. 38, you'll 

19 see the district court dealing with the timeliness of 

this petition. And the district court finds that Ms. 

21 Chaidez could proceed because she used all reasonable 

22 diligence in bringing this claim. 

23  And the government can make laches 

24 arguments, can make other arguments to defeat that. The 

government has renounced those -- I mean, they let those

1 arguments go in the Seventh Circuit and don't raise them 

2 again here. 

3  But I think that, at a minimum, it would be 

4 fair to say that somebody needs to bring a petition as 

soon as the government advises them they're going to 

6 seek deportation. 

7  I'm not even sure, Justice Alito --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: What if someone -- if there 

9 is an attempt to -- a notice of removal for someone 

based on a conviction that occurred a long time ago, 

11 then that would be --

12  MR. FISHER: You could -- you could have a 

13 time lag, but there is two things to remember. First 

14 is, you might have a timely 2255 in that circumstance, 

too, because, remember, in Holland v. Florida, this 

16 Court held that equitable tolling is available for 

17 people with IA -- with ineffective assistance that leads 

18 to them not being able to make the claim earlier. 

19  And the second thing is, as I was discussing 

with Justice Kennedy, the backward-looking aspect of 

21 Strickland would -- would require the party -- once you 

22 get more than a little while back, the prevailing norms 

23 may not -- may not be there for that kind of a claim. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher --

MR. FISHER: And so that's --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, are 

2 you -- you're not making any argument that Teague is 

3 inapplicable because this -- the underlying conviction 

4 here is a federal conviction, not a state conviction, 

and Teague emphasized comity to the states; you're not 

6 making that argument? 

7  MR. FISHER: No, I think you could hold 

8 that, and that is -- that is within our argument. I 

9 don't think you need to go that far, Justice Ginsburg. 

As you said, this Court has said time and again that 

11 Teague relies on comity. That's not present in this 

12 case. 

13  But we think a narrower way to decide this 

14 case, and I think the appropriate way to decide this 

case, is to say, at least for ineffective assistance 

16 claims, when you're bringing -- with a Federal prisoner, 

17 or somebody who has been convicted of a Federal crime, 

18 that's bringing their first petition, that Teague can't 

19 apply. 

And what I was just trying to say is 

21 Strickland itself --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except -- except 

23 that -- and I'm interrupting, in a sense, but it's on 

24 the same track -- except that it seems to me that Teague 

does serve the interest of repose, quite apart from

Official 

1 interference with a federal proceeding, and that 

2 interest is surely sacrificed by the holding you wish us 

3 to make here. 

4  MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm glad 

you asked because that was what I was going to say. 

6  In Strickland, this Court dealt with 

7 finality very explicitly and said, we're creating this 

8 standard which is different than other constitutional 

9 standards because we're concerned about finality. And, 

as this Court said at pages 697 and 98, so, therefore, 

11 no different rules ought to apply in collateral 

12 proceedings as in direct review, because this Court 

13 assumed in Strickland itself and it assumed expressly 

14 again in Padilla that all of these claims would be on 

collateral review. 

16  So in all these cases the Court has said 

17 finality -- the concern -- the very concern you 

18 mentioned, Justice Kennedy, is already baked into the 

19 Strickland formula. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, I'm 

21 concerned that creating exceptions to exceptions in 

22 Teague is just a throwback to Linkletter standard --

23  MR. FISHER: Well --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- where we're making 

choices among situations and saying, these will be

1 retroactive, these won't. 

2  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Answer that concern on 

4 my part. 

MR. FISHER: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then answer -- the 

7 next step is the Martinez type case --

8  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is what happens 

with state reviews that are -- that channel IAC claims 

11 to their habeas processes. So what trumps what in that 

12 situation? 

13  MR. FISHER: Okay. Let me answer both those 

14 things. First, we’re not asking this Court to create 

an exception to Teague. We’re simply asking this Court 

16 to say Teague doesn't apply when a claim is, quote, "on 

17 the equivalent of direct review," which is what this 

18 Court said in Martinez v. Ryan. This Court has already 

19 held with respect to IAC that habeas rules, like the 

procedural default rule and like the Stone v. Powell bar 

21 against Fourth Amendment claims, don’t apply in the IAC 

22 context. So this follows exactly from those previous 

23 holdings. 

24  Now, let me say two other things and then I 

can hopefully reserve my time. To answer your question 

28

1 about Martinez in state cases, it would depend on what 

2 the state system looked like, and I think states have 

3 their own decision to make as to whether they want a 

4 system like Arizona's, where these have to be brought in 

collateral proceedings, or whether, as I understand at 

6 least a couple of states do, say, we're going to stay 

7 and delay the entire direct review process, for years 

8 often, to allow the IAC claim to be brought then. 

9  Now, that's exactly what this Court rejected in 

Massaro, and the government asked this Court to reject 

11 that in Massaro; said we don't want that kind of a 

12 system. I don't know why the government is asking for 

13 it for the first time today. 

14  And finally remember, the last thing I would 

like to say is, all these problems raise not only 

16 finality concerns about the stay and remand procedures 

17 the government suggests; they also raise insoluble 

18 conflicts of interest problems for federal defender 

19 offices, who would have to bring IAC claims against 

themselves on direct review in order to preserve their 

21 ability to -- to get full relief for their client. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps on rebuttal -- I 

23 recognize the white light's on -- you could address what 

24 is -- what is the standard you want me to apply to 

determine retroactivity? The brief says, oh, well, it's

1 just new facts applying to the same general rule. Well, 

2 danger invites rescue; the assault on privity is 

3 proceeding to pace; MacPherson v. Buick and the Erie 

4 Railroad case -- it seems to me that those were probably 

new rules, but there -- it's because the facts told us 

6 what should be negligent. If at some point you could 

7 address that, I don't --

8  MR. FISHER: Justice Kennedy, what I would 

9 like to do, and I am happy to elaborate, is the 

formulation as I think you yourself put it in Wright v. 

11 West, which is that a rule that is -- that is applied to 

12 a new set of facts does not create a new rule; but if 

13 you advance the law in some way you do create a new 

14 rule. 

The last thing I would like to say about 

16 consequences is: Remember, the government doesn't even 

17 have any answer for what is going to be half or more of 

18 the situations where people have Padilla-type claims, 

19 which is when they have a guilty plea and waive their 

right to direct appeal. So there the collateral filing 

21 like this is -- is absolutely the equivalent of direct 

22 review. And so I think this Court ought to be very wary 

23 of going down that road. 

24  If I could reserve the time I have left.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

4  MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

6  In Padilla v. Kentucky this Court announced 

7 a new rule within the meaning of Teague v. Lane. 

8 Because --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that's true 

with respect to both components of the advice, the 

11 omission and commission? I mean, it does appear that 

12 every court who dealt with the commission-type claim, 

13 the fraud, the misrepresentation of consequences, said 

14 it's clear you can't lie to your client. Now, is Teague 

now going -- is our ruling here going to depend on the 

16 type of claim that's raised, with respect to IAC? 

17  MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, this 

18 Court in Padilla didn't distinguish between misadvice 

19 and omissions to give advice. And it therefore 

adopted --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At least one of our 

22 concurrences did, or talked to. So assuming --

23 assuming -- is your position that is on the 

24 retroactivity, that it applies to both kinds, omissions 

and commissions, and neither is retroactive? 

31

25

Official 

1  MR. DREEBEN: As for -- as for Padilla's 

2 rationale, the answer is yes, but there is a rationale 

3 that governed, in our view, misadvice claims that 

4 existed before Padilla. It wasn't addressed or embraced 

in Padilla. It was addressed in Justice Alito's 


6 concurring opinion. Justice Alito gave two reasons 


7 which essentially mirrored the reasons that had been 


8 given in the lower courts for treating misadvice 


9 differently. And that is, affirmative misadvice 


violated a more basic duty of counsel that was well 

11 established, which is not to represent that you're 

12 competent on a matter that you are not competent. 

13  And the second distinction between misadvice 

14 and failure to give any advice is that a client has a 

constitutional right to make his or her own decision 

16 about whether to plead guilty; and a lawyer has a 

17 constitutional duty not to get in the way of that by 

18 affirmatively skewing the client's ability to make that 

19 choice. 

And so I would probably not disagree that 

21 misadvice claim was not new before Padilla and it's not 

22 really addressed by Padilla's rationale. It has its own 

23 independent sources, and the courts that had adopted 

24 that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure. Are those 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 sources -- when you say sources, it's professional norm 

2 sources? 

3  MR. DREEBEN: It's a different professional 

4 norm and it's a different aspect of the Sixth Amendment 

right. And all of the courts that had adopted 

6 misadvice -- there were three of them that had done it 

7 in the removal context; there were three more that had 

8 done it in the parole eligibility context -- they all 

9 simultaneously adhered to the view that as a general 

matter there is no obligation to give advice about 

11 collateral consequences. 

12  And they did this, I might add, despite the 

13 fact that, as Justice Kennedy alluded, the ABA, which 

14 was cited as one of the key sources of prevailing 

professional norms, stated in Standard 14.3.2, in the 

16 criminal justice pleas of guilty standards: "To the 

17 extent possible, defense counsel should determine and 

18 advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of any plea 

19 as to the possible collateral consequences that might 

ensue from entry of the contemplated plea." 

21  So there was an aspirational professional 

22 norm that collateral consequences would be on the table, 

23 but all Federal courts that had looked at this question 

24 before Padilla had concluded that collateral 

consequences are outside of the duty of criminal defense

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me 


3 where -- my colleagues were asking about hypothetical 


4 future cases -- I'm asking, do you think that every 


evolving professional norm, no matter how well 


6 established it becomes, would never be subject to the 


7 Teague rule because -- would always be a retroactive 


8 application or a new rule? 


9  MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Sotomayor. 


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are we frozen in time to 

11 whatever the professional standards are that exist today 

12 that the Court has recognized so far? 

13  MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Sotomayor. And I 

14 think this is the key point about Strickland. 

Justice Kennedy made this point in a concurrence in 

16 Wright v. West, and it was later cited by the Court 

17 as -- as reflecting an accurate understanding of 

18 Strickland. It is a basic norm of professional 

19 competence, and it does not turn on professional --

prevailing professional norms in publications such as 

21 the ABA. They are informative. 

22  And those norms can evolve. The Court can 

23 then announce Sixth Amendment applications of them that 

24 will be not -- not new rules. This Court has decided

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the sense

4 time the guilty plea or whatever occurred, it was not 

the professional norm, and then later the professional 

6 norms change and he makes the argument that -- that he's 

7 entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --

8  MR. DREEBEN: No, I say no, Justice Scalia, 

9 because professional norms are judged as of the time of 

the attorney's action. So although the professional 

11 norms can evolve, Strickland always looks to an actor at 

12 the time of the decision. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what your opponent 

14 contends as well? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think you probably should 

16 ask my opponent what he contends, but Strickland is 

17 fairly clear that professional norms at the time of the 

18 attorney's action are what governs. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so given the ABA 

and everything else, why doesn't that apply here?

2 30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then 

3 it turns out that at the time this case began, there was 

4 such a professional norm; and all that happened in 

Padilla is that the Court following its general practice 

6 said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the 

7 other side win? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all, 

9 Justice Breyer, that's not what the Court did in 

Padilla. What the Court did in Padilla, as Justice 

11 Kagan explained, in section two of its opinion was first 

12 to address the question whether a criminal defense 

13 lawyer had any obligation to give advice about a 

14 consequence that would not be administered in the 

criminal case itself. 

16  No decision of this Court had ever held that 

17 the obligations of a criminal defense lawyer under the 

18 Sixth Amendment extended to that. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: That, of course, is true, 

but the professional norm had evolved by the time of the 

21 proceeding here that they would. 

22  MR. DREEBEN: That was not the basis of the 

23 Court's decision. The Court --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but -- in the other --

in the other, by the way, in the other 29 cases, did the

1 court specifically say in each of those 29 cases that 

2 the basis of our decision is that the professional norm 

3 has evolved and we apply the new professional norm as of 

4 the time? 

MR. DREEBEN: Most of the cases involved 

6 well-settled duties, like the duty to investigate, 

7 applied to particular sets of facts. That doesn't 

8 generate a new rule. 

9  What was unique in Padilla is that the Court 

had to address something that it had never done before, 

11 whether the criminal defense lawyer had to give advice 

12 about a consequence that the sentencing court had no 

13 control over. 

14  And in resolving that question, this Court 

did not cite professional norms. It did not cite the 

16 ABA. It did not cite any of the defense manuals that 

17 recommend that lawyers advise aliens about the 

18 possibility of deportation. 

19  It instead traced the statutory evolution of 

the relationship between deportation and criminal 

21 justice, it examined its own cases that had discussed 

22 what a competent defense lawyer ought to think about, 

23 and it discussed statutory evolution. And it drew from 

24 that the principle that deportation is uniquely tied to 

the criminal prosecution in a way that no other

1 collateral consequence possibly is, and, therefore, the 

2 Court did not decide any other collateral consequence. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as I recall, correct

cited in Padilla was common sense. 

6  MR. DREEBEN: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does common sense change? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Common sense may evolve --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, Tom Paine wrote 

about it, so, you know, since its original. 

11  MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, I think the 

12 Court relied on the idea that any lawyer worth his salt 

13 would inform a defendant about a particularly important 

14 consequence, a momentous consequence of pleading guilty. 

You probably would say the same thing to 

16 somebody who you knew was an avowed hunter and would 

17 lose the right to have firearms, or a politician that 

18 would lose the right to hold office, or a doctor who 

19 would lose a medical license, all of which can be 

automatic consequences of a conviction; actually, more 

21 automatic than deportation, because deportation is 

22 administered by a separate body, oftentimes by a 

23 separate sovereign that has discretion whether to even 

24 institute deportation proceedings. 

And so the fact that we might all share an

1 intuition that good lawyers should advise their clients 

2 about the panoply of consequences that they will 

3 experience by pleading guilty, the reality is that until 

4 Padilla, the Court had never veered from the track of 

saying the lawyer's duty is to help the client figure 

6 out what his odds are of prevailing at trial, what the 

7 sentencing consequences are, whether there are any 

8 affirmative defenses, and what the rights are that the 

9 client would give up by pleading guilty. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, Padilla 

11 itself was a collateral proceeding. And if the state 

12 can argue in Padilla itself that a new rule was being 

13 sought and that that was permissible only on direct 

14 review, should the state have prevailed? 

MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Ginsburg, because 

16 this Court held in Danforth v. Minnesota that Teague is 

17 an interpretation of the Federal habeas statute. It's 

18 an implied delegation to the Court to frame appropriate 

19 rules for Federal collateral review. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this Court is a 

21 Federal court, so --

6 district court at a hearing habeas from a state 

7 conviction? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Well, Danforth made clear that 

9 states have discretion whether to adopt Teague-like 

rules. They do not have to. They can allow their 

11 citizens to have the benefit of new rules in state 

12 convictions. And this Court is doing nothing other than 

13 honoring the state's own policy choice. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, do we know that 

that's true in Kentucky? 

16  MR. DREEBEN: I think Kentucky does have a 

17 Teague-type rule, but the Kentucky Supreme Court decided 

18 the issue on the merits. The state never raised Teague 

19 here. Teague is waivable. So even if you do not agree 

with me, Justice Ginsburg, that Danforth means that 

21 Teague had no relevance whatsoever, Teague was waived by 

22 the state. The state never addressed it. And this --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this Court could not 

24 have raised it on its own? 

MR. DREEBEN: Could have, but didn't. There

1 is nothing in the majority opinion that says that Teague 

2 is an issue. 

3  Now, again, when I say could have, but 

4 didn't, that reflects the -- the reality that this Court 

can do certain things sua sponte. I do not think that 

6 in a case coming from a state system Teague has anything 

7 to do with it. Whether this Court is reviewing the case 

8 on direct review from a state system or reviewing a 

9 state collateral proceeding, Teague is not an issue. 

It's solely an issue when you have a 2254 proceeding or 

11 a 2255 proceeding. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is -- what is the 

13 standard that you wish us to apply? A new rule is 

14 announced when -- when you fill in the blank. And after 

you fill in the blank, is your principal argument that 

16 here the distinction is between the direct consequences 

17 of the conviction that are under the control of the 

18 Court and collateral consequences? Two different 

19 questions. 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, my test is 

21 not a new rule. My test for Teague new rules is this 

22 Court's test: Whether the decision was dictated by 

23 precedent so that any reasonable jurist would have 

24 reached that result, or, to put it another way, that no 

reasonable jurist could not have.

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a little bit like 

2 the AEDPA standard. 

3  MR. DREEBEN: It's similar. I think the 

4 Court has said that things that don't count as new rules 

under Teague can also be cognizable under AEDPA. AEDPA 

6 has a contrary to provision, as well as an unreasonable 

7 application provision, as Mr. Fisher pointed out; but, 

8 as far as the contrary to provision works, it parallels 

9 Teague. 

So we're not asking the Court to make any 

11 new rules up about Teague. We're asking the Court to --

12 to apply Teague. 

13  And in the application of Teague, the 

14 government is relying on this Court's form of analysis, 

which is you look at the state of the law at the time of 

16 the decision in question, when the decision became 

17 final, and you ask whether precedent compelled the 

18 result that a later decision reached. And --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have we applied -- have 

we applied Teague to Federal convictions before? 

21  MR. DREEBEN: This Court has not, except in 

22 the sense that in Bousley v. United States, the Court 

23 ran through a Teague analysis before holding that a 

24 substantive interpretation of a Federal statute is not 

captured by Teague. So, in that sense, the Court has

Official 

1 presumed the applicability, but it hasn't squarely held 

2 it. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It hasn't. 

4  And at least one important basis for the 

Teague rule is the comity to the state court system, 

6 which you don't have when the underlying conviction is a 

7 Federal conviction. 

8  MR. DREEBEN: True, Justice Ginsburg, but 

9 this Court has also recognized that Federal courts have 

an interest in the finality of Federal convictions 

11 that's every bit as strong as state courts. 

12  And so, for example, in 

13 United States v. Frady, the Court applied the procedural 

14 default rule exactly the same as it applies in state 

cases to Federal 2255 proceedings. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the second part of my 

17 question that you were about to answer was whether or 

18 not it's dictated by precedent, and in this case, it was 

19 not dictated by precedent because it applied to 

collateral consequences; or, what's the because? 

21  MR. DREEBEN: Well, there are two becauses. 

22 One is no court had held, as this Court did in Padilla, 

23 that deportation, though not administered by the 

24 sentencing court, was so intimately tied to the criminal 

case that the direct collateral distinction was not 

43

1 useful in this context. There was no precedent that 


2 dictated that. 


3  And then, more generally, as you're 


4 suggesting, Justice Kennedy, the lower courts had all 


adopted the direct collateral reviews. Ten courts of 

6 appeals in published decisions, the Sixth Circuit in an 

7 unpublished decision, 28 states and the District of 

8 Columbia had all adhered to that line. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So unanimous error makes 

right? 

11  I'm not being -- I'm not trying to be 

12 sarcastic. I'm trying to see -- in almost every case we 

13 get here, there are split opinions below. Sometimes the 

14 split is significant or closer than other times. The --

where do we draw that line? Where in the next case is 

16 any time there is a split below or where there's an 

17 unanimity of opinion below, it won't fall under -- it 

18 will automatically create a new rule? 

19  MR. DREEBEN: I would not suggest that the 

Court adopt a mechanical approach. Here, all of the 

21 factors that the Court has looked at all align in the 

22 same direction. The lower courts, Federal courts, had 

23 all agreed that deportation was not the subject of a 

24 duty of advice. The majority of the States had held the 

same.

Official 

1  This Court's decision in Padilla was 

2 significantly splintered, with four justices challenging 

3 the majority's rule as a dramatic expansion and upheaval 

4 in Sixth Amendment law. And then when you actually look 

at the Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, Padilla 

6 did not claim that any decision was controlling of its 

7 holding. 

8  The closest case was the Hill case, 

9 Hill v. Lockhart, and in that case the Court approached 

a collateral consequence, namely, parole eligibility 

11 dates, and it said: We don't have to decide that issue 

12 on whether parole eligibility dates can be the subject 

13 of a Strickland claim, because Hill had failed to show 

14 prejudice. And therefore, it was recognized as an open 

issue whether a consequence that's not administered by 

16 the sentencing court could be within Strickland. 

17  So when you have the coalescence of all of 

18 those factors, I don't think that's a case where the 

19 Court has to draw a fine line between when a sufficient 

split below is enough to --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Can you go back for a 

22 second to Justice Ginsburg's question? I'd like -- I 

23 just don't want you to leave without -- without 

24 answering the following: Normally a new rule that this 

Court announces would apply to cases on direct review.

Official 

1  MR. DREEBEN: Correct. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Right. In the case of 

3 inadequate assistance of counsel, without being picky, 

4 the place where that claim is best developed, in my view 

is first collateral, because for reasons we both 

6 understand. All right. So given the fact that by and 

7 large it is, and I think should be, developed in that 

8 way, why not treat in the case of an inadequate 

9 assistance claim the first collateral as in other claims 

you treat direct review? 

11  MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, let me give 

12 you a merits answer to that question, and then an answer 

13 on why I do not think Petitioner has fairly preserved or 

14 presented that issue to this Court. 

The merits answer is that Teague reflects a 

16 fundamental judgment that when a case is final on its 

17 direct review, society has a strong interest in 

18 protecting that judgment. And the exception to that is 

19 when the state or the Federal government has not 

conformed to existing constitutional law. 

21  Now, bringing that down to earth for 

22 ineffective assistance claims, at the time that Ms. 

23 Chaidez's conviction became final, and all convictions 

24 that became final before Padilla, jurisdictions had no 

reason to think that they needed to protect against the 

46

25

Official 

1 possibility that a criminal defense lawyer would not 

2 have advised about deportation, because the unanimous 

3 view was that's not something that's the Sixth Amendment 

4 duty. 

Immediately after Padilla came down 

6 reflecting that it was, the Criminal Rules Committee 

7 began considering an amendment to Rule 11, which is now 

8 pending before the Judicial Conference, that would 

9 require judges to advise defendants about the 

possibility of deportation consequences. In other 

11 words --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was -- it was approved 

13 by the Judicial Conference in September. 

14  MR. DREEBEN: I will accept that, if that's 

correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

16  The point is that as soon as Padilla made it 

17 clear that a constitutional rule about defense counsel 

18 could threaten the finality of guilty pleas, the Rules 

19 Committee has taken steps to protect the integrity of 

federal judgments through a Rule 11 amendment. It had 

21 no opportunity or reason to do that -- I can't say no 

22 opportunity, but it had no reason to do that as a 

23 constitutional matter until the Court decided Padilla. 

24 And so there is a logical relationship between --

JUSTICE BREYER: You could say that, you 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 could say that same thing precisely about the cases on 

2 direct review which have not been completed. I mean, 

3 you could give all those arguments exactly the same. If 

4 you're worried about the time, you could have time 

limits on the first Federal -- the first Federal habeas 

6 or state habeas. 

7  There are time limits there. You could add 

8 to those. And the -- the -- the direct review is itself 

9 a balance.  It's a balance between the surprise and need 

to complicate the case, and it hasn't really finished 

11 and da, da, da, versus the problem of giving a person a 

12 chance to raise this argument even for a new rule. 

13  MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And so all those -- those 

are the -- when you look at the functional factors, it 

16 looks quite similar to me and I'm trying to --

17  MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it's quite 

18 identical, Justice Breyer, but there are additional 

19 considerations that are at stake here, too. First of 

all, Massaro, which Mr. Fisher relies on, doesn't 

21 preclude a defendant from raising a claim on direct 

22 review. It says that it's not a procedural default if 

23 he does not do that. A criminal defendant will probably 

24 not be in great shape to raise a -- a new rule claim on 

direct review, but he also will not be in great shape to 

48

1 raise it on collateral review. 

2  Unless this Court alters its Sixth Amendment 

3 holdings, such a defendant will be pro se, they will not 

4 have a lawyer, they will be pretty much in the same fix 

that they are in on direct review. 

6  Now, if this Court announces that new rules 

7 under Strickland are not going to be applied to 

8 defendants whose convictions became final, then those 

9 defendants who want to raise a new rule claim are on 

notice that they'll need to do it on direct review. 

11 Courts of appeals will be on notice that if someone 

12 raises such a claim, the appropriate thing to do is to 

13 adjudicate it or remand for its adjudication. 

14  Now, right now the D.C. Circuit doesn't 

follow Massaro. It does remand ineffective assistance 

16 claims. Mr. Fisher said he was unable to locate any 

17 cases where this actually happened. You don't have to 

18 look any further than down the road to the arguments 

19 next week in Smith v. United States, which involves a 

different issue, but the D.C. Circuit remanded an 

21 ineffectiveness claim in that case to the district court 

22 in direct review. It has a practice of doing that. 

23  This is actually a much easier process to 

24 administer than a general exception to Massaro, 

because --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We -- we're seeming to 

2 go backwards. You -- you seem to be arguing against 

3 something that you didn't want previously, that there 

4 should be a stay and determine these IAC claims on 

direct appeal. It seems to be your argument that that's 

6 the preferred process now. 

7  MR. DREEBEN: It's not a preferred process 

8 for ineffectiveness claims generally. I think Massaro 

9 makes that clear. But you have to understand how rare a 

new rule under Strickland really is, the way that the 

11 Court has administered Strickland to date. 

12  Applications of the existing Strickland 

13 standard to particular sets of facts are not new rules. 

14 That's why in the 28 years since Strickland none of this 

Court's decisions, and there are about 30 of them, under 

16 Strickland added up to a new rule. Padilla broke ground 

17 because it answered the question, not how does 

18 Strickland apply, but whether it applies at all to 

19 something outside the compass of the sentencing court. 

And so in that respect, there's no reason 

21 why the standard practice under Massaro should change if 

22 this Court were to address the issue and make clearer 

23 that new rules are not going to be applied on collateral 

24 review. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, if

1 Justice Breyer were right, that there should be sort of 

2 one run -- run up the flagpole and that Teague doesn't 

3 kick in until that one run up the flagpole and here 

4 because of Massaro the one run should include collateral 

review of IAC claims, if that's right, what are the 

6 costs of that? Is that an extra year to the statute of 

7 limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it 

8 something more than that? 

9  MR. DREEBEN: It could be something more 

than that, because if the Court announces a new rule and 

11 makes it retroactive to a case on collateral review, 

12 (f)(3) of the statute of limitations provision gives the 

13 defendant another 1 year. And I think this case 

14 actually illustrates the mischief of that. This case 

doesn't arise on collateral review. It arises on coram 

16 nobis 5 years after the conviction became final. 

17  Now, if Petitioner were really serious that 

18 this Court should carve out from Teague ineffectiveness 

19 claims and adopt a rule just like the one that it did in 

Martinez v. Ryan, which is what he says on page 31 of 

21 his brief, then the Court should not give him the 

22 benefit of that rule, because Ms. Chaidez was on 

23 probation for 4 years after her conviction, she could 

24 have raised this claim after her conviction and sued. 

She did not do that. She had her opportunity. She

1 didn't take advantage of it. And I think this helps 

2 underscore why, if I can turn to this issue not being 

3 properly presented in the Court. 

4  Petitioner did not raise the ineffective 

assistance of counsel type carve-out from Teague that 

6 Mr. Fisher raises in this case. 

7  That debuted for the first time in his 

8 merits brief after certiorari was granted. The 

9 government acquiesced to get resolution of the new rule 

question that had divided the circuits and that will 

11 exist. However this Court resolves this case, if it 

12 chooses to resolve it on the Massaro grounds, the new 

13 rule issue will still be salient for the States, it's 

14 still a circuit conflict that the Court needs to 

address. It was not raised below, it wasn't raised in 

16 the certiorari petition. 

17  The en banc petition raised a very general 

18 argument that Teague should not apply to federal 

19 convictions along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg 

asked me about, whether comity concerns and their 

21 absence meant there should be a difference. 

22  So you've got an argument that, so far as I 

23 can tell, has never been made to any Federal court 

24 before it's been made to this Court, and it would be 

remarkable for the Court to adopt that and then have to

2 in? Is it a permanent exemption for ineffective 


3 assistance claims? 


4  Lots of questions that no lower court has 


looked at, and that I would suggest this Court should 

6 not be the first to answer. 

7  It also raises an entirely new set of 

8 questions about whether Brady -- which also are kinds of 

9 claims that are typically raised on collateral review --

should now be exempt from Teague jurisprudence? 

11  I think the Court would really be engaging 

12 in kind of a sort of examination of Teague that had 

13 never happened before. It's sort of like experimental 

14 surgery on Teague. Shouldn't really happen in this 

Court in the first instance. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Although you said you 

17 recognize that we have not had a Teague case involving a 

18 Federal conviction, I mean, there is lots of language in 

19 Teague cases about the Federal courts not interfering 

with state courts, that Teague was intended to minimize 

21 Federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings, to 

22 limit the authority of the Federal courts to overturn 

23 state convictions. I mean, we have really pressed 

24 that -- that basis. 

MR. DREEBEN: True, but Petitioner is not

2 disavowed it. He's not seriously argued it in response 

3 to our brief that opposed his brand new ineffectiveness 

4 carveout from Teague. What he has done instead is 

concentrated much more on an analogy to Massaro. 

6  If I could give one more reason why I think 

7 the Court should refrain from entertaining that 

8 Massaro-based analogy here, the Court has just begun to 

9 embark in the Martinez v. Ryan line of cases on trying 

to figure out how ineffectiveness claims should be 

11 handled on collateral review. 

12  It grants its certiorari on Monday in 

13 Trevino v. Thaler, where it's going to explore how does 

14 Martinez apply in a jurisdiction that may be more like 

the Federal system in that ineffective assistance of 

16 counsel claims aren't channeled only to direct review, 

17 they can be asserted on direct -- I'm sorry -- only to 

18 collateral review, they can be asserted on direct 

19 review. They are channeled largely to collateral 

review, but not as a matter of law. 

21  So the Court has a lot of work to do in 

22 figuring out what that decision means. And I think 

23 rather than embark on a brand new process of applying 

24 that kind of reasoning in a case where it was never 

raised below, where the government never really had the

1 opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the 

2 lower court never had the opportunity to consider them, 

3 it's not a wise use of the Court's resources. 

4  Instead, resolving the new rule question 

that has divided the circuits would provide an answer 

6 for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that 

7 supported the United States on the new rule question, 

8 and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding 

9 that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's 

Strickland jurisprudence up to that time, and is not 

11 available to cases on collateral review.

14  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

16  MR. FISHER: Thank you. 

17  I'd like to make two points. 

18  The first is, picking up where Mr. Dreeben 

19 left off, I'm not asking for any anything that is 

difficult. 

21  Mr. Dreeben referred to the Frady case, 

22 where this Court held that there is enough of an 

23 interest in finality to have procedural default apply to 

24 federal post-conviction review. Yet, in Massaro, this 

Court carved out IAC claims. 

55

Official 

1  Exactly the same analysis applies here, and 

2 I do think the Court really ought to answer that 

3 question in this case because, if you hold that Padilla 

4 is a new rule and that Teague now applies to IAC claims, 

rest assured the Federal courthouses are going to be 

6 flooded, flooded with Federal -- with Federal defenders 

7 and other criminal lawyers raising IAC claims on direct 

8 review. There'd be nothing else a responsible lawyer 

9 could do, because if you say Teague applies on -- if you 

wait until collateral review, but it doesn't apply on 

11 direct review, any responsible lawyer seeking to protect 

12 his client has to bring it on direct review. It's going 

13 to absolutely change the way criminal procedure and 

14 criminal appellate procedure happens in the Federal 

court system. 

16  The second point I wanted to make is back to 

17 the new rule question. I think I heard Mr. Dreeben say 

18 that the lower courts that had said that misadvice about 

19 deportation consequences violated Strickland had said 

something that was within Strickland that didn't 

21 constitute a new rule. So it can't be that Strickland 

22 broke new ground, if he's correct, by saying deportation 

23 advice falls within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment in 

24 a guilty plea context. 

The only thing he relies on in the end is 

56

1 this distinction the lower courts had drawn between acts 

2 and omissions. And that's exactly the distinction in 

3 Strickland that this Court rejected. 

4  And in Padilla itself, this Court used the 

word absurd. And I think, Justice Kennedy, when you 

6 mentioned commonsense, I think we could throw that in, 

7 too. 

8  And so to the extent that the argument, at 

9 the end of the day when everything's stripped away, is 

that the lower courts were reasonable in saying that 

11 failing to advise about the most important thing a 

12 client would have been thinking as to whether to plead 

13 guilty is not ineffective assistance of counsel, whereas 

14 giving bad advice is, that's a line that Strickland 

itself rejected, that Flores-Ortega rejected when it 

16 came to the right to appeal and whether the lawyer ought 

17 to give advice; and, it's a line that this Court in 

18 Padilla had no difficulty whatsoever rejecting and 

19 called it absurd. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Fisher, can I go 

21 back to one of your points? Your red light is on, but 

22 it is important. The floodgate issue. 

23  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure about the 

floodgates for the following reason. Once we announce

2  collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something 

3  that happened after Padilla would be covered by the 

4  rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims. So the 

floodgate is temporary, if there is --

6  MR. FISHER: No, it's not, 

7  Justice Sotomayor. 

8  The issue arises because Teague ordinarily 

9  comes into play when somebody asks the Court to create a 

new rule and apply it to him. So all the hypotheticals 

11  we've talked about today, about would Strickland apply 

12  here, would Strickland apply there, to parole advice, to 

13  professional license, all of those claims would be 

14  asking, if the government's correct, for a new rule.
