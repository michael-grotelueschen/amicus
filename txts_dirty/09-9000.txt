3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 09-9000, Skinner v. Switzer.

 Mr. Owen. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 The issue before the Court today and the 

11 only question litigated to decision in the courts below 

12 is whether a prisoner's claim that seeks only access to 

13 evidence for DNA testing may be brought in Federal court 

14 under the Civil Rights Act.

 The Fifth Circuit summarily answered that 

16 question "no," adhering to its long-standing view that 

17 any Federal claim that might conceivably set the stage 

18 for a subsequent collateral attack, however removed in 

19 time, must itself be brought via habeas. That rule so 

clearly cannot be squared with the decisions of this 

21 Court, especially since Wilkinson v. Dotson, that the 

22 Court should reverse and remand. 

23  I'd like to begin by describing the contours 

24 of the Heck rule, and -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you about -­

1 Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't 

2 touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one 

3 does. So the cases are distinguishable on that basis. 

4  MR. OWEN: I -- Justice Ginsburg, the reason 

that we argue our case does not touch the conviction is 

6 that the relief that we are seeking, to have access to 

7 the evidence for testing, if we won, if we win in 

8 district court and we get that access, it does not 

9 necessarily imply -- which is the language this Court 

used in Heck and repeated in Dotson -- that the 

11 conviction is lawfully invalid. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I understand that 

13 argument, but there is the distinction of the type of 

14 case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence 

were never going to be questioned, only parole 

16 eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in 

17 1983 is not a destination. The destination is to 

18 further litigation that may or may not arise. 

19  MR. OWEN: That's true, Your Honor. We -­

we don't see that as a distinction that compels the 

21 conclusion that Dotson isn't the model to follow, 

22 because in our view, what Dotson said -- again, the 

23 prisoners, as Justice Ginsburg says, were before the 

24 court seeking a declaration about parole procedures that 

Ohio planned to use in their cases. Those parole

1 procedures had been adopted after those prisoners were 

2 sent to prison, and they complained that was an ex post 

3 facto violation. 

4  And Ohio argued, both in the Sixth Circuit 

and in this Court, that the fact that these prisoners 

6 expected at some point to come back to court armed with 

7 a judgment in their favor and seek a reduction in their 

8 sentences was enough to conclude that the case should be 

9 within the core of habeas.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem odd, 

11 though -- and I don't want to jump into your argument 

12 too much, because you have got planned out what you want 

13 to tell us. It does seem odd that if your suit for DNA 

14 testing is not attack -- an attack on the sentence, that 

you asked for a stay. 

16  I mean, if it's not an attack on the 

17 sentence, why shouldn't that factor into our decision 

18 not to grant a stay or to grant a stay? It's -- it's an 

19 irony in your position.

 MR. OWEN: I think it's an irony -- I -- I 

21 accept the Court's point that that -- that that seems 

22 unusual, but I think that the reason that the Court's 

23 cases, at least as to the relief that we're seeking and 

24 not the stay that the Court entered in order to hear 

this case and decide the question, that the relief we

Official 

1 are seeking does not necessarily imply the legal 

2 invalidity of the conviction. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we don't grant a 

4 stay in order to decide a question. We grant a stay 

because there's a likelihood of success on the merits. 

6 And that goes to the sentence. And now you're telling 

7 us that your attack doesn't go on the sentence. I don't 

8 see why we don't just lift the stay, under your own view 

9 of the case.

 MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think -- if 

11 I -- if I was understood to say that, then I -- let me 

12 clarify. 

13  I think that our success -- when the Court 

14 applies the stay standard, it asks the question: What 

is the likelihood of success on the merits? Success on 

16 the merits, for purposes of our lawsuit, means getting 

17 access to the evidence. That's -- that's what it means. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If that's all it means, we 

19 shouldn't have granted a stay.

 MR. OWEN: I don't -- I don't think so, Your 

21 Honor, because I think once we had demonstrated that we 

22 were likely to prevail on the merits of the case, I 

23 think the Court was within, you know, appropriate 

24 judgment to -- to make sure that the case didn't become 

moot by Mr. Skinner's execution, because I do think that

1 the demonstration that we had to make was not about 

2 whether his ultimate -- or whether, ultimately, he might 

3 get relief from his conviction, but whether we had a 

4 chance of prevailing on this civil rights claim that 

asks for access to the evidence. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that disconnects 

7 the irreparable harm alleged with respect to the stay 

8 and your claim that you now say -- you say now your 

9 claim is not going to necessarily affect the -- the 

sentence. The irreparable harm, if I remember, is quite 

11 obviously the execution. But it's -- there is no 

12 irreparable harm from your failure to get access to the 

13 DNA evidence, unless it's linked to the sentence. 

14  MR. OWEN: Your Honor, I -- I guess I don't 

have a better answer than the one I gave 

16 Justice Kennedy, and that is that I think that the stay 

17 standard doesn't have to link those two things. I think 

18 that if the Court finds that Mr. Skinner is going to die 

19 before he can litigate his claim and it finds he has a 

reasonable chance of prevailing on that claim, that's 

21 sufficient to -- to enter the stay. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: In the real world, a 

23 prisoner who wants access to DNA evidence is interested 

24 in overturning his conviction.

 MR. OWEN: Absolutely.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you deny that? 

2  MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: And isn't the emergence of 

4 the Rooker-Feldman argument in this case an illustration 

of the absurdities that pursuing the 1983 path produces? 

6 Because habeas is not subject to claim preclusion, is 

7 it? 

8  MR. OWEN: No. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: It's not subject to 

Rooker-Feldman? 

11  MR. OWEN: No, it's not subject to those, 

12 Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: But since you've squeezed 

14 this into 1983, now have you to deal with both of those 

issues. 

16  MR. OWEN: I think that the -- the 

17 reason that -- I think the reason the Rooker-Feldman 

18 issue has arisen at this juncture in the case is that 

19 the pleadings in the district court were not permitted 

to -- because of the sort of -- the fact that we were 

21 dismissed at a very early stage in the process, 

22 essentially on the threshold of the case, there was no 

23 opportunity to develop in full what the legal arguments 

24 are for both sides. I -­

1 the yellow brief, where you did have time to explain 

2 your doctrine, you say a Federal constitutional issue 

3 arose only because the Court of Criminal Appeals' 

4 decision regarding the State law issue turned out to be 

so arbitrary and unreasonable as to denying 

6 Mr. Skinner's Federal due process rights. 

7  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think -­

8  MR. OWEN: No, that's -­

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought that's 

Rooker-Feldman to a tee. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

11  MR. OWEN: No, I think, Your Honor, that -­

12 I -- I don't agree about the Court's reading of 

13 Rooker-Feldman if you think that -- if the Court 

14 believes that that would preclude it. And the reason is 

this: In the Feldman case itself, the -- the plaintiffs 

16 in that case, who were unsuccessful lawyers who are, 

17 what, a law school graduate and an attorney who was 

18 barred outside the District of Columbia, and were trying 

19 to get a waiver for a requirement for taking the bar 

here in the District of Columbia -- they filed a number 

21 of claims against the application of that rule by the 

22 District of Columbia Court of Appeals in their 

23 circumstances. 

24  But -- and this Court said those claims 

can't proceed. Those claims challenge the application

2  But this Court went on to say in Feldman -­

3 the last paragraph of the opinion says they have also 

4 raised other claims, and those claims are that this 

rule, as authoritatively construed by the District of 

6 Columbia Court of Appeals, is -- is unconstitutional. 

7 It violates the Constitution. And the Court said, in 

8 Feldman, those claims may proceed. And -­

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Owen, as I -- as I 

read -- I'm sorry. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What's the 

12 rule that's arbitrary and capricious that you're 

13 challenging? 

14  MR. OWEN: Your Honor, the rule that we are 

challenging is that when the Court of Criminal Appeals 

16 construed the fault provision of the Texas DNA testing 

17 statute in our case, it created a wholesale 

18 classification that said everybody who falls into 

19 Mr. Skinner's situation who did not ask for testing at 

trial is forever foreclosed from getting testing. And 

21 -­

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me how 

23 that's different than what Alaska did in the Osborne 

24 case that we upheld; their procedure? I thought that 

was one of the elements of the Alaska rule as well.

1  MR. OWEN: I think -- I'm sorry. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That if you had an 

3 opportunity to ask for it and gave it up, that you lost. 

4 So how are we getting to that here? And how are you 

going to get past Osborne here? 

6  MR. OWEN: I think in Texas we have -- the 

7 difference, I think, Your Honor, is the difference 

8 between a substantive due process claim, as I understand 

9 it, and a procedural due process claim. That in Osborne 

the claim that was being made was that the State was 

11 denying a Federal right in denying access on that basis. 

12  Our argument is that the Texas -- the Texas 

13 statute was enacted to grant, essentially, protection to 

14 a class of inmates who were -- inmates who were 

wrongfully convicted and can prove that with DNA 

16 evidence -- and then -- and then interprets that statute 

17 in a way that needlessly chops a bunch of those inmates 

18 out, and that that's arbitrary, at least to the extent 

19 that it doesn't have reference to the specific facts of 

the case, the likelihood of innocence, the reasons for 

21 not doing the testing, and so on. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Osborne expressly 

23 considered both procedural due process and substantive 

24 due process.

 MR. OWEN: But the reason, Your Honor, as

1 I -- as I read Osborne, that it did not reach a 

2 decision on the procedure, or it didn't -- that it 

3 rejected Osborne's procedural due process claim was 

4 because he hadn't tried at State court.

 I mean, that was the premise of Osborne, 

6 was he was -- I think the Court's language in Osborne 

7 was if he hasn't tried those procedures, he's in no 

8 position to complain about them in Federal court, 

9 whereas we did try the procedures, and it's precisely 

that that is the basis for our claim in Federal court. 

11  If I -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -­

13  MR. OWEN: I'm sorry. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- one of the 

criticisms by your adversary of your proposal to bring 

16 these actions via 1983 is a prospect that the courts 

17 will be used to collaterally attack convictions by all 

18 sorts of due process allegations concerning discovery 

19 disputes. Could you address that point, and why either 

you agree with them that that's what is going to happen, 

21 or if you don't, why not? 

22  MR. OWEN: I don't agree with them, Your 

23 Honor, and for a couple of reasons. First of all is 

24 that experience doesn't suggest that. The rule that we 

are asking the Court to adopt for the whole nation has 

12

1 been the rule for some time in six different circuits, 

2 and there's no evidence that in those circuits there 

3 have been a very large number of prisoners going into 

4 court under section 1983 and trying to leverage 

discovery under the circumstances that are suggested by 

6 Respondent's brief. So that's the practical reason. 

7  As a legal -- as a legal reason, I think 

8 that our claim turns on the existence of the liberty 

9 interest in the State statute for DNA testing that Texas 

has created, and that there is no statute in Texas for 

11 other kinds of general discovery; for example, access to 

12 the prosecutor's file, police reports, or other kinds of 

13 documents. That's not -- there's no legal hook for 

14 that.

 Our legal hook is the existence of that DNA 

16 testing statute and the existence under State law of 

17 opportunities to bring claims of actual innocence after 

18 the evidence is tested. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The critical 

formulation in Heck, "necessarily implies," is a little 

21 difficult. I mean, the adverb points one way and the 

22 verb points the other. And how -- "necessarily implies" 

23 strikes me as a little less conclusive than you seem to 

24 think.

 MR. OWEN: I think -- I think if that word

1 were in isolation, Your Honor, there might be more 

2 uncertainty about what "implies" means. But if the 

3 Court looks at the cases -- looks at Preiser, looks at 

4 Heck, looks at Edwards, looks at Nelson, looks at Hill 

-- what you'll see is the word "necessarily" is in all 

6 those cases. And, in fact, in Hill, I think -- or maybe 

7 it was Nelson; one of the two Florida cases -- the Court 

8 italicizes it twice in the same paragraph. And -­

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you -- you 

read "necessarily implies" to mean "conclusively 

11 establishes," right? 

12  MR. OWEN: Not that strong, Your Honor. But 

13 to finish, the other answer I was going to say is that 

14 in other cases -- I was going to say, "necessarily" is 

everywhere. "Necessarily" is in all the cases. But the 

16 Court also -- "implies" is not in all the cases. In 

17 Dotson, for example, the Court uses the word 

18 "demonstrate" -- "necessarily demonstrates" -- that the 

19 judgment underlying the custody is invalid.

 So I think that there is some -­

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are asking 

22 for an expansion of Heck from "necessarily implies" -­

23  MR. OWEN: No, I think we are -- I think -­

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to 

"demonstrates"?

1  MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think that -­

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if "implies" 

3 doesn't mean the same as "establish" or "demonstrates," 

4 give me an example of a case where the 1983 claim would 

not establish innocence but would still be covered by 

6 Heck. 

7  MR. OWEN: I think that -- I think Edwards 

8 is an example of that, Your Honor, where -- in Edwards, 

9 the defendant, the prisoner, was suing in Federal court, 

alleging that, in his words, the procedures that were 

11 used to deny him -- I think it was deny him parole or 

12 convict him of disciplinary offenses, but the procedures 

13 that had resulted in the disadvantage he was complaining 

14 about were unconstitutional.

 But when you looked at his complaint, what 

16 he said was this -- the reason those procedures are 

17 unconstitutional is because the decision maker was 

18 personally biased against me, which is less a complaint 

19 about the procedures and more a complaint about the 

merits of that adjudication. And if you believe it, if 

21 you credit that, and say, okay, we're going to win, 

22 fine, that's what happened, the adjudication was biased 

23 against you, that necessarily implies the invalidity of 

24 the judgment reached by that procedure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Necessarily implies

2  MR. OWEN: I think necessarily -- with bias, 

3 perhaps that would be conclusively established, because 

4 I think there's no harmlessness test there. But I think 

that -- at least in an adjudication, there wouldn't be. 

6 But I think that "necessarily implies" is all that the 

7 Court needs to continue embracing in order to find 

8 that -­

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would you do with 

the Brady violation? Is that a "necessarily implies" or 

11 is that more akin to your claim? 

12  MR. OWEN: For a couple of reasons, Your 

13 Honor, it's not akin to our claim. First is this: 

14 Brady is a trial right. And I don't mean necessarily 

that it arises at trial, because sometimes it arises 

16 at -- the discovery that makes a Brady claim colorable, 

17 you know, arises after trial. But Brady is a right to 

18 have certain evidence when you go to trial so that you 

19 can use it in an attempt to get the jury to find you not 

guilty. 

21  And, therefore, if that right is violated, 

22 if you don't get that evidence and it's discovered later 

23 that you were denied this stuff that you needed to have 

24 a fair trial, that implies the invalidity of the trial 

judgment, the judgment that results in the custody.

1  In our case, the judgment that we are 

2 challenging is the judgment of the Court of Criminal 

3 Appeals denying us DNA testing, which does not in the 

4 same way demonstrate or necessarily imply that the 

custody judgment in our case is legally invalid. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Owen, could I take you 

7 back to Rooker-Feldman with that as the premise? You 

8 said that what you are attacking is the judgment. I 

9 read your complaint as having an important strand where 

you were not attacking the judicial judgment, but 

11 instead were attacking actions of the prosecutor's 

12 office, independent of any judgment of the State courts. 

13  Are you abandoning that part of your 

14 complaint, or are you continuing to maintain it? 

Because certainly, if you talk about the judgment alone, 

16 it at least gets you into Rooker-Feldman territory, 

17 whereas if you talk about the prosecutor, it does not. 

18  MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that we -­

19 that we are in the territory of talking about the 

judgment. And I think for the reasons I've described 

21 earlier that that does not lead inexorably to a 

22 Rooker-Feldman bar. 

23  But I think that the nature of our claim, 

24 which follows from Osborne, what we understood the Court 

to be recognizing in Osborne, or acknowledging in

4 So I think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

6 understand the argument you're making. Are you 

7 challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute? 

8  MR. OWEN: As interpreted in our case, or as 

9 construed, I think is the right -- is the better word. 

As -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, "as construed" -- I 

12 mean, it's their statute. I mean, you say somewhere in 

13 your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and 

14 capricious interpretation. It's up to them how they 

want to interpret it. We don't -- we don't reinterpret 

16 State statutes because the State Supreme Court 

17 interpreted it strangely. 

18  It seems to me you're either challenging the 

19 statute or -- or you don't belong here.

 MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, we are 

21 challenging the statute. And I think once the Texas 

22 Court of Criminal Appeals says here is what the default 

23 provision means, that is the same thing, for the 

24 purposes of this Court's review, as if the legislature 

had written that in. So -­

got it wrong on their own terms, that would be a 

6 Rooker-Feldman bar, because we couldn't bring that 

7 claim.

9 case focuses on paragraph 33 of your complaint; is that 

right?

13  JUSTICE BREYER: And what is the "but"? 

14  MR. OWEN: I think there has been a lot of 

discussion about the allegations in the complaint, 

16 particularly those paragraphs. I think that is maybe 

17 missing the larger point, which is this: As we said 

18 earlier, I think that the Federal rules permit 

19 complaints to be notice pleading. They permit 

amendment. They permit development of the issues. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So, what's -- look, 33 says 

22 the District Attorney has violated my rights under the 

23 law by refusing to give me the DNA evidence, so make him 

24 do it.

11 to undo your custody, and that's not enough to put this 

12 case into habeas, that that -­

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand. But

where people are seeking the DNA evidence might come out 

16 differently under Heck. In other words, if it's the 

17 type of DNA evidence that could conclusively establish 

18 he's innocent. I mean, there are types like that. It's 

19 somebody else's, you know, DNA and that's what's 

necessary for the conviction. 

21  And there's others -- other types of DNA 

22 evidence that doesn't. I mean, it just happens to be on 

23 the scene of the crime and it turns out that it's not 

24 him that was in the room, but, you know, he was 

somewhere else, and it might or might not mean he's

1 innocent. 

2  In the former case, do you say that has to 

3 go under habeas, but in the latter it doesn't? 

4  MR. OWEN: I think when we are seeking 

access to evidence which has never been tested for 

6 testing, that could be brought under 1983. 

7  I think if the evidence has been tested and 

8 test results exist and are known and are exculpatory, 

9 that is a -- that's a different case and that's probably 

habeas, because then it's the fact that the results are 

11 known and we know they are exculpatory that does 

12 necessarily imply that there's something about the 

13 judgment that could be undone. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Owen, you're fitting 

your case into our decisions about the line between 1983 

16 and habeas. But if nobody -- if you didn't know 

17 anything about that and you looked at what's presented 

18 here in a civil case, it seems as though you are 

19 splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and 

if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief 

21 from the conviction. 

22  So it's the -- it's quite unlike I'm 

23 complaining about prison conditions. Here, the whole 

24 purpose of your seeking this discovery is so that you

2  MR. OWEN: The whole -- I agree, Your Honor, 

3 that the whole purpose for seeking this evidence and 

4 pursuing this lawsuit is so that Mr. Skinner can have a 

meaningful opportunity to pursue the liberty interest he 

6 has under State law in trying to secure release based on 

7 innocence. That is correct. But I don't think that 

8 leads inexorably to the idea that this lawsuit, which 

9 is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you have sought 

11 habeas? Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could 

12 you have sought habeas relief? 

13  MR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that since 

14 our allegation is that the Court of Criminal Appeals 

decision denying us DNA testing, which is not the 

16 judgment that results in Mr. Skinner's custody, is the 

17 problem -- that's the bad, invalid judgment from our 

18 legal theory -- that could not have been brought in a 

19 habeas corpus proceeding, because I think that the 

relief that a Federal habeas court would have available 

21 to itself is limited to release, to accelerating release 

22 or changing custody status. I don't think that there is 

23 power in the Federal habeas court under that statute to 

24 say, even though this will not affect the judgment as to 

which you are in custody, I'm going to act on this way

2 think that it wouldn't be available in habeas, Your 

3 Honor. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, couldn't the habeas 

court say the conviction was invalid because of the 

6 failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which 

7 was relevant to the defense and which was 

8 unconstitutionally denied? Why wouldn't that be a basis 

9 for setting aside the conviction?

 MR. OWEN: Your Honor, this Court has never 

11 said -- and I know the Court's aware of this; I want to 

12 make sure I'm clear on that -- this Court has never said 

13 that it would be a constitutional basis for habeas 

14 relief if you could demonstrate that, factually, you 

were not guilty. 

16  So that's the claim that would have to be 

17 brought in such a Federal habeas. It's not presently 

18 available because this Court has never held that. And I 

19 think, given the constraints of the Federal habeas 

statute and the requirement of clearly established 

21 Federal law from this Court, before a prisoner can get 

22 relief, that's a necessary prerequisite for us seeking 

23 that relief. And -- and I'm sorry. I hope that is

7 mean, it wouldn't happen because you had the opportunity 

8 to raise that in the State court, and now you're 

9 retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.

 MR. OWEN: I think to the extent, Your 

11 Honor, that the question goes to the opportunity that we 

12 had to raise this issue in State court, that's a 

13 preclusion issue, and there may be preclusion issues 

14 back in the district court. We may have a dogfight over 

whether or not this claim should have been raised in 

16 State court. 

17  But that's not the Rooker-Feldman question, 

18 as I understand it. I think the Rooker-Feldman question 

19 is: What are we asking the Federal court to review? 

And what we are asking the Federal court to review is 

21 the Criminal Court of Appeals' authoritative 

22 construction of the statute.

13  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN 

14  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Chief Justice 

16 Roberts, and may it please the Court: 

17  To decide this case, the Court only needs to 

18 make two stops. First is paragraph 33 of Mr. Skinner's 

19 complaint.

 That complaint, that statement of his 

21 complaint clearly alleges against Ms. Skinner -- Ms. 

22 Switzer herself that she has withheld -- and the word he 

23 uses is "exculpatory" evidence -- and violated his due 

24 process rights through that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he says

1 exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's 

2 not guilty. There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that 

3 might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot 

4 of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and 

doesn't mean it will demonstrate. He says it could. 

6  MR. COLEMAN: There -- there are two points 

7 in response to that, Chief Justice Roberts, and the 

8 first is that this is the classic statement of a Brady 

9 claim. When you file a Brady claim, you don't know 

exactly what it is and whether it will definitely be 

11 exculpatory or not. You have learned information that 

12 makes you think that it would be, and you're able to -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The substantive right in 

14 Brady was to have that material at trial, so that it is 

-- that's the substantive constitutional right. Here 

16 the substantive right that's been identified in Osborne 

17 is the liberty interest created by State law. And that 

18 only happens after the conviction. So it's not quite 

19 the same. It's not comparable.

 MR. COLEMAN: I'm not -- I'm not saying that 

21 legally that there isn't some difference to be made from 

22 Osborne. Osborne rejected the substantive claim that 

23 you could bring a Brady claim. What I'm saying is the 

24 language of the text of his complaint is a Brady 

allegation, and at page 19, footnote 6 of his own brief,

1 he acknowledges that Brady claims have to be brought in 

2 habeas and is left simply arguing that, one, that I can 

3 describe to the Court a different theory of my 

4 complaint, or that regardless of how I describe the 

complaint, I can break out the discovery aspects of that 

6 complaint and do it under 1983 and not in habeas. And 

7 part of the problem with that -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to win a Brady claim 

9 in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just 

that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was, 

11 indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome 

12 of the trial. No? 

13  MR. COLEMAN: Yes. But that claim -- that 

14 showing is to be made, if at all, in habeas. And he has 

the opportunity -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't have to make 

17 that showing here. I mean, that's -- that's what he 

18 says distinguishes this case from habeas. In habeas, 

19 you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a 

different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I 

21 don't have to show that; I just want the evidence. 

22  MR. COLEMAN: There is some ambiguity. I'm 

23 not sure I fully understand what you mean by "here." He 

24 has alleged that that's what he is going to prove. What

need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the 

6 relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that 

7 in habeas. 

8  MR. COLEMAN: I disagree. With respect to 

9 the relief that he is ultimately seeking, the question 

is -- if you're saying that the 1983 suit is simply a 

11 retrying of the article 64 proceeding, then I -- I would 

12 have to concede that article 64 does not require the 

13 same showing as a habeas claim. But part of the -­

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, aren't -- aren't 

the -- the exculpatory nature of the evidence and its 

16 materiality elements of the Brady claim itself? 

17  MR. COLEMAN: Well, as -- as the Court and 

18 your concurring opinion in Osborne made clear, that -­

19 that "exculpatory" is really defined as demonstrating 

that you're innocent and that it's material. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I agree think that sounds 

22 like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants 

23 is the DNA. He thinks it's going to be exculpatory. He 

24 doesn't know that till he gets it.

 So look at Dotson. Dotson says that you go

1 into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would 

2 necessarily spell speedier release. End of the matter. 

3 I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence 

4 where he quotes my majority with great praise.

 (Laughter.) 

6  MR. COLEMAN: Justice Scalia -- Justice 

7 Scalia also makes the point at the end of his Dotson 

8 concurrence that the question -- the real question is 

9 whether you could make out this type of claim or this -­

make out this type of proceeding in habeas. Ultimately, 

11 Preiser and Heck -­

12  JUSTICE BREYER: No, not whether you -- what 

13 he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as 

14 I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win 

and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed 

16 into habeas which don't belong there. And that may be a 

17 true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he 

18 has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or 

19 something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to 

you is the test. 

21  And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA 

22 does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all 

23 depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows. So why 

24 isn't that end of the matter?

3  As Justice Ginsburg noted earlier in the 

4 argument, the Court has dealt with these issues in a -­

in a variety of cases, most of them being prison 

6 disciplinary or parole-type proceedings. And in those 

7 cases, the Court is trying to define the outer bounds, 

8 ultimately, of what we're going to say Preiser/Heck 

9 required to be brought in habeas and what may be 

brought. A couple of boundaries on those rules, but 

11 first, Preiser and Heck make -­

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Coleman, if you could 

13 answer Justice Breyer's question, because there are two 

14 phrases, "necessarily imply the invalidity of the 

conviction" and "necessarily spell speedier release"; 

16 and either you think that your case fits one of those or 

17 both of those standards, or you are asking us to abandon 

18 that standard. 

19  MR. COLEMAN: I don't think that that's 

true. I think that what the Court has always 

21 recognized, an article 64 proceeding is a motion in the 

22 criminal case. If you look at the docket number on the 

23 motion, it is a motion in the criminal case. 

24  What "necessarily implies" has always been 

used for is defining the outer bounds of the rule in

1 terms of prison disciplinary proceedings, parole, other 

2 things outside the criminal case itself. 

3  This is an attack on the -- the criminal 

4 proceeding. This is a post-conviction motion in the 

criminal case itself. It's like a rule 60 -­

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Filed in the -- in the 

7 court of conviction? 

8  MR. COLEMAN: It's not only in the court of 

9 conviction; it's under the docket number of the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's a totally 

11 different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what 

12 we did do was go through every of these -- every one of 

13 the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part 

14 the attack, as you say, on prison procedure. And those 

cases where the attack on the proceeding would have 

16 restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the 

17 -- the length of confinement. 

18  In those cases where there was a general 

19 attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be 

carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't. You 

21 suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas. Where 

22 in the case law is this different rule that the rule we 

23 just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the 

24 case? That's basically what you are arguing. What

6 Preiser and Heck say what we allow from that is those 

7 things that may be brought in habeas should be brought

18 already brought it. He brought a habeas petition based 

19 on ineffective assistance of counsel that is, as a 

matter of argument, indistinguishable from the no-fault 

21 arguments that he is making here. The complaint's 

22 against the no-fault aspect of the article 64 

23 proceeding. 

24  He can bring that. Many courts -- this 

Court has never fully said that you can, but many courts

1 do allow actual innocence-type claims to go forward, and

does that, Congress says you must respect those criminal 

6 proceedings. You must show deference. You must require 

7 exhaustion. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Coleman, the habeas 

9 statute says, 2254(a), a Federal court can entertain a 

habeas petition only on the ground that the petitioner

7 the last part of my answer to Justice Kagan I think is

9 either an ineffective assistance claim or an actual 

innocence-type claim, the congressional intent that you

12 things require that to be given to every step of the

they may be a Brady claim; next week it may be a claim 

21 against procedures used in State habeas. But as long as

3  JUSTICE BREYER: I see your point, but I 

4 want to go back to try to understand this.

 And we have the Dotson point, and you said 

6 there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck. So what 

7 Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there 

8 wanted the shortening of his term of confinement. He 

9 wanted good-time credits to be restored. And as we read 

it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is 

11 what made it proper in habeas. But we added that if it 

12 hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration 

13 of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it 

14 would be 1983.

 In Heck, the same thing. They were 

16 establishing the basis for a damages claim that

18 conviction. Where that was so, there would be habeas. 

19 Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not 

demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal 

21 judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in 

22 1983. So as we read those two cases, they stood for the 

23 exact principle I described.

2 Fine. 

3  What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that 

4 we should have the principle of distinguishing the one 

1983 from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an 

6 exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in 

7 those three cases: Dotson, Preiser, Heck? What's your 

8 contrary approach? 

9  MR. COLEMAN: I -- I think the approach is 

if these things may be properly made the subject of a 

11 habeas corpus claim, then congressional intent and the 

12 habeas statute require that it be brought in habeas. I 

13 think that responds -­

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are -- you are 

asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson 

16 formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear. 

17 It says: "Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity 

18 of the conviction or the sentence." Wouldn't 

19 necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling 

us, it may not demonstrate it at all. It may 

21 demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty. So it 

22 wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the 

23 conviction. 

24  And I think to get -- to get -- to say that 

you should prevail, you would have to say: Court, you

4 conviction.

 MR. COLEMAN: I -- I disagree with that, 

6 Justice Ginsburg. I don't think that we're saying that 

7 the Court is wrong. What I think I'm saying is that 

8 "necessarily implies" is not a magic words test that is 

9 the sort of complete and ultimate statement of the 

Preiser-Heck rule, but rather -­

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are asking for 

12 something in addition. You say: Court, don't just look 

13 at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson. This is a 

14 different case, as I suggested originally. This does 

not involve parole. The ultimate destination in this 

16 case is the conviction and sentence. 

17  MR. COLEMAN: I think that that is correct, 

18 in the sense that if you look at Dotson, which was -­

19 involved a specific claim for process -- which is not 

what they are asking for. They are asking for actual 

21 relief, not process. 

22  But you look at those types of cases, 

23 whether it's Heck, it's a civil case that went about 

24 attacking it, these cases on the periphery of what goes 

in and out of Heck, the "necessarily implied" language,

attempt to take the two words or the phrase from Dotson 

6 and turn it back on itself and say -- says that, under 

7 Heck, I can attack motions in the criminal proceedings 

8 themselves, in the State habeas itself, as long as I 

9 stop short of asking for that ultimate relief.

 So Heck said the case is about avoiding 

11 artful pleading, but now what he wants to turn it into 

12 is a rule that encourages artful pleading and -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe we need -- I 

14 mean, we've never had a case like this, and it's 

conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we 

16 said in Heck and Preiser. I'm not sure, however, that 

17 what we ought to say is what you propose: That the test 

18 is whether it could be brought in habeas. You say it 

19 could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective 

assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that 

21 habeas. 

22  You can bring anything in habeas. I mean,

24 could possibly win in habeas. You couldn't win in 

habeas with this claim because you couldn't show that it

2  MR. COLEMAN: Well, as you noted in your 

3 concurrence in Dotson, the question is not whether you 

4 win, but whether you could. And the question is, if 

it's properly the subject of habeas, then Congress has 

6 demanded that all of the safeguards and protections for 

7 habeas be in place. And that -­

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, that doesn't 

9 quite give us the added formulation that some of the 

questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to 

11 Dotson and still rule for you. There has to be some 

12 slightly different qualification. I'm not quite sure 

13 what it is. 

14  MR. COLEMAN: Well, I -- I'm not sure 

exactly what you're angling for there. But at the end 

16 of the day, I think that there is also a -- a 

17 misunderstanding about what article 64 is. 

18  Skinner treats article 64 as simply: I 

19 asked for evidence, and I get evidence. And you denied 

-- you denied me the DNA. What article 64 actually is, 

21 it's a motion, as I mentioned, filed in the criminal 

22 case itself, that says: Judge, I want a ruling that if 

23 this additional DNA evidence were known at the time of 

24 trial, then I probably would not have been convicted.

 And the process for obtaining that ruling is

1 to make an initial threshold showing that suggests the 

2 materiality of the DNA evidence. If you get over that 

3 threshold, then you move on to testing, and you get a 

4 hearing and an ultimate determination.

 But there are really only two results in 

6 article 64. One is a ruling that you probably would not 

7 have been convicted. Or, two, I reject your request for 

8 a ruling that you probably would not have been 

9 convicted. And that's what he got. It is a motion that 

goes to the core of the conviction itself. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: But if -- in Heck itself, 

12 we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if 

13 successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any 

14 outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be 

allowed to proceed. 

16  Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we 

17 say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is 

18 another circumstance. 

19  MR. COLEMAN: Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Even though it will not 

21 demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should 

22 not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, "related to" the

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was going to ask if 

6 you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument. 

7 What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's 

8 counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here? 

9  MR. COLEMAN: There -- there is a way. 

When -- when the court said in Osborne you should use 

11 these State statutes and you may -- you might have a 

12 procedural due process, the court was not saying we are 

13 going to create out of whole cloth an entirely new 

14 category of procedural due process.

 You do it like you do any other procedural 

16 due process. If you go into the system and you -- you 

17 file -- and again litigation is different from an 

18 administrative procedure, which is what Dotson was 

19 about. You're in litigation and you're in court. And 

if somebody says, well, there's this prong that you 

21 can't meet, and you think it violates due process, you 

22 have an obligation to raise it then, and then you have 

23 an opportunity, if the court rules against you, to file 

24 a cert petition.

1 is, from this very limited area, is that the one thing 

2 that you can't do is file a Federal 1983 lawsuit saying 

3 I think that what the State court did is arbitrary and 

4 capricious.

 And, so, Skinner is asking you to create a 

6 1983 lawsuit that is always Rooker-Feldman barred and 

7 always preclusion barred, because you're asking the 

8 court to declare that the State courts violated your -­

9 the constitutional rights in the way they went about it. 

And -- and so he's asking you to create a category of 

11 1983 suits that runs exactly contrary to Rooker-Feldman 

12 and exactly contrary to what Heck said is this 

13 overriding interest in ensuring that these types of 

14 collateral attacks are brought, if at all, in habeas and 

not through generalized 1983 lawsuits that don't provide 

16 any of the protections that Congress has insisted by 

17 statute be applied in these types of suits. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then, can you give us 

19 your best modified statement of Wilkinson against 

Dotson? I think you were telling us that that formula 

21 fit that type of case, would necessarily demonstrate the 

22 invalidity of the conviction. 

23  It's given here that this evidence would not

conviction; nonetheless, you say it falls on the habeas

1 side of the line. That does require you to ask for a 

2 modification of the Wilkinson v. Dotson formula, and I 

3 ask -- if you could say what that would be, what that 

4 precise modification would be?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, first, I don't believe 

6 the Court has ever acknowledged the existence of a cause 

7 of action for discovery separate and apart from the 

8 merits of what you are seeking to do. 

9  The merits of what he's seeking to do is to 

attack his custody. That is something that can and 

11 should be brought in habeas. And the Court should not, 

12 for many reasons, create a cause of action that -- whose 

13 sole purpose is to run counter to Rooker-Feldman and 

14 whose sole purpose is to avoid the protections of 

habeas. 

16  Again, this is not an expansion of habeas. 

17 It's simply a recognition that he has a claim that he 

18 can bring in habeas, it -- it probably is a loser and we 

19 think it certainly would be a loser, but the question 

is, can he bring it, and if he can, it should be subject 

21 to these types of things. And at the end, when you 

22 recognize what he is trying to do, this is fundamentally 

23 a question or a -- he is seeking to invalidate his

6 within "necessarily implies," or is there another 

7 formulation that you think we should have? 

8  MR. COLEMAN: We think given the nature of 

9 the article 64 proceeding, which is itself an attack on 

the conviction, it is a request that the Court declare 

11 that the conviction is probably invalid, that because 

12 that is what he is attacking, he is saying the result

8 article 64 on its face, right? Or are you? 

9  MR. OWEN: Your Honor, this -- this came up 

as we were preparing for our presentation, and I think 

11 there's -- there's -- here's what I would like to say: 

12 We are not suggesting that article 64 -- that there's no 

13 way to interpret article 64 that the court could have 

14 chosen to -- to construe the statute that would always 

be unconstitutional in every case. That's what -­

3  MR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. Our claim -­

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that was a good 

enough excuse to excuse the fact that he didn't do 

6 DNA -- DNA testing at the time of trial? Because that's 

7 what the statute says. You can't get it if it was 

8 present at the time and -- meaning if that actual test 

9 that you're seeking was available at the time of trial, 

or you don't prove that you couldn't have done it for a 

11 good reason. So what is it exactly that the court did 

12 in applying this that was unconstitutional? 

13  MR. OWEN: Your Honor, I think it's not the 

14 specific question to whether in our case they didn't 

consider our ineffective assistance of counsel 

16 arguments. It's that it made no provision for any 

17 exception to its rule. In other words, that it 

18 interpreted this as a blanket proscription on seeking 

19 testing for anybody who didn't seek it prior to trial.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, wait a minute. 

21 That's what the statute says. The statute gives the 

22 conditions under which a petitioner can seek DNA 

23 evidence, and it said you didn't meet those conditions.

 MR. OWEN: That it -- that it is not -- that 

16 it does not admit of any exceptions and that it doesn't 

17 have any reference to the purposes of the statute, the 

18 reasoning the testing might not have been sought in a 

19 particular case, or the fact, particularly that, in our 

case, Mr. Skinner at the time of his trial, this -- the 

21 postconviction DNA testing statute was still 6 years in 

22 the future. So that -- so that to the extent the Court

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And that that falls outside 

6 the bounds of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine? 

7  MR. OWEN: Yes, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Whereas, if you were saying 

9 that the statute -- that the application of the statute 

in this particular case was wrongful, that would not 

11 fall outside of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine; is that 

12 right? 

13  MR. OWEN: That's right, Your Honor, and the 

14 comment that was made during Respondent's argument 

about -- he said we are challenging, in his words, the 

16 way the State court went about applying the law to Mr. 

17 Skinner. That's not what we're challenging. We're 

18 challenging the statute as construed. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is 

22 submitted. 

23  (Whereupon at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
