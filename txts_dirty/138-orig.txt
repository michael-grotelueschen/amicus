CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 138 in our original 

docket, South Carolina v. North Carolina. 

Mr. Frederick. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

South Carolina seeks an equitable 

apportionment with North Carolina of the Catawba River. 

Both States act as parens patriae on behalf of all users 

of the river within their boundaries. 

For three reasons, this Court should not 

adopt the Special Master's recommendation that 

Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply 

Project be permitted to intervene as parties in this 

original action: 

First, the report articulates the wrong 

legal test for intervention. Second, under the New 

Jersey v. New York standard, none of the three entities 

should be permitted to intervene. And, third, the 

report's approach to intervention involves this Court in 

deciding intramural disputes between and among water

users in one State. 

With respect to the first point, the Special 

Master applied the wrong factors, we would submit, in 

deciding whether or not a party or an intervenor should 

be allowed to intervene as a party. 

The Special Master sought to distill from 

this Court's cases three principles that we would submit 

are not the appropriate principles in deciding an 

intervenor's status. 

First, the report overemphasizes the, quote, 

"direct stake," although the master found that the 

equitable apportionment had no specific impact on 

individual users of the water. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

friends agreed that the New Jersey v. New York standard 

applied? 

MR. FREDERICK: Your Honor, part of what you 

will be deciding in this case is the appropriate 

standard for intervention, and the Special Master, we 

respectfully submit, did not apply the New Jersey v. New 

York factors. Instead, the report distilled from other 

cases, not the New Jersey v. New York case, the 

principles that she thought should apply to govern an 

intervenor's status, and those three principles, we 

would submit, are incorrect.

Under the New Jersey v. New York standard, 

the master did not make findings that would be 

appropriate to determine the intervenor status here as 

appropriate parties. There was no finding of inadequate 

representation by either State to support any of the 

intervenor’s request to participate as parties. There 

was no finding of a compelling interest in the sense 

that it was truly compelling. It's hard to argue in 

cases in -- where there is no case from this Court in 

the equitable apportionment area that three intervenors 

would have met the compelling interest standard here. 

And, finally, the New York-New Jersey 

standard talks about having interests that are apart 

from other interests. But both Charlotte and the 

Catawba River Water Supply Project are simply acting on 

behalf of all users of North Carolina water. They 

simply happen to be the largest ones. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, we -- we had 

a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in 

which it was a State against State case, but we allowed 

the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene. 

Now, why is that any different from this 

case? 

MR. FREDERICK: First, the interests were 

different. They were not an equitable apportionment

where the water --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that make any 

difference? 

MR. FREDERICK: This Court has said for 200 

years that water is a unique resource within the 

sovereign control of States. 

In the Maryland case, the Court permitted 

intervention in a situation in which Louisiana had sued 

the pipeline companies in Louisiana State court for a 

declaratory judgment that its tax was constitutional. 

There was also a pending FERC action in Federal court in 

Louisiana raising the same issue, so when Maryland and 

eight other States who were not parens patriae of the 

various pipeline companies who sought to intervene filed 

the original action, I think the Court appropriately 

considered that interests of judicial efficiency called 

for handling the Commerce Clause challenge in the 

original action in this case. 

And finally, the Court only devoted two 

sentences of its opinion and didn't cite the New Jersey 

v. -- New York v. New Jersey case in acting on the 

intervention. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, these – these 

are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to 

when we are going to allow intervention or not? Do –-

is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if 

I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected 

intervention that has been recommended by the Special 

Master? 

MR. FREDERICK: I don't think I can recall a 

case in that factual scenario, but I can point you to 

Kentucky v. Indiana in 1930, in which this Court 

rejected Kentucky's attempt to join individual Indiana 

citizens as parties in an original action over 

Indiana's alleged breach of a contract to build an 

interstate bridge. And the reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your 

basic argument that each State should represent its own 

constituents. But isn't the Catawba River Water Supply 

Project in a different category? Because it straddles 

both States, and I think it can reasonably fear that it 

would be treated as a stepchild by both States. 

MR. FREDERICK: No, in fact, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit they have the weakest 

claim to intervention in this case. 

Their argument, fundamentally, is that Union 

County, North Carolina, which is the North Carolina part 

of the joint venture with the Lancaster Water District, 

should be permitted to have water purchased from the 

South Carolina side of the boundary. So what's

happening with that water project is the water is sucked 

out on the South Carolina side and piped north for Union 

County's consumption under a Union County permit with 

the State of North Carolina. Union County, therefore, 

is acting as any other user of water, along with 

Charlotte and all other users of water in North 

Carolina. 

The Catawba Project is not here to intervene 

to protect its interests on the South Carolina side of 

the boundary. Those are adequately protected, we 

submit, by the attorney general acting on behalf of the 

State. So in effect the Union County, North Carolina, 

claim here of 5 million gallons of water per day which 

they are seeking to protect through their intervention 

is no different than the other interests of North 

Carolina water users that they are seeking to protect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that these --

these three entities are the principal entities that are 

guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially 

what the -- what the dispute is about. 

MR. FREDERICK: The dispute is about the 

transfer of water and consumption of water in toto. The 

Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the focus -- the 

focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers,

isn't it? 

MR. FREDERICK: The focus of the complaint 

highlights interbasin transfers to the extent that they 

are a large quantifiable amount of water being taken out 

of the Catawba River, that we submit should not be 

counted on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And these three 

entities account for a very large proportion of those 

interbasin transfers. Isn't it the case that any -- any 

decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will 

necessarily impact directly these three entities? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? 

MR. FREDERICK: Because in an equitable 

apportionment case, this Court decides which share of 

the water is allocable to each State. It is a question 

of State law how each State shall determine the 

intrastate allocations of the water. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but I'm 

talking about the real world. If -- if indeed North 

Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of 

this Court says that it's taking too much because of 

interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three 

entities are going to be out of luck. 

MR. FREDERICK: We take the real world, Your

Honor, as this Court's cases direct us, and those cases 

tell us that in situations where the Court is deciding 

an equitable apportionment between two States -- water, 

of course, is fungible. It's a series of molecules that 

do not accord property rights in any one entity or user. 

They all divine from the State itself. 

So if North Carolina, in its exercise of 

parens patriae responsibility, determines that Charlotte 

should have a larger share than what it currently has, 

that's a decision for Charlotte -- for North Carolina as 

a political entity to decide among its users. It does 

not necessarily implicate this Court's action in an 

equitable apportionment to say that what the Court will 

ultimately decide is what Charlotte's share is. That is 

not what we are seeking, and that's not what an 

injunction from this Court equitably apportioning the 

Catawba River would necessarily decide. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, if this 

were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the 

rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in 

dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect 

to the trial judge's determination. 

So even though the civil rules are not 

binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a

sound approach that we should adopt? Just as a court of 

appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so 

we should give a healthy measure of deference to the 

Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful. 

MR. FREDERICK: No, for several reasons, 

Justice Ginsburg. First, in any appellate review 

Situation, this Court would review de novo the legal 

test that would be applied. Our initial submission is 

the master applied and articulated the wrong legal test. 

So you would first need to determine, we would submit, 

what is the correct legal test for submission. That is 

a de novo review standard. 

But secondly, the Court has said in numerous 

original cases it does not apply deference, although it 

gives appropriate respect to special masters, and so 

there would be no basis for applying a deference 

standard to a special master ruling on a question of law 

that fundamentally is about what this Court's original 

jurisdiction under Article III is supposed to be about. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But, in fact, we've never 

rejected a special master's desire to -- to have 

intervenors in the case. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, virtually every case, 

Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that oil case that I

mentioned. I forget the name of it. The tax --

MR. FREDERICK: Maryland v. Louisiana. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. What had the Special 

Master recommended in that case? 

MR. FREDERICK: There was actually no 

special master recommendation in that case. The Court 

decided it on its motion directly to this Court. 

Virtually all of the cases that we cited in 

the blue brief highlight the fact that special masters 

routinely reject motions to intervene. It is the rare 

situation in which a special master would allow 

intervention. 

And the only example that the other side can 

come up with is the Nebraska v. Wyoming case, in which 

finally Basin Electric, after 10 years of participating 

in the original action as an amicus, was allowed to 

intervene because the Special Master viewed there to be 

tension between the State of Nebraska's interest and 

that that Basin Electric was seeking to vindicate. You 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, can we go 

back a little? I think you just said there was no 

special master's recommendation in 

Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745. In 

the footnote 21, it said: "The master recommended that

we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to 

intervene as plaintiffs." And then it says: "It is not 

unusual to permit intervention of private parties in 

original actions." 

MR. FREDERICK: And the case that it cited 

is Oklahoma v. Texas, which is a very unusual case from 

this Court's docket in the 1920s. What the Court 

decided in 1932, Justice Ginsburg, in the Wyoming and 

Colorado case was that in situations involving 

interstate allocations of water, the claimants or users 

of a State are deemed to be represented by the State. 

The case on which the Court relied in the Maryland case 

was back into an old era in which it was unclear whether 

States acting as parens patriae had the responsibility 

to act on behalf of all claimants or users of water. 

The Maryland case, as I said before, did not 

analyze the New Jersey v. New York factors, and I would 

submit that in light of the other circumstances of the 

case, the fact that it was a Commerce Clause challenge 

involving Federal, State, and private companies, in 

which there was multiple litigation pending in various 

forums, it was an exercise of the Court's decision to 

efficiently decide the Commerce Clause challenge to 

allow those pipeline companies in, where some of those 

pipeline companies were not represented by States that

were parties in the case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess I 

haven't heard yet an answer to Justice Ginsburg's first 

question about whether there was a recommendation from 

the Special Master or not. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, I -- I will -- I 

obviously forgot about footnote 21 of the Court's 

opinion in Maryland v. Louisiana, Justice Ginsburg. But 

I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know 

that you've actually addressed the operative question of 

what amount of discretion, if any, are we going to give 

to special masters to determine when they require the 

presence of a party to do equity, which is what I read 

the Special Master to be suggesting. These are the 

three biggest users of water, at least one of them 

straddles both States, another has a potential license. 

And so that each of them has a different situation than 

a normal water user. 

So, you're -- all you're begging is the 

question of whether we just say you can't. But why is 

the "you can't" compelled, either by our case law or by 

any original jurisdiction principle? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, let's start with the 

original jurisdiction principle. Those are actions that

are brought invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, 

which this Court could sit without a special master 

and would decide the matter as it sits as a court of 

nine. The fact that it appoints a special master to 

assist and facilitate that effort does not imbue the 

actions of that person delegated that responsibility 

with something akin to the deference given to district 

judges in making various fact findings. 

Secondly, on a question of law, as 

intervention fundamentally is -- and ultimately we are 

talking about the scope and contours of this Court's 

exercise of original jurisdiction -- what the Court has 

said is that there are two interests that are ultimately 

being protected: One is the dignity interest of the 

State acting in its sovereign capacity on a subject, 

water, that quintessentially is sovereign; and it is 

doing so for judicial efficiency purposes, because it 

allows the Court to expect each State to represent 

adequately all of the users of water in that State. 

So, for those reasons, we think that a 

special master recommendation ought to be reviewed with 

the same level of scrutiny that all other aspects of a 

special master’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've -- we've 

allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States.

We have allowed one State to sue another State and a

MR. FREDERICK: Not in an equitable 

apportionment. And -- and I think the -- the scope of 

the relief is important. And that is because the State 

seeking the relief is assuming the risk that the relief 

that it wants to get from that State is an inadequate 

form of relief. 

Here the form of relief South Carolina seeks 

goes only against North Carolina. We cannot get an 

equitable apportionment with Charlotte or the Catawba 

Project. We can only get it from North Carolina. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don’t --

can we take this case on the assumption that nothing 

that you obtain in the way of relief will affect Duke 

Power under the comprehensive relicensing agreement?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't we have to take the 

case on the assumption that their rights under that 

agreement might be affected? 

MR. FREDERICK: They might be affected, but 

only in an ancillary way. It is an -- part of an 

application to the FERC. The FERC here is saying it 

does not affect it because the license itself will not

MR. FREDERICK: Neither the agreement –- and 

this is at page 51 to 52 of our brief, citing 39 of the 

CRA -- says it doesn't affect water rights. The final 

environmental impact statement from FERC says it doesn't 

affect apportionment interstate issues. Both FERC and 

the CRA itself disclaim any impact on the equitable 

apportionment action pending here.

represented by the State. In an equitable apportionment 

action, the interest that is at stake is not a private 

property interest in water. Rather, it is the sovereign 

interest of a State in a particular share of the 

waters of an interstate river. For that reason, a 

private interest in water is not an appropriate basis 

for intervention in such a proceeding. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on, I suppose, 

on what you mean by “is not properly represented by the 

State.” If you think the State does not have a 

sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular 

right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that 

qualify? 

MR. MILLER: Well, I think that the interest 

that the private party has is a State law property 

interest in water, and that’s an interest that simply 

isn't at stake in an equitable apportionment action. 

The only thing that this Court is deciding is what share 

of the river does each State get. 

The Court in an equitable apportionment 

action does not decide the purely intrastate question of 

how will that share be allocated. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you could say that 

realistically when you are talking about an individual 

water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal

about the biggest entities that are going to be affected 

by the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me. 

MR. MILLER: Well, that -- I mean, in New 

Jersey v. New York, Philadelphia, which sought to 

intervene in that case, constituted a majority of the 

water users within the State of Philadelphia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did the special master 

think Philadelphia should have been let in? 

MR. MILLER: I don't recall what the special 

master --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The answer is no. 

MR. MILLER: -- said in that case. But this 

Court has held in, for example, Colorado v. New Mexico, 

that even on purely factual questions, the special 

master is -- who makes recommendations, and those 

recommendations are reviewed by this Court de novo. The 

Court is not sitting in an appellate capacity. This is 

a case within its original jurisdiction, and this Court 

has an independent responsibility to make a 

determination, even on factual questions and a fortiori 

on questions of intervention. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but we haven't -- we 

haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what 

would facilitate the proceeding. Much of the discovery

in the case has already focused on these three entities, 

hasn't it? 

MR. MILLER: That's right. And to the 

extent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So to say that they are 

just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is –- is 

really very unrealistic. 

MR. MILLER: Well, to the -- I mean, to the 

extent that they have valuable information to provide, 

third-party discovery can take account of that, as can 

amicus participation. It would be entirely appropriate 

for parties that have information or a special 

perspective on the case to present an amicus submission 

to the Special Master or to this Court. And it's -- but 

that -- that's not a basis for allowing them to become 

full parties through intervention. 

And then, to the extent that there's a 

concern about the management of this case, I think it's 

important to keep in mind that the rule recommended by 

the Special Master and the rule that the would-be 

intervenors are urging this Court to adopt would, of 

course, apply not just in this litigation, but in every 

equitable apportionment action. And not only does it 

make the litigation of those actions much more difficult 

to have additional non-State parties in, but it makes it

much more difficult for those cases to be settled. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if that -- if and 

when that is the case, the Special Master will not want 

them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters 

have not wanted them to come in, in the past. I don't 

think that's going to change. 

MR. MILLER: I -- I guess what I would 

say is that I don't think that, either in the 

recommendation of the Special Master in this case or in 

the submissions of the -- the would-be intervenors, that 

there’s really any logical limiting principle that 

would not allow, as a matter of routine, large water 

users to come in to equitable apportionment actions. 

And that's inappropriate for the more 

fundamental reason that these original actions in this 

Court are not ordinary cases. This Court has said that 

sitting in judgment between two sovereigns is one of the 

most grave -- grave and delicate responsibilities the 

Court has, and it’s a sparingly exercised jurisdiction 

reserved for the most serious of issues, issues of such 

importance that, if the States were independent 

countries, would be resolved through treaties or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But not reserved 

exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and 

another State. We've allowed it to cover suits between

a State and another State and private citizens of the 

other State. 

MR. MILLER: Yes. And when a State brings 

such an action or seeks to bring such an action, it 

can't simply file a complaint as of right. It has to 

seek this Court's permission to file the complaint. And 

this Court can review the complaint at that time and 

look at who the parties are and figure out whether it's 

an appropriate case for the exercise of this Court's 

jurisdiction. And that, in our view, is a much more 

appropriate way to proceed, making that determination at 

the outset on the basis of the State's complaint, rather 

than through piecemeal litigation as different non-State 

parties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, here the complaint 

was South Carolina's complaint, and these are 

intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's 

side. 

MR. MILLER: That's where they were seeking 

to intervene on North Carolina's side as defendants. 

That's right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And as representing the 

position of the United States, would you address the 

FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?

27 of the Federal Power Act, which is 16 U.S.C. 821, the 

Power Act does not affect State law water rights. So 

State law water rights are taken as a given, and it's up 

to the licensee to have the necessary State water 

rights, and a FERC license does not in any way alter the 

distribution of State law property rights in water. 

And what the commission has said in this 

case in the final environmental impact statement with 

respect to Duke's relicensing application, which is 

available on the commission Web site, it cited section 

27 and it said: "Any license that is issued will not 

impose requirements, including minimum flows, that 

infringe on water rights or apportionments." So the 

commission is aware of the pendency of this case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't a matter of 

infringing on water rights or apportionments. I mean, 

that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of 

the license or the denial of a renewal of the license 

because Duke Power does not have enough water. That 

wouldn't preclude that, would it? 

MR. MILLER: Well, the -- the nature of this 

proceeding makes that outcome not -- not something that 

would happen even if South Carolina were to prevail, 

because what South Carolina is seeking is to get more 

water flowing downstream to it, and so the -- the

licensing conditions, which generally impose minimum 

flow requirements at each of the various dams operated 

by Duke, would be easier to satisfy, not harder to 

satisfy, if South Carolina were -- had an entitlement to 

get even more water flowing through --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand that. I don't understand that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What happens to North 

Carolina if it has less water? What does it do with 

respect to Duke? 

MR. MILLER: Well, Duke -- Duke's dams –-

the licensing condition is that each dam allow a certain 

amount of water to flow through, under the current 

license that they are operating under, and there are 

different minimum flow requirements under the renewal 

license that is being sought. But an order in effect 

requiring that they let more water flow through would 

not be in conflict with the licensing requirement, but 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why isn't Duke 

Power -- why isn't Duke Power on the other side, then?

MR. MILLER: Well, they -- I mean, one 

possibility is, of course, that Duke is -- in addition 

to obviously being an operator of dams, Duke is a very 

large consumer of water. In fact, it's the largest 

consumer of water on the Catawba system because of its 

coal and nuclear power plants which use water 

evaporatively for cooling of the power plants. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it may also mean it 

when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its 

impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to 

generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its 

license. 

MR. MILLER: It -- it may have some effect 

on its ability to -- to generate power. But that makes 

it a large industrial user of water, akin to those that 

the Court referred to in New Jersey v. New York, which 

were not entitled to intervene. 

I would also point out in further response, 

Mr. Chief Justice, to your question, that Duke is a 

North Carolina corporation, which may be why it's 

seeking to come in on the North Carolina side of this 

case. 

But I -- I want to return to the idea that 

these kinds of cases are not ordinary cases. They 

involve sovereign interests, and I think what's

important about that is that the interest --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Miller, if I -- if I 

understood your argument, you are saying that Duke's 

interests are really with South Carolina, or -- to 

increase the flow. But I would think then it would be 

North Carolina who would be objecting to their 

participation in the case rather than South Carolina. 

And they don't. They -- they welcomed them in, as I 

remember the papers. 

MR. MILLER: As I said, Duke is an operator 

of thermal power plants that are large consumers of 

water, and some of those are located in North Carolina.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI 

ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENORS 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The Special Master correctly concluded that 

Charlotte, Duke, and the Catawba River Water Supply 

Project should intervene in this original action. Her 

recommendation deserves some deference because she is in 

the best position to know whether these parties would 

assist her in the adjudication of this complex dispute.

jurisdiction. I regard the Special Master as more akin 

to a law clerk than a district judge. We don't defer to 

somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us 

gather things here. I think on legal questions of 

intervention we have to decide de novo. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Our claim is not that the 

Special Master should get deference on legal questions, 

but she should get deference on -- on the narrow 

question of whether it would be helpful to her to have 

these intervenors in the case. She has --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what she 

said that makes them helpful. What can they provide 

that couldn't be done by merely an amici submission? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, she pointed out, 

for example, that Duke Energy, which controls the flow 

of this river and is participating in the FERC 

proceedings, would establish a -- a direct link between 

this adjudication and what's going on before the FERC. 

And of course those two proceedings have -- have a lot 

of interaction. I think it's also fair to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, your adversary has 

just said none, according to the terms of the license 

and what the FERC has said. So why is -- why don't we 

just take what FERC has said --

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think FERC has not said

effect upon the licensing proceeding from the original 

action. There could be a conflict between the decree 

that comes down, if one comes down in this Court, and 

the terms of the FERC license. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I think all FERC said 

is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would 

require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina. 

And that's quite different from whether -- whether a 

severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would --

would affect the -- the nature of the license given by 

FERC. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Duke of course 

pulled together 69 other stakeholders to join the 

comprehensive relicensing agreement to -- to smooth 

FERC's acceptance of -- of the new license. And this 

original action is -- will pit the two Carolinas, each 

of which seeks to maximize their share of the river, and 

those interests work at odds with the CRA, which 

endorses a compromise middle flow position that –- that 

neither of the Carolinas seeks to defend in this action.

jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to 

resolve disputes between sovereign States. And I look 

out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening 

in a way that would give them party status. And I think 

that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is 

supposed to be about. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Mr. Chief Justice, 

private parties and cities have intervened in the past 

in original actions and have been named as defendants in 

original actions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But even in the New 

Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that 

would have allowed the intervention did say that in 

general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction 

cases with non-State parties. That was even the 

dissenters. So you start out with in general it's not 

wise to let these people come in. 

And following up on the Chief's question, a 

State can't be sued without its consent. And it's true 

here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but 

it's initiating the action against a sister State. The 

Special Master's recommendation would require the State 

to have as its direct adversary three parties who are 

not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion 

of original jurisdiction. It's a controversy between

two States. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, in -- Justice 

Ginsburg, in the case of New Jersey v. New York, New 

York City was a party defendant, and in this case the 

City of Charlotte occupies the exact same position as 

New York City. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's because the State 

chose 

to sue it as a party defendant. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It did, but of course a 

State can only sue a proper party defendant. Whether 

the question is intervention or whether it's naming a 

city as a defendant in an original action, both have to 

pass the test of is this city or non-State a proper 

party defendant? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're -- all of the 

intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make 

sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: That -- that is not their 

exclusive interest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, their -- well, 

they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No. Duke Energy, for 

example, doesn't have an interest in maximizing the flow 

on the North Carolina side of the river. Duke’s -- Duke

Energy's interest is in preserving the -- the flow

extent they have differing interests, why aren't those 

interests fully satisfied by amicus participation? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, when -- when South 

Carolina first opposed, for example, Charlotte's motion 

to intervene, it said: Oh, Charlotte, you can file an 

amicus brief as to any dispositive motion. Well, that 

kind of amicus participation is vastly different from 

being able to shape the record on which the -- the key 

issues in this case are finally decided.

leave to file exceptions to an --

to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by 

whether or not the State that is on their side wants to 

file exceptions. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, let me say two 

things, Mr. Chief Justice: If the proposed decree 

affects the interests of Charlotte or the joint venture 

or Duke, I think they ought to be allowed to file 

exceptions, which this Court can grant leave or not. 

As to the specter of 20 possible 

intervenors --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how does that get us 

to avoid involvement in interstate -- intrastate 

disputes over water use? That just drags us right into 

your problems among your water users. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, South Carolina and 

the United States present this vision of an equitable 

apportionment action in which the Special Master simply 

divides up the flow of the river, and then it's up to 

each State to subdivide among its users. 

But that is not what has happened in 

equitable apportionment cases. In New Jersey v. New 

York, for example, this Court entered a decree, which 

enjoined the flow of the Delaware River to New York City 

above a specified level. I think 411 cubic feet per 

second.

And -- and that is the kind of decree that 

South Carolina, I believe, is seeking in this case. If 

you look at paragraph 2 of South Carolina's prayer for 

relief, they want an injunction against the interbasin 

transfers currently being carried -- carried out by 

Charlotte and the joint venture. So this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And North Carolina, 

as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its 

constituents as it sees fit. 

You and your fellow prospective intervenors 

just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is 

convince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, to 

get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get 

it or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, to 

give it to you, rather than the other parties. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, as to Duke --

Mr. Chief Justice, I have explained, Duke's interest is 

not in maximizing the share -- North Carolina's share of 

the river. 

The joint venture of the Catawba River Water 

Supply Project is not represented by either State 

because it's a bi-State entity. Neither -- and both of 

the Carolinas is -- are affirmatively hostile to part of 

the operations of the joint venture.

They can just come right in here, as if they were a 

State, and participate in the case. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

I think this -- this is not a novel proposition. The 

City of Port Arthur was allowed to intervene in the case 

of Texas v. Louisiana. 

Five Indian tribes intervened in Arizona v. 

California, and New York City was allowed to be a party 

defendant in the New Jersey case, even though the Court 

could have dismissed it from the case, as it did to the 

Indiana citizens in --

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: We are saying that the 

Special Master got it right, when she said that you have 

to show a compelling interest that's not properly 

represented by a party State, and she applied the New 

Jersey v. New York test, finding, at page 27 of her 

report, that neither Charlotte nor the joint venture 

are properly represented. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you see the issue 

before us as being was she right or wrong, even though 

Nevada said -- I'm sorry -- that North Carolina said 

that it was going to adequately represent each of these 

interests, but that just wasn't correct? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think the question 

is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That North Carolina is 

not telling us the truth? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think the question is, 

should the Court accept the Special Master's 

recommendation? And I would disagree with South 

Carolina, when it says that she applied the wrong legal 

test. 

She did apply New Jersey v. New York. She 

did find that the intervenors were not properly

It controls the flow of the river, and there’s no one 

else like Duke on the Catawba. 

The other two intervenors are the cause of 

the harm for which South Carolina seeks injunctive 

relief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- because they use 

a lot of water. And my question is: How do we decide 

once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these 

people in with party status -- what users can come in 

where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of 

the river water to come in, so which ones can and which 

ones can't? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Certainly, our position 

is not that mere users of water or all users of water 

may intervene in original action. 

You have to show a compelling interest 

that’s not properly represented, and that's going to 

depend upon the specific facts of the case.

intervention? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No, Justice Scalia. I 

would say it's not automatic because there are some 

other considerations the Special Master can bring to 

bear. 

For example, timeliness -- you can't show up 20 years 

after the litigation has started, like the City of 

Philadelphia, and expect to get in. You --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, also, how helpful the 

intervention will be to the management of the case. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Correct. Or, conversely, 

how --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, of course, the Special 

Master's determination of that is not final. It's 

ultimately up to us. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it is a discretionary 

intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It is discretionary, and 

if -- if the Special Master believes that -- that this 

complex multiyear water rights dispute would be aided by 

the presence of a -- of a limited number of intervenors 

who have a very special interest in the case, then 

that's something that, for institutional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's special 

about it? I mean, let's say I own a little farm on 

the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- so 

the cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte get 

a special status just because they take a lot? 

I'm affected by how much water runs through 

there. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, Charlotte has 

special status because South Carolina seeks specific 

relief -- injunctive relief -- against Charlotte's 

interbasin transfer. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and that 

relief will affect how much water is available for me to 

draw out and use on my farm. That's a compelling 

interest. 

I -- you know, in times of drought, this 

water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the 

farm is going to go down. It seems to me that, when you 

say they have a special interest, you are just saying 

they have got a big interest. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It's not just that it’s 

-- it’s a big interest, and it surely is, but they are 

singled out in South Carolina's complaint, and 

injunctive relief is sought against them, which, I 

think, brings into the play the rule this Court

announced in Kentucky v. Indiana, which is that, if a 

plaintiff or plaintiff State in an original action is 

seeking relief against a citizen of a State, that 

citizen ought to have an opportunity to come into the 

litigation and defend its interests. 

That's what Charlotte is seeking in this 

case. The joint venture, of course, is not represented 

by either State fully because both States are hostile to 

at least part of what the joint venture does. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say the 

interest -- the dispute is really in effect between 

company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South 

Carolina. I mean, do we -- we would not accept an 

original action if they sued each other, right? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No -- well, of course –-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we let them just 

use the States as, you know, a façade to get into 

this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: No. As in Kentucky v. 

Indiana, if there are improper parties in original 

action, they -- they can be dismissed, but I think it's 

noteworthy that the Court allowed the New Jersey 

litigation to proceed with New York City as a party 

defendant.

indistinguishable from the position of -- of New York 

City in that action, with -- with the sole exception 

that Charlotte seeks to intervene, whereas New York City 

was named as a party defendant. 

South Carolina invokes the principle that it 

is the master of its complaint, and we would agree with 

that, in part. A plaintiff is the master of the 

allegations in claims it seeks to make, but a plaintiff 

is not a master of the universe of -- of interests that 

-- that may be affected by the lawsuit they have -- they 

have brought. That’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the same --

the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a 

private party defendant, as you would urge for 

intervention by a private party defendant? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Yes. I think there would 

be a very similar analysis. I think that the question 

whether a proposed defendant -- and of course, you need 

leave from this Court to file an original action or to 

name someone as a defendant in an original action. I 

think, in both cases, it raises the question: Is –- is 

this entity a proper party defendant or is the entity a 

proper 

intervenor? 

I think it's a similar analysis.

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 

In what respect does the relief sought against the city 

differ from the relief sought against the State? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: In this respect, Justice 

Stevens: The -- the complaint prays for North Carolina 

to stop authorizing the interbasin transfers being 

carried out by Charlotte and the joint venture. But --

but Charlotte and the joint venture are the entities 

whose primary conduct, if you will, would be affected by 

that injunction. They are the parties who are carrying 

out the interbasin transfers, and they would have to 

stop those transfers if -- if authorization was 

withdrawn by North Carolina. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn’t it – would 

it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that 

all the issue that she was going to address was the 

relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina 

and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina 

wanted an injunction directed against the City of 

Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina? North Carolina 

can divvy up its water however it wants. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: I think it would not be 

surprising if she came down -- if she were to come down 

with a decree, it would not be surprising that -- that 

it would decide whether or not to allow Charlotte's

interbasin transfers to continue. 

Because that's -- that was much like what 

was decided, for example, in New Jersey v. New York. 

There was the proposed diversion of water to New York 

City, and the Court there ultimately entered a partial 

injunction that banned flows to New York City above a 

certain level. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in -- in deciding 

what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the 

-- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master, 

initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one 

State or the other are not equitable uses --

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: And, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and go beyond what is 

reasonable. So I don't see how you could decide the 

case without deciding whether especially particularly 

massive uses are appropriate or not. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Not just massive. 

There's -- it's no accident that South Carolina focuses 

upon these interbasin transfers, because they inflict a 

special injury, in South Carolina's view. 

The interbasin transfers take water out of 

the river basin, and -- and so it doesn't come back to 

South Carolina within the basin. Other types of uses of 

water are non-consumptive, in the sense that the water

But South Carolina has targeted these

the water has left the basin --

dispute, or do they account for more like 50 percent?

to me.

significant proportion. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You must have some idea. 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: It’s a significant 

proportion. It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, significant – is 

that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent? 

I mean, nobody has ever bothered to look at that in this 

whole case? 

MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Well, I haven’t done that 

calculation. I will say that they are significant 

enough that South Carolina seeks a specific injunction 

against those interbasin transfers. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I guess it depends on 

what you mean by the water in dispute. If the main 

gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they 

-- they occupy a huge proportion of that.

Scalia asked Mr. Frederick, but I think his response 

needs clarification from North Carolina's perspective. 

The first question dealt with Maryland v. 

Louisiana, and Mr. Frederick responded that that case, 

in which 17 pipeline companies were permitted to 

intervene -- according to Mr. Frederick, the States in 

that case did not serve as parens patriae with regard to 

those 17 pipeline companies. That is factually 

incorrect. In that case, two of those pipeline 

companies -- the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline Company was 

a resident of the State of Michigan, one of the 

complaining States in that case, as well as the National 

Gas Pipeline Company of America was an Illinois 

corporation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maryland v. 

Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies, 

and they were allowed to intervene. This is not that. 

This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of 

the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with 

the water whatever it will. 

It strikes me as very different than 

Maryland v. Louisiana. 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, in Maryland v. 

Louisiana, that was a taxation case, a case that goes to 

a fundamental interest of the States, the power of

taxation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did the decree only 

apply to taxing these particular companies? Could the 

-- could the State have taxed other companies after the 

decree issued? 

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, as the 

Plaintiff States were seeking to attack the Louisiana 

tax at issue. So it would have general applicability. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As -- as the 

allocation would in this case, presumably. 

MR. BROWNING: Well, I don’t -- and that 

question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that yes or no? I --

you say yes, it would have general applicability. 

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, 

Justice Scalia. 

Your Honor, South Carolina has said that 

this case is about consumption of water in toto. But 

when you look at their bill of complaint, that is simply 

not the case. When you look at the question presented 

in their leave for -- their motion for leave to file a 

bill of complaint, it starts out whether North 

Carolina's interbasin transfer statute is invalid under 

the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. 

And when you look at the allegations in the bill of

is seeking injunctive relief with respect to those 

interbasin transfers. We --

involved? Is there -- because I am amazed that this is 

now coming to me for the first time. All this case is 

about is interbasin transfers and that you account for

right? Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody

right to intervene. But if it was about California 

generally, maybe they wouldn't. 

So what I want to know is, what's the water 

that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the 

water that is at issue in this complaint do the three

intervenors account for? That seems like a fairly

MR. BROWNING: Yes.

get the answer to. 

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 

two intervenors that have interbasin transfers account 

for the vast majority of the water that is consumed as a 

result of an interbasin transfer. 

In the 2006 study that was done by Duke 

Energy, the largest interbasin transfer is the City of 

Charlotte at 9 million gallons per day. The second --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, my basic 

concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is

for divided argument. Your proposal was that they be 

divided 10, 10, and 10. You didn't even want to be

defend all of their interests as it affects North 

Carolina, right? You are not incapable of protecting 

their North Carolina interests. 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, their 

interests are inseparable, specifically with regard to 

Duke Energy. 

Duke negotiated, over a period of several 

years, a comprehensive relicensing agreement, with 

various agencies of North Carolina, various agencies of 

South Carolina, and stakeholders up and down this river. 

As a result of that negotiated agreement, 

there was -- the CRA was put in place, which is 

essentially a request that FERC issue a license in 

accordance with the provisions of that agreement. 

That agreement would set a minimum flow of 

water into South Carolina that is much, much higher than 

the previous license. Now, South Carolina has come into 

Court and has attacked that agreement. 

Duke has a very real and substantial 

interest with respect to that agreement. But --

request in this case because South Carolina has attacked 

that agreement. 

From North Carolina's perspective, South 

Carolina is receiving much more water under this 

negotiated agreement than they could ever hope to 

achieve in an equitable apportionment action. 

So at the end of the day, we will be asking 

this Court to issue a decree that sets a flow of 

water less than --

this interbasin transfer, but the fact of the matter is 

injunctive relief is sought as against Charlotte, and 

there is something to be said for fairness in allowing 

that entity to be present in this Court. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you --

MR. BROWNING: Now, turning --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you prepared to say 

that you are not adequately defending the interest of 

the CRWSP? 

MR. BROWNING: Correct, Your Honor, that 

that is an interstate entity. It -- its interests have 

been expressly attacked, the interbasin transfer. South 

Carolina singles it out in the bill of complaint. 

What's more important --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my 

question. You said, with Duke, that you won't support 

MR. BROWNING: Yes. We --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- them. Are you not 

going to support this -- the joint venture in property? 

MR. BROWNING: We -- we cannot represent the 

interests of the joint venture. They have an interbasin 

transfer, pursuant to the North Carolina statute for 

Union County. 

But what the complaint doesn't disclose is

that the other half of that joint venture also has an 

interbasin transfer with respect to Lancaster County, 

South Carolina. 

So South Carolina can hardly attack the 

Union County interbasin transfer while simultaneously 

defending the Lancaster County, South Carolina, 

interbasin transfer. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to the 

question of couldn't the Special Master receive the 

information she wants if these three entities come in as 

amici? 

Coming in as intervenors, they have full 

party status. They can engage in discovery. They can 

protract the case. They can appeal any adverse 

judgment. 

Why isn't the most reasonable accommodation 

to say, well, we will listen to you, but we are not 

going to give you full party status? 

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, if that were 

the -- the standard, there would never be intervention 

motions in any of these proceedings. 

The fact of the matter is that these 

entities have unique interests, and with respect to two 

of those interests -- Duke Energy and the Catawba River 

Water Supply Project -- their interests are not

All three of them have been expressly 

attacked in the complaint, and fairness dictates they 

should have an opportunity to be heard. 

Thank you.

Mr. Frederick, you have 2 minutes. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF 

MR. FREDERICK: I have four points, 

Mr. Chief Justice. First --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me, are you seeking 

injunctive relief out of any of the three intervenors? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. We seek an injunction 

enjoining the interbasin transfer statute to the extent 

it exceeds North Carolina's equitable apportionment. We 

are here to get our fair share of the river vis-à-vis 

North Carolina. 

And Duke's CRA application expressly 

disclaims any -- any ability to go into the interbasin 

transfer. That's at page 20, footnote 14, of our motion 

for leave to file exceptions. 

The FERC has said it will not affect, in 

giving its license, the equitable apportionment action 

now pending before you.

In Duke's CRA, at paragraph 39.9, it says it 

does not affect State water uses. So the only issue 

here is whether or not those expressed disclaimers 

should be given effect when South Carolina is simply 

seeking to determine, as between the two States, the 

rights. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it affects the 

agreement on which the license is based. The license 

was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among a 

number of entities. 

MR. FREDERICK: The license hasn't been 

issued, Justice Scalia. It's still pending. 

And that's what FERC has before it, and FERC 

has said that the CRA will not affect what license is 

issued, but I want to go back to a fundamental --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you willing to 

concede that if whatever you ask for here affects that 

license, once its issued, that then Duke's 

intervention is proper? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, because the United 

States can enter -- can affect the interests and 

represent the interests of its licensees. 

Duke's interest is completely derivative of 

the United States' power to confer a license on an 

energy producer. And the United States here is saying,

no, they should not be allowed to intervene. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought Duke said the 

problem is not the United States -- so much the United 

States granting a license. It's the license we 

requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a 

number of entities, and that agreement goes out the 

window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit. 

MR. FREDERICK: The agreement is a private 

contract among various water users, and it is no 

different than the fact that all users of this river 

will be affected, one way or the other, by whatever 

decree this Court issues, whether they are on the South 

Carolina side or the North Carolina side. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
