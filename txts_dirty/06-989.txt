 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-989, Hall Street Associates v. 

Mattel, Inc.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In this case two very sophisticated parties 

agreed to arbitrate an ongoing dispute that was pending 

in litigation before the United States District Court 

for the District of Oregon. Their agreement states 

plainly that after an arbitration award is issued the 

district court -- and this is at Pet. App. 16A -- "shall 

vacate, modify, or correct any award where the 

arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous." 

Ultimately what this Court must decide is whether there 

is anything in either the Federal Arbitration Act or any 

other Federal law that renders this non-adhesive, 

unambiguous contract agreement unenforceable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, would you 

say the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo 

review in the district court?

MR. PHILLIPS: I would be more concerned 

about identifying a standard of review for the district 

court than identifying a standard for modifying the 

arbitration award pursuant to the agreement. So I think 

that's a different issue. I think that's closer to 

dealing with a judicial function than this is, which is 

simply implementing the intent of the parties as to what 

the standard ought to be for enforcing an initial award.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be -- I am 

assuming that the parties wrote that standard into their 

contract, so to the extent you're relying on party 

autonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever 

standard of review they wish?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, I recognize 

that there is a limit to party autonomy. I think there 

ought to be a very strong preference for party autonomy, 

and I'm not saying that if I were here and I had an 

agreement by which de novo review is the standard I 

wouldn't defend that autonomy. All I'm saying is that I 

recognize that there are limitations on autonomy that 

recognize the functions of the Judiciary. But that 

limitation isn't remotely implicated in this particular 

case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in some -- one of 

the functions of a judicial -- what about an agreement,

arbitration agreement, that the district court can find 

facts de novo?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That one I think worries me 

less because it doesn't -- it doesn't suggest -- I mean 

it just says that we will leave to the district, to the 

district court the findings, and essentially renders the 

arbitration agreement --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a 

complex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water 

quality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for 

a month, the district judge had to go down and sit by 

the river for a month.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But again, the parties under 

those circumstances it seems to me are perfectly free to 

decide whether they want those issues to be decided 

conclusively by the arbitrator or to have them 

adjudicated at the end of the day by the Federal court. 

And so, if they choose to go through the arbitral 

process, and then still say nevertheless that's 

nonbinding and that the district court's free to 

evaluate that on a de novo record, that it seems to me 

doesn't in fact implicate the judicial function in quite 

the same way that the standard of review does.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, are there not such 

things as nonbinding arbitration's?

MR. PHILLIPS: Precisely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which in effect say that 

when we're done the district court will do it as an 

original matter.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And in that context 

you're not raising the same problem that you're 

referring to, Justice Ginsburg, because you're not 

saying anything about the standard of review. You're 

just simply saying that the court ought to decide the 

legal issues.

 Now, I do think that when the parties agree 

that it's a question of law that the question of law is 

for the district court to decide. My assumption is that 

the district court in fact will use de novo review, but 

the parties are not dictating that. That's a matter 

that's left -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the arbitration 

agreement in this case set out a standard of review and 

say on findings of fact they have to be supported by 

substantial evidence?

 MR. PHILLIPS: They do, but that issue --

that standard of review is not at issue in this 

particular case. The only question here is whether or 

not there has been an error of law committed, and 

obviously the district court found that there was a

clear error of law committed. Indeed, the dissenting 

judge below said it was an irrational decision on the 

law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were both --

they were both in this agreement, both the substantial 

evidence rule and the standard of review of legal error. 

So are you saying that you -- we don't have to deal with 

that question or you're not going to defend it, because 

the standard was dual. Am I not right about what they 

MR. PHILLIPS: No. There are, there are 

clearly two different standards that are set out in the 

arbitration agreement and one of them is substantial 

evidence. But when the matter went from the arbitrator 

to the district court there was no issue presented by 

Hall Street on the question of substantial evidence. We 

didn't challenge any of the factual findings by the --

by the arbitrator, and therefore that issue is not 

presented. I'm not saying I wouldn't defend it. All 

I'm saying is I don't have to defend it in this 

particular case because the only issue here is whether 

there has been an error of law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to give us a 

standard. You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the

district court. I don't know the standard you're 

proposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put 

cases on one side of the line or the other. You said, 

well, you can't interfere with the functions of the 

court. I don't quite understand that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the problem there --

and again, I think this is largely a fanciful concern 

because I don't think serious parties who are engaged in 

arbitration agreements are likely to come up with 

standards that are completely alien to the judicial 

process, and indeed there's no empirical evidence to 

support that. Certainly Respondent didn't cite anything 

and our amici didn't cite anything like that.

 But to be sure, Judge Kozinski in his 

concurring opinion in the original panel decision in 

Kyocera said he would have a very different reaction to 

this case if we were talking about the district court 

either flipping a coin or looking at the entrails of 

dead birds as the basis for decision. And our basic 

point is we're not embracing that extreme approach. I 

mean, we recognize party autonomy as a significant part 

of what Section 2 of the Arbitration Act is all about 

and we think that ought to drive the analysis of this 

Court significantly, particularly in how you interpret 

Section 9.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, why do 

you care? If this is not enforceable under the Federal 

Arbitration Act, which gives you kind of a shortcut --

the district court must confirm it if certain criteria 

are met -- I assume you have a normally enforceable 

contract that the district court can enforce just like 

it enforces any other contract.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's absolutely true, 

particularly in this context, Mr. Chief Justice, because 

here we have a situation where we were before the 

district court, this arrangement came out of the 

mediation process, the district court reviewed it, 

blessed it, sent it to the arbitrator --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you should lose.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- and it came right back.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you should lose.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, no, I should win.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. We should 

conclude that you don't fall within the Federal 

Arbitration Act and it's not a big deal because you can 

bring -- you can have the contract enforced. The 

district court as far as I can tell wants to enforce 

this agreement, presumably will enforce it as a 

contract. So you don't need the Federal Arbitration 

Act, so why should we fly in the face of its plain

language to accommodate your interests?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the problem here is 

not what happens in the instance if, Section 9 not 

applying, that we're suddenly -- we go back to square 

one and start over. That might be true in a different 

case, but in this particular case we started in Federal 

district court. We brought this action as a -- as a 

contract action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a basis --

well, the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't provide 

jurisdiction anyway. So I assume you have a basis for 

being in Federal court --

MR. PHILLIPS: Diversity, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in the first 

place. So you're just enforcing a contract in diversity 

in Federal court.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and that's exactly 

what we would ask this Court to be doing here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you're asking us 

to bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say 

that the district court must confirm it despite the fact 

that you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Mr. Chief Justice, you've 

flipped it around. Remember, we lost in the 

arbitration. We won in the district court. The

district court was prepared to enforce the agreement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Both the underlying lease 

agreement and the arbitration agreement. It was the 

court of appeals that said no, you can't do that, you 

can't enter a final judgment in this case, and the 

reason is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But my point --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- because of the Federal 

Arbitration Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that if 

you have an ordinary contract action the district court 

will, because your contract provides a particular 

standard of review, enforce that. Right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, that's absolutely 

true. But that's exactly what we're asking you to do 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: On that point -- the reason 

I think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because 

you said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA 

preclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement? And 

you're going to say: We answer that question, no, it 

doesn't preclude it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't require it; it

doesn't preclude it.

 But then would we have to go back and say 

what is the source? There has to be some source of law 

that authorizes this contractual agreement, and there 

could be two possible sources. And my question here is, 

is it clear that in fact either of these two sources 

does?

 The first source is State law. I gather the 

difficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just 

like the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask 

the Oregon courts: Is this a legitimate contract under 

Oregon State law.

 The alternative source of law is the Federal 

judge's case management authority. And there we have a 

statute which clearly gives the judge some kind of 

authority, but not for your case because your case 

exceeds the jurisdictional amount. Therefore, in the 

absence of that statute, is there inherent authority in 

the district judge?

 Now, I don't know the answer to either of 

those questions.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I thought that --

JUSTICE BREYER: My temptation is to say 

they're open questions and they'd have to be argued on 

remand, which makes this case the case of the century, I

guess, in a certain respect. It's quite a difficult 

case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I was just looking for the 

case of the day, Your Honor, actually.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, in a 

certain area. I overstate.

 But the -- is there any light you can shed 

on those two questions, or is there some third possible 

source of law?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we know that -- I think 

the answer to that is that Section 2 of the Federal 

Arbitration Act, which this Court has recognized 

repeatedly has a very strong preference for enforcing 

the agreement of the parties, is a part of the answer to 

that. And you couple that with the fact that Justice 

Story, back as early as 1814, said that as a matter of 

common law that the notion of restricted arbitration is 

a matter completely left to the parties.

 So I think that there are general common law 

standards. Now, you know, could Oregon law have gone 

the other way on that? Maybe. I think it would be an 

interesting preemption question. But the Respondent has 

never argued that this is unenforceable as a matter of 

Oregon law. So I don't think that issue is in this

case.

 As a matter of case management, if the Court 

wants to defer to anything then it ought to refer to the 

district court's own assessment that this agreement 

should be utterly enforceable, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever argued that 

this is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is 

enforceable?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They never --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever argued that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That it is enforceable?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, under Oregon law. 

Have you ever argued Oregon law?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, we've never argued --

JUSTICE BREYER: No?

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- Oregon law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then it's not 

surprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't 

apply.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, no.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they have in 

fact. On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you 

prevail the parties would be left to a State law 

contract action to determine the enforceability of the 

award.

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the State law 

contract action that they're talking about is precisely 

the State law contract action we brought in this case 

before the Federal district court under diversity 

jurisdiction. And at the end of the day what we're 

asking for is for the Court to enforce --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- the district judge's 

determination --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Their citation 

is to an arbitration treatise. The contract they're 

referring to is the contract to arbitrate. And, unless 

I'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to 

be able to enforce your agreement under the Federal 

Arbitration Act. Right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because it falls squarely 

within the Federal Arbitration Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't 

fall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration 

Act sets different standards of review. And all I'm 

saying is I don't see what the big deal is because you 

-- okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which 

gives you kind of an express remedy the district court 

must confirm. Use normal contract law and say to the 

district court: Well, you don't have the Federal

Arbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a 

judgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid, 

it sets a different standard of review, you should 

enforce it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But I think the 

answer to that is that if Congress had a choice as 

between those alternatives, Congress clearly in Section 

9 made it absolutely indisputable that there's a simple 

way to enforce it, but it didn't suggest the 

alternative, which is that you relegate it to some kind 

of State law, completely complicated process to try and 

get this arbitration award enforced under those 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm just not 

following this discussion. Does it assume that you can 

bring an action on the contract and just bypass the 

provision of the contract which says there will be 

arbitration? How can you do that? You -- you don't 

assert you can do that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, we clearly can't do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You clearly can't do that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So somebody has to decide 

on this arbitration provision.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And I think the

Court, this Court is the court that's got to decide that 

at this point and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The arbitration 

provision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract. 

Right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I don't 

understand why it's not enforceable as a contract.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think we disagree on 

that, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the -- I think that's 

enforceable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's 

enforceable -- I'm obviously missing something here. If 

it's enforceable as a contract, what is the great 

benefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should 

be enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the benefit is the 

efficiency that the Federal Arbitration Act is trying to 

promote. I mean, to be sure, there -- there could 

potentially be any number of routes you might want to 

identify. The clearest one is where the parties don't 

care about what happens on the back end, where they say, 

once you get your -- you have your -- you get your 

arbitration award and then you go off and you do Section 

9 and we don't have any agreement on that. And that one

is easy, and that's the most efficient.

 Then the question is what do you do in a 

situation where the parties don't agree with that, where 

they want the district court to review it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do if 

you have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not 

covered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime 

transaction or involving commerce?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Those are regulated by State 

law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Purely by State law. But 

this is the contract that falls within Section 2, Mr. 

Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But this -- but this one 

isn't, and if we say that you lose under the Federal 

Arbitration Act, is it open to the State court to say, 

well, that's what the Federal Arbitration Act says, but 

we handle arbitration differently?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's sort of the core 

question I think that sort of comes out of Southland 

and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think if you lose on the 

arbitration here, you've got to lose on the arbitration 

before State court.

Southland, Your Honor.

that the case? I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy 

the field of arbitration and to preempt State law. It 

provides that a very direct order -- the district court 

must confirm the arbitration award as a judgment --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you fall 

within the criteria. And all I'm saying is they'll say, 

okay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But I think the answer to the 

conundrum you've raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if 

you're not in Section 9, then you ought to be in Section 

2, and there you should do precisely what the contract 

says, which is that you should vacate or set aside the 

arbitration agreement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. You're in 

Section 2, I agree --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- unless -- if there's an 

error in law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I agree that you're 

in Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your 

agreement under some special rule that applies only to 

arbitration. But you want to be under Section 9, and 

that says --

MR. PHILLIPS: No, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the district 

court must confirm the arbitration award if it meets 

certain standards.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't need Section 9. 

All I need is Section 2 because if -- because under our 

agreement, what we specifically say is that the district 

court shall vacate, modify, or correct. We're looking 

for them to correct this award by saying that the right 

interpretation of this lease is that this is an 

applicable environmental law, and therefore the 

indemnification extends and we are protected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the only basis 

MR. PHILLIPS: That's what I want under 

Section 2.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only basis you 

have for getting them to correct the award is a 

different standard of review than the one provided in 

Section 10.

MR. PHILLIPS: That's true, but that's -- it 

seems to me that just makes my point, which is I don't 

need Section 9, Your Honor. All I need -- all I need is 

an aggressive, not even aggressive -- a fair 

interpretation of Section 2 that says that the parties' 

intent controls under these circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's not that you don't 

need Section 9. You want to get rid of Section 9 --

MR. PHILLIPS: That's quite true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because Section 9 on its 

face seems to provide the opposite to what you're 

asking. Isn't that the problem?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that 

that's the problem. You're right, I don't want Section 

9 to be controlling here, but I don't think it's meant 

to be controlling under these circumstances. I think 

what -- I mean they're making the Section 9 argument. 

All I'm saying is that there's not a problem created by 

Section 9.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- I mean the 

argument that it is meant to be controlling is an 

argument, first, for the plain language.

be controlling," I don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Section 9.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Section 9. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Number one, the plain 

language of the statute.

 Number two, an argument that that plain 

language, as a matter of historical fact, was 

deliberately chosen when Congress made a choice between 

two different, basic arbitration schemes.

 And they chose the arbitration scheme that, 

in effect, does not allow the -- the kind of variation 

that you're talking about. So they say the language is 

plain; the intent behind the language is plain. It is 

restrictive, and you can't do that. What is your 

response, in effect, to the plain language construed in 

terms of the historical argument?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, the answer -- the 

plain language doesn't -- doesn't say what happens if 

the parties reach a different agreement. The first --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may not -- it may 

not say it for the simple reason that it says 

unequivocally what should happen, and you are asking for 

a variation on what it unequivocally provides. That may 

be the reason it does not go into contingencies.

of all, it would seem to me less likely that that's 

true, given the common law history that comes out of 

Justice Story's opinion, which said restrictive 

arbitrations are common.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But you're --

you're ignoring -- when you say that, you're ignoring 

the development of arbitration in the period after 

Justice Story; and you are ignoring the argument that 

the other side makes that a deliberate choice was made 

between two generally understood arbitration, statutory 

arbitration, schemes, and they choose -- they chose the 

one that is inconsistent with your position.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, there are two 

-- there are two questions there, so let me try to 

answer both of your questions.

 The first one is: What does the plain 

meaning of the statute say? The plain meaning of the 

statute, which is at 1a of the appendix to the petition, 

is the parties in their agreement agreed that a judgment 

of the court shall be entered upon the award. We never 

agreed to that, so the plain language of Section 9 

simply doesn't get you there.

 Section 9 envisions that this is a -- that 

this is an understanding.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then how can you get any

award enforced, even subject to your terms?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because under Section 2 the 

parties have -- have provided a mechanism for that by 

saying that the district court will correct an award if 

it's erroneous as a matter of law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then you have to grapple 

with the question whether in fact under Section 2 you 

can provide for confirmation in a manner consistent with 

the provision for confirmation under Section 9.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But all I'm saying is 

that Section 9 doesn't apply in this particular context, 

and, therefore, it makes all the sense in the world to 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You simply -- I -- I don't 

-- maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to stand 

there and just say baldly: Section 9 doesn't apply. It 

doesn't apply, you've repeated that several times. And 

I at least don't know why it doesn't apply.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, hopefully I can 

persuade you by rereading the portion of the statute, 

that the first sentence of Section 9, which is at 

Appendix 1: "If the parties" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Where is it? Where is it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: 1a of the appendix to the 

petition. Section 9: "If the parties in their

agreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall

JUSTICE STEVENS: Uh-huh.

 MR. PHILLIPS: These parties didn't agree 

that a judgment would be entered on the award. They 

agreed that a judgment would be entered on the basis of 

whether there was a non-erroneous declaration of law by 

the arbitrator.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And what you are 

arguing is: At this point, even though we didn't agree 

within the meaning of the preamble to the first sentence 

MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- we still have a right to 

have the award confirmed and enforced --

MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we agreed to it 

under Section 2.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Both parties agreed to it 

under Section 2.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the question, I think, 

is when you argue in that fashion: Do you have a right 

under Section 2 to provide for confirmation and 

enforcement under terms which are inconsistent with the 

provision in Section 9.

And I think that's the -- that's the 

question you've got to answer.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you want 

to make a judgment call and you think there's really a 

judgment you have to make as between Section 2 and 

Section 9, then it seems to me that all of the Court's 

decisions have recognized that the single most important 

objective of the Federal Arbitration Act is embodied in 

Section 2, which is -- which is to enforce the intent of 

the parties --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the cases --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- is you way you should come 

out.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The intent of the parties 

that's being enforced in those myriad cases is the 

intent of the parties to arbitrate. I don't believe any 

of those cases respond to the -- to the issue that we've 

got before us.

 And the issue we've got before us as you are 

now framing it is this: If you do not have a provision 

within the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9 --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- for consummation and 

enforcement --

the enforcement terms under Section 9 --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- can that contract be 

recognized? Do you have a right, in effect, to modify 

the statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Souter --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's what you've got 

to come to grips with. And --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think I have come to 

grips with it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it does not answer 

that question simply to say there are lots of cases 

saying that the intent of the parties to arbitrate 

should be enforced. This is a more specific question.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, it's not the intent of 

the parties to arbitrate. It is every facet of the 

agreement is to be enforced consistent with the intent 

of the parties.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Where do you -- do you have 

a case that says every facet of the agreement, no matter 

how inconsistent arguably with other sections of the 

statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure. But the 

bottom line here -- and -- and I do want to answer the 

Illinois v. New York part of this, because I think 

that's a complete red herring in this case.

 But it still seems to me that if you think 

that there is an ambiguity with respect to Section 9, 

first you should resolve that ambiguity by construing it 

to implement the parties' intent, because that is the 

overriding objection to the FAA. And second --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- if you go to Section 10 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If we do that, we've got to 

dispose of the red herring. So you're going to come 

back to that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay. All right, let me 

answer the red herring. Then -- then I'll tell you what 

I think about Section 10. On the red herring, all --

all the -- first of all, there's nothing in the 

legislative history that suggests that Congress made 

some kind of conscious choice between New York and

Illinois.

 They talk about the New York model. There 

is not a word in the legislative history about Illinois. 

So I don't think that's what the decision was.

 But even if that were the choice they made, 

that still doesn't go to the question of what do you do 

if the parties reach a different agreement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is, indeed, the issue. 

What we're arguing about here is whether 9 and 10 are 

simply default rules that apply where the parties have 

not otherwise specified. That's -- and that's, 

arguably, what the New York law and the Illinois -- I --

I don't know that any of those cases cited by the other 

side involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New 

York rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration 

agreement that said something differently.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. None of -- None of those 

cases fall in that category.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, I think 

both the Illinois rule and the New York rule were 

default rules.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're arguing that 

this is the default rule?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't read like one. 

10 and 11 don't read like default --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the important 

part about Section 10 to keep in mind is -- is their 

argument also is predicated on the assumption that 

Section 10 exhaustively lists all of the grounds for 

modifying an -- vacating an arbitration award. And it 

is absolutely clear from this Court's decisions both in 

Wilko and in W.R. Grace that the list in Section 10 is 

not an exclusive list.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What else is there 

besides the manifest whatever? The --

MR. PHILLIPS: The manifest disregard of the 

law and the -- and public policy. W.R. Grace says you 

can't enforce any contract that violates public policy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, on the 

question of whether it's just a default rule or a 

self-executing definition of what's permissible, 

supposing the agreement between the parties provided 

that the judgment by the court must be entered in 6 

months rather than a year, and it would be vitiated if 

it were entered after that. Would that trump the 

statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think, yes, I think it 

probably would, because --

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, you know, there are 

-- the question in all of these provisions is are there 

some components of the FAA that are meant to be 

mandatory, and there are others that are all subject to 

change. And I think that one strikes me at least as 

most likely subject to change, Justice Stevens.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Federal 

Arbitration Act provide the exclusive grounds on which a 

court can vacate, modify, correct an arbitration award

under the FAA. Those grounds do not include legal 

error.

 What Petitioner wants is to graft on an 

additional ground to that statute, and say, oh, 

10(A)(5), on any other ground that the parties agree to.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the 

fact that our opinions have said that there is another 

ground under 10, which is manifest miscarriage of 

justice? That's not listed there.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, manifest 

disregard is Section 10 (A)(4), exceeding the power. It 

is not mere legal error, and it's manifest disregard of 

the agreement. Section 10 goes to structural errors, 

structural problems: Corruption, fraud, exceeding the 

power. And manifest disregard is in the statute, and 

it's not mere legal error.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why did we go -- go 

to the trouble of expressing it differently?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not just say Section 4?

 MS. BRINKMANN: It was required in Wilko, 

because there were two different questions there. There 

was a provision under the Securities Act that said 

customers couldn't waive certain right.

 And the court said there: Well, we all know

that the Securities Act generally would apply to 

arbitration. Of course, if an arbitrator didn't apply 

the Securities Act, that would be manifest disregard, 

exceeding their power. That they could not do.

 But what the Wilko Court held was: The 

customer, if they went to arbitration, was also waiving 

judicial review of the arbitrator's interpretation of 

the law. And that was the distinction in Wilko, and 

that's why manifest disregard is in the statute. It's 

10(A)(4), and it's that type of error. It is not beyond 

the statute, and that's what Congress meant to do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about public policy? 

That was the other one Mr. Phillips brought up.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes. Public policy would 

often be covered under Section 2. Section 2 allows any 

arbitration contract to be voided under any generally 

applicable State contract law, so that clearly would 

apply. A lot of that would capture off as public 

policy. But "public policy" is used in different ways.

 The Grace case he cites is a labor case. 

And there have been different developments of 

arbitration under the labor statute. But what public 

policy has come to mean in that line of cases is where 

there is another Federal statute that is violated by the 

arbitration.

And there you have another source of law. 

If there is a later enacted Federal statute that was a 

congressional intent to trim the Arbitration Act, that's 

another matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen in 

situations like this? Suppose we agree with you; and we 

say, oh, yes, both of the parties agreed as part of this 

contract: I don't want to let these arbitrators decide 

the law. If they get the law wrong, we want -- we want 

the courts to decide the law. That's the deal. And 

then you're going to say, oh, that portion of the 

contract is no good.

 MS. BRINKMANN: You can't in that situation 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there no such thing as 

-- as failure of the contract for a misunderstanding of 

the law?

 MS. BRINKMANN: That would be a common law 

action that the Chief Justice was referring to, to 

simply enforce an award. But Section 9 created a 

streamlined approach for enforcement of arbitration 

awards. When Congress in 1925 said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think the 

State can enforce an arbitration award that would not be 

enforceable under the FAA?

MR. PHILLIPS: Under Section 9. I hate to 

use the words "broadly FAA," because here's the 

situation: You can have arbitration awards that are 

clearly covered under Section 2, but they are not 

covered under Section 9. Section 9 is a streamlined 

procedure for enforcement of arbitration where it's 

under the FAA.

 When Congress enacted the statute, they 

said, you know, we are going to give a streamlined 

approach. If you want to go quickly from award to 

judgment, you can go right into court and hear Section 

9. That -- and you could agree to this. You have to 

agree to use Section 9. You have to agree to this 

confirmation.

 You come in, and that court must enforce 

that award, confirm that award, unless Sections 10 and 

11 are met. And that's exactly what Congress did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens 

outside -- that happens all the time. They are called 

consent decrees. The party agrees, and agrees to 

particular provisions, and they submit it to the judge 

and say: We want you to write two words, "so ordered," 

at the bottom of this; and then it becomes a judgment.

 You don't have to worry about the 

Arbitration Act. It's a contract.

MS. BRINKMANN: There are a couple of 

differences, I would also say, with the consent decree 

from the Section 9 enforcement of the award, Your Honor. 

Here, of course, Congress spoke to it. And it clearly 

set up a framework for Section 9, 10, and 11: How could 

you have this streamlined, efficient, final way to get a 

judgment. That was the purpose of the FAA.

 So you don't have that in a consent decree 

situation, and you would not have that in a common law 

contract action.

 Also, of course, in that consent decree 

situation, courts maintain their equitable authority.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have the same 

question for you that I had for your friend: Why do you 

care? I mean, if you are saying, look, you can enforce 

this as a state law contract -- you know, it's not 

streamlined. The judge doesn't have to do it; but, you 

know, this judge wants to do it. And he is going to 

enforce it as a State law contract.

 What do you gain?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, we gain a little of 

what we try to get through arbitration: Finality, the 

cessation of the time and cost that this litigation has 

arisen.

 We prevail under the ruling of the court

first sentence of Section 9, you don't have any 

agreement at all; and, therefore, you have no right to 

enforce anything?

 I take it that's not the position you took 

below, and that's not the position you're taking here, 

but how do you answer him?

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's really a repackaging 

of Petitioner's severability argument from below. There 

was an agreement to confirm. It's just whether or not 

if the -- it becomes legally impossible for the other 

condition to occur, the legal review can't occur because 

it's contrary to the statute.

 What happened -- and the court of appeals 

here addressed that issue, applied Oregon law, and 

rejected it. Petitioner filed a rehearing en banc 

petition on that and did not bring it to this Court on 

cert.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Assume we agree with you 

that this is a quick and dirty way to get arbitration 

agreements enforced if you want to bring it within 9 and

10, and if you don't, you're free not to; you can go to 

the State courts. Why can't he still go to the State 

courts?

 You say this is going to terminate the 

litigation. Is this going to be res judicata on 

anything? All it's going to say is the Federal courts 

have no jurisdiction over this. It's not under 9 and 

10. You're going to run off to State court. You're 

going to protract the litigation rather than bring it to 

a quick end.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, this is under 

Section 9. The only way it would not be under Section 9 

is if they had won on the severability argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.

 MS. BRINKMANN: We thought --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Miss Brinkmann, can we 

back up a bit, because this agreement had an usual 

genesis. This was a big case, and the judge kept right 

in the court a piece of it. And then he and the parties 

agreed that another piece of it would best be resolved 

in arbitration. So the judge was in equal participation 

in that effort. All three parties wanted to get a 

particular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather 

than the court, itself.

 And I doubt very much whether the judge

would have been at all interested in that scheme if he 

thought he were doing an idle thing. That the parties, 

having agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice 

way to resolve this issue, would then find themselves 

out of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit 

in State court. It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Two responses, at least to 

that, Your Honor: Then the parties should have asked 

the court to appoint a special master. That maintains 

under the authority of the district court judge. That's 

not what happened here. And that's important.

 What is before the Court here is the Section 

9 action to confirm the judgment. And that's what comes 

to the Court on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to go 

back to State court. You have diversity. You are in 

Federal court, no matter what; right?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that's 

right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why just what you 

said is actually what's worrying me about the case. 

Because what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that 

there could be situations, a lot of situations, where 

Federal judges do want to peel the case off. And you 

say send it to a master. Maybe some would lend

themselves to a master; maybe some wouldn't. I have no 

idea.

 And are we going to have to hold in this 

case whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge, 

does or does not have authority to do such a thing?

 That's why I say -- I was actually thinking 

the case of the century, because it's going to take a 

hundred years to finish.

 But the fact is there are those issues there 

once we say Section 9 doesn't apply. Then you're going 

to have to say -- suppose we were to say it's just State 

law. Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement 

of this kind of contract? Then we have the question of 

the authority -- of the inherent authority, not 

statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits 

of cases and decide them in different ways.

 I don't know the answer to those questions, 

but I think they are quite important. So what do I do?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, first of all, Your 

Honor, if it comes to a question about the particular 

facts in this case involving the scenario that Justice 

Ginsburg put forth of the very unusual situation of a 

Federal district court being there, we would, of course, 

dismiss the writ as improperly granted. That has no 

broader implication, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, because there is a 

holding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a 

large percent of the country, that the district judge 

can't do this. And that's quite a significant holding 

in that circuit, and we ought to review that.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That would be the question, 

Your Honor, if when faced with something that a judge 

wants to peel off, you have to look at what tools a 

Federal judge has been given. Magistrate judges widely 

used for all types of picking juries, discovery, special 

masters, those are the tools that have been given to 

Federal judges. When arbitration --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not use -- why not 

use Rule 16, pretrial procedure, and the parties and the 

judge can work out what they think is the most efficient 

way to resolve this controversy? So they decide at the 

pretrial conference that they are going to build into 

this arrangement one issue that they are going to peel 

off to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to 

retain control through the legal error.

 MS. BRINKMANN: The arbitrator is what 

introduces these different elements, because that's a 

private judge chosen by the parties, paid by the 

parties. He doesn't have life tenure. It's a very 

different animal. And what Congress did in the Federal

Arbitration Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a strange argument 

in this respect. You are arguing that this non-Article 

III person has more control rather than less control; 

that if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow 

that would violate Article III.

 But if the judge has no control and is 

essentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the 

non-Article III person does, then that's all right. And 

the sense of that doesn't come across to me.

 MS. BRINKMANN: It's because it's a matter 

of contract law, Justice Ginsburg. The parties agreed 

to an arbitration here on a contract and the 

arbitrator's award speaks for the parties. It is their 

agreement. That's what an arbitration award is, and 

that's why this streamlined process under Section 9 to 

transfer that award, that contractual agreement --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the question is 

whether or not that streamlined process is the only 

process. It seems to me that if the purpose of the 

Arbitration Act is to promote confidence in the 

arbitration process, that if parties agree to have the 

double assurance that the arbitrator hasn't made some 

strange ruling of law, that that's quite consistent with 

the whole purposes of arbitration.

MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we are not 

suggesting that it's the only means to get an award 

enforced, but if you are doing the Section 9 route, the 

grounds in the statute are the only grounds on which 

that can be done, and the policy about whether or not 

those transaction costs, when parties want further 

review on an arbitration, is shifted to the courts. 

It's one Congress made --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're 

asking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume 

that it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the 

statute as the Petitioner would. You know, under 

Section 8, the parties can use the authority of the 

court to libel a ship. The court is extending its 

authority to -- to use very intrusive means, and to say 

that the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have 

review for correct errors of law -- to correct errors of 

law when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to 

promote the whole purposes of the act.

 MS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, I think 

that's where we get to -- between when we are talking 

about Section 2 and the purpose is that the parties 

control how the arbitration progresses. Then we come to 

the entry of the judgment by a court, and that's what 

Congress controls; and the grounds in 10 and 11 cannot

be perceived as default rules. There are many places in 

the Federal Arbitration Act where --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're arguing about 

that textually. I'm saying that there's nothing 

inconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the 

basic policies of the act. You talk about finality, 

streamline, and so forth; but if the parties have more 

confidence in the arbitration process by ensuring this 

added level of review, it seems to me quite consistent 

with the purposes of the act.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, two things, Your 

Honor. If they want to do that, then they don't choose 

Section 9, and they don't include an agreement for 

Section 9, and then they have what Chief Justice Roberts 

was talking about, a -- a state contract action --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I interrupt on that 

for just a minute? You're assuming and the Chief 

Justice's line of questioning was assuming there's an 

adequate state remedy available for enforcing this 

contract, but the whole premise of the statute at the 

time it was enacted was that there was not a state 

remedy, because there was a bias against arbitration. 

And this was thought to be the sole remedy for 

arbitration at the time the statute was enacted.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that actually

brings me to a red herring. I'd like to address the 

history, because I think that what happens in 

Petitioner's reply brief, there's some confusion between 

common-law causes of action to enforce an arbitration 

award as a contract, and actions under statutes. Some 

of the commentators confuse that also.

 There was an opportunity to have judicial 

review of the law through a contract enforcement case, 

although there was a clear statement requirement. So 

there are going to be cases that talk about, that are 

not under the statue. Then when you look at cases under 

the statute, you have to differentiate between the cases 

under the New York model statutes, where you will not 

find that, and cases under the Illinois statute, where 

you will, because they allow judicial review.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any --

MS. BRINKMANN: Now, when Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any -- are 

there any such States left today that are using the 

Illinois model?

 MS. BRINKMANN: I believe not, Your Honor. 

We explain in one of our footnotes that that came into 

disfavor.

 But I want to address Justice Scalia's point 

about the legislative history. There is no case that we

have found that says, notwithstanding those statutory 

grounds, you can contract beyond them, but we do have 

not only the New York cases, but also in footnote 8, I 

believe, on page 30, several other statutes have 

statutory grounds, and repeatedly they say these are the 

statutory grounds. That is separate from the common-law 

action where you could have a full jury trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the old Illinois 

and the old New York rules, you don't have any cases 

which say -- which establish that those rules were not 

just default rules, but you -- but you were not allowed 

to depart from them.

 MS. BRINKMANN: We think the language in 

those cases will speak -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't have 

any case that holds that?

 MS. BRINKMANN: The cases say things like on 

the statutory grounds, where they do say it. Do they go 

the next step and say by the way, we are not going to do 

anything else that's -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case 

that holds that.

the other side, either.

that the reason the language in the statute is as it 

is -- when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year 

was it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: 1925.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there was still 

abroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators. 

Judges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so 

they would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator 

go ahead and have the most minimal review in court. 

Maybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the 

parties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out 

of it.

 MS. BRINKMANN: If you choose that -- yes, 

Your Honor. And even one more step. But we will tell 

the court to stay out of it only if you agree that 

you're going to come under for confirmation. It's still 

let the parties have the review through common law if 

they want it.

 That's absolutely correct, Your Honor. And 

I think it's that additional step, though, that puts the 

whole picture together. And I do want to emphasize, 

there is appellate arbitration that takes care all of 

the policy concerns about whether or not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you 

agree that what we hold in this case applies to suits in

admiralty, where you don't go to State court under 

Section 8?

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's a difficult question, 

Your Honor. I have looked at many of the old -- some of 

the arbitration cases did come up from admiralty, and I 

think the answer is, if it is an action under Section 9 

to confirm, it must be confirmed unless there is 

vacatur, modification, or correction under 10 or 11. 

Those are exclusive grounds.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at this point you 

don't have a State court fallback for your argument.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I can't say why 

it isn't -- I just repeat my earlier point -- quite 

consistent with encouraging confidence in admiralty 

arbitration to allow district courts to review rulings 

on a matter of law if the parties so choose.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think that question, 

though, perhaps goes to more or not whether the Section 

9 is the exclusive means for enforcing an award, and it 

isn't. So perhaps there is some other means that is 

beyond my expertise.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, if there is, then let's 

think -- suppose that in the middle of a trial, the 

parties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we

have a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts. 

They walk out the door; they have a friend who has a 

sign called arbitrator; and they come away from that 

friend with an agreed statement of facts, which they 

agree to submit to the judge to apply the law. Now, 

there is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, that sign would have 

to be changed. It would have to say --

JUSTICE BREYER: We know -- I'm sorry. I'm 

not even going to tell the judge how I find this. I go 

to a crystal ball; I go to any way I want. I will come 

in with an agreed statement of facts, and is there 

anything, if we have that agreed statement of facts, 

that would will stop the judge from saying I take this 

agreed statement of facts; there's a difference about 

how the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?

 MS. BRINKMANN: There are a couple of 

things. That's not an arbitration award.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no -- I just say --

well, I'll ask you the next question. I take the answer 

to the first question is there's nothing wrong with 

that.

bound by that. It's not a mandatory standard.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I thought that, 

if in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of 

fact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the 

judge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the -- the 

judge would say I'm sorry, even though you agree, I 

insist that you go to trial and?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He can?

agree, and here's our stipulation: We agree that he is 

a citizen of Pennsylvania and you're a citizen of --

It goes to our argument.

wrong here? My question basically, obviously, is, is 

there anything wrong in this case if they had come in 

with an agreed statement of fact?

depended on what the court did with it. So long as it 

was not binding on the Federal court, because you can't

buy an injunction. You cannot stipulate to the 

erroneous law. The Article III judge maintained that 

authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'm trying to 

get to my question; I'm not asking it very well.

 What they agreed to is an agreed statement 

of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and 

10.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's difficult, because 

it's an award --

JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm driving at, 

whether I've asked it well or not --

MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- is is how is it any 

different from coming in with an agreed statement of 

facts?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Because this is an 

arbitration award. It is a contractual agreement where 

the award gives -- imposes a legal obligation on someone 

else, and that award is going to be entered as a 

judgment of the court, against the parties.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of 

basic question? Forgetting the text for a minute, what 

policy reason -- can you think of why would Congress 

want to prohibit this particular form of agreement?

MS. BRINKMANN: Congress wanted to give 

parties an option for a quick, simple, cost-effective 

and final way --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why would they want to 

prohibit an option that takes a little bit longer?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Because that would be a 

different action where you have to look to State 

contract law, contract law defenses, whether there are 

State arbitration laws -- it's a different animal. They 

were looking at the animal of an arbitration agreement 

and a streamlined method to have that enforced and 

that's what Sections 9, 10, and 11 do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

answer would be part the point Justice Stevens brought 

up earlier. There was this State hostility to enforcing 

arbitration agreements at all --

MS. BRINKMANN: Uh-huh.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so what the 

Federal Arbitration Act says is, all right, in the 

narrow circumstances where the parties agreed, subject 

to this narrow standard, you have to enforce it. But 

that doesn't mean we are going to override the State law 

across the board.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's right. It gives the 

parties the option for choosing that, and if you choose

that, you have to do what Congress says.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why do they want to 

prevent the parties from choosing the option they chose 

in this case? I don't think that answer says why they'd 

want to do that.

 MS. BRINKMANN: They can choose another 

option, but they may have a full-blown trial about 

contract law in the award, and that's what Section 9 

would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But then there'd be no 

arbitration at all. That's right.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I also have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I just don't 

understand why it makes any sense at all to say this 

type of arbitration agreement is invalid.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would add --

MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we're not 

saying it's invalid.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would add that in 

admiralty you don't have the back-up of State law.

 MS. BRINKMANN: We're not saying it's 

invalid, Your Honor. We're saying that there's 

entitlement to confirmation of the award unless the 

grounds of 10 and 11 are there. And Petitioner wants to

parties agree on." There's no limit to that, Your 

Honor. There's nothing for harmless error --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the question is 

still here: Why should there be a limit if the parties 

themselves agree? Because if they didn't come in under 

arbitration and they simply came in under contract or 

whatever the causes of action might be in a diversity 

case, the court would have to be dealing with these 

issues anyway.

 MS. BRINKMANN: It would be under a 

different cause of action, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me?

 MS. BRINKMANN: You'd be under State 

contract law. Here you'd have to develop a Federal 

common law of when you took a Section 9 and you started 

reviewing it for error. Are we really going to allow de 

novo review and vacatur when it's harmless? There's a 

whole body of Federal law that has developed about 

harmless error to address those kinds of issues. This 

would be a Federal --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's true in any 

diversity case.

 MS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, this would 

be under the Federal Arbitration Act. Without any 

guidance from Congress, contrary to the grounds they put

forward. And they have no limit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, why didn't Congress 

give any guidance? One suggestion that the Chief 

Justice made, and it played through my mind, is maybe 

the -- what seemed to be the plain language limits in 

Section 9 represent not necessarily a kind of policy 

choice in a perfect world, but a political policy 

choice. Maybe that was the term as you -- as you read 

Section 9, maybe that was the term upon which the act 

could be passed.

 MS. BRINKMANN: It was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We will, in effect -- we 

will say: Look, you got to enforce these contracts, 

arbitration contracts, but you don't have to go one step 

further. Maybe that was the political deal. Is there 

any indication that that was the case and that's the 

explanation for this limit?

 MS. BRINKMANN: With all respect, I think 

not. I think that the Section 2 and 3, the enforcement 

of the arbitration agreement, is about the private 

parties determining the process. But when you get to 

the entry of a judgment by a court on the award, what 

Congress did said: We're going to give you an option to 

have an efficient, streamlined way for that also, and 

here it is: 9, 10 and 11. Now, you still have

something else and you have to agree to this in your 

agreement, but if you agree to it, this is what you 

have.

 And I have to say Petitioner's argument is 

so broad, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, there were 

questions of fact in this. We were -- we were 

litigating under this agreement also in the district 

court, and we brought a question of fact to the district 

court. When the district court first sent this back to 

the arbitrator, it went through and basically told the 

arbitrator: You know, you haven't looked at these 

facts; you haven't looked at these fact; you haven't 

looked at these facts. I believe it's Pet. App. 57a. 

And it sent it back to show the arbitrator's work. I 

mean that is what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what --

MS. BRINKMANN: -- courts would get mired in 

under a common law development standard of review, 

according to what --

JUSTICE BREYER: Has that been a nightmare 

-- has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor 

arbitration? Because I think labor arbitration falls 

outside the act, doesn't it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: It does.

some kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens 

of rules and they have a long complicated labor set of 

regulations on it? I don't think so, but has it?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, I'm not as 

familiar with that perhaps as I should be, but I know --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we run that pretty 

well, why wouldn't you run this pretty well --

MS. BRINKMANN: I think the --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- given a back-up, looking 

at it as a default?

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think they're very 

different policies and different statutory frameworks 

that apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this 

statute and let's take the circuits that have the rule, 

the opposite rule. In fact, the Ninth Circuit had the 

opposite rule until rather recently. What has been the 

experience -- I think the Fifth Circuit is on the other 

side?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What has been the 

experience there?

 MS. BRINKMANN: There has not been 

widespread use of this provision. I think that our 

amici briefs really speak to this, Your Honor, because

the difference would be a statement by the U.S. Supreme 

Court that says parties can now create whatever other 

grounds they want and go in through Section 9 in a 

streamlined process and are going to impose on Federal 

courts, not appellate arbitrators, on Federal courts, 

whatever grounds they want -- de novo review of fact, no 

harmless error, perhaps create different appellate 

standards when it goes up.

 And I think that the amici really point out 

that that is so contrary to the finality and 

efficiencies that the animal of arbitration --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think a lot of those 

horribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he 

hesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that 

trying to control an appeal from the district court, 

that would be out of the ballpark.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think it would create a 

hybrid animal that is not what the Arbitration Act is 

about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't you limit it 

reasonably by saying the parties can agree to anything? 

We would only have to say at least, the parties can at 

least agree to anything that the court would be able to 

do if this had been brought as an action in the court, 

rather than initially as an arbitration.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means the court would

 MS. BRINKMANN: With all due respect, Your 

Honor, that would be for Congress to do, not this Court. 

This is a statutory framework, a statutory cause of 

action that Congress wrote.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but that 

would be a limit. You say it's limitless. It doesn't 

have to be limitless.

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, but you're putting --

you are, I think, as this Court itself has said, you're 

breeding litigation from a statute whose whole point was 

to minimize and limit litigation. You're creating a new 

body of Federal common law that's really antithetical to 

the core purpose of the Arbitration Act. And I think 

that the -- that overriding principle of Federal 

Arbitration Act should really motivate the Court to 

realize what Congress did and the exclusive grounds that 

they set forth.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But one problem that I 

have with your position is you say that the -- you 

should continue to prevail, although that would be in 

violation of the parties' agreement. Under the Ninth 

Circuit decision, you win, what the arbitrator says

goes, and there isn't the review that the parties 

bargained for.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's the severability 

point that they lost on, Your Honor. They had 

petitioned for cert on severability and tried to say 

because the judicial review became legally impossible 

the rest should have followed. We'd be arguing a 

different case. They petitioned for rehearing en banc 

review on that and did not petition for cert on that. 

But that is answered by the severability ruling below.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the parties have an 

arbitration agreement in which they said, if there are 

contested issues of law, either party may seek 

declaratory judgment?

 MS. BRINKMANN: In court?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a Federal court, under 

the Declaratory Judgment Act.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I don't know if that would 

be an arbitration agreement. I'm not sure what the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is it's in 

the arbitration agreement. If the arbitrator gets stuck 

on a difficult question of law, either party can seek 

declaratory relief, and the arbitration proceedings are 

held in abeyance pending that declaration.

like that may just be an advisory opinion, and there 

might be an Article III problem with that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. There's the advisory 

-- we've been through this. This is a real controversy, 

not an advisory opinion.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Then they can go and have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the reason you 

hesitated to answer yes might be inconsistent with your 

position.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. I think that if they have a declaratory 

judgment, then they'll have a judgment. I don't know 

why they would ever go back to the arbitrator. That's 

what I'm not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are lots of other 

things for the arbitrator to do. He's got some specific 

issues of law that are contested.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I don't see how that is 

inconsistent with a party independently going for a 

declaratory judgment action. I don't think that's 

contrary to our position, Your Honor.

Mr. Phillips, you have you 5 minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I'll try to give you back some of that time before I'm 

done.

 In my experience in evaluating cases like 

this, it seems to me that in some ways where you end up 

depends in large measure on where you start. And the 

parties fundamentally disagree about whether or not this 

is an agreement that should be -- you know, who's got 

the burden? Do we have to show that this agreement is 

authorized by something or are we entitled to have this 

agreement and it's their burden to demonstrate clearly 

that Congress meant not to allow this to be enforced? 

And it seems to me clear that the answer to that is that 

it's their burden to find something specific in the 

Federal Arbitration Act or otherwise that precludes 

this.

 Section 9 doesn't get them there because 

Section 9 is predicated always on an agreement of the 

parties in the first instance, and so that's not a basis 

for doing that, but even if you thought Section --

argument that we are limited in considering your 

argument by the severability ruling that you didn't 

appeal?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't see how the 

severability ruling has any relevance to this particular 

problem, because what we're saying is we are entitled to 

enforce the -- the agreement of the parties with respect 

to exactly what the district court has the authority to 

do. The fact that it -- whether it's severable or not 

severable doesn't mean that we're not entitled to the 

enforcement of the agreement as written by the parties. 

Severability doesn't eliminate our right to have that 

part of the agreement --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it does -- it does 

preclude -- I mean, her answer is an answer to the 

argument that you were making in response to a question 

of mine earlier, that in fact you don't have an 

agreement within the meaning of the preamble portion of 

Section 9. She says you do because you have one after 

severance and you didn't appeal severability.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but all I'm saying is 

that I think that puts the cart before the horse. 

Remember, severability only comes up after the court of 

appeals had decided that this provision in the contract 

was unenforceable. And then the question is, is there

any part -- you know, is the entire arbitration set 

aside.

 And what I'm saying is that initial decision 

is wrong. And, therefore, you don't have to worry about 

severability. And the reason why it's wrong is because 

it's their burden to show something in the Federal 

Arbitration Act that's, that precludes enforcement of 

this provision. Section 9 doesn't get you there. 

Section 10 wouldn't get you there because it's not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Remind me why Section 9 

doesn't get you there -- because of the "if" clause.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Because of the "if" 

clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If the parties in their 

agreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall 

be entered upon the award made pursuant to -- but they 

have agreed to that, haven't they?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is simply --

MR. PHILLIPS: Subject to the condition that 

the district court would make a determination that there 

was no error in law. And that -- I mean, that's -- you 

know, they had -- I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is, why is that 

condition excluded from the "if" clause, but all of the

other conditions that are set forth in 10 are not 

excluded from the "if" clause? I mean, it seems to me 

the "if" clause must embrace any conditions.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the point is if, 

if all you do is agree to an arbitration, then Section 9 

and Section 10 apply directly. But if you agree to an 

arbitration that is subject to legal error or review, 

okay, then the "if" clause doesn't prevent you from 

being allowed to have that portion enforced, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you agree on 

condition and the conditions are satisfied, are you 

saying that the district court must enforce under 

Section 9, or are you saying that enforcement would be 

under some other authority?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the enforcement would 

be under the existing authority that the district court 

had in this particular case, because this was a case 

that was pending before the district court under 

diversity jurisdiction seeking to enforce the lease 

agreement. And we have a final decision from the 

arbitrator. The judge has now made a decision that that 

is wrong as a matter of law and has enforced the lease 

in a particular way.

 And so the question is, is that judgment of 

the district court subject to challenge? And our answer

to that is no. There is nothing in the Federal 

Arbitration Act that prevents the district judge from 

doing precisely what it did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure why you have 

to give the answer you just gave to Justice Alito, if 

what you told Justice Scalia is correct, that the "if" 

clause includes the condition that the court reviewed 

for issues -- for errors of law.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm not sure there is any 

inconsistency between those two things, between those 

two things -- statements.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but you're arguing 

to Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could 

interpret the "if" clause that way.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're telling Justice 

Scalia, oh, well, it's a different action. We have got 

the action here anyway.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, all I'm saying 

is that we can win on either theory.

 My whole point here has been Section 9 

doesn't prevent us from being able to do this. Section 

10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are 

allowed to add to Section 10. And at the end of the 

day, regardless, you ought to interpret this under

Section 2, consistent with the intent of the parties to 

ensure that we get what we want.

 The one point I did want to make about how 

all of this operates is, you know, in the relationship 

between the courts and arbitrators, it seems to there is 

probably no more important issue than who decides 

whether something is arbitratable. And yet, this Court 

held quite clearly in First Options that even though the 

statute says it's the arbitrator -- I mean, that it's 

the court, it can be made the arbitrator by the parties.

 Thank you, Your Honor.
