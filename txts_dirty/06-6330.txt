 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-6330, Kimbrough versus United States.

 Mr. Nachmanoff.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL NACHMANOFF

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Derrick Kimbrough's case is about what a 

district court may consider when imposing sentence in 

conformity with Section 3553(a).

 That statute directs sentencing courts to do 

exactly what Judge Jackson did in this case. He 

properly calculated and considered the advisory 

guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's reports, 

Mr. Kimbrough's personal history and background, and the 

offense itself, as directed by the statute. He then made 

case-specific findings to impose an appropriate 

sentence, and he did not make any categorical 

determinations.

 The Fourth Circuit reversed, applying a 

per se rule prohibiting disagreement with the crack 

cocaine guideline. The government, on the other hand, 

argues that Congress has implicitly directed sentencing

courts to adhere to the crack guidelines.

 Both of these positions are wrong.

 With respect to the Fourth Circuit, the 

Fourth Circuit applied a rigid rule that prohibited any 

disagreement with the crack guideline, which is 

determined solely by drug type and quantity. They then 

prohibited the imposition of any sentence outside the 

guideline range, either above it or below it, unless the 

court identified facts specific to the defendant or the 

offense.

 This ruling is inconsistent with the Court's 

holdings in Cunningham and Rita, which hold that the 

courts must be free to disagree with policies.

 Finally, the Fourth Circuit required that 

those facts be atypical, which mirrors the exact 

language that was excised in 3553(b)(1).

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the Congress have 

mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth 

Circuit used here?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, Congress can 

certainly speak explicitly through its statutes to 

impose further refinements on the penalty structure that 

it set out in 841.

 Section 841, on its face, does no more than 

set mandatory minimums and maximums at two triggering

quantities. If Congress wanted to specify further 

triggering quantities which would cabin the discretion 

of sentencing courts, they could do so, but they have 

not done so and there is no canon of statutory 

construction that the government identifies or that I'm 

aware of that would justify the notion of the implicit 

binding directive.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress made a finding 

that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed 

a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every 

district judge shall treat cases involving these two 

substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth 

Amendment problem with that? Or do you think every 

district judge gets the right to make that policy 

decision individually?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Alito, Congress 

certainly can cabin the discretion of judges. But once 

they set a floor and a ceiling, pursuant to this Court's 

remedial holding in Booker, judges must be free to 

consider the entire range of punishment. And Booker 

relies on the notion that the Guidelines are now fully 

advisory and, therefore, judges without having to 

identify specific facts have to have the discretion to 

disagree with policies or identify things unique to the 

case in order to fashion an appropriate punishment.

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's your answer simply 

to the very simple argument that because the floor was 

set on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by 

Congress, that any other sentencing assumption, 

regardless of the particular justifications in a given 

case, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and 

for that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It is the coherence problem 

that is bothering us.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes. There are several 

answers to that question, Justice Souter. The first is 

that this Court has recognized with the same statute 

which has the same structure that the government argues 

can only logically be understood one way, that with 

regard to the weight for LSD in the case of Neal versus 

United States, it is perfectly appropriate for there to 

be two different methods of calculating weight for 

purposes of punishment. The Guidelines calculate weight 

based on a presumed weight of the combination of the LSD 

and the blotter paper or the carrier medium. And the 

statute defines the method for calculating the mandatory 

minimum by the combined weight of the LSD and the 

blotter paper, regardless of whether it is heavy or 

whether it is light.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But is that an argument for 

saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of 

incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do 

it across the board? I mean, there is still an argument 

here on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an 

incoherence between the minimum and the kind of 

discretion that you're talking about.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, I think 

what Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding 

policy directive in 841 itself that requires either the 

Commission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step 

on a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that 

Congress decided with respect to two specific triggers 

should be the case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Did we have the cliff 

problem in the LSD case?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor. The Court 

recognized that, in fact, cliffs are the inevitable 

results of mandatory minimums.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So we are in the same boat, 

then, you say with Neal in that respect, too?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, and Your Honor, if I 

could also point out that there really is a myth here 

with regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and 

as the Commission created it in 1987. The 100 to 1

ratio describes the relative weight of crack cocaine and 

powder cocaine with regard to the levels in the 

sentencing table; so that if you compare, for example, 

the 10-year mandatory minimum trigger, 50 grams of 

crack, that gets you to a level 32 in the sentencing 

table and it requires 5 kilos of powder cocaine or 5,000 

grams. That's the 100 to 1 ratio.

 And it is true that if one compares the low 

end of that table -- 5 kilos to 50 grams, you end up 

with the same punishment, or likewise, if you compare 

the top of the range, 15 kilos to a 150 grams.

 But the way the guidelines have been 

written, there are a multitude of ratios that get 

applied right now and were applied in the pre-Booker 

guidelines scheme.

 In other words, 14.9 kilos of powder 

compared to 51 grams of crack results in a 292 to 1 

ratio. You get the exact same punishment, it is a level 

32.

 Likewise if you flip it, and you compare 149 

grams of crack to 5 kilos of powder cocaine, you are 

still within a level 32, and it is a 34 to 1 ratio.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that was wrong. 

Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to 

be faithful to the Congressional determination, should

have done it quite proportionately. I mean, I'm not 

hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said. I'm 

hung up on what the courts should do now.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: I agree, Justice Scalia. 

And of course, the Sentencing Commission taken to the 

ultimate extreme would have had to have a proportionate 

sentencing table by gram or fraction of a gram in order 

to preserve the 100 to 1 ratio, which simply points out 

in combination with Neal the fact that this was a choice 

made by the Commission, a choice, by the way, not 

grounded on any empirical evidence or any other reason 

other than what 841 originally indicated.

 It could have been done differently. It is 

done differently with regard to other drugs in 841, such 

as LSD or such as marijuana plants, which have a 

different method for calculation under the Guidelines as 

they do for purposes of mandatory minimums. And, of 

course, what that means is that there is no implicit 

directive, which is the only rational --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That just goes back to 

Justice Scalia's point. There may very well be an 

implicit Congressional directive that the Commission did 

not follow.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well -- Your Honor, 

Congress has a method --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It did not reject them, you 

are saying? So, therefore, in effect, there was a 

Congressional ratification?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Congress did not 

reject the original table that was created by the 

Commission in 1987. That is correct. But Congress also 

did not at any time in Section 994, which is where it 

has given other explicit directions to the Commission to 

fashion guidelines in a particular way, say anything 

about how to fashion the punishment for crack cocaine or 

any of the other drugs in Section 841.

 So Congress understands if it wants to give 

further guidance to the Commission how to do it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nachmanoff, in the 

absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting 

your argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did 

not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the 

mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I 

see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs 

are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for 

powder as high as for crack?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Ginsburg, our rule 

certainly contemplates the fact that there may be 

circumstances in which district judges may come to 

conclusions about the appropriate sentence, taking into

consideration the purposes of sentencing and the 

parsimony provision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we throw out the 

100 to 1, what is the range open to the district 

judge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use 

the -- I'm going to use the crack for both? Or say 

there is a difference between the two, so I'm going to 

set it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1.

 What is -- are all those reasonable within 

the position that you take in this case? Would all 

those have to pass muster at the court of appeals level?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well those certainly are 

positions that judges could take. In this particular 

case, the judge was presented with information that led 

the court to conclude that reducing the sentence for 

crack based on the Commission's overwhelming empirical 

evidence and penological evidence and the statistical 

evidence that was submitted was relevant to the various 

factors in 3553(a), in particular the purposes of 

sentencing. And that the Guidelines would not be 

appropriate and, therefore, a lower sentence would be 

appropriate.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the Fourth Circuit 

sees a number of absolutely identical cases exactly like 

Mr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the

sentencing judge either explicitly or implicitly has 

used a 1 to 1, and the next one used 20 to 1, the next 

one has used 50 to 1, the next one has used 80 to 1, and 

the next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under 

reasonableness review?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: The court of appeals has 

been given explicit instruction by this Court that it is 

to review all of those sentences under an abuse of 

discretion, which means that its job is not to 

substitute its judgment for the lower court.

 And if those sentencing courts have 

articulated reasons and have relied on relevant and 

reliable --

JUSTICE ALITO: But the cases are absolutely 

identical. Everything is absolutely identical about 

them, except for the sentences. Can't introduce any new 

variables. What is the court of appeals to do?

 This is not a hypothetical situation, 

really. This is what courts of appeals who have to see 

dozens of these cases have to do. There's a policy 

question there. How severely should crack be treated? 

What is the substantive review that the court of appeals 

is supposed to provide in that situation?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Alito, sentencing 

courts now are free to consider the full range of

punishment and to consider the purposes of sentencing in 

both issue-specific to the defendant and the offense and 

also general policy issues. That is the clear holding 

of the Booker remedial opinion and reaffirmed in 

Cunningham and in Rita. When judges have that full 

discretion to consider the guidelines and follow the 

mandates of 3553(a), but then impose a sentence that 

meets the purposes of sentencing and is consistent with 

the parsimony provision, there may well be judges that 

come to different conclusions, as your hypothetical 

posits, about what people with similar or even identical 

records and identical circumstances may -- may do.

 I would say that the reality is in the 

lower courts no two cases are alike, and so there are 

always reasons for judges to make reasoned distinctions 

in imposing sentences, even where, for example, the drug 

type and quantity is identical.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I take it your answer 

is that all or most of those cases would be affirmed 

under reasonableness -- under abuse of discretion 

review?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: If -- yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you were representing 

the one who got the 80 to 1 ratio you would file an 

amicus brief, no error in judgment?

MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Justice Souter, if 

the court followed the procedural requirements of 

3553(a), if the information was subjected to the 

adversarial process, and if the court imposed a sentence 

consistent with the parsimony clause, it would be hard 

to imagine a basis upon which to object.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The basis is that that 

would be the end of the Guidelines. I mean, that --

every judge has his own view of policy and there is a 

vast range. No point having advice -- I mean, fine, 

but I don't think this Court said it, and I think that 

the test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think 

3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the 

major thrusts is follow the Guidelines. It doesn't make 

them mandatory. But they're in there.

 All right, so the problem for me is just 

what Justice Alito was saying: Is there a path here 

between saying, well, judge, leaving everything special 

about your case out of it -- we're only talking about a 

judge who says there's nothing special about my case --

I disagree with the policy of the commission.

 In such a case, is there a choice between 

saying that no matter what the commission says, the 

court of appeals must insist that their district judges 

follow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is

to say they don't have to do anything that the 

commission says, because the commission is always 

choosing among reasonable choices. Very rarely -- maybe 

you have one in this case -- but very rarely is it 

totally unreasonable.

 How do we thread the channel?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Justice Breyer, the Booker 

remedial opinion makes it crystal-clear that to avoid 

the Sixth Amendment problem with the mandatory 

Guidelines, judges must be free to disagree with the 

Guidelines.

 JUSTICE BREYER: To the extent that it's 

reasonable, and where we're talking about individual 

cases we've already said, given the history of our legal 

system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion 

to the district judge.

 Now we're talking about what's reasonable in 

the context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says 

one way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says 

one way or the other.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, 3553(a) is 

driven by the purposes of sentencing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Driven by a Congress that 

wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate 

matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the

initial draft added the word "mandatory." So the 

history of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is 

seeking uniformity through guidelines.

 At least that's my view of it. And for 

purposes of the question, which is an important question 

to me, let's assume that.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, the 

appellate courts still have a role to play and that role 

is to ensure that the sentencing courts have followed 

the mandate of 3553(a), and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, it may be quite 

impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory 

guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. NACHMANOFF: That very well may be, 

Justice Scalia. In -- this Court even in the remedial 

opinion in Booker recognized that uniformity as it was 

understood in the pre-Booker days would be reduced, and 

that there might be more sentences that have different 

results --

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, I'm 

assuming now you have not -- you don't have a good 

answer to my question. You're saying either we have to 

make it unconstitutional, which I don't think they are, 

or you have to say anything goes, and that my question

has no answer in your view?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Justice Breyer, your 

question certainly is a difficult one. Let me say this: 

With regard to uniformity, Congress has the power to 

make sentences more uniform. They can do it in a 

variety of ways and they have done it where they've 

thought it was important. They haven't done it with 

regard to the 100 to 1 ratio beyond the mandatory 

minimum or the statutory maximum.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't say -- you 

don't say anything goes. I mean, the hypothetical that 

Justice Alito gave is -- is easy, only because Congress 

has created the 100 to 1 ratio as presumably reasonable. 

If Congress enacted it as a statute, it has to be 

reasonable.

 So that enables you to say anything from 1 

to 1 to 100 to 1 is reasonable. But your position is 

not anything goes. It's anything that's reasonable 

goes.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: That is correct, Justice 

Scalia. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is "reasonable" 

defined as an appropriate interpretation of 

congressional intent, or does "reasonable" mean 

something else, like a just sentence? What -- how do we

define "reasonable"?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether or not the 

commission and then the district judge reasonably 

interpret the congressional intent, and if the 

commission reasonably interprets the congressional 

intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Sentencing courts must be 

able to disagree with the commission's conclusions about 

congressional intent.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming the commission 

was reasonable, can they still disagree?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor. I think 

that is the essence of the Booker remedial holding, that 

in order to cure the constitutional problem with 

mandatory guidelines, judges must be free to reject, 

must be free to reject those guidelines. And in fact 

Cunningham makes that clear, that in the California 

determinate sentencing area it was the inability of 

judges to impose a higher sentence based on the general 

objectives of sentencing, as opposed to particular 

factors or circumstances in aggravation, that made it 

unconstitutional. So whether the commission concluded 

that the congressional intent was to import the 100 to 1

ratio or not -- and clearly there is no statutory 

construction that can be inferred or understood from 841 

by itself. It is not explicit and the government 

concedes that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your case you ask us 

to establish the proposition that in any case, a 

sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a 

reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a 

reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt before you 

answer. The question isn't whether they can justify a 

reasonable. It's whether they can justify not following 

one that creates unwarranted disparities within the 

meaning of the statute.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: That's -- that's correct, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would go further --

you would go further and -- and submit to us the 

proposition that I -- that I just stated?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, if -- if 

I understood it correctly, the question is whether or 

not when the commission concludes this is what Congress 

intended --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Reasonably.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: -- reasonably -- does it

somehow imbue that particular guideline with some 

special binding nature. And my response would be that 

the Booker remedial opinion makes it clear that the 

Guidelines as a whole must be viewed as advisory. The 

government tries to argue that if some Guidelines are 

special and are binding, and others are advisory, 

there's no Sixth Amendment problem. But that ignores 

the fundamental principle of the Booker remedial hearing 

-- holding, which is that the Guidelines as a whole must 

be advisory and judges must be able to disagree with 

them. And of course here is perhaps the paradigmatic 

example of a time when the commission's original 

guidelines got it wrong, didn't further the purposes of 

sentencing; and, of course, they themselves have made 

that conclusion, and for sentencing purposes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- and I take it your 

submission is that the district court must be able to 

make the determination that the commission's policy is 

to be disregarded in every case to come before the 

court?

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, 3553(a) 

requires individualized sentencing. There's no question 

that judges are required to follow in every case the 

mandates of 3553(a) and to calculate the advisory 

Guidelines correctly.

Now, there is no reason why judges cannot in 

a certain class of cases conclude that the Guideline 

gets it wrong; that it overstates the seriousness of the 

offense; that it creates an unwarranted disparity; and 

that they are going to impose a sentence outside of that 

guideline range.

 That does not in any way remove the 

requirement that they subject every sentencing to the 

adversarial process to give the parties the opportunity 

to convince them that the guidelines should be followed, 

or not followed, or to be reconsidered.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Mr. Nachmanoff, I 

think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to 

come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point; 

that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to 

one is open to the district judge; and within that 

range, there is no abuse of discretion.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Your Honor, I certainly 

agree that that full range is available to the 

sentencing court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only because Congress has 

said 100 to 1. That strikes me as utterly unreasonable. 

But if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable. 

That's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that 

would not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity

wouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, your answer 

is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to 

one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be --

that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an 

abuse of discretion.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, if I can be clear, 

Justice Ginsburg, sentencing courts must have available 

to them the full range of punishment as defined by 

Congress. And that range, for purposes of 841, are 

broad ranges based on triggering quantities at 5 grams 

and 50 grams for crack cocaine. Within those ranges, as 

long as the court follows the requirements of 3553(a), 

considers all the purposes of sentencing, engages in an 

individualized sentencing process, and relies on 

relevant and reliable information, there would be no 

basis under abuse of discretion review to reverse the 

sentencing court in that instance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've given me a 

bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy 

for a district judge to say: Here's my laundry list; 

and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in 

the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's 

what I'm going to impose.

MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, again, Your Honor, 

Congress certainly has the power to cabin that 

discretion. They just need to do it explicitly, and 

they have not done so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- Congress not having 

done that, then the range is open to the district 

judges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: That's correct, Your Honor. 

If if may reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the court:

 The question in this case is essentially, 

can a district court reasonably disagree with the 

judgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the 

quantity-based sentences for crack and powder.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a 

question right at the outset that is critical for me. I 

think this case may well be controlled by the decision 

in Neal against the United States, which is not cited in 

the government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief.

 But there the Court held that a policy

judgment by Congress fixing mandatory minimums on the 

basis of the weight of the carrier rather than the drug 

did not justify guidelines based on that ratio -- based 

on the same principle -- if that would produce 

unwarranted disparities.

 And, as I understand the facts of this case, 

the Commission has told us actually in some of its 

reports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted 

disparities. Therefore, we should disregard the entire 

guideline as we did in Neal, and the reason the Neal 

case is controlling in this case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, let me start 

with the Neal decision, because I think Neal is 

fundamentally unlike this case. In Neal this Court had 

to determine whether its prior construction of a 

statute, Section 841, survived the Commission's 

decision --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that is a construction 

of what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision 

we assumed that Congress intended what we held the 

statute meant.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, the only 

question presented in Neal was, did the Commission's 

weight guideline for LSD require this Court to change 

its interpretation of Section 841. And the Court held

no.

 There was no question before the Court about 

whether the Sentencing Commission had legitimately 

adopted a different formula than the mixture or 

substance rule that this Court had held governed the 

statute.

 The LSD guideline was not in play in Neal. 

The government never challenged it. Its rationality was 

not at issue. All the Court had to hold was that 

whatever the Sentencing Commission did --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It does hold that a 

guideline that does not conform with a congressional 

judgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a 

guideline that would survive.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I disagree with that, 

Justice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline 

in Neal. There was nothing at issue in the Court to 

decide about whether that Guideline was valid. But even 

if the Court thought that Neal does involve some sort of 

a principle that the Sentencing Commission has greater 

freedom to vary from the procedures laid out in a 

mandatory minimum sentencing statute, Neal does not 

control this case, because there is more data about what 

Congress intended the ratio between crack and powder to 

be, and because Congress changed the basic, organic

statute that governs the Sentencing Commission's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there's also more 

data that the Commission has reflected on all this and 

still concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an 

unwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the statute, itself, 

Section 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1. When 

the Commission first considered creating drug 

guidelines --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It establishes the ratio 

for mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well I disagree with that, 

Justice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal 

context is different from the legal context in Neal.

 Let me start with a couple of points about 

this. First of all, when the Commission promulgated the 

drug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to 

1 ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum 

sentencing statute, because it recognized -- and these 

were the Commission's words -- that a logical and 

coherent sentencing scheme required that there be 

consistent proportionality throughout the sentencing 

process.

 When the Commission later studied the 

crack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had

gotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself, 

had gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did, 

it proposed a Guideline that would have changed the 

ratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one 

between crack and powder.

 And Congress, for the first time in the 

history of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected 

that proposal; and it did so with legislation that made 

clear that it believed that if the commission wanted to 

come back with something new, it should propose 

something that would change both the Guidelines and the 

sentencing statutes so that they would continue to work 

in tandem -- that it would preserve a higher ratio of 

punishment for crack than powder because it believed 

that crack was more serious, and that it believed that 

any ratio should apply consistently across the 

Guidelines and the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if -- you're 

talking about Public Law 104-38?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they also 

said, quote, "The sentence imposed for trafficking in 

crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence for 

powder cocaine."

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's fine, 

but that's pretty far from 100 to 1. "Generally 

exceed," it suggests to me that Congress itself, in 

terms -- you are relying on this implicit directive from 

Congress. And that's the latest expression of 

congressional implicit direction, and it just says 

"generally exceed." So, you know, two to one.

 MR. DREEBEN: This, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

what Congress instructed the Commission to consider in 

making recommendations to change the existing state of 

the law.

 We don't dispute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I know, but you 

are relying on an implicit directive anyway. So as you 

are looking at that vague direction, it seems to me that 

their last expression on what they wanted the Commission 

to do is more probative than a much older pre-existing 

100 to 1 ratio.

 MR. DREEBEN: But they have never changed 

the 100 to 1 ratio. And what I think is significant 

about this statute is what it continues to say, and this 

is on page 124-A of the government's brief -- that "the 

recommendations concerning an appropriate change to the 

ratio that the Commission might believe is warranted 

shall apply both to the relevant statutes and to the

Guidelines." This is on the carryover sentence on pages 

24-A to 25-A.

 And what I think that this reflects is 

Congress' recognition that, so long as the mandatory 

minimum statutes are pegged at 100 to 1, the Guidelines 

need to follow suit. Now if they're going to change, 

that's fine. But they should change in a manner that's 

consistent so as to avoid unwarranted disparities 

between defendants who are governed by the literal 

mandatory minimum statute and defendants who are not.

 The alternative is you end up with various 

serious cliff effects which the Commission itself was 

trying to avoid, where a defendant who has 50 grams of 

crack is sentenced to a minimum of 10 years. But if you 

drop the ratio to one to one, a defendant who has 

49.9 grams --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But those are the same 

cliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely 

the same.

 MR. DREEBEN: But this Court didn't consider 

whether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal 

because it had no guideline before it. And I did went 

to get to the other point that I think distinguishes the 

legal context in Neal from the legal context today, and 

that is, in 2003, Congress amended the organic statute

that governs the Sentencing Commission's promulgation of 

Guidelines to require that the commission make AUDIO 

STARTS its Guidelines consistent with all pertinent 

provisions of the United States Code.

 At the time of Neal, that statute only 

required the commission to be consistent with Title 18 

and Title 28, and the drug statute is found in Title 21. 

And the legislative evolution of this provision reflects 

that there was concern that the commission did not have 

to honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In response to that 

statute, did the commission revise the guideline that 

was involved in Neal?

 MR. DREEBEN: It did not, and the government 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Shouldn't it have done it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it should have, and I 

think that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines 

from the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided 

produces an irrational disconnect between guideline 

sentencing and sentencing --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's because of the 

cliff. But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the 

cliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for 

the numbers after all, which relate punishment to

amounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than 

what you have -- I mean more people likely to take it --

but also the role that the person is likely to play in 

the organization, high or low, and the likelihood that 

he is or this -- these groups of people are big deal 

offenders or not, and many other things.

 Therefore, a system that really is basically 

flat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff, 

and then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not 

an irrational system. It depends on what those other 

correlations are. I say that because suppose a judge, 

noticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the 

commission itself has listed and understanding that 

cliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines 

that are rough correlations, suppose a judge said: My 

system, which we have before us, which doesn't have the 

absolute numerical progression, is far more reasonable 

than the commission's system. There it is. He's 

reviewed the commission's policy.

 Well, Rita says sometimes courts could. And 

so what is the law that forbids the judge from doing 

that, at least on occasion?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as a general 

matter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge 

can revisit, challenge the Sentencing Commission's

policy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an 

advisory guideline system. It's not because we welcome 

that result, but because we think that it followed from 

this Court's decision in Cunningham and that was 

expressly stated in Rita.

 But this is not an area where the sentencing 

courts would be merely second-guessing a commission 

judgment. They would be second-guessing a judgment of 

Congress itself.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, because Congress has 

nowhere said that you can't have cliffs.

 You see, Congress could say, our rough 

judgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind 

of a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is 

probably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang. 

And what has Congress actually thought about this? 

Nothing. They never thought about it.

 So I can't find an instruction there that 

tells the commission that they can't do it this way.

 MR. DREEBEN: But, Justice Breyer, the one 

time when the commission tried to do that --

JUSTICE BREYER: They wanted to abolish the 

whole thing.

 MR. DREEBEN: They wanted to make it one to 

one, and Congress recognized that that would produce

severe cliffs and said not appropriate; if you want to 

change the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem, 

that's fine, make a recommendation. And so the 

government's fundamental position here is that Congress 

has made a judgment that until it says otherwise, 

sentencing ratios of 100 to 1 are appropriate to reflect 

the increased harms of crack.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't your answer also to 

Justice Breyer's question the post-Neal amendment to the 

statute which in effect says, you know, make your 

Guidelines consistent with the statute?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it --

the specific rejection of the proposal they came up 

with.

 MR. DREEBEN: The two of them work together 

in tandem, I think.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Why? That's my 

question. Everyone's assuming that "consistent with the 

statute" means a sentencing system that's smooth without 

cliffs. And I'm sure every mathematician would agree 

with you, but I'm not at all certain that prosecutors 

and defendants who have actual experience in this would 

agree with you, because there are lots of arguments that 

it's perfectly consistent with the objective of the stat

tute to have a few cliffs.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think I want to rely 

on what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it 

concluded that it disagreed with the 100 to 1 ratio in 

the statute. And this is set forward -- forth at page 

50A of the same brief, the Kimbrough brief. This was 

the commission's original commentary where it explained, 

in the first full paragraph, how it set the basic levels 

for drug crimes. And it said that it set them because 

they were either provided directly by Section 841 of 

Title 21 or, quote, "are proportional to the levels 

established by statute," and it said, further refinement 

of the drug amounts beyond those mandatory minimums was 

essential to provide a logical sentencing structure for 

drug offenses. And I think what the commission --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's why -- and the 

1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did 

indeed require the guidelines to track the -- the 

statutory prescriptions for sentencing.

 MR. DREEBEN: 2003, I believe.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Pardon me?

 MR. DREEBEN: It's 2003.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 2003. Sorry. I misspoke.

 But -- but the fact remains that the

doesn't convert to an obligation for the district courts 

to follow that scheme so long as that scheme is only 

reflected in the guidelines. The guidelines themselves 

are still just advisory.

 MR. DREEBEN: What distinguishes this area, 

Justice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that 

the backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a 

mandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the 

sentencing court. It's not subject to the commission's 

intervention and it's not subject to a district court's 

power to disagree with. The sentencing court must use a 

100 to 1 ratio in applying the mandatory minimums.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why don't you just 

skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the 

sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a 

sentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do 

anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription 

that Congress has established?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I'm happy to do just --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what the 

Guidelines add to -- to your game except another --

another stage.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, if -- if it's sufficient 

for the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the 

100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits

for the district courts to disagree with, I'm content.

 I think there is additional data that 

indicates that Congress vetoed attempts by the 

Sentencing Commission to vary from that range and made 

it clear that the Guidelines formulations and the 

statute worked in tandem, which together expresses a 

notion of quantity proportionality tied to the 100 to 1 

ratio.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I would say that that 

statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing, 

whether it's through the commission or not, be based on 

the 100 to 1 ratio.

 MR. DREEBEN: And I agree with that, Justice 

Scalia. And the upshot of disagreeing with that, which 

is what various district courts have done but no court 

of appeals has endorsed, is that every district court 

could come up with its own ratio and that that ratio 

would have to be accepted as reasonable so long as there 

is a cogent, logical data support for it. And here --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it not true that 

that only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine 

cases, because they say -- maybe I'm wrong on this --

that 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by 

the mandatory minimum?

mandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a 

few sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and 

there are sentences that are below the mandatory 

minimum. And in those cases --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I was -- and correct me if 

I'm wrong. I was under the impression that 80 percent 

of the sentences that are actually imposed are at the 

mandatory minimum.

 MR. DREEBEN: I didn't get that out of my 

attempt to plumb the data, Justice Stevens. The 

Sentencing Commission's most recent report has a chart 

that didn't, to my mind, break down adequately the 

figures so I could answer your question.

 But I do think that, even if it's true, even 

if 80 percent were at the mandatory minimum, that would 

mean that as to those 20 percent that are not governed 

by a mandatory minimum, you could have one district 

judge say, I'm going to use one to one, like the 

commission proposed in 1995. Another could say I'm 

going to use five to one, like the commission proposed 

in 1997. A third could use 20 to 1, as the commission 

proposed in 2002. And each one of those would have a 

reasonable --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this another 

alternative? If the district judge concluded, as some

scholars have, that the 100 to 1 ratio itself creates 

unwarranted disparities, could not a district judge 

sentence by just disregarding the guideline for this 

particular substance? And then use just ordinary 

principles, what's appropriate sentencing in this case.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, because I 

think here we're talking about a matter of statutory 

construction. Because the courts of appeals are 

reviewing sentences for reasonableness.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You have a conflict in the 

statute. One says await the guideline. Another says 

avoid unwarranted disparities.

 MR. DREEBEN: That wasn't the two statutes I 

was thinking of. What I was thinking of is that 

Congress itself has said a 100 to 1 disparity --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, Mr. Dreeben, 

your office used to argue that when Congress wants to do 

something, there's a way to do it. They pass a law 

through both houses, then the President signs it. 

That's the only way they can give legal effect to their 

intent.

 Now you are arguing that there's some 

binding intent simply because they set mandatory 

minimums and mandatory maximums that carry beyond that. 

I'm wondering how that's consistent with the positions

the office has taken before.

 MR. DREEBEN: Our position here, I think, is 

consistent with our view that you read statutes both for 

what they say and for what they mean. And here we are 

not relying just on Section 841, although I'm certainly 

happy if members of the Court believe that 841 alone 

dictates a proportionality rule, I'm also relying on the 

fact that Congress vetoed the Commission's attempt to 

break apart the Guidelines in the sentencing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We should read a 

negative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the 

Commission wanted to do?

 MR. DREEBEN: At least the Court should do 

this much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for 

reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge, 

the court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a) 

factors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100 

to 1 ratio is warranted.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If Congress passes a 

statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of 

eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully, 

does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN: It doesn't. But, Justice 

Breyer, that's, for two different reasons, not an apt

analogy for this. First of all, Congress applied the 

100 to 1 ratio at two different points in the sentencing 

spectrum.

 Then if there was a rational basis for 

viewing shotgun culpability as turning on the length of 

the barrel, then perhaps there would be a better 

analogy. But I think here what Congress was focused on 

was the relative culpability of crack offenders and 

powder offenders.

 JUSTICE BREYER: At the cliff. But, of 

course, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized 

by numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect 

underlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun 

case than you are prepared to admit.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, but I think that Congress 

doesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as 

being independent from its mandatory minimum 

determinations. And that's why it vetoed the 

Commission's unilateral attempt to impose a one to one 

ratio --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then are you saying 

that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute 

controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has, 

in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting 

the drug quantity, made that mandatory? That

guideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must 

adhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory 

guideline.

 MR. DREEBEN: They do come down to the same 

thing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline 

as it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio. And 

I believe that Congress well understood that it was 

preserving a guideline that maintains fidelity and 

consistency with its sentencing statute while sending 

the Commission back to the drawing board and saying if 

we're going to change this scheme, let's change it in a 

consistent coherent way. And every district court does 

not get the power to say we're going to change what 

Congress has prohibited the Commission from changing, 

even though we can't change the mandatory minimum 

statute.

 That is Congress' sentencing policy. We 

have to impose that in cases at the mandatory minimum. 

But in cases that aren't at the mandatory minimum, the 

position of the petitioner is basically district judges 

can say to Congress, you're completely wrong. And our 

position is that under a sympathetic attempt to 

construct reasonableness review that is consistent with 

Congressional intent, a district court can't do that.

Congress -- why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you 

say they implicitly did explicitly? They could impose 

the 100 to 1 ratio throughout as opposed to simply as a 

minimum and a maximum. And they did not do that.

 MR. DREEBEN: Because they had no reason to 

do it. Until this Court decided Booker, the Guidelines 

were mandatory. And they fully understood by leaving in 

place a crack guideline that mirrored the statutory --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Congress has legislated in 

this area after Booker. They have not imposed the 100 

to 1 ratio throughout the -- other than as a mandatory 

minimum and maximum.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not aware that they have 

legislated in this area after Booker, Mr. Chief Justice. 

And I think that since all the court of appeals have 

agreed with the single position that district courts are 

not free to substitute their own ratios for the 100 to 1 

ratio, Congress would not have had a great deal of 

reason to intervene in this area.

 And what this case will tell Congress and 

sentencing courts is within an advisory guidelines 

regime, can Congress make certain policy judgments and 

place certain limits on what a district court can do 

that it otherwise would have freedom to do in an 

advisory range.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that, as you say, in 

effect, makes a certain element mandatory. And why 

doesn't that come up against the same Sixth Amendment 

judgement that we made in Booker?

 MR. DREEBEN: The only requirement, I 

believe, that exists under Booker is that judge not in 

all cases be required to find a fact in order to exceed 

the guidelines range that would be based on the jury 

verdict alone or the admission of guilt alone.

 Booker did not say that Congress had to 

tolerate every single policy judgment that individual 

district courts might make to vary upward. For example, 

socioeconomic status. If a particular judge felt in my 

courtroom college students and white collar 

professionals deserve an automatic bump up in their 

sentences above what I would give anyone else because 

they betrayed the advantages that they have, I think 

Congress could come along and say that's not right. We 

don't want socioeconomic status to be a variable that 

affects how long someone goes to prison.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that the gap 

in your argument is that whatever Congress legislated, 

it did not legislate the manner in which you transferred 

this 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart.

 And as your opponent points out, it isn't

done proportionally. It could have been done in a lot 

of different ways.

 MR. DREEBEN: It is done in a logically 

proportional manner --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe. But there are other 

logically proportional manners of doing it. Why would 

the district court be bound to the particular one that 

the Sentencing Commission chose?

 MR. DREEBEN: The Sentencing Commission at 

least started where Congress did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. I'm granting 

that they got a start where Congress did. I'm assuming 

that. But why do they have to follow it through the way 

the Sentencing Guidelines did?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think they do have to 

follow it through exactly the way the Sentencing 

Commission did it, because they don't -- sentencing 

courts today which are sentencing under advisory 

guidelines need not use exactly the same base offense 

levels when they come down to final sentences after 

they've considered what the Commission has done. But 

what they cannot do, I submit -- and it is more of a 

negative -- they cannot say fundamentally the Commission 

has pointed this out and Congress has enacted, but the 

crack and powder guidelines are way out of whack. I

think that they're wrong.

 I think Congress was wrong. And I'm going 

to do everything I can to try to eliminate that degree 

of disparity. And I may not be able to do everything I 

want to. This judge here was limited by the 120 months 

that was the mandatory minimum. But essentially, he, as 

I read the sentencing transcript, thought it was crazy 

for Congress to treat crack and powder differently. For 

a judge to say Congress is crazy, I think, is a sort of 

textbook example of an unreasonable sentencing factor.

 The ultimate sentence will turn on how the 

judge applies all of the facts of the case to the 

particular --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not a fact that this 

guideline is also unique in that it was not based on a 

history of other similar crimes like all the other --

most of the guidelines were? There's no expert 

interpretation of the history of sentencing in this 

particular area?

 MR. DREEBEN: True. But this is an area 

where I don't think Congress chose to rely on the 

administrative expertise of the commission. It made its 

own policy judgment on crack.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. This 

guideline is pretty much unique in that regard. It is

not based on experience in sentencing in comparable 

cases.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the drug guideline was 

based on --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The 100 to 1 ratio is not 

based on history?

 MR. DREEBEN: No. But entire drug --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, none of the 

sentencing guidelines relating to crack are based on 

history.

 MR. DREEBEN: They are based on the fact 

that Congress made a supervening policy judgment. And 

in our system, the policy judgments ultimately 

pertaining to sentencing belong to Congress.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there is really an 

entirely different rationale for defending these 

guidelines than any other guidelines in the system?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, there are some other 

guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but 

my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress 

has made a determination that it has not changed, that 

it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point, 

district courts should not be free to say I think 

Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a 

different paradigm. The Commission didn't think that

was appropriate when it promulgated the original drug 

guideline, which is why that guideline is not based on 

the same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines 

might be deemed to be responsive to. But that only 

reflected that the Commission in its original guideline 

respected that its role was to carry out congressional 

policy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional 

policy, and so long as the Commission was operating in 

that vein -- which I think was correct -- it follows a 

fortiori that sentencing courts should do the same 

thing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the Guidelines 

supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony 

provision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is 

specific?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I would put it 

differently, Justice Kennedy. I would say that Congress 

has made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes, 

this ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient 

sentence, and the Congress that decided that might be 

wrong. And if the present-day Congress decides to 

change that, a new policy will be established, but I 

think that reading the two statutes together, Section 

3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that 

this is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and

even if every judge in the Federal system holds a 

different personal view, that doesn't mean that the 

statute has validated their position over the one that 

Congress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds 

sentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission 

sorts out its policy judgments.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose experience shows 

that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony 

provision -- we find that over a course of time?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think that the 

Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make 

unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841. I think 

reading all of the statutes together would produce the 

conclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to 

achieve the purposes of sentencing.

 Crack is more corrosive in the inner cities. 

It has different kinds of problems than powder. They 

should be addressed in this more severe sentencing 

manner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants 

being revisited, the appropriate body to do it is 

Congress, not each individual sentencing judge, 

formulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket 

affirmance by the court of appeals.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL S. NACHMANOFF

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 If I can respond, Justice Stevens, I think 

-- you asked about the percentage of cases in crack that 

are at the mandatory minimum or near it. I would point 

the Court to page 33, footnote 10 of our opening brief. 

It is approximately 70 percent or just over that that 

hit at the mandatory minimum or just one or two levels 

above that.

 So the large majority of cases involving 

crack cocaine end up being subjected to the mandatory 

minimum.

 With regard to the Government's argument 

regarding Section 994(a) and the fact that direction was 

given to the Commission to be consistent with pertinent 

statutes, of course, that's reflected in Section 5(g) 

which says that mandatory minimums trump the Guidelines, 

and the Commission recognizes that and of course 

sentencing judges recognize that, and Judge Jackson 

recognized it here.

To suggest that Judge Jackson concluded that 

Congress was crazy, I think is unfair. What Judge 

Jackson did was, in a very reasoned opinion, explained 

that the information from the Sentencing Commission, 

which has been persuasive not just to Judge Jackson, but 

to judges across the country and to many others, was 

that the 100 to 1 ratio overstates the seriousness of 

the offense, and he understood that Congress had spoken 

clearly with regard to mandatory minimums, and he 

honored them.

 Finally, Mr. Chief Justice, you point out 

the heart of the problem with the Government's case. 

Congress has not spoken explicitly in the way the 

Government suggests. They are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I was wrong that 

they legislated after Booker.

 MR. NACHMANOFF: Well, Your Honor, Congress 

has failed completely to address this particular 

problem, and they have understood since Booker that if 

they wanted to address the issue of the discretion that 

sentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory 

guidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem. They 

can change the statute. And so long as they then 

require the Government to include in the indictment and 

prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the specific

drug type and drug quantity over and above the current 

mandatory minimum and maximums, they're free to do that, 

and there would no Sixth Amendment problem and there 

would no problem with the advisory guidelines.

 In other words, right now, the Government 

simply alleges that a person engaged in the distribution 

of either 5 grams or 50 grams of crack cocaine -- that's 

what they have to do to meet the thresholds for the 

5-year and the 10-year mandatory minimums -- in 

virtually every case the Government will present 

evidence or a court will find under relevant conduct 

that there was some greater quantity. And if the 

Government's theory were to be accepted, those 

guidelines would be mandatory, and it would be in direct 

conflict with the remedial holding in Booker to require 

courts to adhere to that, absent the procedural 

protections which are not currently in place.

 Judge Jackson did it right in this case. He 

imposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony 

provision and the purposes of sentencing and all of the 

factors in 3553(a).

 He imposed a long sentence, 15 years, but he 

honored Congress's explicit mandate, and we would ask 

the Court to reverse the court of appeals and affirm the 

district court.
