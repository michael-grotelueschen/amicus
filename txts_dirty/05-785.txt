 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in Carey versus Musladin. Mr. Ott.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. OTT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

Court: 

This Court has never addressed the 

constitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators 

during a criminal trial. The two closest decisions of 

this Court, Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn 

established only a general rule that some courtroom 

practices may be so inherently prejudicial that they 

violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Neither 

Flynn nor Williams --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it went a little bit beyond 

that. I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not 

merely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he 

spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that 

improper factors would come into play in the jury 

decision. Isn't that the criterion?

 MR. OTT: An unacceptable risk, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the criterion.

 MR. OTT: Well, the test has been formulated 

different ways --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the way he formulated it. 

That's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.

 MR. OTT: In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a 

paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we 

need to answer is whether this practice, and there the 

courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial 

that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial. 

We don't believe that those are material --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That was the end point that they 

were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by 

referring to the unacceptable risk that improper 

considerations would come into play. And it seems to me 

that if you're going to talk about the criterion of the 

test or the standard, however you want to describe it in 

Flynn, you've got to get that latter point about 

unacceptable risk of improper factors.

 MR. OTT: That certainly was a formulation of the 

test. It's been -- we can accept it as the formulation 

of the test. And it was accepted by the California 

courts below. They attempted to apply that test. They 

announced the proper -- the correct clearly established 

law of this Court, and then proceeded to analyze the

issue. 

Below, however, on Federal habeas review, the 

circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to 

define clearly established law under AEDPA. Instead of 

assessing the state court's application of the general 

rule, the circuit court narrowed this Court's general 

rule into one that specifically condemned buttons. 

Instead of granting the state court wide leeway to 

apply this Court's general rule, it -- the circuit court 

created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit 

buttons in any case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if the court of 

appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme 

Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in 

case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court 

rule, and we're bound by case A. This is the elaboration 

we've given to it. And we have to find that the state 

court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're 

bound by what we do when we review what the state court 

has decided.

 MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor makes a distinction 

between a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases. In a 

post-AEDPA setting, it is -- the circuit court of appeals 

is looking at its own post-AEDPA case -- post A-E-D-P-A, 

AEDPA case which has said that this set of facts

constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly 

established law. 

We don't disagree that stare decisis might come 

into play there. It doesn't mean that that first 

decision was correct, but we don't -- what happened here 

in contrast was a pre-AEDPA decision that was used to 

define the clearly established law of this Court, give it 

more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside 

of it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: To apply an opinion of this Court 

to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of 

the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not 

necessarily to say that that is clearly established 

Supreme Court law. It just means that it is their best 

guess as to how it comes out, right?

 MR. OTT: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they're forced to decide 

it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either 

means this or that. They're not applying a clearly 

established test to the Supreme Court, are they?

 MR. OTT: Not by doing that. However, the circuit 

court of appeals here expressly stated it was looking to 

its own circuit authority to define the law that is 

clearly established. It specifically stated that this 

case, that the state's decision was unreasonable in light

of Norris. It specifically stated that the state court's 

decision could not reasonably be distinguished from 

Norris.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're looking under AEDPA 

at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. 

What do you do in a situation where you think the state 

court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but 

nonetheless reached the correct result? In other words, 

correct understanding of the established Supreme Court 

law would have led to the same result as their incorrect 

articulation of it.

 MR. OTT: Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the -- the 

first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as 

this Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti. Look at the 

fair import of the decision. 

Now, I don't know if you are referring to the 

issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at 

the end of the state court's decision here, but the first 

question is to look at the fair import. And if the fair 

import is that the correct test was applied, then habeas 

relief does not lie.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. My hypothetical, 

and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is 

let's say that the state court wrongly articulates 

Supreme Court law. But under the correct articulation,

it leads to the same result. What happens in that case 

under AEDPA?

 MR. OTT: I believe that the habeas relief should 

not lie. Now, I have seen circuit courts treat it 

different ways. Some courts will decline to give 

deference and review it de novo, but I don't think 

Congress intended, in enacting AEDPA, the A-E-D-P-A, that 

a state habeas -- a state conviction should be overturned 

simply because of an accident in a statement or 

formulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise 

constitutionally balanced --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You are actually saying the 

answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would 

then review it de novo. But on de novo review, you would 

sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.

 MR. OTT: Yes. I believe so. If I understood you 

correctly -- the question correctly, yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You would not affirm -- you 

would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA. You 

would say AEDPA authorizes review, but on review, we 

conclude the conviction was correct. That's what I 

understand the AEDPA to be.

 MR. OTT: Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming 

that the hypothetical is that the state court has 

misapplied, that the fair import has -- they have

misapplied the holdings of this Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It misarticulated them. I 

guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed 

they reached what we would regard as the correct result 

under the correct standard, they just articulated the 

wrong standard. 

Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be 

reviewed without AEDPA deference?

 MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Then I misunderstood 

the question. The deference would still apply if you 

could look at the decision as a whole and see that the 

correct standard was applied. If they have erroneously 

stated the standard -- if the state court erroneously 

stated the standard, but you can look to the decision as 

a whole, and see that the correct standard was 

nevertheless applied, deference is still due.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're concerned here with the 

court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that 

opinions of courts other than this Court have in 

determining whether law is clearly established. 

Do you exclude entirely from the province of what 

is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of 

appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?

 MR. OTT: Yes, we do, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that the only thing -- your 

argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are 

decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a 

case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then 

that's the end of it?

 MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. We -- our position is 

that a Federal habeas court may not look at all to state 

or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly 

established, only the holdings of this Court, and what 

appears on their face. 

If there's a general rule, such as here, the 

question moves to the reasonable application prong. 

And under that prong, because the rule is general, as 

this Court stated in Yarborough versus Alvarado, the more 

general the rule, the more leeway there is. Relief can 

still lie under certain circumstances, but it's -- it 

moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the 

state court's decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose all of the -- suppose 

there are five circuits. They're the only ones that 

looked at the issue. And they all say, we think the 

general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't 

that entitled to some weight? You're not supposed to 

cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you 

go to the state court?

MR. OTT: If Your Honor is speaking only to the 

clearly established prong, my answer would be no. If a 

circuit court says Jackson v. Virginia is clearly 

established law on the sufficiency of the evidence, we 

have no dispute with that. But to redefine or shape this 

Court's holdings beyond the face of those holdings, our 

position is that cannot be done with state or circuit 

law. 

Circuit law and state law may be relevant to the 

question of reasonable application, but not on the first 

prong. If a Federal habeas court looks to circuit or 

state authority on the first prong of 2254(d)(1), the 

reasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion. The 

two -- the two sections of the statute collapse into what 

is essentially de novo review, as what happened here. 

Once, for instance, the habeas court here decided that 

its own circuit authority required -- or prohibited 

buttons, reasonableness was a foregone conclusion, even 

though it was addressed by the circuit. 

But in further response to your question, Your 

Honor, our position is that on the reasonable application 

prong, a Federal habeas court may look to state and 

circuit cases. They are of varying relevance, but they 

should look to state and Federal circuit cases equally, 

but not all those cases have the same relevance. We have

-- there is a distinction between pre-AEDPA and 

post-AEDPA cases, and the distinction between whether 

those cases support or contradict the state court's 

opinion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So would there be any 

difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the 

circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.

 MR. OTT: There would be a difference, Your Honor. 

The -- depending on the prong we're looking at, under --

our argument would still be the same under -- on the 

clearly established prong of 2254(d)(1), that even if 

Norris was a post-AEDPA case, that the circuit court 

could not look to Norris to define this Court's holdings. 

But Norris, if it were a post-AEDPA case would 

have more relevance on the reasonable application prong. 

There, stare decisis might come into play. It doesn't 

mean Norris is correct. It doesn't mean that the result 

reached by the circuit court of appeals in this case 

would be correct, but it would certainly be more 

relevant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us -- let's assume 

for a minute that this case were on direct review, that 

we don't have AEDPA. What is the standard that should 

control? Whether there is an impermissible -- an 

unacceptable risk that impermissible factors will be

taken into account by the jury? Is that the test?

 MR. OTT: That is a test, the test, one of the 

formulations of it. I don't believe it materially 

differs from -- our position is it doesn't materially 

differ from the general due process, fair trial standard 

that applies in all cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you should make it 

more specific for us. You say general due process. How 

does that work in this case? I want to know whether or 

not I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a 

button, a piece of clothing. What's the test that I use?

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, it is an assessment of all 

the circumstances, that if you're a trial judge --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- unless you want to go 

on, that doesn't help me. We just tell all the judges in 

the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no 

more?

 MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. Let's take the 

impermissible factor test. The state court judge should 

look at the circumstances before him and determine 

whether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of 

impermissible factors coming into play. 

Whether the practice at issue, whether it be 

buttons or ribbons or what have you, is so likely to 

prejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his

fundamental rights that we need to order them removed. 

Not just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a 

constitutional requirement. 

So it is a spectrum test, Your Honor. And it's 

essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the 

buttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line 

rule. The circumstances --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't there be here? I 

mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in 

this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not 

exaggerate. But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea. 

For obvious reasons. 

Now, at some point, if enough judges say that, 

each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't 

say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that 

inherent risk that it's unconstitutional. But if some 

point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is 

quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a 

courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does 

it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what 

opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and 

unconstitutional?

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, my answer is no. As a 

supervisory matter, a state court can do whatever it 

wishes. Under the state constitution, state statutes,

state rules of court, can do many things under its 

supervisory power or even state constitutional power.

 That is different altogether, however, from saying 

that all buttons violate the Constitution, which is 

different in turn from saying all buttons require habeas 

relief.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about banners? What would 

you do with banners?

 MR. OTT: I beg your pardon?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do with banners? 

Would it make sense to say all banners are banned from 

the courtroom? I thought you would think that would make 

a lot of sense.

 MR. OTT: Banners?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Signs, placards.

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, I haven't seen a case 

involving banners. I imagine that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think I know why. Because it 

affects the atmospherics of the trial.

 MR. OTT: And likewise, we don't see all the 

button cases where the buttons have been precluded.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you also don't allow people 

to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't 

allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats. 

Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not

necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the 

trial; isn't that right?

 MR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's why we don't allow 

banners, because a courtroom is not the place for 

banners.

 MR. OTT: That's correct, Your Honor. Decorum 

should not be confused with --

JUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely right. Suppose you 

think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners, 

posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea. 

Now, why? Not just because of decorum. But 

because they introduce an extraneous factor into the 

judgment of the jury. 

And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do, 

I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw 

lines among buttons. It is pretty hard to draw lines 

among banners. And the only way to guarantee fair trials 

in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this. No 

buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters. 

How would you explain -- you just say the law 

just doesn't permit that.

 MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to say about 

that? Because that is a concern I have.

MR. OTT: I understand, Your Honor. And this 

Court obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic 

rule that -- but a prophylactic rule covers many 

unconstitutional as well as constitutional practices. 

And that a prophylactic rule requires -- the prophylactic 

rule that might be enacted would require preclusion of 

buttons does not mean that all the buttons that might 

come up are necessarily prejudicial.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not so sure. You think that 

we could just say we're going to exercise our best 

judgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just 

because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby 

banned forever? Do we have the authority to just say 

that?

 MR. OTT: Well, Your Honor, in this case, this 

case has -- this Court granted certiorari on the question 

of application of the AEDPA. So we are not asking --

certainly not asking for that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're exploring initially what 

the rule ought to be. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Supposing we all thought that this practice in this 

particular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial, 

but we also agreed with you that AEDPA prevents us from 

announcing such a judgment. What if we wrote an opinion

saying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional 

violation here, but Congress has taken away our power to 

reverse it. 

Then a year from now, the same case arises. Could 

we follow -- could the district court follow our dicta or 

could it -- would it be constrained to say we don't know 

what the Supreme Court might do?

 MR. OTT: It could not follow this Court's dicta 

under this Court's statement in Williams v. Taylor that 

only the holdings, not the dicta, of this Court establish 

clearly -- clearly establish Supreme Court authority. 

I believe that the rule, if there's going to be 

one, should be the rule that was applied here. A general 

rule of fundamental fairness considering the totality of 

the circumstances before the trial court. I think the 

rule works. And it worked in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need to 

establish that rule, do you? You just need to establish 

that what the Supreme Court determined was not an 

unreasonable application of this Court's law?

 MR. OTT: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice. 

We're not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons. 

The reason we're here is because of the circuit court's 

method in addressing this case and granting habeas 

relief.

JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the button had said --

the three buttons had said "Hang Musladin," would you say 

that there was not -- there was not sufficiently clear 

law from this Court to find that practice 

unconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation.

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, it wouldn't change the 

clearly established prong. We still have the general 

rule, but I think that your instance is one that all 

judges would agree is so egregious that it falls within 

the ambit of that, and would require habeas relief.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Falls within the ambit of what? 

Of a mob-dominated atmosphere or -- your answer to 

Justice Souter was AEDPA would -- was that this would 

require reversal even under AEDPA; is that your answer?

 MR. OTT: I can concede that, yes, Your Honor, 

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We both want to know why you say 

that.

 MR. OTT: Well, the question is objective 

reasonableness. And we don't dispute that some 

circumstances may present such a situation that no one, 

no judge is going to disagree that the situation, at the 

state court, if it denied the relief on the three buttons 

you posed was unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what are the --

getting into the formulation, what are the impermissible 

factors as to which a risk is raised by wearing the "Hang 

Musladin" button? What are those factors?

 MR. OTT: The "Hang Musladin" button, the 

impermissible factor first is the explicit message. 

"Hang Musladin." "Convict him." It's urging the jury to 

convict him and that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what's wrong with that? 

The prosecutor is going to get up and urge the jury to 

convict him. What is wrong with it on the button? What 

risk does the button raise that the prosecutor's argument 

does not? That's what we're getting at.

 MR. OTT: It is an outside influence, Your Honor. 

It is an influence coming from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How different is it from 

the victim's family sitting in the second row behind the 

prosecution every day of the trial? And I mean, I'm --

the hypothetical correctly focuses on the question, at 

least for me, of whether or not you can have specific 

applications of general rules that are clearly 

established. I'm just not sure your agreement with it is 

advisable because it seems to me that simply having --

how many people have to wear these buttons? One person 

shows up with a "Hang Musladin" button, does that mean it 

is a mob-dominated trial?

MR. OTT: No, Your Honor. My -- what I -- the 

point I meant to make was that we're not urging that 

relief can never lie because there's a general rule of 

application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.

 MR. OTT: It's a spectrum. And I would -- I'm not 

conceding that the example necessarily requires habeas 

relief, because there are a whole host of circumstances 

that we wouldn't know about it, for instance, whether it 

was ever seen, in cases that people don't see the button, 

or what have you.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What about simply the facts that 

we have in this case, which I thought I was doing, maybe 

I wasn't clear about it, but the button is different. 

Instead of putting a picture of the victim, it's got the 

statement, "Hang Musladin." It's worn every day by three 

members of his family who sit behind the prosecution 

table within the sight of the jury. Assume those facts. 

Would habeas relief be required under the 

general rule?

 MR. OTT: I don't think it would be required. I 

think it would be reasonable to say that habeas relief 

must lie. There are many -- there are much fewer 

inferences that could be drawn there.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a way of saying that it's

relief on my facts?

 MR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor. It --

there are --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

 MR. OTT: Well, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out, 

three family members of the victim sitting in the front 

row, buttons or not, the buttons don't add -- add little, 

if anything, to the three victim's family members sitting 

there grieving through a trial. They add very little, 

for instance, in this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether they are 

grieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that 

they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a 

button that says "Hang Musladin."

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, I submit that the sentiment 

is obvious to the jury. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon?

 MR. OTT: I would submit that that sentiment is 

obvious to the jury, that a juror --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They may not want him hung. They 

may not believe in the death penalty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you hadn't said that. 

Because I had thought that one of the things that made 

this case leaning in your direction is the fact that

merely having a picture of their loved one on the button 

doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant, 

or even convict the defendant. It just conveys, at most, 

to the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived 

of someone we love, you should take this matter very 

seriously and consider the case carefully. It is an 

important matter to us. And therefore, you ought to 

deliberate carefully. I don't know that it means 

anything more than that.

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, I did not intend at all to 

suggest that that was a message from those buttons. What 

I meant to say was the buttons add very little. Because 

I think a juror understands what a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You said, you know, convict 

what's -- or hang What's His Name. That's quite --

you're equating that with the buttons in this case. And 

I don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and 

so, or even convict so and so. They just say we have 

been deprived of a loved one. This is a terrible matter. 

Please, jury, consider this case carefully. That's all 

it necessarily says.

 MR. OTT: That's, if any message, what the buttons 

conveyed in this case. I was only speaking to the 

difference between the buttons that Justice Souter posed 

as putting forth a more explicit message.

 MR. OTT: Not necessarily, Your Honor.

 MR. OTT: Because in your case, I don't think that 

that message necessarily -- I think it is reasonable for 

a state court to conclude that those buttons did not add 

much to, if anything, to the presence of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it reasonable for a state 

court to say that three family members sitting in a 

courtroom within sight of the jury for whatever number of 

days the trial ran, saying at the guilt stage, hang so 

and so, is exposing the jury to a proper influence, that 

it should, and may consider in deciding guilt or 

innocence?

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, we could concede that for 

this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why don't you concede that 

of course that would be exposing the jury to an improper 

influence, in the "Hang Musladin" case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought some states require 

that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their 

case to the jury for harsh penalty. I don't know that 

that's necessarily inappropriate to know that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's at sentencing after

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: My hypo is at the guilt stage, 

not the sentencing stage.

 MR. OTT: At the guilt stage, that's right. 

California statutes do require that victims' families be 

able to make a statement at sentencing. They also 

require that the victim's family, if the victim is not 

alive, be present at the guilt phase of the trial, during 

the guilt phase of the trial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the guilt stage, is there 

any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the 

family members to display this message to a jury 

throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a 

risk, an unacceptable risk, that the jury will consider 

improper influences in reaching its verdict? 

Is there any question?

 MR. OTT: Your Honor, your -- your buttons might 

raise an impermissible risk.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's my hypothetical. My 

buttons, "Hang Musladin," is there any question about the 

risk of improper influence on my hypothetical? Not this 

case, my hypothetical.

reasonable for a state court to conclude otherwise. And 

it was certainly reasonable for the state court here to 

conclude that three simple buttons bearing only a photo 

did not convey any message of blame, guilt, anything 

other than grief of this family. 

If I may reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. FERMINO

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. FERMINO: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the 

Court: 

I want to direct this Court's attention to the 

state court opinion which appears at 55A to 78A of the 

appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this 

case. I want Your Honors to take a look at that opinion. 

It is 25 pages in length, but the portion of the opinion 

dealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length. 

Of those two pages, all but a few sentences deal 

directly with the Norris case. I believe it is at 

roughly page 72A in their -- 73A of the appendix. All 

but three sentences deal with the Norris case. 

The Attorney General has said in its briefing that 

the court below teased out the particular reference to

the buttons, that it carefully parsed the opinion, that 

it gave a tendentious analysis. This is the description 

of the Attorney General. Nothing could be further from 

accuracy. 

These two pages discuss Norris head on. It is the 

elephant in the room, if you will. The court below could 

not have -- it would have been impossible for the court 

below to write this opinion without addressing the Norris 

case head on.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the key sentence in 

this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a 

button which -- I don't know what the size is. Nobody 

has told them what the button is about. Nobody has put 

for the judge a picture of it. Nobody showed him what 

the button is. So he says a simple photograph of Tom 

Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other 

than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family 

member. Period. Now, what else is there to say? That's 

the court's conclusion. 

And it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the 

button. I couldn't even find the button in the record. 

I didn't even know what this looks like. It is a button, 

somebody later must have said two inches to four inches. 

I don't know who said that. I don't know how the judge 

could have known that. The button isn't in the record.

So why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to 

influence anybody? That's what they say.

 MR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In this case.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct. And I think that 

the court -- it is correct that the record before the 

state court of appeals was inadequate to address -- to 

answer the question. But I think what -- where the court 

erred is in adding and grafting on an additional element. 

It goes beyond that sentence that, Justice Breyer, you 

focused on. I think it is that the -- it is the element 

of branding. It's that this wearing of the buttons in a 

sense branded the defendant in the eyes of the jurors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It goes on frequently in an 

opinion. I have been known to do that myself. And I say 

this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say 

"sure isn't that." Well, what is it?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that language came from one 

of our opinions, didn't it? The branding language?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was quoting Holbrook and 

Flynn.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you can't fault the court 

for just saying it isn't that. Mr. Ott says it isn't

that.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct. But I believe that 

it is not part of the test. It was that the branding 

language, as in Justice Brennan's -- in Justice Brennan's 

dissent was not part of the text articulated by --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Repeated later in opinions for 

the majority, I think.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In later cases, so I mean --

MR. FERMINO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't just put it in Brennan's 

dissent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand your 

point about the state court focusing on Norris. The 

question under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an 

unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

 MR. FERMINO: Well, in this instance, much has 

been said about the opinion and the carefully written 

opinion of the state court. But the portion of the 

opinion that focuses on this issue is, as I said, roughly 

two pages in length and deals almost entirely with 

Norris. Norris was the contrast case for the court of 

appeals.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in here it -- you agree 

that the California court has as much authority to say

what Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right? They 

are on a par. Ninth Circuit decisions in no way binds 

the Supreme Court of California. Isn't that so?

 MR. FERMINO: That is correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that this state court of 

appeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to 

consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a 

very strong argument.

 MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would 

respectfully disagree. I think that the -- were this 

discussion of Norris to be a much longer discussion -- or 

excuse me, part of a much longer discussion, that might 

be true. But its entire focus was Norris. It used 

Norris by way of negative explication to show that the 

facts before it didn't fall within the rule as derived 

from Williams and Flynn. And I think that goes beyond 

respect to the Ninth Circuit.

 I think it took the case, it grappled with it, it 

decided that it was different than Norris. And I think 

that there would have been no way for the court below to 

have looked at the facts of this case without addressing 

Norris --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what was the -- what in 

your opinion -- this is why -- as you can see, I'm 

concerned about buttons. I think they're probably a

problem. I think all judges are concerned about them. 

But then I think about this particular case. And I look 

at that single sentence: "It was unlikely to be taken as 

a sign of anything other than normal grief."           

I mean, suppose this had been a different case. 

Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith 

didn't pull the trigger. It was an unknown person called 

Jones. Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see 

the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was 

Smith. Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those 

buttons. I could think that. 

But this isn't that case. This is a case where 

everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger. The only 

question is whether the family's son came at him with a 

machete. So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure, 

they don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they 

don't think that. He's their son. What would you expect 

them to think? 

So that's why I thought that they are saying that 

sentence, in this case. In this case, it would be taken 

as sign of grief and nothing more.

 MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Breyer, that is 

certainly a plausible reading of the state court opinion. 

However, I think you've also identified one -- the 

problem with this. It is the risk, not the reality. And

that's why we have to look beyond the facts of this case 

and look to the rule as derived from the Williams and 

Flynn case, as I think the court below properly did. 

And in doing so, in applying it to this case, I 

think you have to do away with this kind of courtroom 

behavior. It is simply not acceptable. It is not 

acceptable to wear --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To wear any buttons? It 

says, "Fair Trial."

 MR. FERMINO: Any courtroom practice that causes 

an impermissible risk that the jury's -- that the jury 

would come to a conclusion based on a factor not 

introduced at trial is entirely prejudicial --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, most -- I don't 

think -- a typical jury will understand that the victim 

is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry 

that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial. 

And they may not like the person accused of murdering 

their son. That is not -- that is sort of like in every 

case. That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much 

to what the jury will derive from seeing the family 

seated behind the prosecution bench.

 MR. FERMINO: I agree with Mr. Chief Justice up 

unto the point of it's not different wearing the buttons. 

I think that you add the buttons, and you are creating --

you are doing essentially what the rule derived from both 

Williams and Flynn teaches us is wrong.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Williams and Flynn and 

all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they 

went, it was always the government requiring a defendant 

to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court 

with shackles. And in the case that went for the 

government, the extra officers in the courtroom. 

We haven't had a case, have we, where it is 

spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's 

being attacked?

 MR. FERMINO: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

There isn't a case that is, that -- where the state 

action element, if you will, is not present. However, I 

would posit that in this case, where you have a judge, a 

trial judge who denies a lawyer's motion, that you have 

implicit in that state action, that the court has 

endorsed the practice of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That certainly goes beyond 

where our precedent leaves off. That is, we are dealing 

with direct impositions by government in a way that poses 

an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. And you're having the 

judge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't

make certain demonstrations. If the family were there 

and they -- and one of the members of the family was 

sobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, I -- that --

MR. FERMINO: Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- much, it has much more impact 

than a button.

 MR. FERMINO: It -- and it might. But that kind 

of behavior by a courtroom spectator can be controlled by 

a trial judge if -- when it occurs.  If it is 

spontaneous, it can be controlled. A rule that 

spectators aren't allowed to emote would be implausible, 

or would be impractical. We are not talking here today 

about controlling the emotions of spectators. We are 

talking about an impermissible factor like a message or 

the risk of a message.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but there is a First 

Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of 

people other than the prosecution, people other than the 

state, who is bringing this prosecution.

 MR. FERMINO: There is no question that there is a 

First Amendment issue here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes it a different 

case. It makes it very hard to say, well, the Supreme 

Court's already decided this matter.

context, though, there's a balancing test that needs to 

be employed, and it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, it may come out the way --

it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say 

that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon 

it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the 

First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to 

wear buttons or cry or --

MR. FERMINO: I believe that Mr. Cohen in New 

Hampshire wearing his sign regarding the draft --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that cuts against you.

 MR. FERMINO: I understand that, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: This reason -- suppose, 

hypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be 

no buttons. No buttons, no signs, no banners. A 

courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a 

demonstration of any kind. Now, if I were to think that, 

and I also were to think it's just too difficult to 

figure out case by case whether there is or is not an 

improper influence, suppose I thought both of those 

things. 

Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side 

says: One, you're supposed to decide whether this was 

clear in the law. Two, if you're worried about the 

future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law

either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was 

cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. 

All right. You write for me the words I'm 

supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.

 MR. FERMINO: Justice Breyer, I think that the 

rule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that 

courtroom -- courtroom behavior that creates an 

unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have -- or 

have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on 

evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial. 

And unless it advances some important state 

interest, some compelling state interest like the concern 

that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised about the forcing 

a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling 

cases, that rule I think allows the opinion in this case 

of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of 

the AEDPA. I think that's clear. I think what the court 

below did was essentially apply the rule that I just 

discussed. And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what about -- what if 

the issue was mourning? The trial is being held and the 

families appear and they're all in black because they're 

still in mourning. Does that violate this clearly 

established rule?

 MR. FERMINO: I think you're getting -- Mr. Chief

Justice, I think the hypothetical gets closer to it as 

well. I think a defendant's -- excuse me, a victim's 

family wearing, appearing in court every day wearing 

black gets closer to the kind of message import -- again, 

the risk, not the reality -- that this case is -- that 

the court below was concerned with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my question is under 

AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going 

to keep the family out even in mourning, that would 

violate the clearly established rule that you've just 

articulated?

 MR. FERMINO: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Even if it didn't, though, I 

suppose you could draw a line between people who were 

doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear 

mourning, and some people will come into a courtroom and 

be reminded of the person who died and sob. But in this 

case, they're going out of their way to do something that 

people in mourning do not normally do.

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And so you've got -- I think 

you've got a stronger argument. 

The problem that I have in this case is that, 

number one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just 

described it, as something that is abnormal and something

that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention. 

I don't know why otherwise they would be doing it.           

And from whatever source, we do know that the 

button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger. 

So it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and 

understood perfectly that these were people who were 

raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy. I can 

understand that, and under the general rule out of 

Williams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn 

good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has 

been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations 

as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom 

evidence. 

What, however, do I make of the fact that not one 

single court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you 

know, as a constitutional matter? Am I in the position 

of sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with 

Jim? I'm raising a question about my own judgment 

in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have 

come to that conclusion. What do you think I should make 

of that?

 MR. FERMINO: I think it is a factor to consider 

in the Court's analysis. However, I think the facts of 

this case are unique precisely because this typically 

doesn't -- we don't get this far because most trial

judges don't allow this kind of conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been -- haven't 

there been court decisions that have held that buttons 

didn't compromise a fair trial right?

 MR. FERMINO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in assessing the 

reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's 

decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly 

established when other courts considering our precedent 

have gone the other way?

 MR. FERMINO: Because I think that under -- I 

think that this Court looking at the "contrary to" prong 

of the analysis would -- can come to a conclusion that 

the state court's decision wasn't -- I'm getting ahead of 

myself. 

I think the Court can properly, in looking at it 

from a "contrary to" analysis, come to the conclusion 

that, even with that body of case law, that the state 

court got it wrong, that it misapplied the clearly 

established law of this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't want to put your 

-- hang your hat on the "contrary to" prong, though, do 

you? Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable 

application argument.

 MR. FERMINO: I think it's both, Mr. Chief

Justice. I think it's both. I think -- I don't need to 

hang my hat on the "contrary to" because I think under 

either prong --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, as Justice 

Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case 

involving spectators. So it's not contrary to clearly 

established law. We have cases stating the general 

principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an 

unreasonable application. But "contrary to" seems an 

awful stretch.

 MR. FERMINO: I wouldn't go -- Mr. Chief Justice, 

I would not go as far as "an awful stretch," but I would 

think that we, under the unreasonable application prong, 

we certainly win. I think that there is also an argument 

under the "contrary to."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The record is confusing, at 

least as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong --

on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn. 

A, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons 

were worn?

 MR. FERMINO: It is not. It is not clear at all 

from the record how many days.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it may have been for just one 

day of the trial?

 MR. FERMINO: It may have been. But according to

the declarations that were submitted in the petition for 

collateral review, those are petitions -- those are 

declarations of the trial counsel and of respondent's 

mother -- it is that they were worn on multiple days by 

several members of the family, and that the buttons were 

anywhere from two to four inches in diameter. And that's 

in the record.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where does it say that?

 MR. FERMINO: Those declarations appear --

JUSTICE STEVENS: These are in the joint appendix.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: These were declarations filed 

with the United States district court in habeas?

 MR. FERMINO: They were filed actually as part of 

the state collateral review proceedings. They were filed 

with the habeas. And it appears that they are at the JA 

6 and 8.

the buttons were worn every day?

clear as to the frequency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a time when the trial 

judge said stop. Was there not? He initially denied the 

motion.

 MR. FERMINO: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that there was a 

time in the course of the trial when he told the family 

members to stop wearing the buttons.

 MR. FERMINO: I don't believe so, Justice 

Ginsburg. I think that they were never admonished not to 

wear them, but that the original ruling of the trial 

judge stood as far as the wearing of the buttons was 

concerned.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In his opinion on denial of 

rehearing, Judge Kleinfeld on the Ninth Circuit made the 

point that at criminal trials -- and I suppose at other 

trials -- it is an accepted feature of the proceeding 

that there are going to be spectators who identify with 

one or the other party. And there may be relatives of 

the defendant in a criminal case. There may be relatives 

of the victims. And it's apparent from their behavior 

what they think about the case and which side should win. 

And that's sort of a baseline that has to be 

accepted in judging, not whether wearing buttons is good 

as a -- whether we think it would be good if we were

announcing a court rule, but whether there's a violation 

of due process. Do you accept that?

 MR. FERMINO: Justice Alito, I do, as far as it 

goes, accept that as a baseline. I think Judge Bea in a 

separate dissent likened it to a family wedding, that we 

all know who is here for which party. That we have no 

quarrel with.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So what is it about these 

particular buttons that's reflected in the record that 

shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be 

inferred just from that rather common feature of trials?

 MR. FERMINO: I think in looking at the rule again 

derived from Williams and Flynn, we don't have to go 

there. It's the risk, not the reality. I don't know 

what could be inferred, and we don't know what was in the 

jurors' minds as they saw those buttons. But the point 

is that it could affect the outcome. It is an 

impermissible factor that causes the possibility that the 

jurors' verdict is based on something other than the 

evidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a greater risk? Why 

do the buttons convey -- involve a greater risk than the 

kind of behavior that Judge Kleinfeld was referring to?

 MR. FERMINO: Because you can imagine as a juror 

-- jurors are very attentive during trials -- that they

look out into the audience and see in the jury box -- I 

mean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing 

buttons. What are those buttons? What's on there? 

What's the point of -- there's a degree of scrutiny 

that's naturally going to occur by an attentive juror. 

That's really the issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume -- risk of what? 

That's what I'm puzzled by. Let's assume that the 

buttons were big enough that they could recognize that 

the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose 

murder the trial was about. Let's assume all that. What 

risk is that? 

You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh, 

he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found 

him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence. 

But during the guilt trial? I mean, I see, gee, the 

victim's family loved him a lot. This guy must be 

guilty. That doesn't follow at all. 

In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can 

have any effect on the jury.

 MR. FERMINO: Well, Justice Scalia, I think it's a 

risk of a factor that is not subjected to adversarial 

testing. It is the possibility that it could have an 

impact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the possibility. You

tell me that --

MR. FERMINO: Here you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a real possibility that 

a jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's 

family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?

 MR. FERMINO: But that's only one possible message 

of this button. And again, that's where I'm contrasting 

the risk versus the reality. It's that it could be any 

message that's sent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have to depend on there 

being a message? Isn't it enough if there is an 

influence that is conveyed? I mean, what I thought the 

problem was, was that there was as a result of the 

obtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk 

simply of an emotional approach to the determination of 

guilt or innocence. 

The jurors are more likely to feel sorry for the 

family members sitting there a few feet away from them. 

Perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the 

victim, but certainly for the family members. And it 

would be that improper influence of emotionalism as 

opposed to a particular message that is the problem here, 

isn't it?

 MR. FERMINO: I don't disagree with that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you accept that?

MR. FERMINO: I do accept that, and I don't need 

to rely on a message. I would agree with the argument 

that you've advanced.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. FERMINO: The -- I think it is important here 

to look at the fact that no party in this case -- that 

the state has not advanced that this is a practice that 

should be endorsed or adopted. It is clear that everyone 

involved has had a concern with the wearing of buttons or 

any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that 

would otherwise not be subject to meaningful adversarial 

testing, and I think that's the problem in this case. 

And I do believe if you look closely at the state 

court opinion in this case, you will see that the court 

below's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out 

of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious 

reading, when you look at exactly what the state court 

decided.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's just because we 

haven't had a First Amendment case yet. I mean, we just 

have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial 

for the defendant, for the state. Let's wait until the 

ACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons 

in court. Then you're going to have people arguing, 

people ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can

wear a shirt that says "Blip the Draft."

 MR. FERMINO: But this Court, I think, could craft 

an opinion that addresses that concern without the need 

for simply awaiting that day.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm not sure you're 

right that nobody was concerned about -- everybody 

thought the factors were wrong. I don't think the trial 

judge did. The trial judge said he saw no possibility of 

prejudice.

 MR. FERMINO: And I misspoke. You're correct, 

Justice Stevens. The trial judge did reach that 

conclusion.
