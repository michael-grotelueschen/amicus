CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal 

Dutch Petroleum. 

Mr. Hoffman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HOFFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The principal issue before this Court is the 

narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held 

liable for violating fundamental human rights norms 

under the Alien Tort Statute. Under Respondents' view, 

even if these corporations had jointly operated torture 

centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to 

detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's 

operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, counsel, for me, the 

case turns in large part on this: Page 17 of the red 

brief says, "International law does not recognize 

corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here"; 

and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron 

saying "No other nation in the world permits its court 

to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged

extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation 

has no connection." 

And in reading through the briefs, I was 

trying to find the best authority you have to refute 

that proposition, or are you going to say that that 

proposition is irrelevant? 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, there -- there are a 

couple of questions within that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's -- it involves 

your whole argument, of course. 

MR. HOFFMAN: It does. Yes. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. HOFFMAN: And -- and let me start by 

saying that the international human rights norms that 

are at the basis of this case for the plaintiffs --

crimes against humanity, torture, prolonged arbitrary 

detention, and extrajudicial executions -- all of those 

human rights norms are defined by actions. They're not 

defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a 

corporation or another kind of entity. 

And so, I think that the -- the Respondents 

are wrong when they say that international law does not 

extend to -- to those kinds of acts. They do -- it 

does. And the United States agrees with that position. 

What they have tried to -- to conflate is

the question about whether international law -- the 

international law norms apply to a corporation or a 

person with whether there's a -- an international 

consensus with respect to how those norms should be 

enforced, particularly within domestic civil 

jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in the area of 

international criminal law, which is just analogous, I 

recognize, there is a distinction made between 

individuals and corporations. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, there's a distinction 

made within the jurisdiction of certain modern 

international criminal tribunals. And Respondents take 

their position too far in this, because what they've 

said is that the fact that corporations can't be found 

liable criminally under the International Criminal 

Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying 

norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war 

crimes when it comes to the International Criminal 

Court -- don't apply to corporations. 

And that's clear -- that clearly is wrong because 

the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two 

home countries of -- of these corporations has passed 

domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal 

penalties for violations of those very norms. So,

there's no question that it can be done. 

What the most important -- I think one of 

the most important principles in this case is that 

international law, from the time of the Founders to 

today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts, and 

domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce 

international law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hoffman --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You began by --

by --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hoffman, I -- I 

thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another 

nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil 

liability on corporations for violations of customary 

international law, where the conduct occurred abroad, 

the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not 

a U.S. resident? 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the -- there are two 

parts to -- to my answer to that. One is that the Alien 

Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the 

law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders 

married tort law and violations of the law of nations. 

In the international human rights amicus 

brief, the amicus brief of international human rights 

organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series

of cases where the domestic courts and domestic 

legislation of various states around the world have 

addressed those kinds of issues. And so, there isn't an 

exact analogue to the Alien Tort Statute, but there's no 

question that domestic legislation and domestic courts 

have taken on these kinds of issues. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's no particular 

connection between the events here and the United 

States. So, I think the question is whether there's any 

other country in the world where these plaintiffs could 

have brought these claims against the Respondents. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, let me address the -- I 

think this comes under the general rubric of 

extraterritoriality. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there a yes or no answer 

to that question or not? 

MR. HOFFMAN: I believe that they -- that 

the answer to that would be "yes." 

JUSTICE ALITO: Where? 

MR. HOFFMAN: I think that they could be 

brought in Holland or the United Kingdom for events in 

Nigeria. I think that the cases that are discussed as 

those --

JUSTICE ALITO: Any other country other than 

the country of the citizenship of the defendants?

MR. HOFFMAN: I don't know if this precise 

case could be brought. I know that the -- we have a 

principle of transitory torts, and so, one -- and I 

believe other countries have that principle as well. 

So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have 

plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S. 

residents when they filed this case. They found a 

tortfeasor within the United States that they believe 

was responsible for these torts. And from Mostyn v. 

Fabrigas and before, Mostyn v. Fabrigas being the 1774 

case by Lord Mansfield talking about transitory torts, 

the courts clearly have the jurisdiction to adjudicate 

those kinds of tort claims. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if there is no 

other country where this suit could have been brought, 

regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't 

it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself 

contravenes international law? 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, that -- that issue has 

been raised in a number of the briefs. I would say two 

things: One is that that doesn't really go to the 

question about whether corporations can be categorically 

excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is 

really the issue that -- that was decided by the court 

below and which was the question presented here.

Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of 

issue. I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously 

argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on 

its own. 

But there is no international law principle 

that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be 

proved, that says that the United States Congress was 

disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds 

of tort remedies. And it was clear from the founding 

that the Founders at least believed that this statute 

would be extraterritorial. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it was 

motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here 

within the United States. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, it was motivated by the 

Marbois incident and a similar incident to -- with 

regard to a Dutch ambassador in New York at the time of 

the Constitutional Convention. But if -- if the Court 

looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about 

which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in 

1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very 

important in terms of interpreting the Alien Tort 

Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault 

on the British colony in Sierra Leone. And so, it was 

not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I

think everybody agrees that -- that this statute was 

intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related 

violations of the law of nations. 

It -- the Bradford opinion there said, even 

though U.S. criminal jurisdiction was limited, the civil 

jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute provided that 

the corporation that -- whose property was attacked 

within the territory of Sierra Leone --

JUSTICE ALITO: Have all the judges who have 

interpreted that opinion interpreted it the way you just 

did? 

MR. HOFFMAN: The Bradford opinion? 

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. 

MR. HOFFMAN: I'm not sure in which sense. 

I mean, the -- yes, the -- I think that the Bradford 

opinion has been used --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what did -- how did 

Judge Kavanaugh interpret that on the D.C. Circuit? 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think -- I don't 

recall specifically. I know that there has been some 

controversy about whether that was an attack in the high 

seas. I know there's some scholarship about that. What 

I would suggest to the Court, if the Court went back to 

the original documents that the -- that were sent to 

Attorney General Bradford which -- from the British

government, I think the Court would find that -- that 

this attack actually took place in the territory of 

Sierra Leone. 

And so, one of the reasons that we've 

suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality 

issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled 

by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because 

in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the 

Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents 

have raised it, and there -- the historians that have 

expressed opinions on corporate liability and others 

that would be interested in this question have not been 

able to put the other side before the Court. 

And I think there's a very -- there are 

very --

JUSTICE ALITO: The first statement – the first 

sentence in your brief in the statement of the case is really 

striking: "This case was filed ... by twelve Nigerian 

plaintiffs who alleged ... that Respondents aided and abetted the 

human rights violations committed against them by the 

Abacha dictatorship ... in Nigeria between 1992 and 

1995." What does a case like that -- what business does 

a case like that have in the courts of the United 

States?

JUSTICE ALITO: There's no connection to the 

United States whatsoever. 

The Alien Tort Statute was enacted, it seems 

to be -- there seems to be a consensus, to prevent the 

United States -- to prevent international tension, to --

and -- does this -- this kind of a lawsuit only creates 

international tension. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, the Alien -- if I could 

start with the second part first. The Alien Tort 

Statute certainly was passed to do that but also as an 

expression of the Nation's commitment to international 

law, I think primarily as a -- as a statement of this 

country's commitment to international law as a new 

member of the community of nations. And if -- if you 

look at the incidents like the Marbois incident --

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you really that think the 

first Congress wanted victims of the French Revolution 

to be able to sue in -- in the court -- to sue French 

defendants in the courts of the United States? 

MR. HOFFMAN: I think that what -- I think 

the question would have been, is there a law of nations 

violation? For example, in the Marbois incident, say 

the -- Marbois was -- was attacked by Longchamps outside 

the United States, but Longchamps came to take refuge in 

the United States, and the French government said you

have somebody living in your country that has attacked 

our ambassador in violation of the law of nations. 

I think the United States -- I think the 

same principle -- the United States would have wanted to 

do something for the French government in response to 

that because it would have been giving refuge to someone 

who had violated the law of nations. And -- and the 

same principle has been applied in the modern era to --

to giving no safe haven to torturers and others. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hoffman, could I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That sounds very much 

like Filartiga. And I thought that -- that Sosa 

accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under 

the Tort Claims Act. So, I thought what we were talking 

about today, the question was, is it only individual 

defendants or are corporate defendants also liable? 

MR. HOFFMAN: A lot of the 

extraterritoriality issues would apply to the cases that 

this Court endorsed in Sosa. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I agree that we can 

assume that Filartiga is a binding and important 

precedent, it’s the Second Circuit. But in that case, 

the only place they could sue was in the United States. 

He was an individual. He was walking down the streets

of New York, and the victim saw him walking down the 
streets of New York and brought the suit. 

In this case, the corporations have 
residences and presence in many other countries where 
they have much more -- many more contacts than here. 

MR. HOFFMAN: And those issues, generally 
speaking, are resolved by other doctrines, rather than 
an exclusion of corporations categorically from the 
statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You went -- can I go back 
to -- are you finished with that answer? Because I want 
you to finish. 

MR. HOFFMAN: I was -- the only thing I was 
going to add to that is that a doctrine like forum non 
conveniens or personal jurisdiction would deal with the 
issues about whether this is the most appropriate forum. 
And those doctrines apply whether it's an Alien Tort 
Statute case or it's a -- a common law tort case. 

These plaintiffs could bring this case in 
State court. What the Alien Tort Statute does is 
provide a Federal forum when these torts are in 
violation of the law of nations. And that's really what 
it -- what the Founders intended and what -- and what it 
does. 

I'm sorry.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The court of appeals erred in its 

categorical ruling that a corporation may never be held 

liable under the Alien Tort Statute regardless of the 

nature of the norm, the locus of the wrong, or the 

involvement of the state. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, could you 

explain to me the -- the difference between respondeat 

superior liability and corporate liability? In -- in

the briefs, there seems to be an assumption that 

respondeat superior liability is -- is permissible, and 

the only issue is whether corporate liability is. Is 

there a difference between the two doctrines? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think the difference 

is really a matter of degree. I mean, under respondeat 

superior liability, a corporation is normally 

responsible, liable for the acts of its agents. 

Judge Posner, in the Seventh Circuit Flomo 

decision, suggested that in the nature -- in this 

category of cases, assuming that the ATS would allow a 

common law cause of action for conduct in another 

country, that maybe there should be more limited 

respondeat superior principles because the action would 

occur in circumstances were the corporation sought to be 

held liable may not have much -- much control over it. 

Where the corporation itself is liable --

and this would be true in criminal law and presumably in 

-- in tort law -- would usually require some action by 

those responsible for running the corporation or high 

enough up the chain of command --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Kneedler, when 

you --

MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: When you say in your brief 

that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a 

question of enforcement, do you say that because you're 

thinking of this as a vicarious liability case? In 

other words, there's an individual person who clearly 

has violated a norm of international law, and then the 

question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an 

enforcement question. Or would you say that it's also 

an enforcement question when we're talking about direct 

corporate liability? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think it's both. 

Particularly the latter, but I think the former as well. 

As Mr. Hoffman said, international law norms proscribe 

certain conduct, but the enforcement of that is left to 

each nation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but I find it 

difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold 

foreign sovereigns liable under this Act, that they're 

excluded despite -- despite its language; and yet, we 

cannot inquire whether persons other than sovereigns are 

covered. What is -- what is the distinction between the 

two?

sovereigns, a sovereign could not be held liable for --

at least for conduct outside the United States, because 

of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. That's --

that's what this Court held in the Amerada Hess case. 

Within the United States, if the foreign sovereign 

committed a tort, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 

subject to certain limitations, would allow --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But I think, Mr. Kneedler --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is more specific than 

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. It deals with a 

much more narrow category of case. And I do not think 

that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be 

interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if 

indeed this statute provided for it. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the court in Amerada 

Hess did hold that, that -- and it made an important --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. KNEEDLER: It made a point that is 

important to this case as well. It said that while the 

Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must 

be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not 

identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are 

limitations on who the defendant may be from other 

sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be 

one of them, then the suit could not go forward against 

the foreign sovereign.

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa, 

and this is the footnote 20, we said that the question 

of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor 

might be relevant to the question of whether there was a 

substantive norm that applied to you. 

And I guess the question here is why that 

same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether 

there is corporate liability? In other words, is there 

a substantive norm that applied to corporations?  Maybe 

there is; maybe there isn't. But that that's the 

question, as opposed to what you suggest in your brief, 

that really we should just think of this as a question 

of enforcement, which is entirely up to Federal common 

law. And I guess the question is why think of it as 

enforcement rather than as a substantive obligation? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, first looking at 

footnote 20 in -- in Sosa, it -- what the footnote says, 

that a related consideration, meaning related to whether 

the particular norm satisfies the criteria in Sosa, is 

whether international law extends the scope of liability 

for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being 

sued. If the defendant is a private actor such as a 

corporation or individual --

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I'm not saying footnote 

20 --

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: It addressed a different 

question, but it's an analogous question. If the 

question of whether non-state actors are part of the 

substantive obligation question, why, too, isn't the 

question of whether international law extends to 

corporations? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Because the state 

actor aspect of it goes to the question of the conduct. 

Does the conduct itself violate the norm? 

I think it's a -- but beyond that, it's 

enforcement. I think it's important to bear in mind 

that the Alien Tort Statute uses the word "tort." And 

it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- I didn't 

understand the point you just made, that the sovereign 

immunity part goes to? To the conduct? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it goes to whether the 

defendant can be sued, the sovereign immunity does. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't the corporate 

thing go precisely to the same question? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Because there is no 

independent prohibition in international law or domestic 

law against suing a corporation the way there is for a 

foreign sovereign. To the contrary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But whether -- I'm 

sorry. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I was just going to say, to 

the contrary, at the time the Alien Tort Statute was 

adopted, corporations could be held liable. This 

Court's decision in Chandler recently surveyed the --

the law, and corporations could be held liable in tort. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But under 

international law, it is critically pertinent who's --

who's undertaking the conduct that is alleged to violate 

international norms. If an individual private group 

seizes a ship, it's piracy. If the navy does it, it's 

not. Governmental torture violates international norms. 

Private conduct does not. 

So, why doesn't the -- why isn't the same 

pertinence -- your argument seems to be that all you 

need to do is find an event, torture, piracy, whatever, 

and then it's up to the domestic law whether or not 

particular entities can be sued. 

MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think that's correct, 

and --

your position.

when you're talking about state -- whether it's a state 

conducting the illegal conduct or somebody else. So, 

why -- that's not up to the domestic --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, because that goes to the 

definition of the norm. But if we -- if we take -- if 

we take the Alien Tort Statute, in 1907, the Attorney 

General concluded that an irrigation company could be 

sued for violating a treaty. If we take the examples 

that gave rise to the Alien Tort Statute, if a process 

serving company -- if one of its agents went into an 

ambassador's house and tried to serve process, that was 

a criminal violation at the time. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you go much -- you go 

much further. Suppose an American corporation commits 

human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United 

States. Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be 

sued in any country in the world, and it would -- and 

that would have no international consequences. We don't 

look to the international consequences at all. 

That's -- that's the view of the Government of the 

United States, as I understand. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. The question of 

extraterritorial application is distinct from the 

question of whether a corporation can be held liable.

then -- you want to answer in your brief and -- this 

question, I find impossibly difficult, maybe highly 

fact-dependent. There is no United States Supreme Court 

of the World. There is no way of getting unified law on 

the points of whether when we interpret a common law 

Federal -- a system of Federal common law to decide 

whether a corporation can be defendant in every – a 

defendant in a certain kind of case. Every other country 

could do the same. And there's no way of resolving it. All 

right? 

So, I find that a difficult question. I 

don't know why that's in this case. I would have 

thought the question in this case is, can a private 

actor be sued for certain violations of -- of 

substantive criminal law? The answer is "yes." Okay? 

Genocide, for example. 

And then the question is -- a corporation is 

a private actor, and is there any reason why, just like 

any other private actor, a corporation couldn't be sued 

for genocide? And there the answer is I don't know, but 

I'll find out when the other side argues. You see? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, I -- I think this is 

unnecessarily complicated. They made a -- a categorical 

rule. They said never sue a corporation. I seem to

so, why isn't that -- why are we going into -- I mean, 

you have good reason for doing it, and I want to hear 

why. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, our -- our position is 

straightforward. Just as you said, the question of 

whether a corporation can be held liable we think should 

be based on the fact that the ATS refers to torts. And 

in applying -- this question we think is not 

complicated. 

In -- in fashioning Federal common law to 

decide whether there should be a common law cause of 

action, the ATS's reference to tort law, I think, 

directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question 

of whether a corporation can be held liable under 

domestic tort law. And it clearly can be. It could be 

at the time this statute was enacted, and it can be 

today.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I'd like to begin with the answer to 

Justice Kennedy's first question. Justice Kennedy 

asked, and Justice Breyer renewed the question, is there 

any source in customary international law throughout the 

world that holds corporations liable for the human 

rights offenses alleged here? 

And the answer is there is none. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You say there is not a 

case. That's a different matter. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Not a case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that's a different 

matter because you can have a principle that applies 

even though there isn't a case. And the principle that 

here would apply is what I said, Pirates, Incorporated. 

Do you think in the 18th century if they brought 

Pirates, Incorporated, and we get all their gold, and 

Blackbeard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me; it's 

the corporation -- do you think that they would have 

then said: Oh, I see, it's a corporation. Good-bye. 

Go home.

corporation would not be liable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, what 

source have you for --

MS. SULLIVAN: The corporation would not be 

liable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What source have you for 

that proposition? 

MS. SULLIVAN: The -- look to Justice Story 

in U.S. v. Smith, cited in the Respondents' brief at 

footnote 12. It looks to piracy. And piracy is 

allowed -- in rem actions. You could seize the ship 

with which the piracy was committed, as you could later 

slave trading ships. But you could not seize another 

ship, and you could not seize the assets of the 

corporation. So, piracy --

JUSTICE BREYER: You couldn't seize another 

person other than Blackbeard. That's why -- if the ship 

is owned by a corporation, and they sue the corporation 

in 18 -- 17 whenever it was -- '96 or something, what 

reason do we have to think that the corporation would 

have lost -- I mean, would have won? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, let's be clear 

that Sosa referred to specific norms. So, the answer to 

Pirates, Inc., does not determine the answer in this 

case, which is about whether corporations can commit

post-Nuremberg human rights offenses. 

A given norm must be applicable to a 

corporation. So, even if I gave you Pirates, Inc., it 

wouldn't decide this case. But in fact Pirates, Inc., 

was not suable; it was the ship that could be seized. 

But to answer Your Honor's question about 

the genocide convention, and perhaps I could go back. I 

want to be very clear: We're not arguing there needs to 

be an international adjudicated case finding a 

corporation liable in order for Petitioners to win, but 

they have failed to show anything in the conventions, 

the non-binding treaties engaged in by multiple nations. 

They've failed to show anything in custom or practice. 

They failed --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Sullivan, I think 

that that's mostly because all of these are written to 

prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the 

actors. So, if I could, you know, draw an analogy, it's 

as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this 

norm of international law does not apply to Norwegians. 

And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians, and 

it doesn't specifically say "Norwegians." But, of 

course, it applies to Norwegians because it prevents 

everybody from committing a certain kind of act.

international law does speak to who may be liable, which 

you correctly identified as a substantive question, not 

a question of enforcement.  And international law holds 

corporations liable for some international law 

violations. Look to the convention on the suppression 

of the financing of terrorism, which speaks about legal 

entities, or the convention on bribery of public 

officials, which speaks about legal persons. 

But the human rights offenses here do not 

arise from conventions like those, which allow corporate 

liability. To the contrary. The human rights offenses 

here arise from conventions that speak to individual 

liability. The liability of individuals. 

And, Justice Breyer, in precise answer to 

your question about the convention on genocide, if you 

look to the Chevron brief on page 20 -- this is the 

amicus brief of Chevron filed by Professor Goldsmith. 

On page 20, it quotes in full the relevant passage from 

the genocide convention, article IV. 

I'm sorry. There are many briefs, but 

perhaps if I could read it to Your Honors, I'll read it 

in full. 

It says that "persons committing genocide or 

any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be 

punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible

rulers, public officials or private individuals." 

And, Justice Kagan, all the other relevant 

conventions also speak about natural persons. The 

convention against torture speaks about "him," not "it." 

And when Congress -- in the one time it implemented the 

conventions that are the source of the human rights 

offenses that are alleged here, Congress, in the Torture 

Victim Protection Act, said that the suit may be brought 

against individuals. And it expressly declined to use 

the term "persons," which could embrace corporations. 

And we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're getting ahead 

of yourself. We haven't --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We haven't decided 

that question just yet. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statute doesn't 

use the word "individual," and it doesn't use the word 

"person." As far as a corporate entity is concerned, a 

corporate -- a corporation could sue, could be a 

plaintiff under the Alien Tort Statute, could it not? 

There's no --

corporation could sue if it were an alien, and if you

decided "alien" embraced corporations. And, of course, 

the Attorney General Bradford opinion from 1795, which I 

agree with the Chief Justice, extended -- and with 

Justice Alito -- did not extend to conduct in other 

countries; it extended only to conduct on the high seas. 

But Bradford -- the Bradford opinion, if you 

give it any credit, only establishes that a corporation 

may be a plaintiff. It does not speak to the question 

here, which is whether a corporation may be a defendant. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sullivan, take an 

example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of 

this case removed from it. Let's assume that the French 

ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the 

United States and that that attack is by a corporate 

agent. Would we say that the corporation there cannot 

be sued under the Alien Tort Statute? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor. You would 

say that because there is no assaulting ambassador norm 

that applies to corporations. 

I just want to go back and --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you explain that 

to me? We would have to sue the person individually. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Exactly. Exactly.

Petitioners to show that the norm is established by 

international law, not on us to show that corporate

law and mostly other countries' law would hold the 

corporation liable for the individual's act. Isn't that 

right? That's a general principle of law. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kagan, let's be clear 

to separate two very different causes of action. There 

is no country -- and to answer Justice Ginsburg's first 

question, there is no country in the world that provides 

a civil cause of action against a corporation under 

their domestic law for a violation of the law of 

nations. In Mr. Hoffman's hypothetical, if there were a 

suit in England or in the Netherlands, it would be for 

assault and battery, wrongful death, or --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sullivan that would be 

true against an individual as well. The ATS is just a 

unique statute. It's unique against individuals, and 

it's unique against corporations. That doesn't answer 

the question that you're here to address, which is 

whether corporations are meaningfully different from 

individuals. 

MS. SULLIVAN: They are meaningfully 

different from individuals under international law, 

which is the crucial choice of law question you need to 

answer here. The crucial question that's at the 

threshold is which law determines whether corporations 

are liable?

JUSTICE BREYER: Well you're right on 

that point. What about slavery? Genocide -- I see your 

point in the Goldsmith brief. But what about slavery? 

That seems like contrary to international law norms, 

basic law norms, it could be committed by an individual. 

And why, if it could be committed by an individual, 

could it not also be committed by a corporation in 

violation of an international norm? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Let me be clear. The 

question is not "could" --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know, but the 

way --

MS. SULLIVAN: -- international law apply. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I've read the reason why, 

as you point out in your briefs, the corporations are 

different in many countries as if they're not moral 

persons. And I have in my mind filled in the blanks on 

that, and I think I know what it refers to. All right. 

That's the rationale that kept them out of some of these 

treaties. 

And now the question would be, all right, 

are they always kept out no matter what? And I'm

is slavery. What about -- what about that one? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Corporate liability, even for 

norms on which the international community agrees --

torture, genocide, piracy, slavery -- corporate 

liability is a substantive norm that is established by 

international law. And the nations of the world, for 

various reasons, have treated individuals and 

corporations differently. 

And, Justice Kennedy, over and over and over 

again, as not just the Respondents' brief at page 17 but 

the U.K./Netherlands brief -- two of our most important 

allies filed a brief in support of Respondents, saying, 

at pages 11 through 15, there is no international norm 

applicable to corporations for violations of the human 

rights offenses here. 

Now, the international community has many 

reasons for this. In 1998, when the Rome statute 

established the ICC, the signatories actually discussed 

whether to have criminal liability for corporations; and 

as the Scheffer amicus brief in support of Petitioners 

points out, at page 18, they actually also discussed 

civil liability for corporations, and the nations of the 

world who created the ICC, one of the most important 

modern instruments for bringing about human rights 

prosecutions, declined to embrace --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me why you 

think they did that? I mean, for us, the -- respondeat 

superior is so simple. Why isn’t it a big deal in 

international law? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, 

there's many reasons. For one, a corporation involves 

many innocent stakeholders beyond the perpetrators. And 

the regime established at Nuremberg, if it established 

nothing else, established that it is individuals who are 

liable for human rights offenses. It pierced the notion 

of hiding behind a state abstract entity, and it held 

individuals, including individual businessmen, from 

Alfred Krupp to 28 officials indicted from the I.G. 

Farben firm. But Nuremberg was about individual 

liability. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to I.G. 

Farben? I thought that it was dissolved and its assets 

taken. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I.G. 

Farben was dissolved by the Control Council Law Number 9 

in 1945. It was a political act. It preceded any of 

the tribunals, either international or national. It was

not until later that year that the international 

military tribunal began. It prosecuted no corporations. 

When the Allies prosecuted perpetrators of 

the Nazi horrors in later cases, they prosecuted, again, 

only individual officers, not any corporations. 

There are two amicus briefs on the Nuremberg 

history, one in support of Petitioners filed by Jennifer 

Green and one in support of neither party filed by 

Jonathan Massey. Both of them agree on one proposition, 

and that is that no corporation was prosecuted by either 

the international military tribunal in 1945 and '46 nor 

in any of the subsequent U.S. tribunals. In fact, in 

U.S. v. --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no -- there 

was no civil liability adjudicated in Nuremberg. It was 

about criminal. 

MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And to answer your question, when I.G. Farben was 

dissolved, it was part of denazification, 

decartelization, and the destruction of the Nazi war 

machine of which I.G. Farben was an integral part. It 

was practically viewed as an enemy state in and of 

itself. 

That is a -- so, the precedent of Nuremberg, 

like the precedent of the ICTY, the ICTR, the ICC, all

exclude liability for corporations, even for the most 

heinous offenses of the modern era. They focus 

liability, rather, on corporate officers. 

And, Justice Kagan, we don't dispute that 

corporate officers can be held to account for these 

offenses, assuming, Justice Alito, that we don't have 

concerns about extraterritoriality --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that's --

MS. SULLIVAN: -- even as to individuals. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: If that is true -- let me 

just take you back to this question of separating out 

direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate 

liability, because it's clear if -- one question is, is 

there a substantive international law obligation? 

But there's another question which would not 

be an international law question, which is a remedial 

question. Remedies are addressed by common law rather 

than -- American common law rather than by international 

law. 

So, why shouldn't we look at the vicarious 

liability question as essentially a question about the 

scope of the appropriate remedy once an international 

law violation has been found? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kagan, you should 

look at questions of corporate liability. Like

questions of aiding and abetting liability. Like 

questions of individual private liability as opposed to 

state actor liability. You should look at all of those 

questions as substantive questions answered by 

international law. And that's because footnote 20 of 

Sosa says you look to whether international law extends 

liability to the perpetrator being sued. 

You can't just find an act out there and fan 

out to anyone in the entire world, including consumers 

pumping gas in Ohio, and say there's been an act of --

an international law violation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But the question of who can be 

sued --

MS. SULLIVAN: It's a question of who. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- is a remedial question. 

MS. SULLIVAN: It's not. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: The question of who has an 

obligation is a substantive question. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Respectfully, Justice Kagan, 

we disagree. The question of who may be sued is 

fundamentally part of the question of whether there has 

been a tort committed in violation of the law of 

nations. It would read the verb "committed" out of the 

statute, if you just said find a violation of the law of 

nations anywhere and then apply it to whoever you want.

JUSTICE KAGAN: But in my example, the tort 

in violation of the law nations has been committed. It 

has been committed by the corporate agent. And the 

question then is, can one hold the corporation 

responsible for that tort? And that seems to be a 

question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive 

international law. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kagan, we 

respectfully disagree. That is a question of 

substantive law. Think about a domestic analogy. Look 

to the Restatement of Conflicts. You would ask 

whether -- you would not look to foreign law to 

determine a question of respondeat superior or 

contribution or indemnity. You would not look to 

foreign law to determine whether, in the words of the 

Restatement, one person is liable for the tort of the 

other. 

You would look to the law of the place of 

misconduct or the place of where the corporation is 

headquartered. We -- foreign law determines in this 

case whether you had can have civil remedies rather than 

criminal. We concede that the ATS allows a civil remedy 

where the world would impose only criminal liability. 

That's because civil liability versus 

criminal liability -- that's a matter of remedy. So

would be the amount of damages. So would be the choice 

of compensatory or punitive damages. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you look --

MS. SULLIVAN: Those are matters of remedy 

for domestic law to decide. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you look to the law of 

the place where the corporation is headquartered, well, 

suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability 

that says corporations are liable for the acts of their 

agents. So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I 

think most countries in the world have such a notion, 

that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the 

acts of their agents. So, how does the -- looking to the 

law where the corporation is headquartered, where does 

that get you when that country has the very same law 

that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the 

acts of their agents? 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, 

respectfully, we don't think the world is all of one 

when it comes to issues of corporate responsibility for 

the acts of its agents. If you look at the ICJ --

sorry. If you look at the Rome statute, the Rome 

statute itself has very particular sections about when 

an -- a corporate superior is liable for the actions of 

a corporate inferior. It looks to a knowledge and

deliberate indifference standard. 

Not every nation of the world agrees on what 

standard must -- there must be for even attributing the 

agent's act at the bottom of the corporate hierarchy to 

a senior officer, much less to the corporation as an 

entity. 

In answer to your question about -- earlier 

about respondeat superior, Justice Kagan, the only way a 

corporation can do anything is through the acts of human 

beings; thus, there's always the question, when it comes 

to corporate liability, to ask how to attribute the 

action of the human beings who work for the corporation 

to the corporation. And we respectfully submit that 

Sosa footnote 20 commits that question, as does the ATS 

itself, to international law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

MS. SULLIVAN: Yes? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I wonder if you don't 

concede away too much when you say, well, there's a 

difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions 

of jury trial, damages, and so forth. That's domestic. 

Those were the concerns that the U.K. and

corporations shouldn't be liable for acts committed on 

foreign -- foreign territories. Those -- that was the

whole reasoning of -- of the U.K. brief. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, I agree 

completely, and let me be very clear on one thing. I've 

addressed only step one of Sosa, which is, does 

international law provide for a specific universal and 

obligatory norm of corporate liability? It does not. 

In fact, it refutes it. The Rome statute rejected 

liability for corporations. The jurisdictional statutes 

of the ICTY and the ICTR apply jurisdiction only to 

natural persons. The international community at step 

one has rejected it. 

But, Justice Kennedy, it's very important 

that Sosa puts a second screen into your inquiry. You 

must ask, at the second step, even if international law 

had provided any source of corporate liability, which it 

does not, you would still have to ask -- footnote 30 of 

Sosa says it's a higher bar -- should Federal common 

law, should Federal common law now embrace these kinds 

of actions? And the answer is "no." 

Even if you found this were a question of 

domestic remedy, we think you cannot. This is a 

question of substance. But even if this were a question 

of -- domestic remedy, you should not find liability for 

corporations for the same reasons you rejected corporate 

liability in Malesko.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, and I'm -- in 

Sosa, as I understand it, it's all about what is the 

conduct that falls under this law of nations. It is not 

about who is the actor subject to that law. Sosa is 

dealing with what kinds of conduct come within the Alien 

Tort Statute. It -- it doesn't consider the question of 

what actor; that wasn't before the Court. What was 

before the Court is what kind of activity violates, is 

contrary to, the law of nations. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, 

respectfully we disagree and so do all the courts of 

appeals who have addressed the question of aiding and 

abetting liability. Every court of appeals, save one, 

including the Ninth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, which 

disagreed with us on the outcome, said that the question 

of whether international law permits liability for 

aiding and abetting is to be determined by international 

law. The second --

JUSTICE BREYER: You could -- you could --

first, maybe you addressed this case. There was a case 

called Skinner v. East India Company. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Yes, Your Honor. That was 

under English tort law, 1666. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. So, it's

through the rationale is you find some instances where 

individuals could, in fact, violate an international law 

norm, and then you find a lack of a reason why a 

corporation couldn't do the same. Now, in that kind of 

category, could the Court say we're interpreting Federal 

common law here to determine who can be sued under this 

statute? That's the remedial part. 

MS. SULLIVAN: You may --

JUSTICE BREYER: And we're -- and so, what 

we're saying is that there is a -- in certain 

circumstances, there could be a suit against your 

corporation. You'd have to be careful because you 

recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your 

corporation, you're saying every country in the world 

can do the same. And -- and, therefore -- but maybe 

there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction 

recognized under international law where you could be 

pretty certain no harm would be done by that. 

And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way 

of enforcing it. 

MS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, first we 

disagree that the question of who may be sued is a 

question of enforcement. We think that bridge --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I see. Yes. 

MS. SULLIVAN: -- was crossed in Sosa. And

as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, in all the cases 

that hold, all the courts of appeals agree that who may 

be liable, just primary actors or also aiders and 

abetters, is determined by international law is a 

question of substance. So, we disagree with the 

premise. But to answer Your Honor's question, the 

Federal common law still should not fly in the face of 

Congress, and I think the important question in your 

hypothetical is who is the "you"? 

As Justice Scalia just pointed out, Congress 

could amend the ATS tomorrow to provide for a Federal 

common -- a Federal statutory cause of action against 

corporations. But the one time Congress spoke to the 

very question at issue here, it held the diametric 

opposite. Congress in the TVPA rejected corporate 

liability by choosing the term "individuals" rather than 

"persons." 

And I realize, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the 

next case, but we think there's -- really the answer 

that the TVPA excludes corporations is compelled, and 

the U.S. agrees. 

So, Your Honor, the question is not what 

should Federal courts do in the abstract; it's what 

should Federal courts do when there is exact statutory 

decisionmaking by the political branches that has gone

the other way. In maritime law, in Miles v. Apex, you 

didn't -- you didn't decide to go contrary to the 

Congress in the Jones Act; you said if there's a Jones 

Act statutory statement about wrongful death, we should 

follow it in Federal common law. 

Similarly here, even if the international 

community thought there was anything to corporate 

liability -- which it doesn't. It disagrees. Our two 

allies the U.K. and Netherlands disagree, and Germany 

has filed a brief saying it also disagrees with the ATS 

as it has been applied. Even if there was international 

consensus, you would still have to ask, should the 

Federal courts, through free-form Federal common law 

making, do the opposite of what Congress is saying? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we know the way to do 

it. I mean, in Skinner, even if it was English common 

law, the court reasons -- it says the taking of the ship 

on the high seas was "odious and punishable by all laws 

of God and man." So, we -- could you not say, where an 

action is forbidden by the international law, and it is 

punishable or -- by all laws of God and man, in such a 

circumstance there being no reason to deny corporate 

liability here, even under the moral person rule, it --

we interpret the Federal common law to permit that 

remedy?

MS. SULLIVAN: Well, Your Honor, the ATS has 

language that says the tort must be committed in 

violation of the law of nations. And so, although, 

Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't specify who may be the 

defendants, it does point us to the law of nations to 

figure out what the law of nations thinks about who may 

be the defendants. And the law of nations is uniform. 

It rejects corporate liability. It rejects corporate 

liability. 

So, to find a Federal common law cause of 

action here is to fly in the face of both the 

international community, with all the foreign policy 

consequences Justice Kennedy referred to earlier, if as 

Mr. -- as the Chief Justice said earlier, the point of 

the ATS was to stop war, by making sure there was a 

forum for the Marbois incident so that France wouldn't 

think it had to go to war on us to stop the offense to 

its sovereignty. But it will it provoke war to go out 

ahead of the international community, foiling the 

purpose of the ATS.

foreign policy consequences of this kind of ATS 

liability, and we haven't even gotten to the alternative 

ground Justice Alito and the Chief Justice referred to 

earlier, which is Charming Betsy canon says don't 

lightly construe your law to offend international law. 

But just back to the -- the United States, I 

respectfully suggest you should look to the TVPA, rather 

than simply to what the United States says here today. 

And the TVPA, which is Congress interpreting --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the TVPA is one 

limited statute dealing with one particular category of 

offense, and it was specifically meant to supplement, 

not to supplant, the ATS. So, between those two things, 

the fact that it's limited to torture and that there was 

no design to supplant the ATS, I guess I think that if 

your best shot is the TVPA, that's a -- that's a weak 

one.

Just to go back to the key point about 

international community, the international community --

opinions, but every convention for every international 

tribunal excludes corporations. 

Look to the U.N. process. The Petitioners

MS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, but for --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this --

diversity jurisdiction. So -- because an alien is suing 

an alien. And there's a good argument you could dispose 

of this case, but not all the other ATS cases, by simply 

holding there's no alien diversity jurisdiction here, 

and the ATS can't have been viewed as displacing 

Congress's intent to limit jurisdiction at the time.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. HOFFMAN: Let me just make a few 

quick --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For all the reasons 

Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting 

source and can be viewed as a supplemental source, but 

there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity, 

that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other 

aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not 

be able to sue corporations. 

How do we deal with that incongruity? 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, there are a number of --

of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien 

Tort Statute apart from that. I mean, for example, the 

Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of 

international human rights violations. Congress decided 

to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it 

decided to do that. 

The one thing that's clear, as Justice Kagan 

said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was 

designed to establish or to make even stronger the 

Filartiga precedent and shield it from analyses that 

challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to 

restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way.

And obviously, the next case will discuss in 

greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations 

or not. If -- I don't know. 

If I could just make a couple of additional 

points. 

If -- if it was true that international law 

barred corporate liability, then our friends the United 

Kingdom and the Netherlands have violated international 

law by passing legislation that imposes criminal 

liability on corporations for violating genocide, crimes 

against humanity, and war crimes. 

And I think that brief makes it pretty clear 

that whatever they're saying, if -- if the Alien Tort 

Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law, 

then their views don't apply. 

And -- and this is a tort statute. That's 

what -- there was a meaning to torts. Skinner's case, 

for example, was a tort not only under English common 

law; it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of 

nations. It was robbery on the sea. The law of nations 

was incorporated in English common law, just as it was 

in the founding in our country and, under the Paquete 

Habana, is still part of our land -- the law of our 

land. 

"Tort" meant to the founders "tort

remedies." It meant -- it meant that the means of 

enforcement would be done by the common law. That's all 

that was available then. It's all that's available now. 

And -- and international law places no 

restriction on the way domestic jurisdictions enforce 

international law. There is a general principle law of 

corporate civil liability for all of the things that we 

allege in this case. 

In every legal system in the world, one can 

get redress for this kind of thing. Countries don't 

necessarily call it a violation of the law of nations. 

They didn't fashion the statute the way our Founders did 

for the reasons that they did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. In every 

nation in the world, you can get redress for this sort 

of thing, but I thought you told us earlier that there 

was no place where this suit could be brought --

MR. HOFFMAN: No, no. If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, a 

suit by an alien against another alien for conduct that 

takes place overseas. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, what I'm suggesting -- I 

don't know whether in every domestic jurisdiction, the 

extraterritoriality issue is taken in the same way. 

What I'm suggesting is that, for these kinds

of acts, you can get redress against a corporation 

within every legal system. Now, not every legal 

system -- I don't know every legal system with respect 

to the extraterritoriality issue. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just gets 

back to your basic submission, which is you define the 

international norm based on the act rather than the 

entire issue that's going to be litigated, which 

includes both remedy and actor. 

MR. HOFFMAN: Well, what -- what -- what we 

would suggest is that international law does not 

distinguish with respect to actor, at least in -- with 

respect to these four norms, if we're going by a 

norm-by-norm basis. These -- these norms are defined in 

ways that human beings and corporations can violate. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your position --

MR. HOFFMAN: Could -- could it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your position on 

aiding and abetting? Is that -- is that a matter of our 

domestic law or would we track international law on 

that? 

MR. HOFFMAN: The lower courts have treated 

it in different ways. I think that most of the courts 

now have found that aiding and abetting is --

courts. I care about you. What's your position on 

aiding and abetting? 

MR. HOFFMAN: I think that -- I think that 

aiding and abetting could be viewed as a conduct 

regulating norm, that it actually applies to the things 

that can be done to violate the norm. And, therefore, 

international law would apply to that. 

I think my -- my time is up.
