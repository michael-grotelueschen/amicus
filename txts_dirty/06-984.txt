 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 06-984, Medellin v. Texas.

 Mr. Donovan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. DONOVAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DONOVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The President and the Senate entered into 

three treaties, the Optional Protocol, the UN Charter, 

and the ICJ Statute, by which the United States agreed 

that it would comply with the ICJ's decision in any case 

to which it was a party. We now have such a decision, 

and the President of the United States has determined 

that the United States should comply.

 Texas, however, tells this Court that it 

should tell the world that the framers left us a 

Constitution in which neither this Court nor the 

President nor maybe even Congress could ensure that the 

United States kept the promise that its elected 

representatives made to its treaty partners. Texas's 

position is directly contrary to the constitutional 

design.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not such an

outrageous proposition. You'd certainly acknowledge 

that the President and the Senate could not enter into a 

treaty that required the States to do something that was 

unconstitutional.

 MR. DONOVAN: Yes. The Constitution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So there would be the 

situation that presents the shocking situation you've 

just described. There is a treaty, but nonetheless it 

cannot be enforced domestically.

 MR. DONOVAN: There would be constitutional 

-- there might be affirmative constitutional constraints 

on the enforcement of a treaty, but there are none here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who would enforce 

those constraints? The thing that concerns me about 

your position is that it seems to leave no role for this 

Court in interpreting treaties as a matter of Federal 

law.

 Suppose, for example, that the International 

Court of Justice determined in this case its judgment 

was the same, but they added: As a matter of 

deterrence, we think the officers who failed to give 

consular warning should each be sentenced to 5 years in 

jail. That's the ICJ determination. Would this Court 

have a role in reviewing that judgment?

 MR. DONOVAN: This Court would have a role

in reviewing that judgment, and here's -- here's the 

question. This Court has an obligation, has the 

authority, to say what the law is. In this case the 

obligation is, in fact, to comply with the judgment, 

itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if we determine 

MR. DONOVAN: And if that obligation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if we 

determine, even if we determine that that judgment is 

based on a legal error?

 MR. DONOVAN: The question -- that's the 

basis of submitting a dispute to a third-party 

dispute-resolution mechanism, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the ICJ 

determined that the officers should each go to jail for 

5 years, we would have no basis for reviewing that 

judgment?

 MR. DONOVAN: Wel, that would be -- well, 

that would be a -- raise a separate obstacle. If I may 

answer the questions in turn, first --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the ICJ ever issue a 

judgment of that character? It issues a judgment 

between two nations, two or more nations, and it is 

instructs the United States to do something. I'm not

aware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a 

sentence should be for a particular individual.

 MR. DONOVAN: That is correct. The ICJ 

decides disputes between nations, but those disputes may 

involve the nations' obligation as to specific 

individuals. In this case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm still interested 

in the answer to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, as I say, there are two 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the court acts 

beyond, clearly beyond, its jurisdiction?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, it's -- with respect, 

there's no suggestion here that the court has acted 

beyond its jurisdiction. Indeed, the President has 

determined otherwise.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you answer the 

hypothetical, please.

 MR. DONOVAN: But if the court, itself -- if 

the ICJ, itself, made a determination as to a dispute 

that is within its jurisdiction and that imposes an 

obligation that is within this Court's provenance to 

enforce, that is, that it determines the rights 

attributable -- enforceable within a court of justice, 

this Court would be enforcing the obligation to comply.

It wouldn't -- the fact that it diverged 

from the court's own interpretation, for example, here 

in Sanchez-Llamas, is not relevant to the treaty 

obligation that this Court is exercising --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm 

still looking for an answer to the hypothetical. What 

would be the basis for this Court's reviewing the ICJ's 

determination that officers should go to jail for 5 

years?

 MR. DONOVAN: Because in that situation that 

may be beyond the Court's -- the executive power of the 

Court. What the Court would be doing is determining 

the rights attributable to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court doesn't 

have executive power. It has judicial power. It's 

already exercised that judicial power in Sanchez-Llamas 

in determing the meaning of this treaty.

 And I understood your position to be that we 

have no authority to construe the treaty in this case 

because a judgment was issued by the International Court 

of Justice.

 MR. DONOVAN: The -- the question here is 

that the --the Court would be exercising its judicial 

authority to construe the United States's obligation to 

comply with the judgment. The nature of that

obligation, itself, could be one that would be 

enforceable, in this Court's words, "in a court of 

justice;" and that's the nature of this obligation. Mr. 

Medellin gets a review and reconsideration.

 In the Chief Justice's hypothetical, that 

may well be an obligation that would be enforceable by 

other actors that would -- which would not be directly 

enforceable in a court as here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought --

MR. DONOVAN: It depends on the nature of --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the question --

and I apologize if I'm not paraphrasing it because I 

have my own. This has arisen frequently. Brussels has 

a treaty, and that treaty binds all the member nations, 

and supreme courts of various nations have come up 

against this problem:

 What would happen if the Brussels court or 

the EU court insists under the treaty that we do 

something that violates our own Constitution? I think 

this is an example of that. And the answer typically 

has been: Well, we'd follow our own Constitution, at 

least if it was a violation, what the EU said, of 

fundamental human rights or destroyed some basic 

structural part of our Constitution.

 And the question that I would have is,

doesn't that kind of approach -- not exactly but that 

kind of approach -- satisfy whatever problem there is in 

this respect here?

 MR. DONOVAN: If there were -- if an ICJ --

JUSTICE BREYER: If the ICJ were to do 

something which it had never done, like, say, put 

everybody in jail for 50 years -- I don't know that 

there is such a thing -- but suppose they did, if they 

did, I guess that might violate something basic in our 

Constitution, in which case we wouldn't enforce it.

 MR. DONOVAN: That's right and --

JUSTICE BREYER: If we took that approach --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now --

MR. DONOVAN: If there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back, 

you're conceding, I take it, whether the ICJ has done 

something like this before or not -- and we can debate 

whether what they've done in this case is precisely that 

-- there is a role for this Court in determining whether 

or not a judgment of the ICJ should be enforced.

 MR. DONOVAN: There is surely because it's 

this Court that would be enforcing the obligation to 

comply. And just as a treaty cannot contravene an --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just enforcing the 

obligation to comply or, as we have in this case,

determining the legal basis for the ICJ determination?

 MR. DONOVAN: There are -- there are two 

different obligations here: There is an obligation 

under the Vienna Convention itself, and this Court has 

determined the dispositive effect of that obligation of 

a matter of U.S. law.  But there's a different 

obligation. The President and the Senate agree to go to 

a third party, to go to the International Court of 

Justice, to resolve disputes. The very premise of that 

obligation is that we might disagree with the 

determination -- with the interpretation of the treaty, 

and we agreed in that circumstance to comply with the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose in this case the 

President did the opposite -- the same facts only the 

President said to Texas, do not comply with this 

judgment.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, it -- that would -- it 

would be inconsistent with this Court's duty and 

obligation to comply, to enforce a treaty that the --

that the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the President's --

MR. DONOVAN: If the --

conclusive.

determination -- what the President has determined here 

is to enforce the treaty. He --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is he's 

coming out the other way. He says don't follow this 

judgment. And you say he can't do that.

 MR. DONOVAN: If --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I think that 

that's not -- not consistent with your earlier position.

 MR. DONOVAN: Oh, if the President here --

the -- if there's an obligation here to comply and, in 

the words this Court, it's "an obligation of a nature to 

be enforced in a court of justice," and here the 

obligation imposed by the ICJ and the Avena judgment is 

an -- is an obligation --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the obligation --

MR. DONOVAN: -- which essentially --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the obligation that 

the United States undertook when it signed the UN 

Charter the obligation to undertake to comply with ICJ 

judgments in accordance with its own constitutional 

processes, not necessarily that any ICJ decision would 

be regarded by any court in this country as binding 

Federal law?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, it would be -- that --

that's exactly right. What the -- what the ICJ -- what

U.S. did is undertake to comply. So the question is, 

what is the nature of the obligation imposed?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had a --

MR. DONOVAN: It might have obligations --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had a treaty on 

the recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual 

recognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the 

judgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty. We 

wouldn't look behind it to see if we agreed with it on 

the merits.

 Are you saying that this undertaking, this 

agreement to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of 

the ICJ gives the judgment in the particular case, 

although not precedential effect, the counterpart to 

full faith and credit?

 MR. DONOVAN: That's exactly the effect of 

the judgment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's self-enforcing. I 

thought you --

MR. DONOVAN: It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you -- you think 

this treaty is self-enforcing. You don't really need 

the President's order here.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, if the -- whether or not 

the treaty obligation is self-executing or

self-enforcing goes to the nature of the obligation. If 

the ICJ said -- if a treaty or an ICJ judgment said, go 

pass a statute, that's obviously directed to Congress. 

If it said cease hostilities, that's directed to the 

President. But as this Court has said, when a treaty 

or, by extension, a treaty obligation to comply with a 

judgment is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --

MR. DONOVAN: -- of a nature to be enforced 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May ask this question? I 

don't think you've answered the Chief Justice's original 

hypothetical. It's easy, of course; they cannot compel 

us to violate our Constitution by a judgment of their 

kind. But what about the hypothetical that they said 

the sentence for this man should be 5 years, not just 

there be an investigation to see if he's been 

prejudiced. Would we have to follow that judgment?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, in that situation, if it 

was a judgment rendered in a case to which we had --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In this very case.

 MR. DONOVAN: That would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: This very case. Supposing 

they had said the judgment is that Medellin should spend 

5 years in jail and no more. Would we have to honor

that judgment?

 MR. DONOVAN: In the first instance, yes, 

the Court would honor that judgment as an obligation to 

comply. But remember that there are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it becomes --

MR. DONOVAN: -- some constraints that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it becomes a penal 

judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country 

forces -- enforces another country's penal judgment.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, that would depend on the 

-- if -- how you construed the obligation to comply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we say --

MR. DONOVAN: In this case, we have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this man goes to jail 

for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.

 MR. DONOVAN: If that was the nature of the 

dispute that the United -- that is, of course, not the 

nature of the dispute that the United States --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if they say --

MR. DONOVAN: But if he --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- he goes to jail for no 

time at all? They say that the remedy for these 

violations, in order to deter future violations, should 

be that the charges should be dismissed and any future 

prosecution should be barred. Would that be

automatically binding?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, the question is, is it 

binding in the first instance because the -- there's an 

obligation to comply? That doesn't say anything about, 

for example, Congress's ability to repudiate that 

obligation to comply, just like it has the obligation --

the authority as a last-in-time rule, pursuant to the 

last-in-time rule, to repudiate any treaty obligation. 

But the framers wanted treaties to be enforced in the 

first instance when they were susceptible of judicial 

enforcement, and if the ICJ renders a judgment pursuant 

to our treaty obligation to submit disputes, that is of 

a nature to be judicially enforced, then the Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the answer to --

MR. DONOVAN: -- would be exercising --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the answer to 

either my or Justice Stevens's hypothetical then, yes, 

we do have to enforce an ICJ judgment of that sort?

 MR. DONOVAN: You would enforce an ICJ 

judgment that did in fact -- that was of a nature to be 

enforced in -- in a judicial proceeding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is not of a nature to 

be enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas. Texas 

has procedural rules that disable the Texas court from

complying with the ICJ judgment here. Are you telling 

me that the ICJ judgment empowers either Federal or 

State courts to do things which -- which their laws do 

not permit them to do?

 MR. DONOVAN: If the -- both the President's 

determination and the Article 94 obligation which result 

in the Avena judgment are Federal law. The President's 

determination pursuant to his State court authority and 

Article II authority and the -- and the Avena judgment 

pursuant to the treaty --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and do you know of 

any other Federal law that -- that interferes in the --

in the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them 

as to what -- what procedures they have to have?

 MR. DONOVAN: The Court has -- when there's 

a Federal procedural rule that preempts a State 

procedural rule, the Court allows that to preempt as a 

Federal rule all the time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Really?

 MR. DONOVAN: That's a function of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where? I don't know what 

you're talking about unless you're talking about 

constitutional requirements. Of course, those are 

binding on the States. But you're saying that the 

Federal Government can prescribe State court procedures

and authorize State courts to do things which -- which 

the State government does not authorize them to do?

 MR. DONOVAN: The Federal Government can 

prescribe rules of decision that preempt Federal rules 

and require the cases that other -- that would not 

otherwise be heard to be heard. That's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- you're --

as I understand it, in order for you to prevail on that 

point, the only -- the only conclusion that has to be 

drawn, as I understand it, is that the Texas courts have 

subject matter jurisdiction of this kind of -- of order, 

and that the bar that Texas is asserting is simply, in 

effect, a procedural bar; and, therefore, in order for 

this Federal rule to preempt the State bar is not to 

give the State courts jurisdiction they don't have, but 

to remove a bar to the exercise of their jurisdiction 

that State law, absent preemption, would impose; is that 

correct?

 MR. DONOVAN: That's correct. That's right. 

It removes a bar by preempting that bar.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You just --

MR. DONOVAN: If I may --

JUSTICE ALITO: You just said that the Avena 

decision is Federal law. How is the -- how is the Avena 

decision itself a Federal law?

MR. DONOVAN: Well, the Avena decision --

JUSTICE ALITO: It's not a statute. It's 

not the Constitution. It's not a statute. It's not 

itself a treaty.

 MR. DONOVAN: The Avena decision has the 

force of Federal law, either by virture of the treaty 

obligation to comply with it under Article 94-1, or the 

President's determination under his Article II authority 

to require -- to determine that the United States should 

comply. And by either one of those vehicles, in effect 

the judgment becomes the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the --

MR. DONOVAN: -- the instrument by which it 

must be complied with.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't mention the 

Optional Protocol which is -- is where the United States 

gave its promise. It voluntarily accepted this 

jurisdiction. It didn't have to.

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, that's right. It's the 

combined force of the Optional Protocol and the UN 

Charter and ICJ statute.

If the Avena judgment is binding as Federal 

law, is it your position, though, that the -- this Court 

has no authority to review the content of that Federal 

law -- the judgment? Our choice is simply enforce it?

 MR. DONOVAN: The relevant Federal law here 

is the Federal law that says that the United States will 

comply pursuant to its voluntary choice to submit 

these -- this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have no --

MR. DONOVAN: I'm sorry -- to the ICJ.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have no authority 

to review the judgment itself, even though the judgment 

will have the effect as Federal law of preempting the 

State law in this instance?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, you are in effect 

applying Federal law in the form of the obligation to 

comply. That's different than applying the Vienna 

Convention --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me, but your 

position is not that we are applying the obligation to 

comply, because we interpreted that in Sanchez-Llamas 

and came to the exact same conclusion as the ICG here. 

What you're saying is it's different here because the 

operative law is the judgment.

 MR. DONOVAN: The operative -- it's

different because on the one hand, in Sanchez-Llamoas, 

this Court was interpreting the underlying obligation 

under the treaty. That is, the immediately applicable 

instrument. But, as with respect to any judgment, a 

court's -- and this Court has affirmed with respect to 

international adjudications, that it will enforce an 

international adjudication.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can this court interpret 

the meaning of the Avena judgment if it's ambiguous? 

For instance, it said that a number of Mexico nationals 

have not received a hearing. It didn't say all of them. 

And I have a problem, incidentally, because I think 

Medellin did receive all the hearing that he's entitled 

to under the judgment anyway.

 Can we interpret the judgment in that 

respect if it's ambiguous, not clear?

 MR. DONOVAN: Wel, in this case, the court 

would be -- a court applying the Avena judgment either 

by virtue of the Optional Protocol in 94-1 and the 

President's determination would be in effect applying 

Federal law. We think the judgments --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we interpret the 

judgment?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, to the extent necessary 

to apply Federal law in the form of a judgment --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And can the President 

displace our authority to do that?

 MR. DONOVAN: The President would not 

displace the Court's authority to interpret a judgment, 

no. What the President has said is that the judgment 

shall be enforced. That's an independent source of 

Federal law under his Article II --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he determines 

that the judgment should not be enforced and this Court 

determines, based on our construction of the treaty and 

the judgment that it should be enforced, which 

determination controls?

 MR. DONOVAN: This Court -- to the extent 

that this is Federal law, this Court has the ultimate 

authority to determine whether or not it should be 

complied with. And this Court -- the framers have made 

treaties supreme Federal law specification so they could 

be judicially enforceable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we have the 

authority to determine whether the treaty should be 

complied with in the face of a presidential 

determination, why don't we have the independent 

authority to determine whether or not it should be 

complied with at a matter of Federal law without regard 

to the President's determination?

MR. DONOVAN: You have two separate and 

independent sources of authority here. Without the 

President's determination, this Court pursuant to the 

mandate in the Supremacy Clause would apply the treaty 

obligation to comply with the judgment because the 

nature of the judgment is such to be enforced in a court 

of justice. In this instance, you have an entirely 

independent source of authority because the President in 

the exercise of his Article II authority has determined 

that it's in the paramount interest of the United States 

to comply. That becomes a second object.

 Of course, it would be a judicial function 

to interpret the -- interpret those obligations, 

interpret what the President meant. But in this case 

it's crystal clear. The Avena judgment is mandatory and 

prospective. The President is determined that it be 

enforced, and that would be the result even had the 

President not acted pursuant to the mandate of the 

Supremacy Clause, which makes treatise enforceable 

Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Donovan. We'll give you 5 minutes for your 

rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS

 AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree with the 

last statement.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think I do agree 

with that and there's a couple of the issues here where 

we take a slightly different take. Obviously we feel 

the President's determination here that we will comply 

with the Avena judgment is a critical element in why 

there's an enforceable obligation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We would have no --

according to you, we would have no obligation to enforce 

this judgment but for the President's action?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice 

Scalia. Now, obviously, Mr. Donovan and his clients 

could get here and ask you to enforce the judgment of it 

own force without the President's determination and that 

would ultimately be a question for this Court. We of 

course --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We could decide to go back, 

too. But would we have any authority to do it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I hope that you wouldn't 

and we would be up here saying don't, because if you

look at Article 94 of the UN Charter as a whole, it has 

two components and I think it makes clear why the 

President's intervening role here is important. 94-1 

says that we undertake to comply with our obligations, 

with our obligations to comply with the judgment. But 

94-2 says what happens when a country doesn't do that. 

It's a matter for the Security Council. And that, of 

course, I think necessarily implies that countries do 

retain the option to put themselves out of compliance 

with an International Court of Justice judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would take an 

action by somebody in the country.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, Justice Ginsburg, 

and I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here that hasn't -- that 

hasn't happened. 94 would never be triggered because we 

haven't said we're breaking our promise, we're not going 

to comply.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, and that's why 

we're supporting Mr. Donovan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. In order to 

get it to the Security Council, you have to take some 

affirmative action not to comply? It's just not enough 

simply not to comply?

or a commission I don't think is the point, Justice 

Scalia. My point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was tte 

point of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been 

no decision not to comply. Don't you need an 

affirmative decision to comply?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I didn't take that to mean 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you don't -- if you 

don't comply, you don't comply. But we -- certainly not 

-- in that situation here, the President said the United 

States agreed that it would submit to the binding 

jurisdiction for one case only, and we are bound by that 

judgment and I'm going to enforce it.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree, i think the 

omission-commission --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know you agree, but it 

depends on whether it's up to the President to make that 

call. Usually when we have treaties that are not self-

enforcing the judgment of whether that international law 

obligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for 

the Congress.

 Congress passes a law to enforce the treaty, 

and you're telling us that, well, we don't need the 

Congress; the President can make a domestic law by

writing a memo to his attorney general.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, let 

me take that in turn. Let me just first close the 

discussion of what happened here by saying the reason I 

think the commission-omission distinction doesn't have 

much purchase here is because the President did make a 

determination that we would comply. And I think if you 

ask the question who makes the determination as to 

whether we're going to default on our international law 

obligations or comply, especially vis-a-vis the UN, the 

answer to that question is quite clear: It's the 

President, and Congress has acquiesced in that with the 

UN Participation act at 22 U.S.C. 287.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the 

President had said, we're going to comply with this 

judgment, but in a different way than the ICJ 

determined. We're going to comply by examining in each 

case whether there's already been a determination of 

prejudice, and if there has then there's no further 

review, but if there hasn't then there'll be further 

review. Would that be binding as a matter of Federal 

law?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It depends exactly what 

form that would take. I think part of the problem --

I'm stumbling with that question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same as a 

memorandum just like -- it's a memorandum just like the 

one we have here.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And what does it suggest 

that is supposed to be done with tne end product of that 

determination?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says that if there 

has already been -- the State courts are to determine if 

there's already been a determination of prejudice in the 

case, and if there has there's to be no further review. 

But if they determine there hasn't, there is to be 

further review. That's different than the ICJ's 

judgment, which suggests there should be a new 

determination in every case.

 Is that -- does that have the same status as 

the memorandum here?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I would say that it 

wouldn't -- I would say that it wouldn't, as you 

suggest, not fully comply and not fully discharge with 

our obligation.

 But the extent to which we did and purported 

to be doing that under compliance with the judgment, it 

would have the same force as providing the rule of 

decision, which, to get back to Justice Scalia's 

question, especially in a context like this, is not so

unprecedented. It is not materially different from when 

the President supplies the rule of decision in the 

pre-FSIA practice by making a determination, binding on 

the courts State and Federal, that somebody has 

sovereign immunity.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree with you, would 

the effect be that the President can take any treaty 

that is ratified on the understanding that it's not 

self-executing and execute the treaty and give it force 

under domestic law?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Alito, I don't 

think the theory would sweep that broadly, and I think 

that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would it not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, first of all, 

there's obviously a limiting principle in our theory, 

which is to say that the President can't take any action 

pursuant to this which is inconsistent with other 

constitutional obligations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he can -- he can 

take action that's inconsistent with the determination 

of Federal law by this Court?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

don't think that's true.

determined in Sanchez-Llamas that the treaty did not 

mean what the ICJ said it means in this case.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right as to 

the Vienna Convention. But this case raises a question, 

not about the proper interpretation of the Vienna 

Convention, because as you remember we were four-square 

with this Court on its interpretation of the Vienna 

Convention in Sanchez-Llamas. The relevant treaties 

here the Optional Protocol and the UN Charter, and the 

question here is not the force of -- of the Avena 

judgment as precedent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you doubt that 

the judgment here is based on a determination of the 

Vienna Convention that's exactly the opposite of what we 

determined last year?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No doubt at all, Mr. Chief 

Justice. And we think with respect to anyone but the 51 

individuals that are covered by the judgment that of 

course this Court has the final word on the 

interpretation of the Vienna Convention.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They were not 

parties to it. What do you mean, "covered by the 

judgment?" Is this some -- some new kind of new kind of 

jurisdiction? If you're named in a suit by somebody 

else, you somehow acquire rights under that suit? I

don't know of any such principle.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: These people were not 

parties to the -- the countries were parties to the 

judgment.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Of course the countries 

were parties, but these 51 individuals' claims were 

specifically adjudicated. Why were they specifically 

adjudicate? Because they were effectively -- the claims 

were espoused by the Mexican Government. That system --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General, can we just 

clarify something which I think is important? Justice 

Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing. The 

State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention 

itself told Congress very clearly: You don't have to do 

anything; this is self-executing. And then the protocol 

says: We the United States agree to accept the 

jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases. 

And Congress ratified that, too. So I don't think that 

self-executing has anything to do with this case.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that reflects that self-executing is one of those 

words that people use to cover a lot of different 

meanings; and I think in its most correct sense, you're 

right to say that the Vienna Convention is

self-executing.

 So there didn't have to be legislation 

before Texas and its local officials were obligated to 

provide notice in this case; and of course, it's their 

default on that treat obligation by the State and local 

officials that has us in this predicament in the first 

place.

 Now, there's another meaning of 

"self-executing", or maybe it's a misuse of the term, to 

say whether it gives rise to individually enforceable 

rights in court without more. And we do take the 

position that if the President had done nothing, and 

certainly if the President had said we're not going to 

comply, we're going to respond to this ICJ judgment the 

way we did with the Nicaragua judgment, we don't think 

that this judgment would be enforceable as of its own 

terms.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Nicaragua the 

United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ 

had no jurisdiction over the case. So the absence of 

jurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation, 

even within the United States, to give full faith and 

credit. If the court had no jurisdiction, another State 

doesn't have to give full faith and credit. But if it 

does have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in.

GENERAL CLEMENT: That's absolutely right, 

and that gets back to the basic principle of reviewing 

foreign judgments; and it's not that this Court is 

disabled from its judicial role. It's just the judicial 

role here is not a straight-up question of the 

interpretation of the Vienna Convention. It's a 

question of what effect to give the judgment that's been 

effectively validated by the executive branch. And 

there's two things --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You're arguing it's just 

the normal choice of law problem, that even though the 

judgment's clearly wrong on the matter of international 

law, if the court had judgment -- had jurisdiction to 

enter the judgment, we must treat it as binding?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's -- that's right, 

Justice Stevens. As Justice Ginsburg put it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's provided that we 

regard these individuals as though they're tantamount to 

the parties to the judgment itself.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's right, and 

certainly our obligation under that judgment as the 

executive branch sees it is to these 51 individuals as 

their claims have been espoused by --

reached the contrary conclusion, a hypothetical we put

earlier. Supposed the President had told Texas, do not 

follow this judgment?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Then I'd be on that side 

of the podium, Your Honor. I mean, we would take the 

position that the President's authority here is, in his 

view of this, is a necessary step; and that seems to be 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree that we should 

give that determination great weight, but that's 

something quite different from saying that he can 

displace the authority of this Court on that issue of 

law.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but the -- the 

President can't displace the role of this Court. It's 

just that the role of this Court in a situation where 

there's been a judgment and the executive branch has 

viewed that judgment as something we should comply with, 

then the role of this Court is limited to deciding 

whether there was jurisdiction to issue that judgment in 

the first place; and then the secondary role of this 

Court would to be to say, does the rule of law embodied 

by that judgment violate the Constitution. And that's 

why the answer to the Chief Justice's original 

hypothetical, about a sentence to 5 years for guards 

that had no notice -- that's a different case.

But here there's no colorable argument that 

the -- that the judgment here and what's embodied in it 

lies outside the power of the Federal Government as a 

whole to adjudicate and to put as an obligation on the 

States.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Chief Justice, may I 

ask a further - may I ask a further question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me try one other 

variation to make sure that I understand your argument. 

What if the President of the United States had said this 

judgment, the Avena judgment, will not be enforced, and 

this Court interpreted the Avena judgment as binding, as 

providing a rule of decision and a rule of decision 

which was entitled to respect by Texas?

 Would this Court's authority to make that 

declaration and issue a judgment to that effect be 

displaced by the President's determination that it would 

not be that the Avena judgment would not be enforced?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Of course not, Justice 

Souter. That would just be like cases that 

unfortunately happen, where we would take a position 

that the judgment on its own is not binding and you 

would reject that position and that would be the law of 

the land.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: We don't suggest that we 

wouldn't comply with a judgment of this Court, accepting 

Mr. Donovan's first theory that the President's role 

here is unimportant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- but we do think, we 

stick to our view that the President's role here makes 

this an easier case and is in our view dispositive.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it does follow then 

from what you've said that if we take exactly the 

position that I outlined in my hypo, we could avoid the 

entire question of presidential authority.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You could. I think 

another route, of course, that would be available to you 

is to simply say: Here we have a judgment and we have 

the President effectively espousing the judgment, and in 

those cases we don't have to worry about what would 

happen if we didn't have one or the other.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's in effect a judicial 

version of one of the variants in Justice Jackson's hypo 

in the Steel case --

President and Congress; we're talking about the

President and the Court.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The President espousing the 

judgment -- Texas takes the position that this 

memorandum has -- has no legal effect; it's a memorandum 

from the President to the -- to his attorney general. 

It's not a directive to the States. In fact, it even 

refers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which 

suggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative, 

don't do it if you don't want to be cooperative.

 What is your response to that? And would it 

be enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to 

himself saying that, I think this is the way that the --

that the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced? He 

doesn't have to tell Texas. He can just tell his 

attorney general?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

think there's two questions there. I'd like to try to 

answer them both. One is, what degree of formality is 

required? And we would say that if you look to 

historical practice, this is not something where you a 

need a high degree of formality. So look to the 

executive agreement that this case -- this Court gave 

its positive effect to in Belmont and Pink. It was an

exchange of diplomatic letters, nothing more. Look to 

the executive determination that this Court give 

dispositive effect to, dismissed the lawsuit completely 

in Ex Parte Peru. It was a letter from the 

undersecretary of state to the attorney general.

 Going back to the very beginnings of the 

nation, look at the extradition of Thomas Nash. What 

was the form of the President's determination we would 

extradite him? A letter from the secretary of state to 

Judge Bee in South Carolina.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In none of those 

cases were we talking about a determination contrary to 

a legal determination by this Court concerning the scope 

of powers under the treaty.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in Nash he was being 

held under Federal custody. So Nash is just 

inapplicable here.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think Nash 

is inapplicable, Justice Kennedy; I think it is on all 

fours.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, Nash is just a 

wonderful speech by Marshall anyway; it's not an 

opinion.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But it is a wonderful

speech, and I really do think you should take a look at 

that speech. If you want to find it, it's actually 

appended to volume 18 of the U.S. Reports. And I think 

you should look at that speech before rejecting our 

position here, because it really is on all fours in that 

there you had a treaty obligation duly approved by the 

Senate, and there was a question: Do we need an act of 

Congress before the executive can extradite somebody? 

And Marshall I think put the law exactly right in that 

case when he said: Sure, Congress can make a 

determination and if it does, that's the end of matter; 

but absent the congressional determination, the 

President has the authority to extradite Nash.

 Now, that's a situation where somebody's 

personal liberty was at stake. So I would say that in 

some respects it's a fortiori that in this case what's 

at issue is simply recognizing that there's binding 

Federal law here, that I think if the Texas court had 

recognized that it was binding Federal law, it would 

have applied under their own State procedural default 

law.

 Now, just to finish up, and then I will sit 

down, there's a second part of your question, Justice 

Scalia, which was addressed to what does the reference 

to comity mean. Obviously, from the very beginning in

this case we have taken the position in this Court that 

the President's memorandum directs the State courts, in 

its words, to give effect to the Avena judgment -- not 

decide whether you want to give it effect based on your 

State law of comity, but give effect to the judgment.

 I think if you actually look at the law of 

comity, one of the things that it talks about is comity 

is really what the courts should do in the absence of a 

controlling view from one of the political branches. 

Here the President has made clear, it's clear to me what 

the answer is applying comity, which would be to give 

effect to the judgment.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

 Mr. Cruz, by my count we'll give you an

 ORAL ARGUMENT of R. TED CRUZ,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The entirety of the United States's argument 

is predicated on the idea that the President's 

two-paragraph memorandum is in and of itself binding 

Federal law.

the argument, but your brother the Solicitor General has 

conceded that if we take the position in this case that 

there is a -- a rule of decision that should be 

respected in this Court and, hence, the subject of a 

judgment to Texas that, among other things, would 

suspend Texas's procedural bar law -- that that would 

obviate the question of presidential power.

 MR. CRUZ: There's no doubt, if the Court 

decided it on the ground that Avena was a binding 

judgment, the President's order would be unnecessary.

 I would note the United States strenuously 

disagrees with that proposition. And, indeed, the 

United States explicitly disclaims these treaties as the 

source of his authority; in fact, expressly agrees with 

this Court's decision in Sanchez-Llamas.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you could spend a 

minute explaining that, because, as I read the 

Constitution, it says all treaties made, or which shall 

be made, under the authority of the United States shall 

be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every 

State -- I guess it means including Texas --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- shall be bound thereby, 

anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the 

contrary notwithstanding.

Now, as I understand it, the United States 

entered into a treaty. That treaty said we will follow 

the interpretations and the judgments of the 

International Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna 

Convention.

 And that Court did make a judgment in that 

respect, in respect to this client, and it said: Our 

judgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States, 

must redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether, 

in deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's 

a procedural default, full account is taken of the 

importance of the Vienna rights. That's what we're 

talking about.

 It's a judgment of the court. The United 

States has promised to follow that judgment of the 

court. The Constitution says, since it promised by 

treaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States.

 That may be simple-minded, but I'd like to 

hear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is 

-- chain of law.

 MR. CRUZ: Certainly, Justice Breyer. 

Texas, of course, does not dispute that the 

Constitution, laws, and treaties are the supreme law of 

the land. And Texas statutes must give way to any of 

these three.

The President's memorandum is none of those 

three.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I was not talking --

MR. CRUZ: And, with respect --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- about the President's 

memorandum at the moment. And to be -- to disclose 

fully what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that maybe if a 

president disagreed in such a thing, some kind of a 

question -- I'm not sure what -- would be presented.

 But whatever "what," I don't worry about 

that "what" here, because the President, too, agrees.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the -- the answer 

to your question is the Avena decision is not a judgment 

in the sense we recognize judgment in U.S. courts for 

six separate reasons.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, forget whether we 

recognize it this way as a judgment. I'm saying we 

promised in the treaty to follow that thing. Call it 

whatever name you want. We promised to follow that 

thing, which I have in front of me -- excerpts of which 

-- called an Avena something. And we know what that 

says. I'm just looking to see what they call it. They 

call it -- well, you tell me what they call it. They 

call it -- it is not called the word "judgment." It's 

called: "The appropriate reparation in this case

consists of the obligation of the United States to" --

and then they listed it.

 So I take it we have promised to carry out 

that obligation by treaty.

 MR. CRUZ: Except that when the Senate 

ratified the Optional Protocol, it made clear that the 

Optional Protocol was not self-executing. Indeed, a 

point Mr. Donovan made in his argument --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are the words that the 

Senate said? Because, when you say "self-executing," 

the easiest way for me to understand that is the 

Constitution means what it says.

 But there happened to be a few instances 

where the nature of the obligation or the intent of the 

party makes it very difficult to enforce it as a binding 

judgment of a court. That is not this case.

 MR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has made clear 

for 200 years the Senate can ratify a treaty and yet 

leave it not self-executing in the sense that it is not 

enforceable in U.S. domestic courts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, and so if they did 

that, now, will you quote the words or give me the 

reference where the Senate said: Although we entered 

into this and although we ratify it, we're not going to 

do it --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless you --

MR. CRUZ: The text of the treaty, itself, 

is the first place to look. The text of Article 94 of 

the UN Charter provides that the remedy is that the 

party may have recourse to the Security Council.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's after there's a 

breach, but we -- let's stick to the protocol, the 

Optional Protocol -- optional. The protocol says:

 We accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the 

ICJ. "Jurisdiction" means power. We agree that in 

cases of this character, Vienna Convention violation 

cases, we submit to the jurisdiction of X tribunal, the 

ICJ.

 What is there that needs execution about 

that? Congress said yes, the United States, the 

Executive Branch of the United States decides that it's 

a good idea to submit to the -- to the jurisdiction of 

the ICJ. We ratify that.

 And I don't see anything left for Congress 

to do. It said the United States can submit to the 

jurisdiction of the ICJ.

 MR. CRUZ: "Jurisdiction" in that sense is 

not "jurisdiction" in the sense of a U.S. court. 

Rather, it is an international obligation that is to be

resolved through political and diplomatic avenues. And 

the best example of that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It just means we agree that 

the case can go before the court.

 MR. CRUZ: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And we will be a party 

before the court. Isn't there some doubt whether the --

the Senate and the President, together, can -- can take 

away from this Court the power and responsibility to 

decide what the treaty obligations of the United States 

are?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there some problem 

there?

 MR. CRUZ: I would go further than some 

doubt, and I would say that if the treaty purported to 

give the authority to make binding adujudications of 

Federal law to any tribunal other than this Court, that 

it would violate Article III of the Constitution.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then, are you 

saying there are -- there are 112, I believe, treaties 

in which we've entered into promises that we're going to 

follow what an international tribunal said. Somebody 

looked up, I saw on the Internet, that at this moment 

there are approximately 116 regulatory entities in the

world where we've entered, or others have entered into, 

regimes, where there are various adjudicatory tribunals 

of different kinds, mostly commercial, that bind us.

 And is your view: All of these thousands, 

perhaps, or hundreds, anyway, of treaties are unlawful, 

and that our promises are not enforceable, because 

there's a constitutional question?

 MR. CRUZ: There are hundreds of treaty 

obligations that this nation is committed to that are 

not self-executing, that don't immediately have force --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. I'm thinking that 

are self- executing. I'm thinking that there are --

like WTO, NAFTA. We can go down a long list of 

instances where the United States has promised to follow 

the decisions of tribunals that are not Article III 

courts and to put them into effect at once.

 MR. CRUZ: If -- if --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I wonder, without 

further ado, now, are you saying that all those are 

unconstitutional?

 MR. CRUZ: In -- in those instances --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Yes" or "no"? I'd 

appreciate a "yes" or "no" answer.

MR. CRUZ: In those instances, the bodies in 

question are not making definitive interpretations of 

what Federal law is. The best illustration of this is 

the example Mr. Donovan used in his opening argument 

where he said, if the ICJ said to the United States 

cease hostilities, that would be directed to the 

President.

 Now, under Mr. Donovan's argument, that's a 

clear directive. The United States is bound by treaty, 

and apparently the Federal courts could order the 

President to cease hostilities if that was the 

instruction of the ICJ.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. What I don't 

understand about this is that I thought that the ICJ in 

this case interpreted the treaty. That's not Federal 

law. That's the treaty. And it said that the treaty --

MR. CRUZ: The treaty is Federal law, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, then I don't understand 

you because the WTO interprets a treaty. It interprets 

a treaty that binds the United States, just like the ICJ 

is interpreting a treaty that binds the United States. 

So what's the difference?

Department at the time it was introduced, the Senate, 

and every member of the Senate who discussed it, 

understood that the decisions of the ICJ would not have 

binding effect in U.S. courts. And that is identical to 

the understanding of every single nation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what you are saying --

and this has been the law --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question, 

please?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Go ahead.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's critical to me to 

understand the effect of the judgment, and you said 

there are six reasons why it's not an ordinary judgment. 

I really would like to hear what those reasons are 

without interruption from all of my colleagues.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. CRUZ: I would be happy to provide 

those, Justice Stevens. The first reason is because the 

Optional Protocol is not self-executing, so it does not 

have force in United States courts.

 The second reason is, if it was a binding 

judgment, that would violate Article III. It would give 

to a tribunal other than this Court the authority to 

determine Federal law.

 The third reason is in Sanchez-Llamas a

majority of this Court rejected this argument and 

provided explicitly, quote, "nothing in the structure or 

purpose of the ICJ suggests that its interpretations 

were intended to be conclusive on our courts.

 The fourth reason is the parties in Avena 

were the United States and Mexico. Neither is a party 

to this proceeding. The argument as to why it is 

binding in this case is that Texas is vicariously part 

of the United States. That was equally true of Oregon 

in Sanchez-Llamas. In both cases, there's one State who 

is in some sense one of the parties.

 The fifth reason is the Breard case was in 

many senses equally a judgment, in that you had the ICJ 

issuing an order to this Court concerning Breard, 

concerning his specific case, to stop his execution, and 

this Court concluded that that could not trump U.S. law.

 And the sixth and final reason that it is 

not a judgment is to treat it as a binding judgment 

would be to cut out the President's authority not to 

comply. Everyone agrees, for example in the Nicaragua 

case, that the President retains the authority to say 

no, we're not going to comply.

 Which is why the entire purpose of this 

adjudication is not to resolve something finally in a 

court of law, but it is rather a diplomatic measure,

much as -- much like when the United States sued Iran 

during the hostage crisis. We didn't believe the 

Ayatollah was going to listen to the ICJ and suddenly 

let the hostages go. We didn't -- we didn't expect that 

Iranian courts would give force to it, but it was 

helpful diplomatically to bring it to that tribunal to 

then put international pressure. That --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then this is consistent 

with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in 

your answer, that for 200 years we have had some 

treaties that are very important, but they're not 

self-executing; their violation may put us in violation 

of international law; but it is for us to determine how 

we are going to comply with the international 

obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of 

the State to comply with that law because it's not 

self-executing.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, that is exactly 

correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: At some point I think in 

the course of your argument, we may get back to whether 

the Vienna Convention itself is or is not 

self-executing. I think the Solicitor General was 

correct in saying that that's a difficult word. I think 

it is self-executing in that the State has to comply

with it.

 I'm not sure that it is self-executing in 

that the State has to accept whatever procedural 

framework the foreign national demands.

 MR. CRUZ: I would agree with the 

characterization you suggest, which is that the Vienna 

Convention was self-executing in the sense that it 

didn't require legislation to go into effect, but it was 

not self-executing in the sense that it provided 

judicially cognizable rights.

 But let me add a caveat to that, which is in 

both Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, this Court assumed the 

Vienna Convention created individual rights, and 

although Texas maintains that it did not create 

individual rights and the United States maintains that 

it did not create individual rights, we don't have to 

win on that proposition to prevail in this case. Even 

assuming it created individual rights in this case, 

Medellin defaulted on that claim and this Court held 

with Sanchez-Llamas that procedural default is 

consistent with the treaty.

 And the real question here in this case, 

particularly with respect to the President's order, is 

whether the Optional Protocol is self-executing, the 

decision of the Avena court, or, as a subsequent matter,

whether the President has some sort of independent 

authority to make Federal law.

 And in this respect --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I still -- I would 

like to get back to that Optional Protocol. It -- was 

it submission to jurisdiction? My understanding is that 

any two parties that can agree, can have a formed 

selection clause, can agree that we accept the authority 

of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if 

you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound 

to follow its decisions. And that that seems to be 

understood in the world community because, is it not so 

that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and 

Iran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the 

nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that 

tribunal?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that is correct 

as a political and diplomatic matter, but in my judgment 

it speaks volumes that of the 166 nations that signed on 

to the Vienna Convention and of the 50 nations that 

signed on to the Optional Protocol, zero -- not a single 

nation -- treats ICJ judgments as binding in their 

domestic courts.

 What Petitioners are arguing here is for an 

interpretation of this treaty that no other nation

gives. And in fact, if I found myself in the nation of 

Mexico and arrested without consular notification, I 

could not raise this claim in Mexico. The Mexican 

courts would not treat it as a defense to my criminal 

prosecution.

 And so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have a case that 

says that? A Mexican case that says that?

 MR. CRUZ: I do not have a case that says 

that, but neither Petitioner nor their many amici have 

been able to point to a single instance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe it hasn't come up.

 MR. CRUZ: Given that these treaties are 

four decades old, that that speaks volumes that no -- no 

nation has accorded binding force to ICJ --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe these other nations 

have an inquisitorial system where an investigating 

judge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the 

dossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution 

give it such weight as it's entitled to.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice --

happen?

peculiar nature of this. Procedural default only --

JUSTICE BREYER: In an --

MR. CRUZ: -- matters in system like the 

United States' where habeas allows a second bite at the 

apple. Most other countries don't allow criminal 

defendants to relitigate criminal matters, in which case 

procedural default matters. The other countries simply 

deny it altogether.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course it matters. But 

the -- of course it matters. That's why when I read the 

-- the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not 

telling you to set aside a procedural default rule. 

What they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of 

the United States' own choosing, review and 

reconsideration of the convictions and sentences by 

taking account of the violation of rights.

 And throughout they ask -- when you decided 

whether the person was really prejudiced, when you 

decided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights, 

at that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he 

might not have raised them was because he knew nothing 

about them and his lawyer knew nothing about them, 

because nobody ever told either about them? In which 

case there might be a causal connection.

 As I read it, the ICJ left all that up to

you but just asked you, please, look at it again having 

read our opinion and keeping this in mind.

 MR. CRUZ: But the ICJ's decision -- I think 

your question goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question 

about the effect of an ICJ decision.

 The legal -- legal adviser to the State 

Department told the Senate, when it was ratifying the UN 

Charter, that decisions of the ICJ are "a moral 

obligation" and there is "no provision" for the 

enforcement of such decisions. And one fascinating 

example of this is the entire debate over the Connally 

Amendment. One can look in the entire course of 

legislative history, and it's an argument back and forth 

about whether it is wise to require the United States to 

cast a veto in the Security Council over an attempt to 

enforce an ICJ. And not a single senator of the entire 

U.S. Senate suggested the proposition that ICJ decisions 

might be independently enforceable. Nobody discussing 

that understood it that way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, there is a 

constitutional problem, is there not, if they are 

automatically enforceable?

 MR. CRUZ: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is conferring upon the 

ICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United

States treaty which is United States law.

 MR. CRUZ: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm rather jealous of that 

power.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it belongs in this 

Court. And when you have a non-self-executing treaty, 

there is no problem.

 It becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the 

House pass a law which the president -- it doesn't 

become U.S. law because the President writes a 

memorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become 

U.S. law when a law is enacted.

 MR. CRUZ: And that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That solves the 

constitutional problem, but in the situation we're 

talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can 

allow some international court to decide what is the 

responsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of 

the United States law.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, that's absolutely 

correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And how does the WTO 

differ?

JUSTICE BREYER: How does the WTO and NAFTA 

and all our trade agreements differ?

 MR. CRUZ: The WTO and NAFTA -- I mean NAFTA 

is not a treaty. It's a congressional agreement, but it 

is also adjudicating specific factual questions that 

deal with the application of facts to a particular 

circumstance. It's not interpreting the treaty and 

purporting to bind the United States on this is what the 

underlying Federal law means.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the United States 

apparently accepts the verdict of those --

MR. CRUZ: Right. Right. And it could 

choose not to.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have three different 

things that you have to tell us about today: That the 

President's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and -- and 

the Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the 

Vienna Convention itself.

 And the only question I have that I need 

your help with is as to the last, and I hope that it 

doesn't interrupt the train of your argument.

 I think the ICJ -- pardon me, the Vienna 

Convention is self-executing, in that it requires the 

States to conform to the consular notification 

provision.

MR. CRUZ: And we don't disagree with that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a judge 

who has control over a defendant who's being held in 

custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to 

see my -- my foreign counsel. The judge says no. Can 

you mandate that -- assuming State procedures allow him 

in, couldn't you mandate that judge to require him to 

allow the notification to take place?

 MR. CRUZ: The consequence of the argument 

that it doesn't create individual rights would mean that 

that individual defendant could not raise it in that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You see where I'm going?

 MR. CRUZ: Yes.

 And so in that circumstance, it would mean, 

if a judge declined to comply with that obligation, the 

individual defendant would not have an appealable legal 

error.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I thought he did, would 

I still have to rule against you?

 MR. CRUZ: No, not at all. In fact, just as 

this Court did in Breard and Sanchez-Llamas, it assumes 

that the Vienna Convention created individual rights. 

And so we don't need to prevail on that to reach the 

identical outcome. Because even assuming we are 

incorrect concerning individual rights, the

Sanchez-Llamas holding is that procedural default 

respects those rights just as fully as it respects 

constitutional rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could I make a distinction 

between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my 

hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework 

be altered? Isn't there a distinction between those two 

cases, do you think?

 MR. CRUZ: I think that's right. I think 

also in your hypothetical, your hypothetical assumes a -

a deliberate violation of the law which no one suggests 

here rather than inadvertence. And inadvertence 

complied with, as you suggested earlier, no prejudice 

whatever so. And there has -- both the Federal and 

State courts that looked at this concluded that there 

was no even arguable prejudice from the violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cruz --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cruz, could I go back 

to your discussion of whether this is a judgment or not? 

It seems to me some of your reasons actually go to 

whether the -- whether it was a correct interpretation 

of the treaty. And if it were a judgment, would you 

agree that this Court would have to accept it, even if 

this Court disagreed with its legal analysis?

MR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I would not, 

because I do not believe consistent with Article III 

this Court's authority can be given away by treaty.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How is it given away to a 

treaty if it just says one State court must honor a 

judgment of a sister State even if it thinks it's dead 

wrong? Is it giving away its judicial authority by 

obeying the Full Faith and Credit Clause?

 MR. CRUZ: That is provided by the 

Constitution. And in this instance, giving any other 

entity, the authority to make a conclusive determination 

of Federal law, that goes to the heart of the Article 

III power.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that even 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was agreed by 

treaty to give it conclusive effect?

 MR. CRUZ: If the Senate agreed that this 

was self-executing, then you would have the height of 

the Presidency and Congress working together. But even 

in that situation, I would submit as a matter of 

separation of powers, they could not give this Court's 

essential role, under Marbury, to say what the law is to 

another body.

treaty with another country on the mutual recognition 

and enforcement of judgment, because the other country 

might get it wrong, we might disagree with its 

interpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the 

rest of the world, the United States can't get the 

advantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments 

will be respected, and in turn we will respect your 

judgment.

 MR. CRUZ: In enforcing foreign judgments, 

the foreign court is not purporting to make a definitive 

determination of U.S. law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be that if the 

case turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think, 

as many think about the ICJ, that they got that question 

wrong. Still, it's always been if you don't look behind 

the judgment. You say in the next case I'm certainly 

not going to apply that wrong interpretation. But here 

I'm bound by a judgment.

 And that's why I questioned your use -- your 

heavy use of Sanchez-Llamas. I agreed with the court in 

that case because it was a question of interpretation. 

We don't have to agree with the ICJ. We were not faced 

with a decision, a binding adjudication, which we accept 

for that case only. So there's a difference between 

Sanchez-Llamas and this case that you appear not to

recognize in your brief.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, it has been the 

consistent position of the United States for over four 

decades from the day this treaty was ratified that the 

Optional Protocol was not self-executing, was not 

enforceable in U.S. courts. So it is not a judgment 

that has -- were this Court to treat it as -- as a 

judgment, it would be making that treaty self-executing. 

And the power to transform a non- --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you said 

that -- oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill 

or that most ICJ judgments -- ICJ judgments, they're not 

binding but people comply -- nations comply with them as 

a matter of goodwill?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly 

correct. And the President had a number of 

constitutional means at his disposal to comply, had he 

chosen. The -- but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What could -- other 

than -- I mean, the most logical place to have this go 

on is the court that rendered the judgment. It's always 

better for the court that rendered the judgment than 

some foreign court or another State court.

 So what else could the President do? The 

ICJ did say U.S., as a matter of your own choosing. And

the President chose the most logical forum, but what 

else could he have done?

 MR. CRUZ: There are three avenues that the 

President could have chosen that would have been 

constitutional. The first of which he could have gone 

to Congress and proposed a statute amending the AEDPA to 

allow Federal habeas review.

 The second is he could have negotiated a 

treaty, submitted it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's start with the 

first one. Why should this case be in Federal court? 

It's a state judgment that's in question.

 MR. CRUZ: This Court has made clear that 

the Federal Government cannot expand the jurisdiction of 

the State courts. There is a State --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can have the 

Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the 

State what to do? That seems to me practically much 

more of an encroachment on State authority than to say, 

State courts, you do it.

 MR. CRUZ: Well, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or to say Federal 

courts, you do it.

 MR. CRUZ: A corollary --

that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal 

habeas jurisdiction quite improperly. But it happens 

every day, doesn't it?

 MR. CRUZ: It does. And a corollary to this 

is if Congress could pass a statute creating a Federal 

right to review, and that Federal right to review under 

the principles of Testa versus Katt would have to be 

respected in the State court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would be doing the 

review?

 MR. CRUZ: Well, if it were a Federal right 

to review, under Testa versus Katt, both the State and 

Federal courts would give review. Interestingly enough, 

if it were a new Federal right, it would clear the 

jurisdictional bar because the Texas jurisdictional bar 

allows an exception for a new law. So if Congress 

passed a new law that would be jurisdiction to raise --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: A law passed by Congress 

saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?

 MR. CRUZ: A law passed by Congress saying 

in order to give effect to the Avena judgments the 51 

Mexican nationals at issue shall be entitled to review 

and reconsideration of whether there was prejudice from 

the denial of the Vienna Convention. That law would be 

respected equally.

I would suggest that Testa versus Katt, 

which Petitioner uses, is a case which powerfully 

supports Texas, because the principle of Testa versus 

Katt was there is one Federal law that must be applied 

equally in Federal courts and State courts. And the 

State courts are not at liberty to ignore Federal law.

 This is a very curious assertion of 

presidential power. Because the presidential power is 

not directed at the Federal courts. It is directed at 

the State courts,and the State courts alone. And I 

would submit is the only instance I'm aware of, of a 

Federal mandate that falls only on the states, singles 

out the states, and commandeers those judges.

 In over 200 years of our nation's history 

I'm not aware of any other directive from the President 

directly to the State courts and State judges.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So what's absent in your 

view is Congress. You say that all of this could have 

been done --

MR. CRUZ: Absolutely --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and Texas could have 

been ordered, but the President doesn't have the 

authority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,

 MR. CRUZ: And Justice Ginsburg, I think a 

powerful parallel is the decision of this Court last

near in Hamdan. In Hamdan the President was at the 

height of his war powers authority. And nonetheless, 

this Court concluded that he could not act contrary to 

the will of Congress.

 Here his interests are far less than 

prosecuting war, and yet he is asserting the authority 

to go it alone, despite a consistent stream of 

congressional disapproval, both in ratifying these 

treaties and saying they're not self-executing and also 

in passing the AEDPA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The not self-executing in 

the position of the State Department, wasn't there -- in 

the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a 

letter from the current -- the then current legal 

adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's 

binding on all courts in the United States, State and 

Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to 

comply? I think that was sent both to the governor and 

the other officials.

 MR. CRUZ: This letter was sent out to all 

affected States, but it is -- the United States is quite 

candid in what they are doing. The department to its 

credit describes it as "unprecedented," and it goes 

further, if I may read a portion of page 5 of the memo, 

or memo page 6, rather: The President's memorandum is

sufficient to create a binding legal rule.

 The department is not hiding what they're 

arguing. They're not arguing the treaties require it. 

They're not arguing any statutes requiring it. They're 

saying a two-paragraph memorandum from the President to 

a member of the cabinet is binding Federal law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which -- which letter are 

you quoting? Are you quoting --

MR. CRUZ: I'm quoting the United States' 

brief in this proceeding, page 6 of the brief. On page 

5 it also describes the President's power as 

"establishing binding rules of decisions that preempt 

contrary State law."

 If that is correct, there is no reason why 

the President could not have directed his memorandum to 

the Federal district courts or even to this Court, and 

that is an extraordinarily broad power to be asserted on 

behalf of the executive.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Cruz, you have 

frequently emphasized the non-self-executing character 

of the optional protocol.

 Is there any rule, any positive rule in 

existence today either of international law or domestic 

law that precludes this Court from being the 

implementing authority as opposed to the executive or

the executive and the Senate?

 MR. CRUZ: This Court has the final 

authority to determine what Federal law is, and so if 

this Court determines that that's what the treaty 

requires, then that be federal law. Now I would suggest 

that would require overruling --

JUSTICE SOUTER: These treaties including 

the optional protocol.

 MR. CRUZ: In my judgment, if the Court 

reached that conclusion it would be error. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you misunderstood. 

I thought he was asking whether if it is -- assuming it 

is not self-executing, this Court can execute it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. Yeah.

 MR. CRUZ: In my judgment it would be wholly 

illegitimate for the Court to do so.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why?

 MR. CRUZ: Because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the rule -- what is 

the positive rule of international and domestic law that 

precludes it?

 MR. CRUZ: The rule is a constitutional 

rule, that the President makes treaties the Senate 

advises and consents. And the limitation --

We have got the optional protocol. Whatever the

 MR. CRUZ: The limitations the Senate put on 

are it as much a part of the treaty as the treaty 

itself, and the consequences --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- my point is, 

my -- I'm accepting as premise of the question the 

limitation which you assert, i.e., non-self-executing; 

and my question is, may the execution, if you will, be 

made by this Court? Is there an independent rule that 

precludes this Court from that role?

 MR. CRUZ: If this Court did so, in my 

judgment it would be usurping the role of Congress. All 

right? Because the essence of the decision --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't mean to be 

disrespectful of your judgment but what do you base it 

on -- tradition?

 MR. CRUZ: The essence of the decision by 

the Senate to say something is non-self-executing is to 

say if something in this treaty is going to change U.S. 

domestic law, you have to come back to us.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying by -- by 

non-self-executing, they mean you have to come back to 

us? The terms --

that you have to change United States law?

of this Court to change United States law.

 MR. CRUZ: That's precisely correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you assume it is 

self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find 

out -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a 

sense of saying Texas do that over again --

I assume the reason he asked Texas to have 

the hearing is because the ICJ knew -- and I guess maybe 

he knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this 

subject -- as far as I can see; I looked at it, there 

didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their 

finding that there was no prejudice. They said well, he 

had a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot 

of trouble, I think.

 MR. CRUZ: He had two lawyers.

got into trouble, and the other didn't?

 MR. CRUZ: The only argument --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Fine. My point is 

there's no evidence of that.

 MR. CRUZ: With respect, Justice Breyer, 

there actually is.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There is? In the first 

habeas hearing?

 MR. CRUZ: The evidence there is --

JUSTICE BREYER: I read the whole thing.

 MR. CRUZ: In our appendix there is an 

affidavit from the Mexican Consulate. Once the Mexican 

Consulate started assisting Medellin, they prepared an 

affidavit, and the affidavit said if we had been 

contacted, we would have told you not to confess; and we 

would have told you to get a lawyer. The problem with 

that is Medellin confessed within about three hours of 

being arrested, and even the ICJ in Avena said that 

notification had to occur within 72 hours.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm thinking of is the 

evidence at the first habeas hearing that led the 

district judge to reach his conclusion that there was no 

prejudice and that the procedural default was not

excused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what 

that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that 

the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be 

easiest for Texas to go back to that.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer -- it was part of 

the State court record, and it was the basis for saying 

there was no prejudice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It was in the first 

hearing.

 MR. CRUZ: I believe it was. And it's 

included in our appendix four.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you think there was no 

reason for the ICJ to ask the President --

MR. CRUZ: It is difficult to explain.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the basis for 

the determination of no prejudice the fact that the 

Petitioner in this case had received full Miranda 

warnings, which went beyond what the consulate was going 

to tell him?

 MR. CRUZ: That is completely correct, and 

he waived those in writing.

lawyers Texas gave him?

 MR. CRUZ: Both of them vigorously defended 

him, and in Medellin we devoted several pages of our 

brief to going through in considerable detail the many 

motions they filed. It was a vigorous defense, and yet 

they failed to raise this particular --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And so they have -- the 

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals didn't adopt a simple 

solution of the case, to say He got all the protection; 

that there's no prejudice and therefore there's no 

treaty violation.

 MR. CRUZ: The Texas Court of Criminal 

Appeals didn't have it as option to say, it would have 

been easier, one might say, to just go along. The 

President is asking you to do this, make the whole thing 

go away; just go along. The problem is the Texas Court 

of Criminal Appeals had a statute, and a statute that 

divested of jurisdiction unless there is new Federal 

law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that statute 

really would not have divested -- if I understand he 

Texas law correctly -- if you did agree -- which you 

don't, I know -- that there was a preexisting Federal

obligation to honor judgments of the ICJ, then under 

Testa v Katt principle and Howlett opinion and others, 

the Texas court would have had jurisdiction.

 MR. CRUZ: Although that holding would be, I 

would suggest, in considerable tension if not directly 

contrary to Sanchez-Llamas.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but Sanchez-Llamas 

doesn't deal with the judgment. And It says a separate 

Federal obligation --

MR. CRUZ: Oregon is as much a part of the 

United States as Texas.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Then I think the Texas --

there would be jurisdiction in the Texas court to 

entertain this claim. I think you -- you agree with 

that?

 MR. CRUZ: I do not, because it has to be a 

new claim, and if this were a judgment, the judgment --

PLAINTIFF'S CO-COUNSEL: It would be a new 

claim based on a new judgment which was after Sanchez --

the Chief Justice's opinion in that case.

 MR. CRUZ: Let me point out one consequence 

of -- of the President's assertion of authority.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm -- you just

it seems to me if you did agree -- and I know you

vigorously don't -- that there were a pre-existing 

Federal obligation -- an obligation of the United States 

to respect the judgment of the ICJ, which is -- which we 

think is wrong as a matter of international law; we have 

previously construed the treaties to the contrary -- but 

if there were an independent obligation to expect --

Federal obligation -- respect that judgment, it seems to 

me that that obligation could be enforced in Federal 

court.

 MR. CRUZ: I don't disagree with that, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't.

 MR. CRUZ: If -- although I disagree with 

the premise.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. CRUZ: But if the premise were true, I 

don't disagree with the conclusion.

 The statute allows jurisdiction where there 

is a new legal basis that was not previously 

availability. The only two potential sources of that 

are Avena, which we submit is a non-self-executing 

international law obligation, or the President's order; 

and, in fact, it is worth underscoring if the United 

States' theory is correct, there's no reason why the 

President needed to wait for a decision from the ICJ.

If the President has the authority to take a 

non-self-executive international law treaty and order it 

to be implemented and set aside any State law to the 

contrary --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, there is. We have 

interpreted the law, and we have said as far as what 

Article 36 means, we disagree with the ICJ.

 MR. CRUZ: I agree with you, Justice 

Ginsburg, but the United States does not. The United 

States believes that the President has the authority to 

make decisions and to implement treaties -- an 

independent authority to create new binding law, even 

though the obligation is not self-executing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How many parties to 

Avena -- there were 51 -- are being held in the State of 

Texas?

 MR. CRUZ: There are 51. There were 15 in 

the State of Texas. There are now 14 because 1 was 

under the age of 18, so is now off of death row; 51 in 9 

States across the country.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Oklahoma has taken 

the opposite position, and they -- they did give the 

review and reconsideration?

 MR. CRUZ: Not that we're aware of, no. 

There have -- the 51 -- my understanding is it's down to 

44. For various reasons these individuals are not on 

death row but, other than Oklahoma, not related to the 

Avena decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the fact that 

they're on -- on death row isn't at all significant 

because the judgment of the ICJ purports to vacate the 

convictions as well; isn't that correct?

 MR. CRUZ: That's exactly right; and, in 

fact, in Paragraph 34 of Avena it asserted the authority 

to annul U.S. criminal convictions. So some of the 

hypotheticals coming from bench, under the ICJ --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the ICJ flatly 

refused Mexican -- Mexico said ICJ annulled the 

judgment. The ICJ said no, and it didn't vacate it, 

either. It just said that it did a reconsideration to 

see whether there was prejudice.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, you're correct 

they did not order the annulment. But in paragraph 34 

they asserted they could order the annulment. They 

simply were choosing --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm looking at page


186. They require review and reconsideration of the 

conviction and sentence.

 MR. CRUZ: That's correct. So it is not 

just the sentence; and, in fact, they, despite the fact 

that their statute does not allow them to have precedent 

in any other cases, they said in paragraph 151:

 The fact that the Court's ruling concerned 

only Mexican nationals cannot be taken to imply the 

conclusion reached in the present judgment do not apply 

to other foreign nationals finding themselves in 

situations. They were in an unprecedented act recording 

the authority to bind U. S. Courts in a way, to the best 

of my knowledge, no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Their very own statute, 

the statute setting up the ICJ, makes it clear that is 

not the case. They can issue a binding judgment in the 

particular case. It has no precedential effect for 

other cases, not even within the ICJ.

 MR. CRUZ: But they can issue a decision 

that can be enforced by the Security Council. And had 

they issued --

MR. CRUZ: It has gone -- for example, in 

the Nicaragua case, there was an effort to take it to 

the Security Council there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the U.S. exercised 

its veto.

 MR. CRUZ: Correct. And that's part of a 

diplomatic treaty, where it's between nations is -- is 

that it is not binding in the sense that the domestic 

courts will enforce it.

 Indeed, if the ICJ had asserted the power it 

claimed to annul U.S. convictions, under the U.S.'s 

theory the President presumably could have issued an 

order effectively pardoning State prisoners despite the 

fact that the Constitution limits its pardon authority 

to Federal crimes.

 Mr. Donovan, you have five minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DONALD F. DONOVAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First, there is nothing in the ratification 

history that suggests that Avena made any assumptions 

about whether or not the Optional Protocol would be 

self-executing. The Connally Amendment went to the 

compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, and the discussion

to which Texas has referred is entirely about the 

international ramifications.

 In fact, the Senate specifically declined to 

apply the Connally Amendment to the Optional Protocol. 

So that gets to the question that we have been 

discussing here, which is:

 What is the scope of the enforceability of 

an ICJ judgment? There are obviously constraints to 

that. One is illustrated by the Chief Justice's 

hypothetical. That is, there are affirmative 

constraints in the Constitution, itself.

 The second is illustrated by a point I made, 

but Mr. Cruz misunderstood, which is that the nature of 

the obligation emanating from the judgment is directed 

at a constitutional branch such as the obligation to 

enforce an active statute. Obviously, that is not 

enforceable in court.

 If the nature of the obligation is to cease 

hostilities, that is obviously directed to the President 

and is not enforceable in court. And that's illustrated 

by the Nicaragua case in which the ICJ issued a 

judgment. Congress passed a statute that said it wasn't 

going to comply; and the President said he wasn't going 

to comply.

 That, in turn, applies to the third

constraint, which is the political constraint, itself. 

The Nicaragua case illustrates that if the ICJ issues a 

judgment that the United States does not want to comply 

with, Congress can pass a statute to say we repudiate 

the obligation.

 So the obligations that we are talking about 

here in which the ICJ judgment would be enforceable by 

an individual fall squarely in the class of cases that 

this Court has decided for two centuries where an 

individual has a right conferred by the statute.

 And he walked into a court, and he asked 

that court to enforce that right, and he invokes that 

right in -- as in the Caffa core case, the Roucher case, 

cases going back to the founding.

 And this Court has said when the right is of 

a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, this 

Court will enforce it. And that is all Mr. Medellin is 

asserting here: The right to enforce a right that is 

eminently suitable for judicial enforcement because it 

goes to the judicial process, itself.

 The second point with respect to Article 

III: It cannot be the case that this Court can never 

enforce -- gives away its Article III authority when 

somebody else enforces a judgment. We know from the 

Comegys and the Abba cases that we have cited that the

Court has in fact said that when the U.S. submits a case 

to international adjudication that international 

adjudication is binding and it's not reexaminable in a 

U.S. court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read the Comegys 

case, however you say it, to be for the exact opposite 

proposition. There they were saying, this is an 

international arbitration, there's no reason to go 

behind it.

 But the question of whether or not that 

arbitration is binding in the bankruptcy proceeding that 

was at issue there was very much one for the U.S. 

Supreme Court to make.

 MR. DONOVAN: But that's because that was 

not part of what the court had actually decided, or 

rather that the international adjudication had actually 

decided. You think about, if the proposition is that 

nobody else but an Article III court can decide a 

Federal question, this Court could not have decided 

Mitsubishi. In Mitsubishi the Court sent Federal 

statute antitrust claims to an arbitration panel in 

Tokyo and said that the result would be everyone 

forcible so long as the panel actually took cognizance 

of the claim and actually decided it.

 This Court if it evaluated the claim that

Mr. Medellin is entitled to review and reconsideration 

as a result of the treaty obligation under 94-1 and the 

President's determination that that treaty obligation 

will be given effect, this Court would be performing a 

supremely judicial function, that is it would be 

interpreting and applying Federal law in the form of a 

statute, which is exactly what the Supremacy Clause 

requests the Court to do.

 With respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Put precisely, it would be 

making it Federal law and then applying it. If you 

assume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it 

to domestic law. Now, Congress can obviously do it by 

passing a law.

 But you're saying the Court can do it, can 

make it dmestic law and then enforce it.

 MR. DONOVAN: That assumes thatit is not 

self-executing, yes. But the whole question here is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes, ys.

 MR. DONOVAN: -- when we're talking about 

self-executing here we're saying what branch is the 

obligation directed to. And what the Court has said 

time and time again is when the obligation is of a 

nature to be enforced in a court of justice it is 

directed to the judicial authority.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you are saying if 

I understand you is that Justice Scalia was wrong when 

he said that would be making it Federal law. I think 

you were saying that would be a -- the branch that was 

responsible for determining how to execute, i.e., to 

apply, Federal law. Is that your point?

 MR. DONOVAN: That's exactly right. The 

thing that makes the treaty Federal law is not the 

Court; it's the Supremacy Clause, which makes it supreme 

Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 

authority -- I get back to where I started. I 

understood you to concede that we would have authority 

to construe the judgment if it provided, for example, 

for a punitive sanction against the officers. What is 

the basis under your theory for that authority?

 MR. DONOVAN: Well, it's settled that a 

treaty cannot contravene an affirmative constitutional 

obligation. There would be -- if there was -- if the 

ICJ --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it can -- it can 

contravene our interpretation of the treaty as a matter 

of Federal law.

 MR. DONOVAN: There are two different treaty 

obligations. There's a treaty obligation under the

Vienna Convention, which this court has now 

dispositively interpreted, and there's a treaty 

obligation to comply. And it's the very nature of an 

obligation to put a dispute to a third party that you 

may not agree with the result, and that does not in any 

way compromise this Court's Article III authority to 

rest that judgment on an obligation committed to by the 

political branches, three treaties ratified by the 

President and Senate that said when this country commits 

itself to do something we're going to do it. Now we 

have the President of the United States saying that it's 

in the paramount interests of the United States for 

purposes of enforcing --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have the 

authority to interpret the judgment of the ICJ?

 MR. DONOVAN: The courts in enforcing that 

judgment would. Of course that would be part of the 

judicial enterprise. The applicable instrument is now 

the Avena judgment, pursuant to the treaties and the 

President's determination, independent sources. In 

applying that judgment, there may well be interpretive 

questions because the Avena judgment lays down standards 

and requires obligations and that would be part of the 

judicial enterprise.

authority to interpret it, we have the authority to 

construe whether it's carry to the Constitution, but we 

do not the authority to consider whether it's consistent 

with Federal law?

 MR. DONOVAN: That's right, because that's 

the very nature of enforcing a judgment: You do not 

re-examine the merits. You take the judgment and you 

enforce the judgment. And it's the judicial enterprise 

to construe what that -- it may be a question about 

construing that -- what that instrument requires, what 

that judgment requires. But it's the judicial function 

in enforcing that judgment that calls upon this Article 

-- the Court's Article III authority, and does not in 

any way compromise it, which in turn goes to the 

question about what the judgment requires. It requires 

prospective review and reconsideration. The Texas court 

didn't suggest that Mr. Medellin had received review and 

reconsideration. The ICJ made it clear that it had to 

be prospective, and one of the fundamental reasons for 

that is because the judgment says that the treaty rights 

have to be determined on it own. Mr. Medellin is 

entitled to show that the violation of the treaty 

standing on its own two feet and not filtered through a 

constitutional right affected -- that he is entitled to 

show prejudicie.
