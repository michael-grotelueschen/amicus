3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department 

of Health and Human Services v. Florida.
 

6  Mr. Long.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG
 

8  AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE
 

9  MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 

please the Court: 

11  The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a "pay 

12 first, litigate later" rule that is central to Federal 

13 tax assessment and collection. The Act applies to 

14 essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue 

Code. There is no reason to think that Congress made a 

16 special exception for the penalty imposed by section 

17 5000A. On the contrary, there are three reasons to 

18 conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here. 

19  First, Congress directed that the section 

5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the 

21 same manner as taxes. Second, Congress provided that 

22 penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes. 

23 And, third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key 

24 indicia of a tax.

 Congress directed that the section 5000A 

3

5

15

20

25

Official 

1 penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same 

2 manner as taxes. That directive triggers the 

3 Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that "no suit for 

4 the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection 

of any tax may be maintained in any court by any 

6 person." 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that depends, as --

8 as the Government points out, on whether that directive 

9 is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to 

how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a 

11 directive to him and to the courts. All of the other 

12 directives there seem to me to be addressed to the 

13 Secretary. Why should this one be directed to the 

14 courts? When you say "in the same manner," he goes 

about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply 

16 accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless 

17 adjudicate the cases. 

18  MR. LONG: Well, I think I have a three-part 

19 answer to that, Justice Scalia. First, the text does 

not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect 

21 taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be 

22 assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing 

23 any party particularly. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he's assessing and 

collecting it in the same manner as a tax.

1  MR. LONG: Well, the assessment -- the other 

2 two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I 

3 don't think there's any dispute in this case that if the 

4 Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the 

section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be 

6 assessed and collected in a very different manner from 

7 other taxes and other tax penalties. 

8  There are three main differences. First, 

9 when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay 

the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to 

11 get it back with interest. Second, you have to exhaust 

12 administrative remedies. Even after you pay the tax, 

13 you can't immediately go to court. You have to go to 

14 the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months 

to see if the matter can be resolved administratively. 

16 And, third, even in the very carefully defined 

17 situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge 

18 to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary 

19 has to make the first move. The taxpayer is never 

allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the 

21 Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the 

22 process. 

23  Now, if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does 

24 not apply here, none of those rules apply. And that's 

not just for this case; it will be for every challenge

1 to a section 5000A penalty going forward. The taxpayer 

2 will be able to go to court at any time without 

3 exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none 

4 of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to 

wait for the Secretary to make the --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why will the
 

7 administrative remedies rule not be applicable,
 

8 exhaustion rule not be applicable?
 

9  MR. LONG: Well, because if the
 

Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply, there's no 

11 prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or 

12 collection of this penalty, and you can simply --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but courts apply the 

14 exhaustion rule. I mean, I know you've studied this. 

I'm just not following it. Why couldn't the court say, 

16 well, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no 

17 injunction? 

18  MR. LONG: Well, in -- you could do that, I 

19 think, as a matter of -- of common law or a judicially 

imposed doctrine, but in the code itself, which is 

21 all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely 

22 central statute to litigation --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes. 

24  MR. LONG: -- about taxes. And the code 

says -- first it says you must pay the tax first and 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 then litigate. So, that's the baseline. And then, in 

2 addition, it says you must -- I mean, it's not common 

3 law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund, 

4 you must wait at least 6 months. I mean, that's -- many 

of these provisions are extremely specific, with very 

6 specific time limits. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they would apply 

8 even if the rule is not jurisdictional. The only 

9 difference would be that the court could enforce it or 

not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to 

11 the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle. 

12 It's a case quite similar to this in which the 

13 constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at 

14 issue, and the government waived its right to insist 

upon the application of this Act. 

16  Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't 

17 waive it. So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis 

18 case? 

19  MR. LONG: Well, Helvering v. Davis was 

decided during a period when this Court interpreted the 

21 Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the 

22 pre-statutory equitable principles that usually, but not 

23 always, prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment 

24 or collection of taxes. So, that understanding, which 

is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis 

7

25

Official 

1 decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing 

2 and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones. And so, 

3 I would say, effectively, the Davis case has been 

4 overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, why don't we 

6 simply follow the statutory language? I know that 

7 you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by 

8 later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act 

9 is "no suit shall be maintained." It's remarkably 

similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed 

11 Elsevier: "No civil action for infringement ... shall 

12 be instituted." And that formulation, "no suit may be 

13 maintained," contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act. It 

14 says the district court shall not enjoin. That Tax 

Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says 

16 "courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding 

17 in State court." So, both of those formulas, the TIA 

18 and the no injunction against proceedings at State 

19 court, are directed to "court." The Anti-Injunction 

Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says 

21 "no suit shall be maintained." And it has been argued 

22 that that is suitor-directed in contrast to 

23 court-directed. 

24  MR. LONG: Right. Well, I mean, this Court 

has said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was 

8

Official 

1 based on the Anti-Injunction Act. You're quite right, 

2 the language is different; but we submit that the 

3 Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that "no suit 

4 shall be maintained," is addressed to courts as well as 

litigants. I mean, after all, a case cannot go from 

6 beginning to end without the active cooperation of the 

7 court. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how is that different 

9 from "no civil action for infringement shall be 

instituted" -- "maintained" and "instituted"? Anything 

11 turn on that? 

12  MR. LONG: Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a 

13 party could initiate an action without the active 

14 cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from 

beginning to end, again, requires the court's 

16 cooperation. 

17  And even if -- I mean, if the Court were 

18 inclined to say as an initial matter, if this statute 

19 were coming before us for the first time today, given 

all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you 

21 might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional 

22 statute, a lot of water has gone over the dam here. The 

23 Court has said multiple times that this is a 

24 jurisdictional statute. Congress has not disturbed 

those decisions. To the contrary --

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Court said that 

3 many times, but is there any case in which the result 

4 would have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act 

were not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were 

6 viewed as a mandatory claims-processing --

7  MR. LONG: There's --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: -- rule? 

9  MR. LONG: There's certainly a number of 

cases where the Court dismissed saying it is 

11 jurisdictional. 

12  As I read the cases, I don't think any of 

13 them would necessarily have come out differently, 

14 because I don't think we had a case where the argument 

was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so, 

16 you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional, it --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the clearest -- the 

18 clearest way of distinguishing between the 

19 jurisdictional provision and a mandatory 

claims-processing rule is whether it can be waived and 

21 whether the court feels that it has an obligation to 

22 raise the issue sua sponte. 

23  Now, if there are a lot of cases that call 

24 it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out 

differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a

1 mandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one 

2 side. 

3  And on the other side, you have Davis, where 

4 the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; 

the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was 

6 a waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which 

7 is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the 

8 Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision. 

9  The Court said that there could be a suit if 

there's no way the government could win and the 

11 plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm. Now, doesn't 

12 that sound like an equitable exception to the 

13 Anti-Injunction Act? 

14  MR. LONG: No, I think the -- I think the 

best interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was 

16 interpreting a jurisdictional statute. And, indeed, in 

17 Williams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional 

18 statute. 

19  But, again, even if you had doubt about 

simply the cases, there's more than that because 

21 Congress has not only not disturbed this Court's 

22 decisions stating that the statute is jurisdictional; 

23 they've passed numerous amendments to this 

24 Anti-Injunction Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems --

Official 

1 you can't separate those two points. The idea that 

2 Congress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps 

3 you if what we have said is fairly consistent. And you, 

4 yourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone 

back and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional
 

6 provision or not. So, even if Congress acquiesced in
 

7 it, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in.
 

8  MR. LONG: Well, what you have said,
 

9 Mr. Chief Justice, has been absolutely consistent for
 

50 years, since the Williams Packing case. The period 

11 of inconsistency was after -- the first 50 years, since 

12 the statute was enacted in 1867, and there was a period, 

13 as I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary 

14 circumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but 

then, very quickly, it cut back on that. And since --

16 and since Williams Packing, you've been utterly 

17 consistent --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even since 

19 Williams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan. 

And that case can also be understood as a kind of 

21 equitable exception to the rule, which would be 

22 inconsistent with thinking that the rule is 

23 jurisdictional. 

24  MR. LONG: Well, again, I mean, I think the 

best understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that it's an equitable exception, but it's the Court 

2 interpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would 

3 interpret any statute in light of its purpose, and 

4 deciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow 

exception --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Long, in Bowles, the 

7 Court looked to the long history of appellate issues as 

8 being jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a 

9 claim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule, 

the power of the court to hear a case. 

11  From all the questions here, I count at 

12 least four cases in the Court's history where the Court 

13 has accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and 

14 reached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one 

of them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where 

16 exceptions to that rule were read in. 

17  Given that history, regardless of how we 

18 define jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing 

19 statutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement 

that Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary 

21 case, we will hear the case? 

22  MR. LONG: No. No, Justice Sotomayor, 

23 because in many of these amendments which have come in 

24 the '70s and the '90s and the 2000s, the Congress has 

actually framed the limited exceptions to the 

13

Official 

1 Anti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms. And it has 

2 written many of the express exceptions by saying 

3 notwithstanding section 7421 --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But doesn't that just 

prove that it knows that the court will impose a 

6 claim-processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in 

7 those in which it specifically doesn't want the court 

8 to, it has to be clearer? 

9  MR. LONG: Well, but Congress says, 

notwithstanding 7421, the court "shall have 

11 jurisdiction" to restrain the assessment and collection 

12 of taxes in very limited --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to the 

14 question that Justice Alito asked? Assuming we find 

that this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of 

16 horribles that you see occurring if we call this a 

17 mandatory claim-processing rule? What kinds of cases do 

18 you imagine that courts will reach? 

19  MR. LONG: Right. Well, first of all, I 

think you'd be saying that for the refund statute as 

21 well as for the Anti-Injunction Act, which has very 

22 similar wording. So, if the Anti-Injunction Act is not 

23 jurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to 

24 the refund statute, the statute that says you have to 

first ask for a refund and file, you know, within

1 certain time. So, it would be -- it would be both of 

2 those statutes. And, you know, we are dealing with 

3 taxes here. If people can litigate --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't my question.

 MR. LONG: I'm sorry. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My question was, if we 

7 deem this a mandatory claim-processing rule --

8  MR. LONG: Right. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what cases do you 

imagine courts will reach on what grounds? Assuming the 

11 government does its job and comes in and raises the AIA 

12 as an immediate defense --

13  MR. LONG: Well, that --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what -- where can a 

court then reach the question, despite --

16  MR. LONG: That would certainly be the first 

17 class of cases that occurs to me, where, if the 

18 government does not raise it in a timely way, it could 

19 be waived. I would think plaintiffs would see if there 

was some clever way they could get a suit going that 

21 wouldn't immediately be apparent that it --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assumes the lack of 

23 competency of the government, which I don't, but what 

24 other types of cases?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Long, I don't think

Official 

1 you're going to come up with any, but I think your 

2 response is you could say that about any jurisdictional 

3 rule. If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to 

4 happen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal 

court deciding whether you're going to make an 

6 exception, and there will be no parade of horribles 

7 because all Federal courts are intelligent. 

8  (Laughter.) 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it seems to me it's a 

question you can't answer. It's a question which asks 

11 why should there be any jurisdictional rules? And you 

12 think there should be. 

13  MR. LONG: And, Justice Scalia, I mean, 

14 honestly, I can't predict what would happen, but I would 

say that not all people who litigate about Federal taxes 

16 are necessarily rational. And I think there would be a 

17 great --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I just don't want to lose 

the second half of your argument. And we've spent all 

21 the time so far on jurisdiction. And I accept pretty 

22 much -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on 

23 jurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the 

24 second part, because the second part says "restraining 

the assessment or collection of any tax."

1  Now, here, Congress has nowhere used the 

2 word "tax." What it says is "penalty." Moreover, this 

3 is not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of 

4 collection.

 And so, why is this a tax? And I know you 

6 point to certain sentences that talk about taxes within 

7 the code --

8  MR. LONG: Right. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is not attached 

to a tax. It is attached to a health care requirement. 

11  MR. LONG: Right. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: So, why does it fall within 

13 that word? 

14  MR. LONG: Well, I mean, the first point 

is our -- our initial submission is you don't have to 

16 determine that this is a tax in order to find that the 

17 Anti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very 

18 specifically said that it shall be assessed and 

19 collected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a 

tax penalty and not a tax. So, that's one argument --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But that doesn't mean the 

22 AIA applies. I mean -- and then they provide some 

23 exceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies. 

24  It says "in the same manner as." It is then 

attached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 as being "the manner of." Well, that it's being applied 

2 or if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax 

3 doesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since 

4 the reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with 

revenue sources. And here, an advance attack on this 

6 does not interfere with the collection of revenues. 

7  I mean, that's -- you've read the arguments, 

8 as have I. But I'd like to know what you say succinctly 

9 in response to those arguments.

 MR. LONG: So, specifically on the argument 

11 that it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point 

12 that it should be assessed and collected in the same 

13 manner as a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act uses the term 

14 "tax"; it doesn't define it. Somewhat to my surprise, 

"tax" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue 

16 Code. In about the time that Congress passed the 

17 Anti-Injunction Act, "tax" had a very broad definition. 

18 It's broad enough to include this exaction, which is 

19 codified in the Internal Revenue Code. It's part of the 

taxpayer's annual income tax return. The amount of the 

21 liability and whether you owe the liability is based in 

22 part on your income. It's assessed and collected by the 

23 IRS. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: There's at least some doubt 

about it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

25

Official 

1 said, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that 

2 ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that, 

3 unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of 

4 jurisdiction. And I find it hard to think that this is 

clear. Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that 

6 it's not clear. 

7  MR. LONG: Well, I mean, the Anti-Injunction 

8 Act applies not only to every tax in the code but, as 

9 far as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code. 

And --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, you said 

12 before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the 

13 Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction 

14 Act. And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what 

can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of 

16 raising revenue. The Tax Injunction Act does not apply 

17 to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with 

18 the law, rather than to raise revenue. And this is not 

19 a revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful, 

they -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be 

21 no revenue to raise. 

22  MR. LONG: Well, in Bob Jones, the Court 

23 said that they had gotten out of the business of trying 

24 to determine whether an exaction is primarily 

revenue-raising or primarily regulatory. And this one

9 denominating it as a penalty.

 MR. LONG: That's -- that's absolutely 

11 right, and that's obviously why -- if it were called a 

12 tax, there would be absolutely no question that the 

13 Anti-Injunction Act applies. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Absolutely. But even 

the section of the code that you referred to previously, 

16 the one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly 

17 make a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between 

18 tax and penalties. It's very explicit.

correct. And there are many other places in the code

2 either, one, these are penalties that were penalties 

3 assessed for not paying taxes; or, two, they involve 

4 matters that were called by the court taxes; or, three, 

in some instances, they were deemed by the code to be 

6 taxes. 

7  Now, what we have here is something that's 

8 in a different statute that doesn't use the word "tax" 

9 once, except for a collection device and, in fact, in 

addition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to 

11 the Solicitor General: We don't care what you think; 

12 we, in Congress, don't want you in court where the 

13 revenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the 

14 revenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and, 

therefore, you can't waive it. 

16  Now, I got that. Here it's not at stake, 

17 and here there are all the differences I just mentioned. 

18 So, I ask that because I want to hear your response. 

19  MR. LONG: Well, I mean, there are penalties 

in the Internal Revenue Code that you really couldn't 

21 say are related in any -- in any close way to some other 

22 tax provision. There's a penalty -- it's discussed in 

23 the briefs -- for selling diesel fuel that doesn't 

24 comply with EPA's regulations, you know. So, there are 

all kinds of penalties in the code, and I think it's --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Long, aren't there 

3 places in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were 

4 specifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act? There's 

one on health care plans, there's one on pharmaceutical 

6 manufacturers, where Congress specifically said the 

7 Anti-Injunction Act is triggered for those. It does not 

8 say that here. Wouldn't that suggest that Congress 

9 meant for a different result to obtain?

 MR. LONG: Well, I mean, Congress didn't use 

11 the language the Anti-Injunction Act "shall apply" --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: No, but it -- in section 

13 9008 and in section 9010, it specifically referred --

14  MR. LONG: Right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- to the part of the code 

16 where the Anti-Injunction Act is. 

17  MR. LONG: All of subtitle F, which picks up 

18 lots of administration and procedure provisions, but 

19 those are fees, and they're not -- Congress did not 

provide, you know, in the sections themselves that they 

21 should be paid as part of a tax return. So, they were 

22 free-standing fees. And by using that subtitle F 

23 language, Congress plugged in a whole set of rules for 

24 how to collect and administer the fees, and it went not 

just to assessment and collection -- and the IRS has

2 series of additional things. 

3  So, I think it would be a mistake to look at 

4 that language and say, oh, here's Congress saying they 

want the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. They're actually 

6 doing more than that. 

7  And, yes, I grant you, you could look at 

8 section 5000A, the individual coverage requirement, and 

9 say, well, they could have been clearer about saying the 

Anti-Injunction Act applied. And that's certainly true, 

11 but, again, they were trying to accomplish a lot. And 

12 it's --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's easier to talk about 

14 this case if we just forget the words "for the purpose 

of restraining assessment or collection." In a sense, 

16 that brings the jurisdictional question and 

17 Justice Breyer's question together. 

18  It seems to me -- maybe you could just 

19 comment on that language. Is that sort of language 

usually contained in a jurisdictional provision? I 

21 mean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until 

22 after the thing is under way. I can see it with 

23 malicious prosecution and some civil rights cases. Does 

24 it strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision 

in a jurisdictional sense?

Official 

1  MR. LONG: It does strike me, honestly --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Excuse me. 

3  MR. LONG: -- as a bit unusual, but this is 

4 an old statute. I mean, this -- the core language is 

essentially unchanged since 1867, and it -- you know, I 

6 think that's part of the explanation for it. And, 

7 again, it's, you know, become the center of a series of 

8 provisions that very carefully control the circumstances 

9 in which litigation about Federal taxes can take place.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, there's another 

11 argument that has been made that I would like you to 

12 address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty --

13 it's all beside the point because this suit is not 

14 challenging the penalty. This is a suit that is 

challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is 

16 made that, if, indeed, "must-buy" is constitutional, 

17 then these complainants will not resist the penalty. 

18  So, what they're seeking is a determination 

19 that the "must-buy" requirement, stated separately from 

the penalty, that the "must-buy" is unconstitutional. 

21 And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's 

22 not so, they're not resisting the penalty. 

23  MR. LONG: Well, I think that argument 

24 doesn't work for two reasons. I mean, first, if you 

look at the plaintiffs' own complaint, they clearly 

24
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 challenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the 

2 penalty. At page 122 of the Joint Appendix, they 

3 challenge the requirement that the individuals obtain 

4 health care coverage or pay a penalty.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that? 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If that's -- if that's 

7 the problem, it's easy to amend a complaint. They can 

8 just take that out of the complaint. So, it can't turn 

9 on that.

 MR. LONG: Well -- and -- yes, I mean, it's 

11 -- or another complaint would be filed, but, still, I 

12 think that's a serious problem. But even if they had 

13 filed a different complaint, I don't think you -- in 

14 this case, I don't think you can separate the minimum 

coverage requirement from the penalty, because the 

16 penalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum 

17 coverage requirement. 

18  So, first, I mean, I think these plaintiffs 

19 would not be satisfied if the Court were to render a 

judgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is 

21 invalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing. 

22 Anybody who doesn't have insurance has to pay the 

23 penalty. Then they'd have to pay a penalty equal to the 

24 cost of insurance and they wouldn't even have insurance. 

So, I don't think that would be --

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they say they want to 

2 obey the law --

3  MR. LONG: Right. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: -- and they say that your 

argument puts them in the position of having to disobey 

6 the law in order to obtain review of their claim. And 

7 what is your answer to that? 

8  MR. LONG: Well, I mean, first of all, I 

9 can't find that in the record, in their declarations. I 

don't see a statement that they will, you know, never 

11 incur a penalty under any circumstances. But -- but 

12 even if that were so, what this Court has said in 

13 Americans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any 

14 suit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own 

taxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes. 

16  And so, even if it were really true that 

17 these plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and 

18 would never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in 

19 this case in striking down the minimum coverage 

requirement, the inevitable result would be that the 

21 penalty would fall as well, because the government 

22 couldn't collect a penalty for failing to follow an 

23 unconstitutional requirement. And so, it would still be 

24 barred because it would be a suit that would prevent the 

collection of some of the --

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me take us back to 

2 Justice Kennedy's question about the "for the purpose 

3 of" language. I take it you interpret the statute to 

4 mean the following: "For the purpose of" means having 

the effect of. Is that correct? 

6  MR. LONG: Well, I mean, this Court in the 

7 Bob Jones case, where a similar kind of argument was 

8 being made by the plaintiff in that case, said, you 

9 know, look, you know, where the -- where it's inevitable 

that this is what the suit is about, they're sort of two 

11 sides of the same coin, that clearly is a primary 

12 purpose of the suit. And it's -- and you can't by 

13 clever pleading get away from that. That's just the 

14 nature of the situation.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Long, aren't you 

16 trying to rewrite the statute, in a way? The statute 

17 has two sections. One is the "you have to have 

18 insurance" section and the other is the sanction. The 

19 statute has two different sets of exceptions 

corresponding to those two different sections. You're 

21 trying to suggest that the statute says, well, it's your 

22 choice, either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee. 

23  But that's not the way the statute reads. 

24 And Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a 

decision that that shouldn't be the way the statute

1 reads, that it should instead be a regulatory command 

2 and a penalty attached to that command. 

3  MR. LONG: Well, I would not argue that this 

4 statute is a perfect model of clarity, but I do think 

the most reasonable way to read the entire statute is 

6 that it does impose a single obligation to pay a penalty 

7 if you are an applicable individual and you're not 

8 subject to an exemption. 

9  And the reason I say that, if you look at 

the exemptions from the penalty, I mean, the very first 

11 one is you're exempt from the penalty because you can't 

12 afford to purchase insurance. And it just doesn't seem 

13 reasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress 

14 having said, well, you know, this person is exempt from 

paying a penalty because we find they can't afford to 

16 buy insurance; however, they still have a legal 

17 obligation to buy insurance. That just doesn't seem 

18 reasonable. 

19  So, I do think, although it's -- I certainly 

wouldn't argue it's clear, that that's the best way to 

21 understand the statute as a whole. 

22  But, again, I would say, you know, that's 

23 not essential to the question we're discussing now, of 

24 whether the Anti-Injunction Act applies. Again, you 

know, I think --

so if the result were to say simply, this is not -- oh, 

6 I'm sorry. The Solicitor General's reading. So, now 

7 it's not --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That it is a 

9 jurisdictional bar, but there's an exemption for those 

items that Congress has designated solely as penalties 

11 that are not like taxes. 

12  MR. LONG: Right. Well, I mean, I think the 

13 Solicitor General's reading would probably create the 

14 fewest problems, as I understand it. I mean, my -- my 

main objection to the Solicitor General's reading is I 

16 don't think it makes a whole lot of sense. I mean, 

17 basically, the Solicitor General says every penalty in 

18 the Internal Revenue Code, every other penalty in the 

19 Affordable Care Act is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh that's not -- that's 

21 carrying it too far, because he says if a penalty is 

22 designated as a tax by Congress, then it's subject to 

23 the AIA, and that's most of the code, the tax code. And 

24 he says for those portions of the Affordable Care Act 

that designate things as taxes, the AIA applies. So,

11  MR. LONG: I think my -- my take on it is if 

12 you adopted the Solicitor General's approach, there are 

13 probably three penalties for alcohol- and 

14 tobacco-related offenses at 5114(c), 5684, and 5761 that 

I think would be very difficult to distinguish from this 

16 one, and possibly the 527(j) penalty for failure to 

17 disclose political contributions.

19 to reserve.

Official 

1  This case presents issues of great moment, 

2 and the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the Court's 

3 consideration of those issues. That is so even though 

4 the Anti-Injunction Act is a jurisdictional limit that 

serves what this Court described in Clintwood Elkhorn as 

6 an exceedingly strong interest in protecting the 

7 financial stability of the Federal Government, and even 

8 though the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable 

9 Care Act is an exercise of Congress's taxing power as 

well as its commerce power. 

11  Congress has authority under the taxing 

12 power to enact a measure not labeled as a tax, and it 

13 did so when it put section 5000A into the Internal 

14 Revenue Code. But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction 

Act, the precise language Congress used is 

16 determinative. And there is no language in the 

17 Anti-Injunction Act -- excuse me -- no language in 

18 section 5000A of the Affordable Care Act or in the 

19 Internal Revenue Code generally that provides a textual 

instruction that --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, General Verrilli, 

22 today you're arguing that the penalty is not a tax. 

23 Tomorrow you're going to be back and you'll be arguing 

24 that the penalty is a tax.

 Has the Court ever held that something that

25

Official 

1 is a tax for purposes of the taxing power under the 

2 Constitution is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act? 

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito, but 

4 the Court has held in the license tax cases that 

something can be a constitutional exercise of the taxing 

6 power whether or not it is called a tax. And that's 

7 because the nature of the inquiry that we will conduct 

8 tomorrow is different from the nature of the inquiry 

9 that we will conduct today.

 Tomorrow, the question is whether Congress 

11 has the authority under the taxing power to enact it, 

12 and the form of words doesn't have a dispositive effect 

13 on that analysis. Today, we're construing statutory 

14 text where the precise choice of words does have a 

dispositive effect on the analysis. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, General, you also 

17 have the Bailey child labor tax cases, 'cause there the 

18 Court said that the tax, which was a prohibitory tax 

19 alone, was a tax subject to the AIA, and then it said it 

was beyond the Court's taxing power in a separate case, 

21 correct? 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I do think, Justice 

23 Sotomayor, that with respect to one of the arguments 

24 that my friend from the NFIB has made in the brief, that 

Bailey v. George is a significant problem because I 

32

25

Official 

1 think their argument on the constitutionality under the 

2 taxing power is essentially that the Affordable Care Act 

3 provision is the same thing as the provision that was 

4 held unconstitutional in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different 

6 issue. The question Justice --

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: But on the same day --

8 right, but on the same day as Bailey v. Drexel 

9 Furniture, the Court issued Bailey v. George, which held 

that the Anti-Injunction Act did bar a challenge to that 

11 provision, even though the Court had concluded that it 

12 was invalid under the tax power. 

13  So -- and I think the reason for that has 

14 been -- is clear now after Williams Packing and Bob 

Jones, in that, in order to find that the 

16 Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply to something that 

17 otherwise would be a tax that triggers it, you have to 

18 conclude essentially that there's no substantial 

19 argument that can be made in defense of it as a tax. We 

don't have that here. So, I don't think you can get 

21 around the Anti-Injunction Act if the Court were to read 

22 it, as the amicus suggest it should be read, on that 

23 theory, but --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, a basic

Official 

1 second part, that is, for purposes of the statute, the 

2 Anti-Injunction statute, this penalty does not 

3 constitute a tax, then does the Court need to decide 

4 whether the Anti-Injunction Act in other cases, where it 

does involve a tax, is jurisdictional? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: No. I apologize if I'm 

7 creating any confusion about that, Justice Ginsburg. We 

8 think by far the better route here is to understand the 

9 statute as we have proposed that it be construed as not 

applying here. From the perspective of the United 

11 States -- and if I could, I'd like to take a minute on 

12 this -- the idea that the Anti-Injunction Act would be 

13 construed as not being a jurisdictional provision is 

14 very troubling, and we don't think it's correct.

 And I would, if I could, follow up on a 

16 question, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in 

17 terms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act, 

18 7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix 

19 to our brief.

 I'd ask the Court to compare that to the 

21 language of the very next provision in the code, which 

22 is on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a, 

23 which is the refund statute, which we've talked about a 

24 little bit so far this morning, 7422(a).

 The refund statute this Court held in Dolan 

34

Official 

1 was jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and 

2 Brockamp held that the statute of limitations that 

3 applies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional. 

4  The language in 7422(a) is virtually 

identical to the language in 7421(a) --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is correct, although 

7 in the refund context, you have the sovereign immunity 

8 problem, in which we presume that that has not been 

9 waived.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. But I --

11 7421(a) --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're correct on --

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- and 7422(a) were the 

14 same --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The language is quite 

16 parallel. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: And, originally, they 

18 were the same statutory provision. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: They were only separated 

21 out later. So, I do think that's the strongest textual 

22 indication, Justice Ginsburg, that -- that 7421(a) is 

23 jurisdictional. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that I 

35

20

25

Official 

1 asked you is, if you're right that this penalty is not 

2 covered by section 7421, if you're right about that, why 

3 should we deal with the jurisdictional question at all? 

4 Because this statute, correct, the way you're reading --

read it doesn't involve a tax that's subject to the 

6 Anti-Injunction Act. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that is exactly our 

8 position. And the reason we don't --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so, you agree that 

we would not -- if we agree with you about the correct 

11 interpretation of the statute, we need not decide the 

12 jurisdiction. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: There would be no reason 

14 to decide the jurisdictional issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't you want to know the 

16 answer? 

17  (Laughter.) 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Kennedy, I think 

19 we all want to know the answer to a lot of things in 

this case. But -- but I do -- but I do think that the 

21 prudent course here is to construe the statute in the 

22 manner that we read it. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you indicated -- there 

24 was a discussion earlier about why does the government 

really care, they have competent attorneys, et cetera.

1 But -- and you began your argument by saying it would be 

2 very troubling to say that it's not jurisdictional. 

3  I'd like you to comment on that. It's not 

4 for us to tell a party what's in its best interests. It 

would seem to me that there might be some instances in 

6 which the government would want to litigate the validity 

7 of a tax right away and would want to waive. But you 

8 say it's -- that's not true; that it's very troubling. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think there are two 

problems. One is the problem that Justice Scalia 

11 identified, that if it's not jurisdictional, then courts 

12 have authority to craft equitable exceptions. And it 

13 may seem from where we stand now that that authority is 

14 or could be very, very tightly cabined. But if -- if 

this Court were to conclude that it isn't 

16 jurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other 

17 circumstances in which they might find it equitable to 

18 allow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite 

19 the existence of the Anti-Injunction Act.

 And, second, although I certainly am not 

21 going to stand up here and disparage the attorneys for 

22 the United States in the slightest, the reality is that 

23 if this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument 

24 -- it's open to the argument that it's subject to 

forfeiture by a simple omission in failing to raise it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Ginsburg.
 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it -- I
 

7 mean, the government is going to be defending these
 

8 suits. How likely is it that the government will
 

9 overlook the Anti-Injunction Act? So, it seems to me
 

that this is arming the government by saying it's 

11 waivable at the government's option. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: That's -- that is not our 

13 assessment of the institutional interests of the United 

14 States, Justice Ginsburg. And we do think that the --

the right way to go in this case is to read the statute 

16 as not applying to the minimum coverage provision of --

17 of the Affordable Care Act. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was -- it was the 

19 calculation of the interests of the United States that 

your predecessor made in the Davis case. 

21  There, the Solicitor General exercised 

22 authority that we sanctioned to waive the 

23 Anti-Injunction Act. And, of course, that couldn't be 

24 done if it were jurisdictional.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's true,

1 Mr. Chief Justice. Several points about that, though. 

2  We do agree with Mr. Long's analysis that 

3 Davis occurred in -- during a time in -- in which under 

4 the Standard Nut case, the Court had interpreted the 

Anti-Injunction Act as doing no more than codifying the 

6 traditional equitable principles which allowed courts 

7 discretion to conclude that in certain circumstances, a 

8 case could go forward. 

9  Williams Packing repudiated that analysis, 

and Bob Jones v. Simon again repudiated that analysis 

11 and said, no, we're no longer abiding by that. It is 

12 true that the Davis case has not formally been 

13 overruled, but we do think it's fundamentally 

14 inconsistent with the Court's understanding now of --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought Davis was the 

16 case that -- where a shareholder sues the corporation. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And the remedy is that the 

19 corporation shouldn't pay the money to the tax 

authority. Now, it's a little technical, but that isn't 

21 actually an injunction against the tax authority 

22 collecting. He's not -- they're not restraining the 

23 collection of the tax. They're saying to the taxpayer, 

24 don't pay it.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. And --

2 gets you. 

3  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, in fairness, 

4 Justice Breyer, the United States did intervene in the 

-- in the Davis case and was a party, and so -- not as 

6 far as I'd like, I guess, is the answer. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't do it again, because 

8 I think that goes too far.  I don't think that's 

9 restraining the collection of the tax. It's restraining 

the payment of the tax. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to let that 

13 bone go, right? 

14  (Laughter.)

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Our view here is that it 

16 is jurisdictional. Because it's jurisdictional as this 

17 Court understands jurisdiction now, it's not waivable. 

18 And, therefore, we don't think that -- that that part of 

19 the Davis decision is good law.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, can I ask you about 

21 Reed Elsevier? Justice Ginsburg suggested that the 

22 language was very similar in Reed Elsevier as it is 

23 here, but there are even further similarities. Reed 

24 Elsevier pointed out that the provision in question 

wasn't in Title 28. Here, too, it's not in Title 28. 

40

1 In Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision 

2 there had numerous exceptions to it. Here, too, there 

3 are numerous exceptions that we find that have been 

4 created by the courts over the years.

 In Reed Elsevier, the question was 

6 essentially one about timing. Come to court after you 

7 file your registration. Here, too, the question is one 

8 about timing. Come to court after you make -- after you 

9 pay your taxes.

 So, Reed Elsevier seems in multiple respects 

11 on all fours with this case. 

12  Why is that wrong? 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think so, Justice 

14 Kagan. First, we think -- I guess I'm repeating myself 

and I apologize. But we think the closest analogue is 

16 the very next provision in the United States Code, 

17 7422(a), which this Court has held is jurisdictional, 

18 and is phrased in exactly the same way as 7421(a). In 

19 fact, as I said, they were the same provision back in 

the earlier days. That's the closest analogue. 

21  This isn't -- and it's actually 7422 that's 

22 a statute that says do something first. But this 

23 statute is just a flat-out command that no suit shall be 

24 maintained to restrain --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I take the point --

2 collection. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- but if you would comment 

4 on the similarities of Reed Elsevier to this case. How 

do you think it's different, at all? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because the -- I 

7 think the best answer to that is that there are no magic 

8 words, and that history and context matter, as the Court 

9 said in Henderson. And the history and context here is 

that 7422 and 7421 function together to protect an 

11 exceedingly strong interest that the Court has held with 

12 respect to 7422, sufficiently strong that it explains 

13 the jurisdictional nature of that. The same interest 

14 applies here.

 This isn't just a matter of do X and then 

16 you can -- and then you can come to court. It's just a 

17 fundamentally different set of interests at stake. 

18  So, we do think that that makes a big 

19 difference. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't Reed 

21 Elsevier -- if you're dividing jurisdiction from claims 

22 processing -- it says you have to register before you 

23 can sue. There are a lot of things you have to do 

24 before you can sue. So, why isn't Reed Elsevier like 

you have to pay a filing fee before you can file a

1 complaint? 

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: It is -- we do think it's 

3 very much in that nature and different from this case, 

4 Your Honor.

 And one way I think it's helpful to get at 

6 this is to look at the history. We've cited a string of 

7 court of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening 

8 brief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the 

9 courts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act 

as a jurisdictional provision. 

11  Again, if the Court agrees with our 

12 statutory construction, we don't need to reach this 

13 issue. But they have -- in fact, one of those cases, 

14 the Hansen case, the district court in that case had 

dismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil 

16 Procedure 12(b)(6). The court of appeals vacated and 

17 sent it back with instructions to dismiss under 

18 12(b)(1), which is the subject-matter jurisdiction 

19 provision.

 So, I do think that, to the extent this 

21 issue is before the Court, it is jurisdictional, but it 

22 doesn't need to be before the Court because of the 

23 statutory construction argument that we had offered. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: On your statutory 

construction argument, is there any other exaction

1 imposed under the Internal Revenue Code that would not 

2 qualify as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, or is 

3 5000A just out there all by itself? 

4  GENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- it's not quite 

out there all by itself. There are other provisions
 

6 that fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and,
 

7 therefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in
 

8 section 6671(a), which answers the question about the
 

9 applicability of the Act for most penalties.


 The ones that we've identified -- I may be 

11 overlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26 

12 U.S.C. 857, which imposes certain penalties in 

13 connection with the administration of real estate 

14 investment trusts.

 There are provisions that Mr. Long 

16 identified in his brief, sections 6038(a) through (c) of 

17 the code, which impose certain penalties with respect to 

18 reporting requirements for foreign corporations. 

19  We have, in addition, in footnote 22 at page 

36 of our brief, identified three provisions that Mr. 

21 Long also identified about -- about alcohol and tobacco. 

22 Now --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we -- could we 

24 address, General, the question of whether there are any 

collateral consequences for the failure to buy -- to not

1 buy health insurance? Is the only consequence the 

2 payment of the penalty? 

3  The Private Respondents argue that there are 

4 other collateral consequences such as for people on 

probation who are disobeying the law. If they don't buy 

6 health insurance, they'd be disobeying the law and could 

7 be subject to having their supervised release revoked. 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. That is not a 

9 correct reading of the statute, Justice Sotomayor. The 

only consequence that ensues is the tax penalty. And 

11 the -- we have made a representation, and it was a 

12 carefully made representation, in our brief that it is 

13 the interpretation of the agencies charged with 

14 interpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and 

the Department of Health and Human Services, that there 

16 is no other consequence apart from the tax penalty. 

17  And I do think, if I could talk for a couple 

18 of minutes about the argument that was discussed as to 

19 whether this can be conceived of as a suit just 

challenging the requirement, which is entirely 

21 stand-alone based on inferences drawn from the 

22 exemptions, I really don't think that's right. And if I 

23 could spend a minute on it, I think it's important. 

24  The exemptions in section 5000A -- it is 

true that there are two categories of exemptions. There 

45
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 are exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the 

2 subsection (a) requirement. But the -- but I think, not 

3 only as a practical matter, but I think there's a 

4 textual indication and even as a legal matter, 

they are -- they both function as exceptions to the 

6 requirement. 

7  First, as a practical matter, one of those 

8 exemptions is a hardship exemption. And if the Court 

9 will just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page 

11a of the appendix to our brief. It provides that a 

11 person can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a 

12 hardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal 

13 matter here, excuse compliance with the penalty. 

14  It seems to me to make very little sense to 

say that someone who has gone to an official of the 

16 United States and obtained an exemption would, 

17 nonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker. 

18  We think another way in which you can get to 

19 the same conclusion slightly differently is by 

considering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which 

21 is 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes. 

22 Members of Indian tribes are exempt only from the 

23 penalty as a formal matter under the structure of the 

24 statute here, but the reason for that is because members 

of Indian tribes obtain their health care through the

Official 

1 Indian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system 

2 that doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an 

3 entirely different system. 

4  They were taken out of this statute because 

they get their health care through a different system. 

6 And it doesn't make any sense to think that persons 

7 getting their health care through the Indian Health 

8 Service are violating the law because -- because exempt 

9 only from the penalty but still under a legal obligation 

to have insurance, when the whole point of this is that 

11 they're supposed to be in a clinic-based system. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your whole point that 

13 this was inartful drafting by Congress, that, to the 

14 extent that there is an exemption under the penalty, 

it's an exemption from the legal obligation? 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: I guess what I would say 

17 about it, Your Honor, is that the way in which this 

18 statute is drafted doesn't permit the inference that my 

19 friends from the NFIB are trying to draw from it.

 And there is an additional textual 

21 indication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our 

22 reply brief. This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C.A. 

23 section 18022(e). This is a provision that provides for 

24 a certification that certain individuals can get. And 

this is the paragraph starting with the words "Other 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 provisions" contains the quote. 

2  And it says, "an individual with a 

3 'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from 

4 the requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of 

section 5000A(e)(1) of such Code," is entitled to a 

6 certificate that allows for enrollment in a particular 

7 program for this category of people. 

8  But you can see here, Congress is saying an 

9 exemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from 

the penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as 

11 Congress says, an exemption from the requirement of 

12 section 5000A. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: General --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: 5000A says, directly, "an 

applicable individual shall ensure that the individual 

16 has the minimum essential coverage." And you're saying 

17 it doesn't really mean that, that if you're not subject 

18 to the penalty, you're not under an obligation to 

19 maintain the minimum essential coverage.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. And we 

21 think that's what Congress is saying, both in the 

22 provision I just pointed to, Your Honor, and by virtue 

23 of the fact -- by virtue of the way the exemptions work. 

24 I just think that's the -- reading this in context, that 

is the stronger reading of the statute.

6 So, all they have to do is take away the penalty. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't -- I don't think 

8 so, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't think it makes it easy 

9 for the government in the future. We think this is the 

fairest reading of the statute, that the -- that the --

GENERAL VERRILLI: That if they don't pay

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a person who has 

22 been receiving medical care in an emergency room -- has 

23 no health insurance but, over the years, goes to the 

24 emergency room when the person wants medical care --

goes to the emergency room, and the hospital says, well,

1 fine, you're eligible for Medicaid, enroll in Medicaid. 

2 And the person says, no, I don't want that. I want to 

3 continue to get -- just get care here from the emergency 

4 room. Will the hospital be able to point to the mandate 

and say, well, you're obligated to enroll? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't think so, 

7 Justice Alito, for the same reason I just gave. I think 

8 that the -- that the answer in that situation is that 

9 that person, assuming that person -- well, if that 

person is eligible for Medicaid, they may well not be in 

11 a situation where they're going to face any tax penalty 

12 and therefore --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: No, they're not facing the 

14 tax penalty.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. Right.

17 to continue to give them care and pay for it themselves,

21 enrolled in Medicaid.

fair to say that the Congress wants people in that 

6 position to sign up for Medicaid. I think that's 

7 absolutely right. And I think the statute is structured 

8 to accomplish that objective, but the reality still is 

9 that the only consequence of noncompliance is the 

penalty. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, but I thought 

12 that people who were eligible for Medicaid weren't 

13 subject to the penalty. Am I wrong? I could be just 

14 factually wrong.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it all -- the 

16 penalty is keyed to income. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: And the -- it's keyed to 

19 a number of things. One is, are you making so little 

money that you aren't obligated to file a tax return? 

21 And if you're in that situation, you're not subject to 

22 the penalty. It's also if the cost of insurance would 

23 be more than 8 percent of your income, you're not 

24 subject to the penalty.

 So, there isn't necessarily a precise

2 Medicaid eligibility at the present moment. That will 

3 depend on where things are and what the eligibility 

4 requirements are in the State.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But for those people 

6 below --

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. As a general 

8 matter, for people below the poverty line, it's almost 

9 inconceivable that they're ever going to be subject to 

the penalty, and they would, after the Act's Medicaid 

11 reforms go into place, be eligible for Medicaid at that 

12 point. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: So, is your point that the 

14 tax and authority -- what we want to do is get money 

from these people. Most of them will bet -- that the 

16 money by buying the insurance, and that will help pay. 

17 But if they don't, they're going to pay this penalty, 

18 and that will help, too. And the fact that we put the 

19 latter in brings it within the taxing power. But as far 

as this Act is concerned, about the injunction, they 

21 called it a penalty and not a tax for a reason. They 

22 wanted it to fall outside that.

textual instruction in the Affordable Care Act or in the 

6 Internal Revenue Code that that penalty should be 

7 treated as a tax --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except you --

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- for Anti-Injunction 

Act purposes. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with 

12 Mr. Long, isn't -- I mean, I thought you just agreed 

13 with Justice Breyer that one of the purposes of the 

14 provision is to raise revenue.

 GENERAL VERRILLI: It will -- well, it 

16 will raise revenue. It has been predicted by the CBO 

17 that it will raise revenue, Your Honor. But even though 

18 that's the case -- and I think that would be true of 

19 any -- of any penalty, that it will raise some revenue, 

but even though that's the case, there still needs to be 

21 textual instruction in the statute that this penalty 

22 should be treated as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act 

23 purposes, and that's what's lacking here. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: After this takes effect, 

there may be a lot of people who are assessed the

1 penalty and disagree either with whether they should be

3 the amount of their penalty. So, under your 

4 interpretation of the Act, all of them can now go to 

court? None of them are barred by the Anti-Injunction 

6 Act? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Those are two different 

8 things, Justice Alito. I think for reasons that 

9 Justice Kennedy, I think, suggested in one of his 

questions to Mr. Long, all of the other doctrines, that 

11 exhaustion of remedies and related doctrines, would 

12 still be there, and the United States would rely on them 

13 in those circumstances. And -- and so, I don't think 

14 the answer is that they can all go to court, no.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why isn't --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Two former -- two former 

17 commissioners of the IRS have filed a brief saying that 

18 your interpretation is going to lead to a flooded 

19 litigation. Now, they're wrong on that?

 GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. We don't -- we've 

21 taken this position after very careful consideration, 

22 and we've assessed the institutional interests of the 

23 United States, and we think we're in the right place.

immediately after instituted unless a copyright is 

6 registered. 

7  MR. KATSAS: Unless the copyright is 

8 registered. And this goes -- this goes to the character 

9 of the lawsuit. The statute in Reed Elsevier says 

register your copyright and then come back to court. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, why isn't that like

13 copyright infringement, you have to register your

 MR. KATSAS: It -- it's a precondition to 

16 filing suit. The -- the analogous precondition here is 

17 pay your taxes and then come back to court. The point 

18 is --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that -- that's not 

true. The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the 

21 action. It has to do with the form of relief that 

22 Congress is barring. It's not permitting -- it is not a 

23 tax case; you can come in afterwards. It's not 

24 permitting the court to exercise what otherwise would be 

one of its powers.

1  MR. KATSAS: It has to be the same 

2 challenge, Justice Sotomayor, or else South 

3 Carolina v. Regan would say the Anti-Injunction Act 

4 doesn't apply. You are right that once you file -- once 

you pay your taxes and then file the refund action, the 

6 act of filing the taxes converts the suit from one 

7 seeking prospective relief into one seeking money 

8 damages. And in that sense, you could think of the 

9 statute as a remedial limitation on the courts.

 But whether you think of it as an exhaustion 

11 requirement or a remedial limitation, neither of those 

12 characterizations is jurisdictional. In 

13 Davis v. Passman, you said that a remedial limitation 

14 doesn't go --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does seem strange to 

16 think of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a 

17 certain action and give a certain remedy as merely a 

18 claim-processing rule. What the -- the court is being 

19 ousted from -- from what would otherwise be its power to 

hear something. 

21  MR. KATSAS: The suit is being delayed, I 

22 think, is the right way of looking at it. The 

23 jurisdictional apparatus in the district court is 

24 present. Prospective relief under 1331, money damages 

action under 1346. If the Anti-Injunction Act were

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how do you deal with 

this case and our Gonzalez -- our recent Gonzalez case, 

6 where we talked about --

7  MR. KATSAS: Right. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the language of the 

9 COA statute, that no appeal will be heard absent the 

issuance of? 

11  MR. KATSAS: Gonzalez -- Gonzalez v. Thaler 

12 rests on a special rule that applies with respect to 

13 appeals from one Article III court to another. 

14 That's -- that explains Gonzalez, and it explains Bowles 

before it. 

16  You have five unanimous opinions in the last 

17 decade in which you have strongly gone the other 

18 direction on what counts as jurisdictional. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is an argument 

that we should just simply say that Bowles applies only 

21 to appeals, but we haven't said that. 

22  MR. KATSAS: Though, you came very close. 

23 In Henderson, Justice Sotomayor, you said that Bowles, 

24 which is akin to Thaler, is explained by the special 

rules and understandings governing appeals from one

1 Article III court to another. And you specifically said 

2 that it does not apply to situations involving a party 

3 seeking initial judicial review of agency action, which 

4 is what we have here.

 So, while you're right, the texts in Bowles 

6 and Thaler are not terribly different, those cases are 

7 explained by that principle. Under Henderson, it 

8 doesn't apply to this case. 

9  The text in this case speaks to the suit, 

the cause of action of the litigant. It doesn't speak 

11 to the jurisdiction or power of the court. The 

12 Anti-Injunction Act is placed in a section of the tax 

13 code governing procedure. It's not placed in --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of those --

all of that in particular --

16  MR. KATSAS: You did rely on that in Reed 

17 Elsevier as one consideration. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And we haven't relied on 

19 it in other cases.

 MR. KATSAS: Another -- another 

21 consideration in Reed Elsevier that cuts in our favor is 

22 the presence of exceptions. You said three in Reed 

23 Elsevier cut against jurisdictional characterization. 

24 Here, there are 11. And --

2  MR. KATSAS: Well, some of them have no 

3 jurisdictional language at all, and not a single one of 

4 them uses the word "jurisdiction" to describe the 

ability of the court to restrain the assessment and 

6 collection of taxes, which is what one would have 

7 expected --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: It basically, basically the 

9 difference -- of language is relevant. There are a lot 

of relevant things. But one thing that's relevant in my 

11 mind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the 

12 life's blood of government. 

13  MR. KATSAS: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And so, what Congress is 

trying to do is to say there is a procedure here that 

16 you go through. You can get your money back, or you go 

17 through the Tax Court, but don't do this in advance for 

18 the reason that we don't want 500 Federal judge --

19 judges substituting their idea of what is a proper 

equitable defense, of when there shouldn't be an 

21 exception made about da, da, da, for the basic rule. 

22 No. Okay?

24 there. You tried to apply that reason to the copyright

6  JUSTICE BREYER: The language -- you're -- I 

7 see the similarity of language. I've got that. But 

8 it's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for 

9 not wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant 

role in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional. 

11 Plus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that 

12 Northrop or whatever that other case is. 

13  MR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, as to 

14 reasoning, you -- you give an argument -- you give an 

argument why, as a policy matter, it might make sense to 

16 have a non-jurisdictional statute. But of course, this 

17 Court's recent cases time and again say Congress has to 

18 clearly rank the statute as non-jurisdictional in its 

19 text and structure. It seems to me a general appeal to 

statutory policies doesn't speak with sufficient 

21 clarity --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: That's fine. I just asked

1 this view. It is true that in most cases, the 

2 government doesn't want and Congress doesn't want people 

3 coming into court. But Davis shows that there may be 

4 some cases including, for instance, constitutional 

challenges to landmark Federal statutes where the 

6 government sensibly decides that its revenue-raising 

7 purposes are better served by allowing a party to come 

8 into court and waiving its defense. That's what the 

9 Solicitor General did in Davis, and this Court accepted 

that waiver. 

11  As for prior cases, we have the holding in 

12 Davis and the holding in all of the equitable exception

2 All of your cases analyze the situation as if a statute 

3 is jurisdictional, then it's not subject to waiver. If 

4 you were to construe this as such a one-off unique 

statute, it seems to me we would still win because the 

6 Solicitor General with full knowledge of the 

7 Anti-Injunction Act argument available to him 

8 affirmatively gave it up. This is not just a forfeiture 

9 where a government lawyer is -- through inadvertence 

fails to raise an argument. This is a case where the 

11 government --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They raised it and then 

13 gave it up. 

14  MR. KATSAS: They made it below. They know 

what it is. And not only are they not pursuing it here; 

16 they're affirmatively pursuing an argument on the other 

17 side. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, is your basic 

19 position that when we're talking about the jurisdiction 

of the district courts, a statute has to say it's 

21 jurisdictional to be jurisdictional? 

22  MR. KATSAS: I wouldn't go quite that far. 

23 I think at a minimum, it has -- it has to either say 

24 that or at least be directed to the courts, which is a 

formulation you've used in your cases and which is the

1 formulation that Congress used in the Tax Injunction Act 

2 but did not use in this statute. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is -- I mean, I 

4 suppose one could try to make a distinction between this 

case and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference 

6 between instituting something and maintaining something. 

7 I'm suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant 

8 does, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more 

9 what a judge does.

 MR. KATSAS: I don't think so, Justice 

11 Kagan, because we have an adversarial system, not an 

12 inquisitorial one. The parties maintain their lawsuits, 

13 I think, is the more natural way of thinking of it. 

14  If I could turn -- if I could turn to the 

merits question on the AIA before my time runs out. 

16  The purpose of this lawsuit is to challenge 

17 a requirement -- a Federal requirement to buy health 

18 insurance. That requirement itself is not a tax. And 

19 for that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act 

doesn't apply. 

21  What the amicus effectively seeks to do is 

22 extend the Anti-Injunction Act, not just to taxes which 

23 is how the statute is written, but to free-standing, 

24 nontax legal duties. And it's just --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point --

1 the whole point of the suit is to prevent the collection

3  MR. KATSAS: Of taxes, Mr. Chief Justice. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, prevent the 

collection of taxes. But the idea that the mandate is 

6 something separate from whether you want to call it a 

7 penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense. 

8  MR. KATSAS: It's entirely separate, and let 

9 me explain to you why.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a command. A 

11 mandate is a command. 

12  MR. KATSAS: Right. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, if there's 

14 nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what 

happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer 

16 is nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the 

17 punishment from the crime. 

18  MR. KATSAS: I'm not sure the answer is 

19 nothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to 

me there is a difference between what the law requires 

21 and what enforcement consequences happen to you. This 

22 statute was very deliberately written to separate 

23 mandate from penalty in several different ways. 

24  They are put in separate sections. The 

mandate is described as a "legal requirement" no fewer

1 than 20 times, 3 times in the operative text and 17 

2 times in the findings. It's imposed through use of a 

3 mandatory verb "shall." The requirement is very well 

4 defined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a 

general exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty. 

6  Congress then separated out mandate 

7 exceptions from penalty exceptions. It defined one 

8 category of people not subject to the mandate. One 

9 would think those are the category of people as to whom 

Congress is saying you need not follow this law. It 

11 then defined a separate category of people not subject 

12 to the penalty, but subject to the mandate. I don't 

13 know what that could mean other than --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would you 

have a requirement that is completely toothless? Pay --

16 you know, buy insurance or else. Or else what? Or else 

17 nothing. 

18  MR. KATSAS: Because Congress reasonably 

19 could think that at least some people will follow the 

law precisely because it is the law. And let me give 

21 you an example of one category of person that might be: 

22 The very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but 

23 subject to the mandate. 

24  Mr. Long says this must be a mandate 

exemption because it would be wholly harsh and 

67

25

Official 

1 unreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very 

2 poor to comply with a requirement to obtain health 

3 insurance when they have no means of doing so. 

4  That gets things exactly backwards. The 

very poor are the people Congress would be most 

6 concerned about with respect to the mandate to the 

7 extent one of the justifications for the mandate is to 

8 prevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive 

9 uncompensated care. So, they would have had very good 

reason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and 

11 then they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the 

12 very poor a means of complying with the insurance 

13 mandate, and that is through the Medicaid system. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, do you think a 

person who is subject to the mandate but not subject to 

16 the penalty would have standing? 

17  MR. KATSAS: Yes, I think that person would, 

18 because that person is injured by compliance with the 

19 mandate.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And what would that look 

21 like? What would the argument be as to what the injury 

22 was? 

23  MR. KATSAS: The injury -- when that person 

24 is subject to the mandate, that person is required to 

purchase health insurance. That's a forced acquisition

1 of an unwanted good. It's a classic pocketbook injury. 

2  But even if I'm wrong about that question, 

3 Justice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring 

4 the challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very 

different -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very 

6 different from the actual plaintiffs. We have 

7 individuals who are planning for compliance in order to 

8 avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say. 

9 And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to 

all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to 

11 enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into 

12 Medicaid by virtue of the mandate. 

13  So, we don't have the problem of no adverse 

14 consequences in the case.

 And then, we have the separate distinction 

16 between the question of who has Article III standing in 

17 order to maintain a suit and the question of who is 

18 subject to a legal obligation. And you've said in your 

19 cases that even if there may be no one who has standing 

to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility 

21 clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the 

22 legal obligation into a legal nullity. 

23  Finally, with respect to the States, even if 

24 we are wrong about everything I've said so far, the 

States clearly fall within the exception recognized in

2 mandate because the mandate forces 6 million new people 

3 onto their Medicaid rolls. But they are not directly 

4 subject to the mandate, nor could they violate the 

mandate and incur a penalty. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I just understand, Mr. 

7 Katsas, when the States say that they're injured, are 

8 they talking about the people who are eligible now but 

9 who are not enrolled? Or are they also talking about 

people who will become newly eligible? 

11  MR. KATSAS: It's people who will enroll --

12 people who wouldn't have enrolled had they been given a 

13 voluntary choice. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: But who are eligible now.

 MR. KATSAS: That's the largest category. I 

16 think there could be future eligibles who would enroll 

17 because they're subject to a legal obligation but 

18 wouldn't have enrolled if given a voluntary choice. 

19  But I'm happy to -- I'm happy to focus on 

currently eligible people who haven't enrolled in 

21 Medicaid. That particular class is the one that gives 

22 rise to, simply in Florida alone, a pocketbook injury on 

23 the order of 500 to $600 million per year.

suggest that the State is being injured because people

7 all who are eligible and choose to obtain it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would somebody not 

11 choose to obtain it? Why -- that's one puzzle to me.

13 eligible; Medicaid doesn't cost them anything. Why 

14 would they resist enrolling?

16 Ginsburg. All I know is that the difference between 

17 current enrollees and people who could enroll but have 

18 not is, as I said, on the -- is a $600 million delta.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it may be just that 

21 they haven't been given sufficient information to 

22 understand that this is a benefit for them.

the third-party actions are not unfettered in the sense 

6 of Lujan; they are coerced in the sense of 

7 Bennett v. Spear. Those people are enrolling because 

8 they're under a legal obligation to do so. 

9  The second argument made against the States' 

standing is that the States somehow forfeit their 

11 ability to challenge the constitutionality of a 

12 provision of Federal law because they voluntarily choose 

13 to participate --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? What does 

19 the fact that the State is challenging Medicaid -- how 

does it give the State standing to challenge an 

21 obligation that is not imposed on the State in any way?

Federal tax, but because of its relationship to the

1 same manner as taxes. And the parties' principal 

2 argument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act 

3 applicable is that, well, that simply goes to the 

4 Secretary's activities.

 And I would simply ask, if you look at 

6 chapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which 

7 are the chapters on assessment and collection, they are 

8 not just addressed to the Secretary. There are many 

9 provisions in there that are addressed to courts and 

indeed talk about this interaction, the very limited 

11 situations in which courts are permitted to restrain the 

12 assessment and collection of taxes. 

13  There was a statement made that there 

14 aren't -- and many of the exceptions to the 

Anti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection 

16 provisions -- there was a statement made that none of 

17 these directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the 

18 assessment and collection of taxes. That's not true. 

19 In footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several.

 I'll simply mention section 6213 as an 

21 example. That says -- I quote: "Notwithstanding the 

22 provisions of section 7421(a), the making of such 

23 assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy 

24 during the time such prohibition is in force may be 

enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including

1 the Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction 

2 to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund 

3 under this subsection unless a timely petition for 

4 redetermination of the deficiency has been filed and 

then only in respect of the deficiency that is the 

6 subject of such petition." 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: All that's going to really 

8 what I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in 

9 sticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and --

and it's certainly an argument in your favor. 

11  The over-arching thing in my mind is it's up 

12 to Congress, within leeway. And they did not use that 

13 word "tax," and they did have a couple of exceptions. 

14 And it is true that all this language that you quote --

you know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks 

16 about the use of "tax" in the IRC. It talks about the 

17 penalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter. 

18 And we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability 

19 provided by a different law, which says collect it 

through the subchapter. And it has nothing to do with 

21 the IRC. See? 

22  So, we've got it in a separate place. We 

23 can see pretty clearly what they're trying to do. They 

24 couldn't really care very much about interfering with 

collecting this one. That's all the statutory argument.

making. 

6  MR. LONG: I mean, I think I'm following 

7 you, but the fact that it's not in the particular 

8 subchapter for assessable penalties in my view makes no 

9 difference, because they said it's still clearly -- it's 

assessed and collected in the same manner --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it is.

18 indication that the Anti-Injunction Act applies. 

19  The -- the refund statute that does 

specifically refer to penalties -- that has nothing to 

21 do with this argument that it's assessed and collected 

22 in the same manner as a tax. That would simply go to 

23 the point that, well, you can't just call it a tax, 

24 because they've referred to it as a penalty.

 And, finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I

1 think the key point is we have a long line of this 

2 Court's decisions that's really been ratified by 

3 Congress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional 

4 terms.

 As I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel, 

6 the gist of those decisions was not any sort of special 

7 rule about appeals, It's that when we have that 

8 situation, which I would submit applies as much to the 

9 collection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from 

Federal district courts when we have this degree of --

11 of precedent, including precedent from Congress in the 

12 form of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that 

13 should be -- the presumption should be that this is 

14 jurisdictional.

 If there are no further questions. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long, you were 

17 invited by this Court to defend the proposition that the 

18 Anti-Injunction Act barred this litigation. You have 

19 ably carried out that responsibility, for which the 

Court is grateful. 

21  MR. LONG: Thank you. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will continue 

23 argument in this case tomorrow. 

24  (Whereupon, at 11:41 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
