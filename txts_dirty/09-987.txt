7  General. 

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

11  GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, 

12 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

13  For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private 

14 citizens to contribute money to private organizations 

set up by private individuals and has let those 

16 organizations use that money towards scholarships when 

17 individuals apply for them. The Ninth Circuit erred 

18 first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had 

19 standing, and second in striking the program down.

 On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the 

21 three necessary elements. Regarding injury in fact, the 

22 key point is this: Not a cent of the Respondents' money 

23 goes to fund religion. If you placed an electronic tag 

24 to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent 

plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a 

4

Official 

1 cent, would go into any religious school's coffers. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, their point 

3 is that this tax money does belong to the State that the 

4 private individuals are using, because it is money that, 

even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the 

6 State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the 

7 State's money, and it's giving you by its largesse the 

8 right to redirect it. That's their argument. 

9  GENERAL KATYAL: Right, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it would be the 

11 taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they 

12 could sustain their claim. 

13  GENERAL KATYAL: There are two problems with 

14 that. One has to do with injury in fact. The other has 

to do with redressability. With respect to injury in 

16 fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars, 

17 it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike 

18 the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court 

19 has considered taxpayer standing for religion.

 Their complaint is not that the government 

21 is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money 

22 that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers. 

23 Their complaint is that someone else's money is not 

24 being extracted and spent enough. And the relevant 

language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 occur, that, quote, "his tax money" must be extracted 

2 and spent, and here that's not occurring. 

3  Now, with respect to the other argument, not 

4 injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our 

point is this: It's speculative as to whether or not 

6 that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice 

7 Sotomayor, would actually happen. As this Court said in 

8 Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes 

9 that actually reduces the amount of money the government 

has to spend. It doesn't increase it. And so that's 

11 different than the direct outlay that was at issue in 

12 Flast. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Then is it constitutional 

14 if we get a new system? Here's what the system will be: 

The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a 

16 box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a 

17 possible system -- what happens is that that check is 

18 cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the 

19 local priest to say prayers for the individual who 

contributed the money. And, in your view, there is no 

21 one who could challenge that? 

22  GENERAL KATYAL: Well, let me say two things 

23 about that. First is: That is not all that different, 

24 Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3) 

deductions.

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: The difference is, of 

2 course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in 

3 this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that 

4 would otherwise go into the coffer.

 GENERAL KATYAL: That -- that's -­

6  JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. But I'm 

7 interested in, conceptually, does the Government think 

8 that there is no one who could challenge that? 

9  GENERAL KATYAL: I don't think that any 

taxpayer could challenge that. That is, depending on 

11 the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the 

12 government is specifying which religious organizations 

13 might be eligible for the check box. But if the 

14 government is doing something that is under-inclusive 

and only giving tax credits to one set of religious 

16 organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, where 

17 this Court -­

18  JUSTICE BREYER: So, if you go back into 

19 history, it could have been the case that the -- as long 

as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress 

21 could have funded prayers throughout the nation in 

22 churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not 

23 have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had, 

24 nobody could have challenged it.

 GENERAL KATYAL: No, Justice Breyer. Two

1 things on that. First is: We're only talking about 

2 standing, not the merits. And with respect to standing, 

3 if the government funded only religious organizations or 

4 religious prayer, I do think that other organizations 

would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this 

6 Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say 

7 there's an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer 

8 standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other 

9 organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because 

they're -­

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General -- counsel, does 

12 anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this 

13 scheme? 

14  GENERAL KATYAL: The way this scheme is set 

up, our answer is no. And I think that accords with 

16 this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer 

17 standing in this area. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we leave out the 

19 fine points that you were discussing, isn't the 

underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the 

21 Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we 

22 recognize taxpayer standing? 

23  GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't see that, 

24 Justice Ginsburg, in Flast. I think Flast is a very 

narrow exception for when someone's dollars are being

1 taken out of their pocket and spent by the government on 

2 religion, and I don't think that's happening here. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right -­

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Flast is gone; is that 

right? Flast is gone. There is no more -- nothing more 

6 to Flast, because it just happened that nobody had 

7 thought of this system at the time of Flast. 

8  GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Breyer -­

9  JUSTICE BREYER: If they had, they could 

have had -- what? 

11  GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Breyer, I don't 

12 think Flast is gone at all. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 

14  GENERAL KATYAL: -- when there is direct 

government outlays to spend on religion, like Flast. I 

16 mean, that -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but you don't need be, 

18 because all you have to do to get around it is to create 

19 what we have here.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that that 

21 can get around it -- that can get around it in some 

22 circumstances. And, again, those who are under-included 

23 in a government program may have standing, not as a 

24 taxpayer.

 But, at the end of the day, Justice Breyer,

1 if that's the result, that's the result for every other 

2 clause in the Constitution. Taxpayer standing is the 

3 most narrow of exceptions, and -­

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is -- there is a 

plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights, and most 

6 provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose free 

7 speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have. 

8 It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I 

9 thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was 

in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was 

11 responding to. 

12  GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't see that in 

13 Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think 

14 this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that 

if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff 

16 with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our 

17 general requirements of Article III standing. 

18  And here, if you granted the plaintiffs 

19 standing, what you would be granting is, for the first 

time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about 

21 someone else's money not being spent to a high enough 

22 level. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: So if you are right, General 

24 Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz, 

Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case, 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 just a few years ago? That the Court was without 

2 authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow 

3 nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG 

4 recognize that fact. The SG participated, I believe, in 

each of those cases. 

6  GENERAL KATYAL: Right. So let me say two 

7 things about that. 

8  First is, I do think it's very much just 

9 like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with 

this exact problem. The Court had conferred standing in 

11 taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and 

12 then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as 

13 a question about Article III standing, the Court said: 

14 No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those 

cases. So my answer to you is yes. 

16  Now, I do think that this Court's decision 

17 in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental 

18 principles and the limits on Flast. And I think the 

19 Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go 

no further than the facts of Flast. 

21  And to grant standing here, you have to 

22 go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about: a 

23 direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money 

24 out of someone's pocket to fund religion.

 GENERAL KAGAN: But I -­

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make sure I 

2 heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes. 

3 In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism 

4 of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those 

cases were wrongly decided. 

6  GENERAL KATYAL: They -- they could have 

7 gone out -- the results may have been the same. It just 

8 would have been -- would have been on standing instead 

9 of the merits. Mueller, for example, upheld the 

program. So the bottom-line decision would have been 

11 the same, but the way in which the Court got there would 

12 have been so that there was no tax -­

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you would have said 

14 there would have been no standing in those cases.

 GENERAL KATYAL: No taxpayer standing. Now, 

16 there may have been other forms of standing, Texas 

17 Monthly standing, that could have been alleged to 

18 challenge those programs, but yes. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't -- it 

wasn't -- I don't remember whether the Government 

21 participated in the Winn case when it came up under the 

22 Tax Injunction Act. 

23  GENERAL KATYAL: We did, and in the first 

24 footnote -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there wasn't a word

1 from the Government about lack of standing. 

2  GENERAL KATYAL: The first footnote in the 

3 brief, Justice Ginsburg, acknowledged the fact that 

4 standing hadn't been pushed or pressed below. But I 

acknowledge that, particularly in the wake of Hein, 

6 should another case arise, the Government will -- will 

7 acknowledge the standing defects and brief them as we 

8 are here. 

9  Our point on redressability is not simply 

that the -- that the tax -- that the cost of the program 

11 is speculative. It's also that the relief that the 

12 plaintiffs are seeking in this case won't redress their 

13 problem. That is, if you gave the plaintiffs everything 

14 they're asking for, the very same religious schools and 

the very same religious STOs would continue to be 

16 funded. The very same religious STOs would continue to 

17 be funded because they would leave in place -- and this 

18 was my answer to Justice Breyer -- the tax deduction, 

19 the 501(c)(3) tax deduction. And so there would still 

be government revenue being spent in favor of these 

21 religious STOs under their program. It would just be at 

22 the level of one-third instead of 100 percent. 

23  I don't think that satisfies their problem. 

24 I don't think James Madison 's remonstrance would be 

satisfied if they were -- if Madison were told: Well,

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA S. BICKETT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MS. BICKETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Arizona's tuition tax credit does not 

12 violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral 

13 law that results in scholarship programs of private 

14 choice. It's neutral because, like the tax deduction 

that the Court upheld in Mueller, it's one of many 

16 tax-saving devices, including some 26 other credits that 

17 are available to Arizona taxpayers on a neutral basis. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Bickett, could you 

19 explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and 

puzzling over this scheme. Could you tell me why 

21 Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more 

22 typical tuition voucher scheme? In other tuition 

23 voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher 

24 or scholarship or what have you. This is so much more 

complicated and complex and unusual. And it just left

Official 

1 me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks 

2 the advantages are of it now? 

3  MS. BICKETT: Yes, Justice Kagan. One of 

4 the things that is true in Arizona that was not true in 

Ohio is that, under the Arizona Constitution, any direct 

6 aid to private schools is prohibited. 

7  The other thing about the tax credit program 

8 is that it does encourage contributions not only from 

9 parents but from the community at large. And this -­

this then provides money for low-income students, 

11 students from low-income families. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the record show the 

13 extent to which there are donations by people who do not 

14 have students?

 MS. BICKETT: Could you -­

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the -- does the 

17 record show the extent to which there are these 

18 additional donations that you just referred to? 

19  MS. BICKETT: Your Honor, of course, it was 

at a motion to dismiss phase. What the record shows is 

21 that there's some reports that -- studies that have been 

22 done that show that there have been some children that 

23 have switched from public schools to private schools as 

24 a result of the program, that many of the scholarship 

programs are -- in fact, most of the scholarship 

15

1 programs provide scholarships based on financial need. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't -- I don't 

3 think you answered his question. The question was, is 

4 there anything in the record that shows whether any of 

the money that's involved here comes not from parents, 

6 but rather from others who can contribute to the 

7 program? 

8  MS. BICKETT: Well, what the record shows is 

9 that there have been -- there's a large amount of 

contributions. There is $55 million. It doesn't -- we 

11 have Arizona Department of Revenue reports that list the 

12 number of contributors and who contributes -- or not the 

13 individuals who contribute. I -- it doesn't 

14 specifically line out who the contributors are, whether 

they are parents, or whether they are not parents. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose if some of 

17 the contributions are considerable, like a million 

18 dollars, that couldn't be just a parent, right? 

19  MS. BICKETT: You're right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are there contributions of 

21 that size? 

22  MS. BICKETT: Again, the record doesn't show 

23 what the size of the contributions are. It shows the -­

24 the number of contributions and the total amount of 

contributions.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could only 

2 get -- if you give a million dollars, you still only get 

3 a $500 tax credit, right? 

4  MS. BICKETT: That's correct, Your Honor.

 The -- the programs are programs of private 

6 choice, because any aid that reaches religious schools 

7 does so after -- only after at least four levels of 

8 private decisionmaking. Arizona sets up the neutral 

9 rules for the -- this tax credit, and after that, 

private individuals and organizations take over. Anyone 

11 can form a school tuition organization, and the increase 

12 in the number and diversity of school tuition 

13 organizations over the 13 years that the tax credit has 

14 been in existence demonstrates, in fact, that -- that 

this is free for everyone to participate in. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Something that worried me 

17 in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer. 

18 Probably Arizona spends some billions of dollars on 

19 public schools, doesn't it? I don't know what the exact 

amount is. 

21  MS. BICKETT: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's take 30 or 

23 40 percent of that and spend it through this program on 

24 religious schools. Imagine that happens. At that 

point, people might get into considerable discussion

2 it's a valid school, or is it just teaching religion,

4 dealing with this problem? By saying there are no 

regulations, by saying that we're not -- is there a 

6 system for dealing with the legitimacy and the 

7 circumstances under which a particular religion's 

8 schools qualify for this program? Who decides and how? 

9  MS. BICKETT: Well, under the tax credit 

program -­

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that must be a set of 

16 regulations and rules. 

17  MS. BICKETT: Primarily what it is, is that 

18 private schools in Arizona satisfy the compulsory 

19 education law as long as they meet the requirements that 

the public schools have in terms of providing 

21 qualitatively the subject matter that the public 

22 schools -­

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: And those standards have 

24 nothing to do with this program. They are standards

4  JUSTICE BREYER: And when do they teach the 

religious part of their program? 

6  MS. BICKETT: Excuse me? 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, when does a private 

8 school -- normally the schools -- I mean, I'm not an 

9 expert, but what you have to do to be a school is a very 

complex thing, and you have all kinds of requirements 

11 that eat up quite a lot of the day. And I just wonder 

12 how the religion part fits in. Has there turned out to 

13 be no problem? When do they -- do they teach religion 

14 at 6:00 in the morning? Does it matter if the person's 

qualified? How does the -- I once had a case on this in 

16 the First Circuit, and it came out to be surprisingly 

17 complex, and I just wondered how -- if there turned out 

18 to be any problem at all in Arizona in this area. 

19  MS. BICKETT: Justice Breyer, the record 

doesn't reflect that, and I am not aware of any problem 

21 with private schools in Arizona and certainly not that 

22 have participated in this tax credit program.

6 private institution -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it's an STO. 

8  MS. BICKETT: And so that is a private

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. There are no 

11 attributes of State action that would suffice to allow a

7 the university from having tax-exempt status because 

8 that -- that violated public policy, and, therefore, 

9 they were not entitled to 501(c)(3) status. And so too 

here. All of these organizations are 501(c)(3)

don't get these tuition vouchers. But what the State 

21 has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that 

22 uses intermediaries that can make exactly that

make those distinctions?

9 tuition organizations that support solely secular 

schools are in existence, and there has been no problem

3 you, the -- there was one school tuition organization 

4 that pre-existed the tax credit, and certainly the 

private schools that participated in these for the most 

6 part did exist before this school tuition organization. 

7  What this program allows private 

8 organizations to do, it allows parents to get together 

9 with private schools and form school tuition 

organizations that then -­

12 was an STO before this program, but it didn't get the 

13 benefit of money from taxpayers that would have gone -­

14 that money went to -- to Arizona, not to the STO before 

this scheme was created. 

16  MS. BICKETT: Before this scheme was 

17 created, they would have gotten a tax deduction, a 

18 Federal tax deduction and a State tax deduction, instead 

19 of a tax credit. But the difference -- there is not a 

significant difference between a tax credit and a tax 

21 deduction in terms of constitutionality. The only 

22 difference between a tax deduction is that, for purposes 

23 of a tax deduction, it depends on -- the value of it 

24 depends on the tax bracket of the taxpayer, whereas a 

tax credit, the value depends -- is -- is equal for all

2 a distinction between tax credits, on the one hand, or 

3 tax exemptions, tax deductions. 

4  Under -- under Respondents' theory, any 

money that the government doesn't take in would then be 

6 the equivalent of State money, and that would then 

7 undermine 501(c)(3) corporations and all kinds of 

8 charitable organizations. What you need to look at

12 normally be entitled to if they give contributions to

Walz, in Hernandez.

17 distinguishing here between what Arizona is doing and

my question. It's how is it discriminating on the basis

8 not; it's treated the same? 

9  MR. BENDER: The STO -- most money is given 

out by STOs that do care whether it goes to a religious 

11 school.

13 going to the STO -- the State doesn't care whether it 

14 goes to a religious STO or a secular STO.

 MR. BENDER: That doesn't matter. If the 

16 State's grantee cares, that's unconstitutional.

18 that when you have the decision is made by a private 

19 entity whether to use the money to go to a religious 

school or a nonreligious school, that that doesn't 

21 violate the Constitution because the decision is not 

22 made by the State; it's made by the private recipient. 

23  MR. BENDER: I believe the Court held the 

24 opposite in Bowen, where the decision to use the money 

for religious purposes was made by the grantee, not made

6 face because -- it wasn't unconstitutional because 

7 religious organizations could participate as grantees.

religion.

4 services on the basis of religion, that would violate 

the Establishment Clause. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know that the schools 

7 here do that? There are some religious schools. Do we 

8 know that these religious schools do not admit people 

9 except of a certain religion?

 MR. BENDER: Well, I think we do know that, 

11 and the complaint alleges that, but that's not the 

12 point. The point is not what the religious schools do; 

13 the point is what the STOs do. The STOs are government 

14 grantees. They are distributing government funds. The 

Constitution prohibits organizations that distribute 

16 government funds as part of a government spending 

17 program to do it on the basis of religion.

19 that it's government funds, that any money the 

government doesn't take from me, because it gives me a 

21 deduction, is government money. I mean, that's the

1 time this tax credit is taken, the taxpayer owes the

3 You've got to pay that $5,000. You can't keep it. It's 

4 not your money. You can't keep it. It's not that all 

of your money is the government's money; it's that this 

6 $5,000 that you owe the government as income taxes is 

7 the government's money. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: But why isn't that true of a 

9 tax deduction also? And this is a very modest tax 

credit. The tax deduction that a wealthy person would 

11 get by making a contribution to a college or university 

12 that has a religious affiliation is much more valuable 

13 than this $500 credit. 

14  MR. BENDER: It doesn't turn on whether it's 

valuable or not. It turns on whether when the taxpayer 

16 makes the payment the taxpayer is paying the taxpayer's 

17 own money or money the taxpayer owes to the government. 

18 When you make a charitable contribution, you're using 

19 your own money. That's not money you owe to the 

government. You don't know how much money you owe to 

21 the government until you figure out your taxes.

1 understand that. Somebody does know. It's December 

2 31st. They know -- they figure out how much tax they're 

3 going to have to pay for that year. They know exactly. 

4 They can know exactly what their taxes will be. And it 

will be X, and if they make a -- a deduction, then it 

6 will be X minus Y. What is the difference? 

7  MR. BENDER: The difference is -- that -- to 

8 me, the broad difference is that the tax deduction is 

9 given for charitable contributions. And I think the 

Court would decide if it faced the question -- I don't 

11 think it's ever had to -- that it is constitutional for 

12 the government to support private charity. And if the 

13 government is going to support private charity by 

14 letting you deduct charitable contributions, it can't 

leave religious charities out of that program. That 

16 would violate the Establishment Clause. 

17  So if you believe that the charitable 

18 deduction in the Federal income tax is a constitutional 

19 thing for the government to do, to support private 

charity by picking up part of the tab -- that's true 

21 when there's a deduction -- then you have to give the 

22 deduction to people who contribute to religion. 

23  So, yes, there is a government support for 

24 that private charitable contribution, but it's a 

charitable contribution.

11  Now, in Zelman, the holding, I would 

12 think -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now

form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to 

16 use for such education as they wish, that met certain 

17 standards, including religious schools. 

18  So what's the difference between the program 

19 here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?

 MR. BENDER: The difference is that, in 

21 Zelman, the money went to the parents without any 

22 religious discrimination. Religion was not involved in 

23 the distribution of the money to the parents. The

2  MR. BENDER: It's not a parent, by the way, 

3 in answer to Justice Kennedy's question before. Parents 

4 under this program are not allowed to give contributions 

for scholarships for their own children. The people who 

6 get the -- who can claim the tax credit, the person that 

7 gets the scholarship cannot be a dependent of the person 

8 who gives the contribution. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose they change 

one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this: They 

11 said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify 

12 for your child to go to the school that you wish to go 

13 to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you 

14 want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's 

absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice 

16 versa. 

17  Now, in your opinion, that then would be 

18 constitutional? 

19  MR. BENDER: Yes. We only challenge -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes? The answer is yes? 

21  MR. BENDER: Yes. Yes.

 MR. BENDER: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought another part 

7 of your complaint was that the STOs were giving just to 

8 the religious schools. 

9  MR. BENDER: STOs don't give scholarships to 

religious schools. They give scholarships to parents.

 MR. BENDER: To attend that school, yes.

18 the recipient, the recipient child, be of a particular 

19 religion?

 MR. BENDER: Both of them, yes. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Could I ask you: Is

8 program? Has the State said who the beneficiaries of 

9 this program are? Are the beneficiaries of this program 

the parents, or are the beneficiaries of this program 

11 the general taxpayers? 

12  MR. BENDER: The beneficiaries of this 

13 program are the parents and children. That's what this 

14 program is for. The State set up a program to help 

parents send their children to non-public schools, and 

16 to do that, they are going to give them scholarships. 

17 Scholarship money is going to be made available.

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bender, can I go back

12 that taxpayer has the whole universe to spend it on: 

13 Buying clothes, on gambling, on this charity, that 

14 charity. But your point here is this contributor does 

not have the universe to pick and is free to pick a 

16 charity. This one has -- you either give it to the 

17 government or you give it to the STO. That's -­

18  MR. BENDER: Exactly. Right. Yes. It's 

19 not -- it's not the taxpayers' money. It's confusing 

because we're talking about two kinds of taxpayers here. 

21 We're talking about my clients, who are general 

22 taxpayers, whose money is being used to fund this 

23 program, and we're talking about the taxpayers who take

taxpayers.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: So if Arizona had a statute 

2 that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals 

3 who make charitable contributions to educational 

4 institutions, there would be a problem there, because 

they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable 

6 contributions? 

7  MR. BENDER: No, Justice Alito. I think it 

8 would be constitutional if it said that you get a 

9 deduction for making a charitable contribution to an 

educational organization and that that can include a 

11 religious educational organization, because if it 

12 didn't, it would be unconstitutional. 

13  You can't set up a program that gives you a 

14 deduction for giving to educational institutions but not 

to -- not to a religious organization. That would be 

16 unconstitutional. If you're going to support private 

17 charity, you have to support religious charity in the 

18 same way you support nonreligious charity. But 

19 if you're going to have somebody -­

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought your answer to 

21 Justice Ginsberg was the difference between this and the 

22 Federal tax deduction for charitable contributions was 

23 that the Federal tax deduction is available for a broad 

24 range of charities, whereas this is available only for a 

very narrow range.

Official 

1  MR. BENDER: I may have misunderstood her 

2 question. I think her question was: At the time the 

3 taxpayer makes the charitable contribution that he is 

4 going to take a deduction for, the taxpayer could do 

anything he wants with that money. He could take a 

6 vacation. He could give it to a charity. He could -­

7 he could buy clothes with it. He could buy food with 

8 it. It's a completely open system. Nobody tells the 

9 taxpayer what he has to do.

 In this case, when the taxpayer writes that 

11 check to the STO, the taxpayer can't keep that money, 

12 can't use it on a vacation, can't use it for buying 

13 food, has to either pay it to the State or, with the 

14 State's authorization, pay it to an STO.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing is true of 

16 charitable deductions. When you take a charitable 

17 deduction, you -- you don't have the money anymore. You 

18 have given it to a charitable organization. 

19  Now, you are allowed to give it to a 

particular religion, a particular church, and there 

21 seems to be nothing unconstitutional about that, right?

2 supports people of a particular religion to go to that 

3 school? I don't see any difference. 

4  MR. BENDER: There's nothing 

unconstitutional about the taxpayers sending the money 

6 to an STO. If STOs did not discriminate on the basis of 

7 religion in giving that money out, there would be no 

8 unconstitutionality. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: But churches discriminate 

on the basis of religion. When I take my charitable 

11 deduction to give it to a particular church, that church 

12 discriminates on the basis of religion, but that's okay; 

13 isn't it? 

14  MR. BENDER: If the government said to you, 

you can pay your taxes -- don't pay your taxes to us, 

16 pay them to a church -- and the church gave its benefits 

17 only to people of a certain religion, I believe that 

18 would be unconstitutional. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's how the government 

puts it, the idea? So it really is just that line in -­

21 in the tax form that you are concerned about, and the 

22 only relief you really need is -- is changing the tax 

23 form?

charity and paying your taxes. When you make a

1 charitable contribution, you are making a charitable 

2 contribution. It costs you money. 

3  In Arizona, if you make a charitable 

4 contribution of $1,000, it costs you $950 if you're at 

the maximum tax rate, because the maximum tax rate is 

6 5 percent. In Arizona, if you take this tax credit, it 

7 costs you nothing. It's not charity. Charity is 

8 something -- you give something of your own, I believe. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Excuse me. Just to 

follow on Justice Scalia's question, because I want to 

11 make sure you have the answer: If this system were set 

12 up exactly as it is now, but Arizona said contributions

deductible from one's income tax? 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

17  MR. BENDER: And, yes. No, we would not 

18 have a problem with that. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only 

difference is that Arizona set up this system where you

13 Establishment Clause turns on? The -­

14  MR. BENDER: Yes, because that's still 

charity. If the top rate is 90 percent, when you give 

16 that money, it's your money; you can use it for anything 

17 you want. And even if you're in the 90 percent bracket, 

18 you are giving some of your own money. You are engaging 

19 in charity. And the Constitution, I think, permits the 

government to subsidize private charity. 

21  And if the government's going to subsidize 

22 private charity, it can't leave religious charities out. 

23 So that's the dividing line. Is the government 

24 subsidizing private charity? In this case, the

if the STOs did not discriminate at all on the basis 

6 of religion? 

7  MR. BENDER: Because it's perfectly okay to 

8 use government money for non-religiously discriminatory 

9 purposes. You can get a tax credit for buying a solar 

water heater. That's a 100 percent tax credit. Now, 

11 that's a somewhat different kind of tax credit, because 

12 there, when you buy the heater, you get something for 

13 the money. It's -- this tax credit is a very strange 

14 kind of tax credit. This is a tax credit that is only 

used to pay your taxes. That's the only function it 

16 has. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: If you -- you have STOs that

19 for religious affiliated schools, but we will not 

discriminate on the basis of the student's religion.

18 the Association of Catholic Hospitals, another is the 

19 Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of 

totally secular hospitals. So it gives the tax credits 

21 to all three. Now, of course, the Catholic group is

4 organizations, like the Association of Catholics, 

Jewish, or secular hospitals, and we expect them to 

6 distribute it. And they will, of course, distribute it 

7 to those who are their members. And in some cases, 

8 their members are religious organizations, and in some 

9 cases, they're not. Now, what's the difference between 

that and what happens here, leaving the student out of 

11 it? 

12  MR. BENDER: It depends on who the

14  JUSTICE BREYER: The beneficiaries of the 

government -- Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan 

16 program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the 

17 ones who belong to the Catholic hospital association. 

18 Money will also go to the secular hospital association,

don't see that part. That's the last prong we're

9 The beneficiaries here are not the STOs; the

 My friend said, I think I have this right, 

16 "we are talking about my clients whose money is being

18 of Flast. It is not a description of what's going on

solicitude for taxpayers when money is taken out of

in Flast that was the case. But why isn't it -- given 

6 that it's a nexus in Flast, what was in Flast, why isn't 

7 it also a nexus where you have this complicated system 

8 which is designed to make the ordinary taxpayer pay a 

9 little more in this kind of instance, where what you've 

done is directly subtract from the treasury $5,000 cash 

11 to turn over, in the view of the plaintiffs, to a purely 

12 forbidden religious purpose? 

13  GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Breyer, two things. 

14 First, the relevant language of Flast is at page 106. 

It's not the nexus test; it's the definition of what the 

16 actual taxpayer standing claim is. And it requires 

17 that, quote, "his tax money being extracted was" -­

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Was that -- was that in 

19 that instance in Flast? Does Flast rule out the 

possibility -­

21  GENERAL KATYAL: And that's the general 

22 description, Flast says, about how taxpayer standing

24 Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters

1 look to economic effects, and that alone will be enough. 

2 And it's just Property Clause, Tax and Spending Clause, 

3 it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the 

4 treasury. And this Court said no, that isn't the case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: General Katyal, Flast could 

6 not have meant that it's your particular dollar. There 

7 would be no way to know it's your particular dollar, and 

8 that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the 

9 plurality opinion in Hein makes clear. What Flast said 

was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer 

11 dollars are going to this activity in the same way that 

12 it's going to the activity here. 

13  GENERAL KATYAL: I disagree on two levels. 

14 First is I don't think that's what Flast is. I think 

Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is 

16 coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion. 

17 And that's what Madison complained about. It may be 

18 very small; it may be 3 pence. But there's a special 

19 harm of conscience when it's your money, your 

hard-earned money, being used to fund a program directly 

21 as to which you don't like. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Flast talked about a nexus 

23 in the way that Justice Breyer said. And here, there's 

24 a taxpayer challenging a provision of the tax code, 

enacted pursuant to the tax and spending power, that -­

1 that grants a tax benefit. That's as close a nexus as 

2 you are going to get using the language of Flast. 

3  GENERAL KATYAL: Again, I think that doesn't 

4 deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is 

the language of Flast. Even if we -- even if you 

6 disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot 

7 more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to 

8 posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer, 

9 that tax credits will cost the government money, not 

save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to 

11 someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like, 

12 or you have to posit that the government won't cut 

13 spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General, 

9 counsel.

 The case is submitted.

12 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
