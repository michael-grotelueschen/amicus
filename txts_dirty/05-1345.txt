 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in United Haulers Association versus 

Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority.

 Mr. Tager.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. TAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The barriers to interstate commerce imposed 

by the flow control ordinances in this case are even 

more severe than those resulting from the ordinance this 

Court struck down in Carbone. As in Carbone, no local 

waste can leave the counties for processing. In 

addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and 

running no local waste can leave the counties for 

disposal either. The issue here is whether Carbone is 

inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because 

Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are 

required to bring the waste. The answer is no, and the 

reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce 

Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was 

being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise 

or a private one.

The whole point of the Commerce Clause was 

to promote the national economy and to put an end to 

parochial barriers to interstate trade. This Court has 

consistently held that embargoes, local processing 

requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce 

violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably 

prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately --

JUSTICE BREYER: I guess in many thousands 

of municipalities throughout the United States it's 

fairly common to have a locally owned electricity 

distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas 

distribution company. And I thought it was fairly 

common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, 

or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our 

town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from 

the local community. And I guess that's been going on 

for about 110 years.

 And yet I've never seen anybody think or 

write or anything that that violated the Commerce 

Clause. But of course, there could be somebody in 

another State who'd like to sell electricity to the 

people in our town. They can't do it because the town 

says, we own the company and you got to buy from us.

 Now, if we agree with you are we saying that 

all those gas companies, distribution companies, et

cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?

 MR. TAGER: The first point of clarification 

on that is the question -- the question is does strict 

scrutiny apply.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not interested in 

tests. I'm interested in just the outcome. I just 

raise the question.

 MR. TAGER: Yes. I am not, I am not sure 

that it's correct that in all of those municipalities 

you hypothesize that they are actually pairing their 

provision of local --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I used to teach the 

subject and I can't say you're wrong. But I knew that 

it was a fairly common thing to have a certification 

that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a 

local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly. And 

that was common and it was called a service area, and in 

the local town, the service area, I never even heard of 

a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, 

because I thought that this certificate gave them an 

exclusive right to provide the local electricity service 

or the natural gas service. I mean, it's a fairly 

obvious thing. And I might be wrong and I mention that 

my memory -- I've never focused directly on it. Just 

everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the

constitutionality of this. But of course, memory is 

fallible, including mine. Therefore, I raise the 

question.

 MR. TAGER: Well, if the utility is -- if 

the utility is privately owned --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm not talking 

about that because I guess that would be trying to 

attack Carbone. Far be it from me.

 But I know at least there are these things 

called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity 

companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to 

be quite a good thing, and that's years ago. In all 

that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies, 

I've never seen an attack based on this ground.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I think that the same 

logic would apply as in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I think it would. 

The same logic would apply.

 MR. TAGER: And it would apply to all of the 

cases this Court has ever held. In every single case 

involving an embargo or a local processing requirement 

or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in 

public ownership" you'd have the exact same case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the fact is there is 

a difference between public ownership and giving an

exclusive franchise to a public company. And the public 

ownership means that the people of the State have 

decided to have their own little nationalized industry, 

which again people don't like, many. But I never knew 

there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I think that the whole 

point of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of 

JUSTICE BREYER: Nationalized industries?

 MR. TAGER: Well, to stop the idea that 

everything can be localized.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't 

even have to get into the theory. What happens in a lot 

of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, 

we're going to run the waste treatment facility and 

we're going to tax the people in the municipality to 

support it and the service is going to be free. Now, is 

that a violation of the Commerce Clause?

 MR. TAGER: If they're only providing it for 

free and not barring you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. TAGER: -- from engaging in interstate 

commerce, in the event, for example, that you found 

there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an 

interstate transaction, I think we would have -- the

Commerce Clause would be implicated. But as a practical 

matter, they would be able to accomplish much the same 

thing because most people would take the free service.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand. 

You know, as far as the impact on out of State 

competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same. The 

State or the municipality runs its own waste disposal 

facility. There is no charge for dumping the waste 

there. The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes. 

Okay.

 Now, the people you're representing, out of 

state people who would provide dumping grounds for this 

waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever 

they would charge. It would be more than what the 

municipality is charging.

 Now, why isn't that a restraint on 

interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate 

commerce?

 MR. TAGER: Well, it's market participation 

if all they're doing is public collection and bringing 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I'm sorry. You have to 

dump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.

 MR. TAGER: If you parrot the Flow Control 

ordinance I think it's exactly the same.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, so that's fair. Even 

if they support it entirely by taxes?

 MR. TAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that they're not 

competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not 

getting any money from the people who are dumping 

garbage. They get money from the whole tax base.

 MR. TAGER: The impact on the interstate 

market is the same, and I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it is indeed.

 MR. TAGER: -- the Court's Commerce 

Clause --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think you'd be 

willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates 

the Commerce Clause.

 MR. TAGER: But I don't think I -- let me be 

clear. We don't need to win that case in order to win 

this case, because in this case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure.

 MR. TAGER: This case is almost on all fours 

with Carbone. All you've done is transfer the 

ownership. As you know, in Carbone that facility was 

destined to be owned within less than 2 years from the 

time the Court issued its opinion.

opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read 

it, on almost every page it uses words like "local 

operator," "local enterprise," "local proprietor," 

"local business," doesn't speak, as the dissent did, 

about a municipal facility. It seems great care was 

taken in the majority to not characterize that transfer 

pledge as a municipal facility.

 MR. TAGER: Well, two responses to that, 

Justice Ginsburg. First, there were other references 

where the opinion said "the town's facility." Indeed, 

the Flow Control witness himself referred to it as the 

town's facility.

 And the other response is, to call someone a 

proprietor doesn't mean that they're private. In this 

case, they're charging $81 -- or $86 a ton. Every ton 

that comes in, they make more money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. At least as I 

read the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the 

public-private distinction. It seemed to assume it was 

a private entrepreneur. And it didn't take a position 

one way or another whether there would be a distinction.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I don't think the Court 

affirmatively decided the issue. I think the 

distinction didn't matter to the majority. I think the 

majority is focusing on the consequences of putting up

barriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes 

and local processing requirements. And you could take 

almost any one of the Court's cases and just substitute 

in public ownership. Take, for example --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not -- you know, you 

have a whole string of commercial products, but you have 

recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been 

considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal 

function.

 And you also say that the total, the -- what 

is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of 

the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the 

garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't 

be any commerce problem, right? But if it does 

something less, there is?

 MR. TAGER: Well, there were two questions 

embedded there. Let me see if I can take them in order. 

The idea that it is a traditional local function, I 

don't think can support any kind of meaningful test in 

this case. The Court has rejected that very - that very 

standard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and 

prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity 

cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was 

unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional 

government function in any particular case. The Court

found that it was in a total line-drawing morass. And 

so it said we're throwing that out.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is still at 

least the obvious distinction, that one of the main 

purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent 

protectionism. Protectionism is when a state favors its 

own producers. And you could see, indeed a big argument 

in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; 

well, we are at least favoring one. But now where the 

municipality is running it itself, no one is favored.

 So I don't think it was an object of the 

Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own 

government.

 MR. TAGER: I don't know whether the framers 

considered it but I do know --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's about --

MR. TAGER: -- protectionism wasn't the only 

thing that they were concerned about.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there something 

here that is not protection? Because Carbone was still 

perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of 

protection, only one individual was protected.

 MR. TAGER: No. First of all, what was 

being protected was this plan. The town had to fund its 

transfer station, a transfer station that it was going

to take possession of less than two years after this 

Court decided the case.

 So the protectionism that was going on there 

was really protection of their investment in their 

scheme.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was also 

protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the 

time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that 

there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person 

who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to 

the town for a dollar. That, so far as we know, that 

person or that company was in it for the money.

 And so for the period of the five years 

prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that 

particular entity was being protected so it could make 

money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that 

company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a 

dollar. Surely that entity was being protected 

handsomely.

 MR. TAGER: But it would be equally 

protected, Your Honor, if the government owned the 

facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until 

it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too.

 This distinction --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- that's a

third case but that's not the question we have here, is 

it?

 MR. TAGER: Well, the case you have here is 

are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular 

distinction between public and private ownership, when 

in the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these 

other distinctions were unworkable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so, you say 

formalistic as if it's a bad thing. But the, the 

distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private 

contractor the day before the municipality bought the 

facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of 

his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that 

is state action just because the next day it was going 

to be controlled by the public entity. And yet the next 

day, that type of action would be subject to First 

Amendment scrutiny. It may be a formalistic distinction 

but in many areas of the law it makes all the 

difference.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I just think you are going 

to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because 

if that example is one, are you going to require 100 

percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50? 

Once you go down this road, I think it is just opening 

up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what

is the impact on interstate commerce? What we have here 

now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute 

embargo. No waste generated in this town, in these 

counties, excuse me, can leave the State, period, end of 

story.

 It is no different, in effect, it is no less 

likely to breed resentment and retaliation than --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is kind of 

formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you 

agreed that if the municipality did it through tax 

revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and 

yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free 

facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I'm glad you reminded me 

of that point. I meant to make it earlier. In West 

Lynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things 

make a difference. There are certain ways you do things 

and certain ways you can't do things. If you place an 

embargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject 

to strict scrutiny. If you try to do the same thing by 

making it free and providing public -- public -- public 

collection, that's okay.

 And -- and what the Court cases say is do it 

the right way and we'll worry about the consequences 

later.

JUSTICE BREYER: Here, I take it the reason 

they want to do this is because they wanted their 

municipal facility to charge a higher price for the 

non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to 

segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable --

recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less.

 And that's why they want to do it, and of 

course that's not going to work. If somebody comes in 

from out of State and charges a lower price for all of 

the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, 

it just won't work. It is rather like electricity, 

interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the 

same thing. They want discriminatory rates in order to 

push out the possibility of poorer people getting 

electricity. This they want to do the same thing but 

they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage 

recycling.

 MR. TAGER: Several answers to that, 

Justice Breyer.

 One, the same argument was made in Carbone. 

It doesn't matter who owns the facility.

 Two, this is an argument about why they 

might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you 

don't like hearing about that -- but the question here 

is do we apply strict scrutiny or not. And that goes to

the strength of their interest. And then of course the 

question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory 

ways? The answer is "very well." Since Carbone was 

decided, the municipalities have been living with no 

flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet 

recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening 

period.

 Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling 

is to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the 

haulers and the, and the generators. That's not what is 

going on here. They're just charging it at the disposal 

point. So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse 

me -- plenty of communities all over the country that 

are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay 

for each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on 

a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label, 

the label costs a certain amount of money. None of 

these people have flow -- none of these communities have 

flow control but there's a direct straightforward way.

 They can also impose regulations directly on 

the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure 

they're doing these things. So it is hardly a reason 

for creating a brand-new public-private distinction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It sounds to me as though,

Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility 

in the United States is going to fall.

 MR. TAGER: Well -- I'm not an expert on --

on that industry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you know, you know 

that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have 

municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas. They 

seem to get electricity. The lights go on. And 

therefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just 

heard, there just wouldn't be the justification for, 

let's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and 

gas by private entities from outside.

 So that if you win on this argument, no more 

municipal lifelines.

 MR. TAGER: I didn't hear the last part.

them unconstitutional.

 MR. TAGER: Well, but that's excluding that 

-- as I understand it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that they can 

do it so long as they charge less than out of State 

people --

MR. TAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and therefore people buy 

their services because they're cheaper. So long as they 

don't prohibit the importation, if they run the 

municipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge 

very little for the electricity or whatever they're 

providing, that's perfectly okay for you. Right?

 MR. TAGER: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as they don't 

prohibit anybody from out of State.

 MR. TAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then where does your 

argument about formalism go? Isn't it a formalistic 

distinction whether the utility does its financing 

through or its collection through taxes, or through a 

user fee?

 MR. TAGER: Well, I think what I was talking 

about, the public-private distinction, it is different 

in kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct, 

some kinds of Government conduct that are permissible 

like a subsidy, for example, take your South-Central 

Timber versus Wunnicke case. The Court said in that 

opinion you can't impose contractually on the people who 

buy the timber the obligation to process it in the 

State; but what you can do is you can subsidize it, so 

they can't want to do it. So this is something that has 

JUSTICE SOUTER: There's some, then I guess 

you are saying some formalistic distinctions, some 

distinctions that don't make any difference economically 

but are formalistically different are okay.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I'm not sure that one is 

completely formalistic. The Court said there, that 

gives people a choice. They can still take it out of 

the State if they want to, and they may have good reason 

to.

Going back to the trash argument, the trash 

example, you could provide it for free; but a consumer 

might say, you know what, I'd like to have more days of 

pickup than you're providing me. Or I think their 

trucks of this private company are a lot nicer; I'd 

rather have a van stopping in front of my house than 

your beaten up municipal truck. So a case like Wunnicke 

establishes that that's the way it works. That it's 

okay to have alternatives. What you can't have is 

forcing people to do this through regulation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- is there a 

distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to 

you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity 

company, and this case? In this case you have private 

haulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you 

just have a public, a publicly owned and mandated 

processing center in the middle.

 It would be as if in the electric case you 

have private electric companies that generate the power, 

private electric companies that distribute the power, 

but they all have to go through a Government-owned 

transformer at the key. It seems that's the case you 

have here.

 MR. TAGER: Yes. That's why --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: At least that's not the 

way you answered Justice Breyer.

 MR. TAGER: I like your answer better, Your 

Honor.

 MR. TAGER: But what, what I was trying to 

get back to was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Like it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but then, but then 

Justice Breyer is going to say well, you --

MR. TAGER: He'd changed the hypo.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that you, that you can 

bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a 

little bit --

MR. TAGER: You can --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- actually is greater 

than the sum of it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I actually point out that 

California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize 

the rest of it. And there are -- I mean, it --

Justice Kennedy is totally right. There are all kinds 

of combinations and permutations. There, there could be 

distributors who are in fact regulated private companies

and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I 

guess there, there is one generator, at least, company 

that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA. 

They, they make their own.

 So there are all kinds of permutations and 

combinations. And I think we're getting at, when we 

take that aspect of the permutation and combination and 

say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government 

says: "Our way or the highway." You know, that's what 

they say. "Buy from us." Period.

 And if you're in a certain region, I've 

always thought they could do that. And I have to admit 

I never really looked it up; I've just never came across 

a case that says to the contrary.

 MR. TAGER: I, I haven't seen a case either 

way. It's my, my way of seeing this case law is that 

there's -- that the rule is simple: if you are doing 

something to interfere with the free flow of interstate 

commerce, you're subject to strict scrutiny. And maybe 

in that situation, maybe it survives strict scrutiny. I 

don't know that they would in this day and age, when 

getting, getting gas or other kinds of power to a 

commercial establishment, for example, is not very 

difficult and would not necessarily tear up the 

infrastructure, or whatever. I think they might --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What I guess we really 

don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of 

horribles are cases in which the municipality was able 

to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it, 

in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were 

they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as 

Justice Scalia pointed out. I don't know.

 MR. TAGER: I think it's hypothetical.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a quite different 

assumption.

 MR. TAGER: I think his hypothetical assumed 

a ban. But I certainly agree with you, Justice Stevens, 

that if they do it simply by competing, then that's 

perfectly acceptable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is your 

authority for the proposition that we use strict 

scrutiny?

 MR. TAGER: I draw it from the entire line 

of cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo 

cases, the local --

Clause jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.

 MR. TAGER: Well, I was using it as a 

synonym for the "virtually per se unconstitutional" 

rule.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is to say, if it 

discriminates?

 MR. TAGER: If it discriminates, or some of 

the earlier cases didn't use the term --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But certainly on burden 

cases we don't require that.

 MR. TAGER: Well, not the burden that we 

talk about in the price context. But in the earlier 

cases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber 

and some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as 

being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant 

was there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think 

it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local 

needs requirements, local processing requirements, 

things likes that, which basically so obstruct 

interstate commerce as to require the virtual per se 

rule.

 Indeed, Pike itself has that very statement. 

That's sort of the classic case in which you invoke that 

high level of scrutiny.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. CAHILL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. CAHILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 No decision of this Court has held that 

public service is comparable to private enterprise for 

purposes of dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Here the 

only entity that benefits from these laws is the 

government itself.

 JUSTICE ALITO: All the local processing 

cases, would they have come other differently if those 

facilities -- the milk processing plant, the shrimp 

processing plant, and so forth -- had been publicly 

owned?

 MR. CAHILL: I think, Your Honor, they would 

be different. In each of those cases the laws in 

question operated to protect a private entity or group 

of entities. In Dean Mills, for instance, it was a 

group of private milk pasteurizers within a five-mile 

radius of the town -- the city of Madison. In none of 

those cases was the government itself engaged in 

providing the service to the public.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be a good 

revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's 

have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a 

criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other 

than ours and we'll charge triple the price.

 MR. CAHILL: Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not a burden on 

interstate commerce?

 MR. CAHILL: That might be. In our case 

that is not the case here. What we use is a user fee. 

We have a limit. There's a limit to a user fee. We can 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the user fee were 

ten times what it is?

 MR. CAHILL: We can only charge something 

that's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the 

service that we provide.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that?

 MR. CAHILL: In Evansville Airport, Your 

Honor, this Court held that -- versus Delta Airlines --

that a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has 

to be a relationship between the cost of a service and 

the amount that's charged.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So don't call it a user 

fee. Call it something else.

whatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user 

fee, right?

 MR. CAHILL: In New York, Your Honor, you 

either have to call it a user fee or a tax or something 

else.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Call it a cable TV 

franchise fee. I mean, isn't that the way 

municipalities used to make a lot of money? They 

charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise 

and then grant a monopoly in exchange.

 MR. CAHILL: I don't know what cable 

franchises base their, base their amounts on. I do know 

that in our case the cost to tip a ton of waste is 

directly related to the value of the services that we 

provide to the public.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get back to the 

public-private distinction, what is the answer to 

Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if 

you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent 

privately owned company? Is that covered by the 

Commerce Clause cases or not?

MR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I think that the --

they would not be -- it would not be unconstitutional 

under the Commerce Clause cases. I think that the 

distinction is that when government is actually in the 

transaction, when it's taking the risks, when it's 

spending public money, when it's providing a service 

directly to the people, it's a public, it's a public 

service.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the same -- exactly 

that -- that avoids the problem. At exactly the same 

time, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest. 

Why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be 

subject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall, 

that if the government wants to do this the government's 

going to do it the way the government's doing it in your 

case, it's going to be a 100 percent government. If it 

doesn't, it's protectionism.

 MR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I agree with you. 

We don't have 50 percent ownership. We don't have any 

private ownership anywhere. There are, however, 

government agencies in other contexts where there is a 

private partner. That's a case that isn't here today. 

But the question was what if there was, and I don't 

think the answer is automatic one way or the other.

agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign 

immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't 

apply when the government is engaged in a commercial 

activity. Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to 

government regulation which ends up discriminating 

against out of State businesses, when the government is 

engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the 

restrictions of the Commerce Clause? Why isn't that a 

reasonable rule?

 MR. CAHILL: I think it is a reasonable 

rule. But I don't think that we're engaging in 

commercial activity in this particular case. If we were 

to offer our services to citizens to whom we do not have 

a governmental responsibility, then I think we're 

entering into the realm of competition with the private 

sector.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose any 

private entity can choose its market.

 MR. CAHILL: Pardon me, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose any private 

entity can choose its market. You're a market 

participant. You're saying, we're going to serve this 

class of consumers. That's your privilege. But what 

you do is you have a market participation which is 

sanctioned by the criminal law. You've built this trash

utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you 

enforce use of that by the criminal law. So you're 

engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an 

extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to 

enforce its use.

 MR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I don't -- I agree 

with you that we're providing a service here, and we do 

use the law to require that haulers and generators 

participate in the service that we -- in the system that 

we've created. We need to have -- to achieve the goals 

that we're trying to achieve. We've asked our public to 

separate their wastes and we've asked our haulers to 

collect it in a way that's consistent with the programs 

that we've established.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could do that by 

requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and 

non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each 

householder just as much trouble then there could be 

competition and you would have achieved your goal. No?

 MR. CAHILL: No, Your Honor. There is no 

competition between our program and -- that's offered by 

the private sector. What we do is different than what 

the private sector offers and there's no place else for 

it to go. The haulers are required today to comply with 

the program and to coordinate their activities with the

separation done by the residents and the facilities that 

the authority has putting to.

 We do things -- we have three different, 

three basic differences between what we do and what the 

private sector would do. The first one is to step in 

and take some of the risk for proper disposal. When the 

haulers make the decision about where the garbage goes, 

there's a liability that attaches to the waste. If it 

goes to the wrong place it's going to follow, follow 

back both to the hauler and to the person who generated 

it. We have had some bad experiences with people making 

bad decisions about where waste goes in the 1980s and 

the public asked us to set something up so that they 

could trust who was making the disposal decisions. So 

as a government we've stepped into that problem. We've 

stepped into the shoes of the generator, and we're 

trying to set up a place --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could do that by law. 

You could do that by law. You could specify that only 

certain waste facilities can be used.

 MR. CAHILL: I think not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to run the 

business in order to assure that, do you?

MR. CAHILL: Because we don't have the power 

as a local government in New York to talk to landfills 

in Ohio or Pennsylvania about how they should run their 

facilities. The only way that we can be sure that it 

goes to the right place, that's engineered the right way 

and built the right way and run the right way is to 

offer to do it ourselves. And that's what we've --

JUSTICE ALITO: But none of that -- in 

answer to my earlier question, I thought you said none 

of that really matters, right? The only thing that 

matters is that this is a publicly owned facility. You 

could be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it 

would come out the same way.

 MR. CAHILL: I think why public ownership 

matters is that it's not discriminatory. I think the 

strict scrutiny test should not apply when government 

owns --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So your answer is yes?

 MR. CAHILL: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter? 

Hamburgers are just as good?

 MR. CAHILL: Well, hamburgers, Your Honor, 

if the government was going to be the sole purveyor of 

hamburgers in a community, I think they'd have to have a

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cahill, you started to 

tell us three reasons why it was important that you 

regulate. You gave us one. Mention the other two.

 MR. CAHILL: The other two are, Your Honor, 

that we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to 

establish the system that reduces the amount of waste 

that we generate and recycles as much as possible. 

That's not necessarily something that the private sector 

would do. A landfill is not built to discourage the 

amount of waste that comes through it. Our system is 

designed to try to change the habits of our citizens and 

increase recycling --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's basic 

Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in 

what happens to the product out of State. Baldwin 

versus Seelig.

 MR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can't say we want --

we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other 

States. That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought that was 

just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your 

point two.

 MR. CAHILL: We are attempting to protect 

our own citizens by reducing the liabilities that they 

may incur if that waste is shipped anywhere outside of 

the counties. We hope to give them a better solution 

for disposal than they would get from the marketplace. 

To the extent that liability crosses state lines, we are 

trying to protect our citizens from that liability --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether they want the 

protection or not?

 MR. CAHILL: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And whether a private 

individual can come and offer them the same protection

we're here to help you?

assume that the government does have some basic health 

and safety objectives and the objective to protect its 

citizens here.

 MR. CAHILL: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the government tries to 

pursue these policies solely by private inducement, 

trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those 

terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, 

another State, what-not.

 By taking on the job itself, the government 

in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can 

protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental 

policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation 

of service? There's kind of an assurance of service 

plus the objectives that the government gets by running 

the plant itself. And isn't that sort of the nub of all 

of your points?

 MR. CAHILL: Yes, Your Honor, that's true. 

That is the essence of government. We are there and we 

are going to have to stay there. Whether -- where a 

private entity might decide to go out of business 

tomorrow, government is going to be there to continue to 

do what we set out to do.

 But this leads me also to my third point,

comprehensive solid waste plan. With the passage of 

Federal legislation on these environmental matters 

touching on waste in the 1970s, with the Resource 

Conservation and Recovery Act, and With the 

Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act, 

there was a new message sent to the country, which to 

generators meant, you better think about what you're 

doing with this stuff. You better make a -- you better 

watch where it goes and you better be careful because 

liability could attach to you.

 And RCRA told government, States and 

localities, it was their responsibility to come up with 

plans to find new ways to manage solid wastes. That's 

what we've done. Any time a government comes together 

to put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes, 

whether like ours it uses several different technologies 

to try to address different parts of the waste stream, 

you have to have the cooperation of the people who 

collect the waste. If the people who collect the waste 

could drive its away to anywhere they please, the plan 

is no plan; the plan is just a suggestion. The haulers

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the State of New York 

can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.

 MR. CAHILL: No, Your Honor, it cannot.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you say the Congress of 

the United States has authorized discrimination against 

interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. 

That has happened.

 MR. CAHILL: That is not our position, Your 

Honor. We're not saying that RCRA or any of these 

statutes authorize discrimination against interstate 

commerce. What the Federal statutes did do, however, 

was recognize that the states do have the sovereign 

power to act, and they expected the states to act in 

this way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's take one of these 

classic discrimination cases involving milk. I think 

what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a 

law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility 

owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would 

be perfectly okay.

 MR. CAHILL: That would not discriminate 

against interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And it would 

really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it, 

and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers,

and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to 

that.

 MR. CAHILL: No, I do think the Commerce 

Clause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just -- our 

position is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny. I 

think the Pike test is a very good test to get to the 

bottom of why Wisconsin would want to do such a thing, 

and it would also be a good test to show just what the 

adverse impact on interstate commerce was, and what 

precisely the benefits of, to Wisconsin there might be.

 I think the Pike test --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then, the 

Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we 

would develop federal law about what's appropriate for 

municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate? 

We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste 

facilities but not to run milk pasteurization. I don't 

know how we would do that.

 MR. CAHILL: I don't know how you would do 

that either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that 

by accepting the petitioner's argument that public 

services and private sector services are comparable 

under the Commerce Clause. To go back to your example, 

earlier, Justice Scalia --

that argument, we would treat the public services just 

like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring 

private companies. You're the one that's arguing for 

special treatment based on public ownership.

 MR. CAHILL: I think we are not, Your Honor. 

I think public ownership and public services are unique 

and they're different, and they should be subject to 

Commerce Clause scrutiny, but not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the whole point 

is these are not unique. The whole point is there are 

private companies that provide these kinds of services. 

Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are 

not unique. But you can't say that this is a unique 

service being provided by government.

 MR. CAHILL: I think the approach that 

Oneida-Herkimer has taken is in fact unique. It is 

tailored to our local situation. It's not something 

that the marketplace would provide if the government was 

not there. And if the Petitioner's idea that any 

government service could be challenged under the dormant 

Commerce Clause simply because there's a private entity 

out there that says they could do the same thing were 

accepted, the definition of discrimination would be 

changed from differential treatment of economic 

interests to differential treatment of government or

economic interests. And whether we use the taxing power 

or police power to support a public enterprise, it would 

be subject to challenge.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the challenge here 

isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you 

can require everybody in the area to go through the one 

facility and pay a tipping fee.

 MR. CAHILL: Yes.

 I would like to close, I think, because I'm 

running out of time, with just the admonition or 

requirement that we are, in providing a public service, 

still subject to the Constitution and we must deal with 

the part private sector fairly. But if we do deal with 

the private sector fairly and we don't favor anyone in 

state or anyone out of state, we should be judged under 

the balancing test of Pike, so that the Court, if the 

court below found the benefits of our system 

substantially outweigh any incidental burdens that are 

placed on it by commerce, placed on commerce by the 

system. Thank you.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As you suggested, Justice Breyer, the theory 

that petitioners would have the Court adopt here is in 

fact a novel one. What they are suggesting is that 

there is discrimination sufficient to trigger near fatal 

scrutiny every time the government takes over, to the 

exclusion of all private actors both in state and out of 

state, a government service, that that is sufficient to 

trigger strict scrutiny. That is completely 

inconsistent with the way that this Court has defined 

what constitutes discrimination for purposes of the 

dormant Commerce Clause.

 The Court has said, and it has stressed 

repeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the 

differential treatment of in state and out of State 

economic interests, not government interests, in a way 

that benefits the former and burdens the latter. That's 

from Oregon Waste System.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a sort of 

simple question. Is there an interstate impact on, of a 

municipal rule whether it is milk, or garbage, or what, 

that says all of this product must be processed within 

this city before it can go out of State?

MS. HALLIGAN: There may well be an

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't that have a burden 

on interstate commerce?

 MS. HALLIGAN: It may well, and that is 

something that is appropriately judged under the Pike 

standard.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't that exactly what we 

have here?

 MS. HALLIGAN: I think that you do have that 

here, and you should judge it under the Pike valency 

test, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Pike doesn't apply to 

discrimination. Pike applies to burdens.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor. And where 

you have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems you are 

conflating the two.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Respectfully, I disagree, 

Your Honor. Where you have the government taking over a 

service entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination 

because there is no local private interest that is 

advantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of 

state interest. That is where the dormant Commerce

for a rule that broad, Your Honor. What we are 

suggesting is that where you have a publicly owned 

operation, a government operation, and it does not 

disproportionately benefit in state or local interests, 

as against out of state interests -- But it always does. 

It benefits the people of the State, who make the money 

from the money from the, from the very expensive 

hamburgers that are sold by the State of California.

 MS. HALLIGAN: If --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It always benefits the 

State of California.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying so long 

as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great 

wealth in the State of California, it is okay.

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the distinction 

as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.

government action, for example, someone suggested could 

the government sell hamburgers. I believe Justice Alito

suggested that, and that was to operate to the 

disadvantage of out of state interests, even if it only 

advantaged one in state interest, we would agree that 

that would be appropriate for treatment under strict 

scrutiny. But that's not what you have here.

 What both the district court and the circuit 

court in fact found here is that the primary burden of 

these local ordnances in fact is on local residents. 

And so the political process check that this Court has 

found critical in cases like Minnesota versus Cloverleaf 

and Wunnicke is very much precedent here. This is not 

an attractive proposition that these localities have 

entered into.

laws --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You -- I'm sorry. We're

view.

 I'm a home owner. I have two choices. I 

either send it to the local facility or I can ship it 

over to New Jersey. You're telling me I can't ship it 

to New Jersey. Doesn't that burden an interstate 

transaction?

 MS. HALLIGAN: This is very different from 

those kinds of export bans. Those export bans did one 

of two things.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: This is an export ban.

 MS. HALLIGAN: The export bans that this 

Court has struck down either created local --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Your case involves an 

expert ban. All the trash has to be processed in your

the extent that's what you are characterizing as an 

export ban, that's certainly correct. What the Court 

has found problematic about export bans are either that 

they are put in place to create local to correct 

economic opportunities, for example the timber cases or 

the shrimp cases.

 That's not what you have here. There's no 

allegation that the purposes of these statutes is to 

foster or promote local industry. In fact, the only 

plaintiffs in this case are local haulers themselves.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is an 

allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue 

particular economic goals that the municipality has.

 MS. HALLIGAN: For a different basket of 

services, Your Honor. A basket of services that 

includes a wider range of, of goals that the private 

sector has no Interest in providing.

 To return, to return to the question of 

whether or not this is an inappropriate benefit for the 

citizens, I would argue that there is a meaningful 

distinction between government taking an action which 

benefits the citizens as a whole, which we would hope 

any government law would -- any law passed by a 

government would do, as opposed to a law that benefits a 

local private economic interest and is intended to do

so.

 For the dormant Commerce Clause to reach 

that far would be unprecedented. It would implicate not 

only electricity but under Petitioner's theory it would 

implicate, I would think for example government 

decisions to provide prison and correctional services 

through a public system as opposed to a private one. 

What about school bus services? Car insurance --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If only facilities 

on your side of the case that are traditional municipal 

services, but then this seems to be at the borderline. 

I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases 

or the milk processing cases. How do we decide whether 

this is one of the traditional governmental services, 

the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these 

that looks more like regular market participation?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Two answers if I can, Your 

Honor. First of all, I think this Court has answered 

that question with respect to waste management more than 

a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case. 

It was clearly held there the provision of waste 

management services is an essential function that 

governments appropriately provide.

 So that's been answered here. With respect 

to this question about hamburgers and other services

that look commercial, I think there are two checks on 

those kinds of ordinances. First of all, I think it is 

very likely that in most circumstances if you were to 

say that hamburgers will be sold at a government 

operated facility, that that would disadvantage local 

interests significantly, and there would be a political 

process check.

 Secondly the Court has been clear that it is 

not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce 

Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that 

is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court 

has said, forthright or ingenious. So if case were to 

present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case 

no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to 

believe that the motive of a government entity was, in 

fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict 

scrutiny might be appropriate.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that what it turns on, 

the motive? If the motive were to keep the jobs at the 

plant in New York, rather than in some facility outside 

of New York, that would be, that would make a 

difference?

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, I think this Court has 

held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate 

means that is used. But what we are arguing is that

here you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my 

co-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate 

means. It is not inappropriate under the dormant 

Commerce Clause for the government to step in and take 

over provision of a service. Petitioners themselves 

agree that, in fact, the government could take over 

waste management services from soup to nuts. They 

suggest that there is some difference of a 

constitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is 

contracted out to the private market, and would argue 

that actually turns the dominant Commerce Clause on its 

head.

 One final point, if I could make. Several 

of you asked about whether or not there are other 

mechanisms that the localities could use to further 

these goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal 

and State laws.

 First of all, under the Pike test, there is 

no least restrictive alternative test. So it is not 

required that the localities demonstrate that there is 

no other option that might meet these goals. The Second 

Circuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of 

the appendix to the petition that there was no other 

option that presented itself in the record that the 

counties could address, or could use to address their

liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a 

very wide range of products.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no determinative 

element in the Pike test whatever. It is a totality of 

the circumstances test, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's wonderful.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. HALLIGAN: And we suggest that that is 

the appropriate test here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Halligan, how do you 

answer something in the Petitioner's brief that says 

there's no difference between this case and Carbone 

because these transfer stations are constructed and 

operated by a private company?

 MS. HALLIGAN: I think that that distinction 

is essential here. It is essential because of the 

purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. These are 

publicly owned facilities. The facility in Carbone was 

privately owned and as you suggested, Justice Ginsburg, 

the opinion is replete with careful references to that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you, where 

do you come out on the 50-50 facility?

 MS. HALLIGAN: I think that's a hard 

question, Your Honor. And I think there the kind of

approach that the Court took in a case like Westland 

Creamery and Hunt versus Washington Apple is helpful.

 If it appears to the Court that the motive 

is protectionist then it is appropriate to apply strict 

scrutiny. Whether that line is 50 percent, 55 percent

 The first point I'd like to make is I'd like

a market participant case. But what is significant 

there -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two 

significant things about that case which I think are of

interest.

 First, the Court's footnote 1 is an 

interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota 

had elected to make a lot of these different industries 

state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been 

discussing are not completely off the wall.

 If you can do it for waste you can do it 

for, in that case coal. They wanted to do it for 

stockyards but I think the legislature rejected the 

government's proposal. So the hypos are right on point.

 Secondly, the Court made a point there in 

rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that 

the state was not prohibiting competing cement 

companies. And I think the inference from that is that 

it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem.

 Second, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point. 

I just want to remind the Court that in addition to 

paying for the recycling and everything, they were using 

the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy 

recovery facility. So, if you start focusing on what 

you use it for, it is a very slippery slope.

 On his point about protecting the generator 

from liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in 

our briefs. But one other point I want to make is he's 

wrong about their ability to determine whether other

Official - Subject to Final Review 

facilities that the haulers want to use are safe for 

environmental purposes. That's exactly what the city of 

New York does. Because it doesn't have its own disposal 

facility, its got very stringent requirements for where 

the waste can be taken.

 Fourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were 

raising an inquiry about the political process and 

whether that's adequate to protect the out of State 

interests.

 And I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn 

Creamery decision where the Court said the people whose 

oxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents 

as well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce 

Clause violation. The political process is simply not a 

good answer to our argument.

 In terms of your other question about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A tariff is also imposed by 

a State, isn't it? As opposed to --

MR. TAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Money goes to a State.

 MR. TAGER: It would go to a State. I 

suppose it could be done by a subdivision, though.

 On Ms. Halligan's point about California 

Reduction, I just would like to remind the Court that 

that was a case of flow control to a private company.

So Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all 

with the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was, 

it was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to 

the extent it had any Commerce Clause implications.

 Finally, I would like end with the point 

that Carbone has been the law for 13 years -- may I 

finish?

 If the Respondents have a problem with 

Carbone, Congress can fix it. That's one of the unique 

things about the Commerce Clause that is different from 

other constitutional provisions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
