3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. 

Jones. 

6  Mr. Dreeben. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Since this Court's decision in Katz v. 

12 United States, the Court has recognized a basic 

13 dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment. What a person 

14 seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own 

home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle 

16 when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment 

17 protection. But what he reveals to the world, such as 

18 his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not. 

19  In Knotts v. United States, this Court 

applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper 

21 surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public 

22 roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of 

23 privacy. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Knotts, though, 

seems to me much more like traditional surveillance.

1 You're following the car, and the beeper just helps you 

2 follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance. 

3 That was 30 years ago. The technology is very 

4 different, and you get a lot more information from the 

GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper. 

6  MR. DREEBEN: The technology is different, 

7 Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that 

8 shows that this was not simply amplified visual 

9 surveillance is that the officers actually feared 

detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to 

11 Wisconsin. The driver began to do certain U-turns and, 

12 the police broke off visual surveillance. They lost 

13 track of the car for a full hour. They only were able 

14 to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a 

helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio 

16 transmitter in the can of chloroform. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a good 

18 example of the change in technology. That's a lot of 

19 work to follow the car. They've got to listen to the 

beeper; when they lose it, they've got to call in the 

21 helicopter. Here they just sit back in the station, and 

22 they -- they push a button whenever they want to find 

23 out where the car is. They look at data from a month 

24 and find out everywhere it's been in the past month. 

That -- that seems to me dramatically different.

1  MR. DREEBEN: But it doesn't expose 

2 anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed 

3 to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that 

4 was the crucial principle that the Court applied --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under that 

6 rationale, could you put a beeper surreptitiously on the 

7 man's overcoat or sport coat? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Probably not, Justice Kennedy; 

9 and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United 

States -- United States v. Karo -- specifically 

11 distinguished the possibility of following a car on a 

12 public roadways from determining the location of an 

13 object in a place where a person has a reasonable 

14 expectation of privacy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, no. This is a special 

16 device. It measures only streets and public elevators 

17 and public buildings. 

18  MR. DREEBEN: In that event, Justice 

19 Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the 

installation of such a device would implicate either a 

21 search or a seizure. But if it did not, the public 

22 movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- and on that latter 

24 point, you might just be aware that I have serious 

reservations that there wasn't -- that there -- about

1 the way in which this beeper was installed. But you can 

2 get to that at -- at your convenience. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to 

4 get to it now.

 (Laughter.) 

6  MR. DREEBEN: Happy to, Your Honor. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I have to give a little 

8 prologue to my question. When -- when wiretapping first 

9 came before this Court, we held that it was not a 

violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth 

11 Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in 

12 their persons, houses, papers, and effects against 

13 unreasonable searches and seizures. And wiretapping 

14 just picked up conversations. That's not persons, 

houses, papers, and effects. 

16  Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you 

17 mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, 

18 is there an invasion of privacy? Does -- are you 

19 obtaining information that a person had a reasonable 

expectation to be kept private? I think that was wrong. 

21 I don't think that was the original meaning of the 

22 Fourth Amendment. But, nonetheless, it's been around 

23 for so long, we're not going to overrule that. 

24  However, it is one thing to add that privacy 

concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally 

6

5

25

Official 

1 existed, and it is quite something else to use that 

2 concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it 

3 originally meant. And it seems to me that when that 

4 device is installed against the will of the owner of the 

car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and 

6 thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his 

7 effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an 

8 unreasonable search and seizure. It is attached to the 

9 car against his will, and it is a search because what it 

obtains is the location of that car from there forward. 

11 Now, why -- why isn't that correct? Do you deny that 

12 it's a trespass? 

13  MR. DREEBEN: It may be a technical 

14 trespass, but it was equally a technical trespass in the 

United States v. Karo, when a can of ether was 

16 transferred to somebody that had -- and it had a radio 

17 transmitter --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the owner of the 

19 can at the time it was installed consented, and that is 

not this case. There is no consent by the owner of the 

21 property to which this device was affixed. In fact, it 

22 was done, as Justice Scalia indicated, surreptitiously. 

23  MR. DREEBEN: But there was no consent to 

24 the owner of the can once he acquired it to have it 

contain a foreign item installed by the government.

1 And --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's too bad. That 

3 doesn't make it a trespass. I mean --

4  MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that 

it --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: It may be a sneaky thing to 

7 do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass. 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court thought that 

9 it was a technical trespass in Karo and said that made 

no difference because the purpose of the Fourth 

11 Amendment is to protect privacy interests and meaningful 

12 interferences with possessory interests, not to cover 

13 all technical trespasses. And the case that I --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, we've narrowed the 

Fourth Amendment? 

16  MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the -- the privacy 

18 rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some 

19 respects.

 MR. DREEBEN: It changes it, Justice Scalia. 

21 And I think the case that most clearly illustrates the 

22 distinction between trespass and Fourth Amendment 

23 protection is Oliver v. United States, the case that 

24 reaffirmed the open fields doctrine. In that case, 

there was absolutely no doubt that the police committed 

8

1 a trespass under local law.  They entered, they crossed 

2 fences, they ignored big "no trespassing" signs; and 

3 this Court held that the interests that are protected by 

4 trespass law are distinct from the interests protected 

by the Fourth Amendment. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly, but the 

7 rationale of that case was that it was not an 

8 unreasonable --

9  MR. DREEBEN: No, the rationale was that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it was not an 

11 unreasonable search. 

12  MR. DREEBEN: -- there was no search, 

13 Justice Scalia. The rationale of that case was that 

14 open fields are not among the things that are protected 

by the Fourth Amendment. And the Court was very 

16 specifically focused on the distinction between trespass 

17 law and Fourth Amendment law. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there 

19 would also not be a search if you put a GPS device on 

all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month? 

21 You think you're entitled to do that under your theory? 

22  MR. DREEBEN: The Justices of this Court? 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

24  (Laughter.)

 MR. DREEBEN: Under our theory and under

yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device 

6 on every one of our cars, follow us for a month; no 

7 problem under the Constitution? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: Well, equally, Mr. Chief 

9 Justice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put a team of 

surveillance agents around the clock on any individual 

11 and follow that individual's movements as they went 

12 around on the public streets, and they would thereby 

13 gather --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that seems to get --

to me to get to what's really involved here. The issue 

16 of whether there's a technical trespass or not is 

17 potentially a ground for deciding this particular case, 

18 but it seems to me the heart of the problem that's 

19 presented by this case and will be presented by other 

cases involving new technology is that in the 

21 pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy -- I 

22 would say most of the privacy -- that people enjoyed was 

23 not the result of legal protections or constitutional 

24 protections; it was the result simply of the difficulty 

of traveling around and gathering up information.

1  But with computers, it's now so simple to 

2 amass an enormous amount of information about people 

3 that consists of things that could have been observed on 

4 the streets, information that was made available to the 

public. If -- if this case is decided on the ground 

6 that there was a technical trespass, I don't have much 

7 doubt that in the near future, it will be possible -- I 

8 think it's possible now in many instances -- for law 

9 enforcement to monitor people's movements on -- on 

public streets without committing a technical trespass. 

11  So, how do we deal with this? Do we just 

12 say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the 

13 information that people expose to the public is -- is 

14 fair game? There's no -- there's no search or seizure 

when that is -- when that is obtained because there 

16 isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, but isn't 

17 there a real change in -- in this regard? 

18  MR. DREEBEN: I don't think, Justice Alito, 

19 that there's a particularly dramatic change in this case 

from what went on in the Karo and the Knotts cases. 

21  It is possible to envision broader advances 

22 in technology that would allow more public information 

23 to be amassed and put into computer systems. But I 

24 think that the remedy for that -- if this Court agrees 

with the principles in Knotts and Karo and applies them

1 to this case, the remedy is through legislation, just as 

2 when the Court held that amassing pen register data, all 

3 of the numbers that you dial on your telephone, the 

4 lengths of the times of the calls. The Court was 

confronted in that case with Justice Stewart's view in 

6 dissent, that --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a third party 

8 involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case. 

9 And, here, it's the police. Essentially, I think you 

answered the question that the government's position 

11 would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we 

12 leave our homes. So, the only thing secure is the home. 

13 Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your 

14 argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not 

used inside the house, is okay. 

16  MR. DREEBEN: Well, we're talking here about 

17 monitoring somebody's movements in public. We're not 

18 talking about monitoring their conversations, their 

19 telephone calls, the interior of their cars, their 

private letters or packages. So, there are enclaves of 

21 Fourth Amendment protection that this Court has 

22 recognized. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the 

24 question that I think people are driving at, at least as 

I understand them and certainly share the concern, is 

12

Official 

1 that if you win this case, then there is nothing to 

2 prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 

3 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the 

4 United States. And -- and the difference between the 

monitoring and what happened in the past is memories are 

6 fallible; computers aren't. 

7  And no one, or at least very rarely, sends 

8 human beings to follow people 24 hours a day. That 

9 occasionally happens. But with the machines, you can. 

So, if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like 

11 1984 from their brief. I understand they have an 

12 interest in perhaps dramatizing that, but -- but maybe 

13 overly. But it still sounds like it. 

14  And so, what protection is there, if any, 

once we accept your view of the case, from this slight 

16 futuristic scenario that's just been painted and is done 

17 more so in their briefs? 

18  MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, first of all, 

19 this is exactly the argument that was presented to the 

Court in Knotts. If you go back to 1983, the beeper 

21 technology in that case seemed extraordinarily advanced, 

22 and there was a potential for it to be used. The 

23 Respondent --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, that's true. 

And they do have a limit. In this case, they say Knotts 

13

1 involved a single journey, or let's say it involved four 

2 journeys. And let's say it involved four journeys in 

3 2 days.  This involves every journey for a month. So, 

4 they say whatever the line is that's going to protect 

us, it's short of every journey in a month. 

6  So, I'm not asking -- I'm saying I accept 

7 your point there. And what do you say is the limit? 

8  MR. DREEBEN: I first want to address the 

9 suggestion that you could draw a line somewhere between 

a month and a trip and have a workable standard for 

11 police officers to use. Police officers use a variety 

12 of investigative techniques which in the aggregate 

13 produce an enormous amount of information. Pen 

14 registers, trash pulls. They look at financial records. 

They conduct visual surveillance. And under a principle 

16 of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not, 

17 there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in 

18 how they are --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is the same 

kind of guidance that you have in any case of this Court 

21 that uses the technique which is used sometimes, and I 

22 think it's used for example in the bribing the judge 

23 case, you know, with campaign contributions. You draw 

24 an outer limit, you say you can't go beyond that. We 

know within that, there is no standard. We'll leave it

2 over time. 

3  That's not necessarily desirable, but that 

4 is a method this Court has sometimes used.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: But even if it's wrong, I 

7 want to know, are you saying there is no limit or are 

8 you suggesting one? 

9  MR. DREEBEN: I'm suggesting that the Court 

do the same thing that it did in Knotts. This case does 

11 not involve 24-hour surveillance of every citizen of the 

12 United States. It involves following one suspected drug 

13 dealer as to whom there was very strong suspicion, for a 

14 period of time that actually is less than a month, 

because the beeper technology failed during --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then you're --

17 you're moving away from your argument. Your argument is 

18 it doesn't depend how much suspicion you have; it 

19 doesn't depend on how urgent it is. Your argument is 

you can do it, period. You don't have to give any 

21 reason. It doesn't have to be limited in any way, 

22 right? 

23  MR. DREEBEN: That is correct, Mr. Chief 

24 Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the

1 normal way in these situations that we draw these limits 

2 how intrusive the search can be, how long it can be, is 

3 by having a magistrate spell it out in a warrant? 

4  MR. DREEBEN: When you're talking about the 

movements of a car on a public roadway, which even 

6 Justice Breyer's question seems to concede could be 

7 monitored for a day or perhaps 4 days, there is no 

8 Fourth Amendment search, unless --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're talking 

about the difference between seeing a little tile and 

11 seeing a mosaic. The one gives you information; the 

12 other doesn't. 

13  MR. DREEBEN: So does a pen register. So 

14 does a garbage pull. So does looking at everybody's 

credit card statement for a month. All of those things 

16 this Court has held are not searches. And the --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, this case 

18 started out with a warrant. There was a warrant, and 

19 the limits weren't followed. The warrant said 10 days, 

do this in 10 days, and the police took 11. They were 

21 supposed to do it in D.C. Instead, they did it in 

22 Maryland. 

23  So, the police could have gotten permission 

24 to conduct this search. In fact, they had received it. 

Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's

1 in the electronic surveillance manual, better get a 

2 warrant. Was there any problem about -- when this kind 

3 of surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a 

4 warrant? Were they encountering difficulty getting 

warrants? 

6  MR. DREEBEN: In this case, there would not 

7 have been any difficulty getting a warrant, Justice 

8 Ginsburg. And the warrant authorized things beyond just 

9 monitoring the car. It authorized entering the car in 

order to install it, which wasn't necessary here. It 

11 also authorized monitoring the car in a location where 

12 there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. This 

13 case is only about monitoring a car on public streets. 

14  But I think it's very important to keep in 

mind that the -- the principal use of this kind of 

16 surveillance is when the police have not yet acquired 

17 probable cause but have a situation that does call for 

18 monitoring. And I'd like to give an example. 

19  If the police get an anonymous phone call 

that a bomb threat is going to be carried out at a 

21 mosque by people who work at a small company, the bomb 

22 threat on an anonymous call will not provide even 

23 reasonable suspicion under this Court's decision in 

24 Florida v. J.L.

6  MR. DREEBEN: You do neither, because 

7 without probable cause you cannot enter the house. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, why 

9 are you asking for a different rule in this situation?

 MR. DREEBEN: Because the -- the police in 

11 this situation have the traditional means available to 

12 investigate these sorts of tips. They could put teams 

13 of agents on all the individuals who are within the pool 

14 of suspicion and follow them 24/7. And that would 

raise --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're now 

17 suggesting an answer to Justice Kennedy's question, 

18 which is it would be okay to take the computer chip, put 

19 it on somebody's overcoat, and follow every citizen 

everywhere they go indefinitely. So -- under your 

21 theory and the theory espoused in your brief, you could 

22 monitor and track every person through their cell phone, 

23 because today the smartphones emit signals that police 

24 can pick up and use to follow someone anywhere they go.

 Your theory is so long as the -- that all --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to track them, to 

7 invade their sense of integrity in their choices about 

8 who they want to see or use their things. That's really 

9 argument you're making.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

11 think that that goes considerably farther than our 

12 position in this case, because our position is not that 

13 the Court should overrule United States v. Karo and 

14 permit monitoring within a private residence. That is 

off limits absent a warrant or exigent circumstances 

16 plus probable cause. And monitoring an individual 

17 through their clothing poses an extremely high 

18 likelihood that they will enter a place where they have 

19 a reasonable expectation of privacy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Cars get parked in a 

21 garages. It happened here. 

22  MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but a car that's parked 

23 in a garage does not have a reasonable expectation of 

24 privacy as to its location. Anyone can observe --

difference between this and a general warrant is? I 

11 mean --

12  MR. DREEBEN: A general warrant --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what motivated the 

14 Fourth Amendment historically was the disapproval, the 

outrage, that our Founding Fathers experienced with 

16 general warrants that permitted police indiscriminately 

17 to investigate just on the basis of suspicion, not 

18 probable cause, and to invade every possession that the 

19 individual had in search of a crime. How is this 

different --

21  MR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- this kind of 

23 surveillance where there's no probable cause, there's 

24 not even necessarily reasonable suspicion in --

MR. DREEBEN: A warrant authorizes a search.

3 which this Court said in Knotts that no individual has a 

4 reasonable expectation of privacy because when they go 

out in their car, their car is traveling on public 

6 roads. Anyone can look. The police have no obligation 

7 to avert their eyes from anything that any member of the 

8 public --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if we -- I give 

you that, that it's in public. Does the reasonable 

11 expectation of privacy trump that fact? In other words, 

12 if we ask people, do you think it's -- it violates your 

13 right to privacy to have this kind of information 

14 acquired, and everybody says yes, is it a response that, 

no, that takes place in public, or is it simply the 

16 reasonable expectation of privacy regardless of the fact 

17 that it takes place in public? 

18  MR. DREEBEN: Well, something that takes 

19 place in public isn't inherently off limits to a 

reasonable expectation of privacy. That's essentially 

21 the holding of Katz. You go into a phone booth, you're 

22 in public; making your calls within the phone booth is 

23 subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

24  But this Court, with full awareness of that 

holding, in Knotts and in Karo recognized that

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can see, though, 

4 can't you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it 

violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the 

6 police following you, you might get one answer, while 

7 today if you ask people does it violate your right to 

8 privacy to know that the police can have a record of 

9 every movement you made in the past month, they might 

see that differently? 

11  MR. DREEBEN: They probably would also feel 

12 differently about being followed 24/7 by a team of FBI 

13 agents, who gain far more information than a GPS device 

14 produces. GPS only gives you the approximate location 

of the car as it drives on the roads --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the speed as well. 

17  MR. DREEBEN: The approximate speed, the 

18 location traveled, the -- that -- that is what the GPS 

19 provides. It doesn't show you where the car stopped. 

It doesn't show you who was driving the car. It doesn't

3 do that. There are protections --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was -- that is when 

the police came upon the violator. But this is -- it's 

6 all in a computer. The police can say we want to find 

7 out more about X, so consult the database, see if 

8 there's an indication that he was ever speeding in the 

9 last 28 days.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's not 

11 very hard for police to follow somebody and find a 

12 traffic violation if they want to do that. But to 

13 answer in part Justice Breyer's earlier concern about 

14 limiting principles, this Court recognized in the Whren 

decision that, although the Fourth Amendment is not a 

16 restriction on discriminatory or arbitrary or oppressive 

17 stops that are based on invidious characteristics, the 

18 Equal Protection Clause is. The First Amendment also 

19 stands as a protection. If this Court believes that 

there is an excessive chill created by an actual law or 

21 universal practice of monitoring people through GPS, 

22 there are other constitutional principles that are 

23 available. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Fourth Amendment 

protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures.

2 Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has 

3 been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and 

4 the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation; 

and yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and 

6 monitoring the person's movement whenever they are 

7 outside their house in the car, is not? I mean, it just 

8 -- something about it that -- just doesn't parse. 

9  MR. DREEBEN: I'm quite sure, Justice 

Ginsburg, that if you ask citizens whether the police 

11 could freely pick up their trash for a month and paw 

12 through it, looking for evidence of a crime, or keep a 

13 record of every telephone call that they made for the 

14 duration and the number that it went through, or conduct 

intense visual surveillance of them, that citizens would 

16 probably also find that to be, in the word that

21 would a democratic society look like if a large number 

22 of people did think that the government was tracking

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see where I'm -- and 

6 that's what I'm listening very hard to find. 

7  MR. DREEBEN: All right. Justice Breyer, 

8 two things on that. First of all, I think the 

9 line-drawing problems that the Court would create for 

itself would be intolerable, and better that the Court 

11 should address the so-called 1984 scenarios if they come

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The GPS technology today 

19 is limited only by the cost of the instrument, which 

frankly right now is so small that it wouldn't take that 

21 much of a budget, local budget, to place a GPS on every

7  MR. DREEBEN: I think that -- Justice 

8 Scalia, the legislature is a safeguard, and if the Court 

9 believes that there needs to be a Fourth Amendment 

safeguard as well, we have urged as a fallback position 

11 that the Court adopt a reasonable suspicion standard 

12 which would allow the police to conduct surveillance of 

13 individuals in their movements on public roadways, which 

14 they can do visually in any event, and would allow the 

police to investigate leads and tips that arise under 

16 circumstances where there is not probable cause. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would be under your

19  MR. DREEBEN: As in most reasonable 

suspicion cases, it's the police at the front end and 

21 it's the courts at the back end if there are motions to 

22 suppress evidence. But fundamentally, just as in the

11  MR. LECKAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

12 and may it please the Court: 

13  I want to talk about the one issue that the 

14 United States didn't talk about, which is whether this 

is a seizure. This case can be resolved on a very 

16 narrow basis, a very narrow basis: What are the 

17 consequences when the police without a warrant install a 

18 GPS secretly on the car of any citizen of the United 

19 States, and they want to use the evidence gained that 

way in a criminal trial? Our position is that's a 

21 seizure.

2  MR. LECKAR: In -- the record doesn't show 

3 in this case, but we know -- we learned last week, 

4 Justice Alito, from the NACDL that there's now a GPS on 

the market that weighs 2 ounces and is the size of a 

6 credit card. Think how easy it would be for any law 

7 enforcement agent of the 880,000 in the United States to 

8 stick one of those on anybody's vehicle. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: And what if it was put on 

the license place? Would that be a technical trespass? 

11 Is that the property of the driver? 

12  MR. LECKAR: Well, a license plate, as I 

13 understand it, is the property of the State, and driving 

14 is a privilege. But it's not a technical trespass in 

this particular case. Mr. Jones had the --

4 insofar as the seizure is concerned is, is it
 

meaningful. Everybody agrees here that there is -- that 

6 Antoine Jones had the right to control the use of his 

7 vehicle. The question is, was the interference a 

8 meaningful deprivation of his possessory interest? 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't -- I didn't 

hear an answer to Justice Alito's question. What is 

11 your position on the placement of the GPS device on the 

12 State-owned license plate?

14 do it, Your Honor. It's a seizure.

you to have. So, your trespass theory, it would seem, 

21 falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.

23 Chief Justice Roberts, my -- you would probably see the 

24 GPS, and in that case, you might have --

2  MR. LECKAR: In that particular case, what 

3 you have done is you have -- the installation of the 

4 GPS, it is a seizure. What makes it meaningful is the 

use of that GPS --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is ridiculous. 

7 Look at -- you give the State permission to put the 

8 license plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the 

9 State's license plate. You do not give anybody 

permission to have your car carry a tracking device. 

11  MR. LECKAR: That's correct. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: And whether it's put 

13 directly on the car or directly on something that the 

14 car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any 

difference. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it made a 

17 difference under your theory, which focused on the 

18 question of trespass, because it was attached to an 

19 effect owned by somebody else. This is an effect not 

owned by the individual. 

21  MR. LECKAR: That's correct. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the trespass 

23 theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.

3 interest. Then the question becomes --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Leckar, I guess I'm not 

sure I quite understand the argument, because a trespass 

6 is accomplished no matter what you put on somebody's car 

7 or somebody's overcoat or what have you. You could put 

8 a nonworking device in somebody's car, and it would 

9 still be a trespass, but surely the same constitutional 

problem is not raised. So, how do you get from the 

11 trespass to the constitutional problem? 

12  MR. LECKAR: As I -- thank you, Justice 

13 Kagan. As I said moments ago, what makes it meaningful, 

14 what makes it a meaningful deprivation of a -- of a 

possessory interest, is once the GPS gets activated. We 

16 look at reality. We follow what Silverman v. --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make it a 

18 seizure. That doesn't make it a seizure. It makes it a 

19 search.

 MR. LECKAR: Your Honor --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you can say that 

22 there's a trespass for the purpose of obtaining 

23 information, which makes it a search. But I don't see 

24 how it's a seizure. A seizure -- you have to bring 

something within your control. You have to stop the

3  MR. LECKAR: What has been seized is 

4 Antoine's data. Data is seized that is created by the 

GPS. Antoine Jones had the right, Your Honor, to 

6 control the use of his vehicle. And what the government 

7 did was surreptitiously deprive him of the use of 

8 that --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any case 

involving seizure of data floating in the air as opposed 

11 to papers? 

12  MR. LECKAR: The closest case I could come, 

13 Your Honor, would be Silverman, where the Court called a 

14 Fourth Amendment violation where the spike mike just 

touched -- touched the ventilator unit. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: It's not a violation 

17 unless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable 

18 search. And since you already -- and the same is true 

19 of seizure, isn't it?

 MR. LECKAR: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I think that's the 

6 question we've been debating. And I would like to know 

7 from you -- what they are saying is that the parade of 

8 horribles we can worry with -- worry about when it comes 

9 up; the police have many, many people that they suspect 

of all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost 

11 children to terrorism to all kinds of crimes. 

12  They're willing to go as far as reasonable 

13 suspicion in a pinch. And they say at least with that, 

14 you will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact 

allow the police to do their work with doing no more 

16 than subjecting the person to really good knowledge of 

17 where he's going on the open highway. Now, I -- they 

18 probably put it better than I did, but I'd appreciate 

19 your views on that.

 MR. LECKAR: Reasonable suspicion, Justice 

21 Breyer, is something that the Court has adopted for 

22 limited intrusions. And I refer you to the United 

23 States v. Place. Every 10 seconds of the day for 28

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know 

7 that? 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does it have to be 

9 cost-free? Suppose the police department says: We've 

got two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and 

11 watch this person, or we can have a device with a 

12 warrant. What difference does it make?

14 the capacity with GPS to engage in grave abuse, grave 

abuse of individual and group liberties, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose what they got 

17 is nothing more than what they would have had if they 

18 had 30 deputies staked out along the route. That's all. 

19 They'd get the same from 30 deputies. A constitutional

6 the surveillance camera? 

7  MR. LECKAR: Yes. First of all, you have a 

8 physical invasion. That's Bond v. United States. You 

9 have an invasion of his possessory interest, placement 

on the car. Physical invasion of a possessory interest, 

11 Justice Ginsburg, is more significant. It has always 

12 been viewed by this Court as more invasive than mere 

13 video -- mere visual surveillance. 

14  And even with a camera, it depends on the 

type of the video camera. We're not saying that the 

16 police are prohibited from having individual video 

17 cameras or several video cameras to surveil people.

19 enables limitless, pervasive, indiscriminate --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But what is the difference 

21 really? I'm told -- maybe this is wrong, but I'm told 

22 that if somebody goes to London, almost every place that 

23 person goes there's a camera taking pictures, so that

9 in London actually enabled them, if you watched, I got 

the impression, to track the bomber who was going to 

11 blow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he 

12 did. So, there are many people who will say that that 

13 kind of surveillance is worthwhile, and there are others 

14 like you who will say, no, that's a bad thing. But that 

isn't the issue exactly in front of us.

9  MR. LECKAR: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if -- give us a 

11 theory. Is that okay for the police to access those 

12 cameras and look at you moving from place to place? And 

13 if that's okay, then why is this not okay? What is your 

14 theory of your case?

 MR. LECKAR: Our theory, Justice Sotomayor, 

16 with respect to video camera, if they're targeting an 

17 individual -- this presents a grave question. It's a 

18 question that need not be resolved given this case. But 

19 if the Court wanted to address that question, once the 

police target somebody, they want to engage in 

21 individualized targeting for use of a pervasive network 

22 of cameras, and GPS is like a million cameras. That's 

23 the -- the New York Court of Appeals pointed that out, 

24 and this --

2  MR. LECKAR: All right. It's 28 cameras, 

3 but the equivalent of a camera tracking you every street 

4 corner you're on everywhere. Once you have 

individualized suspicion like that, if a court wanted to 

6 deal with it, I believe you would have to have a 

7 warrant. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Leckar, your -- all of 

9 this discussion -- you're going into it, but the 

questioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps 

11 over the difficult part of your case. The issue before 

12 us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police 

13 conduct is unreasonable. The unreasonableness 

14 requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not 

take effect unless there has been a search. And our 

16 cases have said that there's no search when -- when you 

17 are in public and where everything that you do is open 

18 to -- to the view of people. That's the hard question 

19 in the case, not whether this is unreasonable. That's 

not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do 

21 anything that's unreasonable. They can do a lot of 

22 stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth 

23 Amendment, and the -- the protection against that is the 

24 legislature.

3 where the car is going on the public streets, where the

this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for 

6 3 months, and that would not have violated anything, 

7 would it? 

8  MR. LECKAR: No. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Because there's no 

invasion of privacy. So, why is this an invasion of 

11 privacy? 

12  MR. LECKAR: Because it is -- it is a 

13 complete robotic substitute. It's not a -- it's not a 

14 tail. And interestingly enough, Your Honor. The 

government only cited in its brief one instance of a 

16 24-hour surveillance for all of 2 days. What you have 

17 here, Justice Scalia, is -- I'm going to refer to your 

18 dissent. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: A hundred times zero equals 

zero. If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1 

21 day, there's no invasion of privacy for a hundred days. 

22 Now, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can 

23 handle that with laws. But if there's no invasion of 

24 privacy, no matter how many days you do it, there's no 

invasion of privacy.

1  MR. LECKAR: Justice Scalia, what -- I'm 

2 going to refer to your dissent along with Justice Breyer 

3 in Bond v. United States. A GPS in your car is like --

4 or anybody's car, is like -- without a warrant, is like 

having an -- it makes you unable to get rid of an 

6 uninvited stranger. That's what it is. Now, what --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So is a tail. So is a tail 

8 when the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a 

9 month.

 MR. LECKAR: The question we have to answer 

11 in this case, Justice Scalia, is this: A tail -- if 

12 they can -- if they want a tail, if they want to commit 

13 the resources, that's fine. But what a GPS does, it 

14 involves -- it allows the government to engage in 

unlimited surveillance through a machine, through a 

16 machine robotically. Nobody is even involved monitoring 

17 it. The record in this case showed that many times the 

18 police officers just let -- let the machine go on. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where would you draw 

the line? Suppose that the GPS was used only to track 

21 somebody's movements for 1 day or for 12 hours or for 3 

22 hours. Would that be all right? 

23  MR. LECKAR: Our position, Justice Alito, is 

24 no circumstances should a GPS be allowed to be put on 

somebody's car. But we recognize --

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Put aside -- put aside the 

2 trespass question. 

3  MR. LECKAR: I'm not addressing it purely as 

4 a trespass.  Our view is the -- the use of a GPS as a 

search in and of itself should be -- is -- should be 

6 viewed as unreasonable. But if the Court were 

7 uncomfortable with that, if the Court had concerns with 

8 that, we suggested in our brief some -- some 

9 possibilities: One day, one trip, one person per day or 

trip, or perhaps when you use it exactly as a beeper, 

11 when you follow it, when you actually physically follow 

12 it. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that sounds like a 

14 legislative line. But what is the difference between 

following somebody for 12 hours, let's say, and 

16 monitoring their movements on a GPS for 12 hours? You 

17 would say that the latter -- your first argument is 

18 there's a problem with the latter but not with the 

19 former. But what would the reason for that be?

 MR. LECKAR: Because it's an unreasonable 

21 invasion of privacy, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: There's no more -- what --

24 you're followed by a police officer for 12 hours and you

2  MR. LECKAR: Because -- because what you
 

3 have here is society does not expect that the police,
 

4 the human element, would be taken out of -- would be
 

taken out of the surveillance factor. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: You know, I don't know what 

7 society expects, and I think it's changing. Technology 

8 is changing people's expectations of privacy. 

9  Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe 

10 years from now 90 percent of the population will be 

11 using social networking sites, and they will have on 

12 average 500 friends, and they will have allowed their 

13 friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365 

14 days a year, through the use of their cell phones. Then 

-- what would the expectation of privacy be then? 

16  MR. LECKAR: Well, the use of a cell phone, 

17 there are two ways of looking at it. As Justice Kennedy 

18 observed in Quon, cell phones are becoming so 

19 ubiquitous, there may be privacy interests.

 Our view is that currently the use of a cell 

21 phone, that's a voluntary act. People nowadays 

22 understand that there are ways to monitor by way of a 

23 cell phone.

4 on people's cars and either -- call it a seizure, call 

it a search, call it a search and seizure in the words 

6 of Katz, or call it a Fourth Amendment violation. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that -- maybe that's a 

8 good way to decide the case. But I just wonder, would 

9 Mr. Jones or anybody else be really upset if they found 

that the police had sneaked up to their car and put an 

11 inert device the size of a credit card on the underside 

12 of the car? What would they say about that, other than 

13 the fact that the police are wasting money doing this? 

14  MR. LECKAR: If it were nothing more than a 

note, say, or even a bumper sticker like you get at 

16 South of the Border, probably nothing, but this --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: You don't even see it. It's 

18 just a little wafer. They put it under the car. It 

19 does nothing.

 MR. LECKAR: It's a little wafer that's got 

21 an enormous capacity. Look at the --

It's not this invasion of your property interest. It's 

6 the monitoring that takes place. 

7  MR. LECKAR: The monitoring makes it 

8 meaningful. Putting it on enables them to make --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: But to ask Justice Alito's 

question in a different way, suppose that the police 

11 could do this without ever committing the trespass. 

12 Suppose that in the future all cars are going to have 

13 GPS tracking systems, and the police could essentially 

14 hack into such a system without committing the trespass. 

Would the constitutional issue we face be any different? 

16  MR. LECKAR: If, as I assume, that's because 

17 of manufacturers doing it, or because Congress has 

18 legislated it, Justice Kagan? Under either 

19 circumstance, people would know. They would know that 

their privacy rights had been taken away. Whether that 

21 would be possible to be -- to go through Congress, I 

22 seriously doubt, but people would know.

3  Justice Alito, what happens here, GPS
 

4 produces unique data. When you and I drive down the
 

street, we don't emit GPS data. What makes GPS data 

6 meaningful is the act -- is the use and placement of the 

7 GPS device, that was in this case, in this case, 

8 unconsented to by Antoine Jones, unknowingly. And the 

9 government knew that. That's why they went and did it 

surreptitiously, because they couldn't get it any other 

11 way. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Lots of communities have, 

13 including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on 

14 stop lights. Suppose the police suspected someone of 

criminal activity, and they had a computer capacity to 

16 take pictures of all the intersections that he drove 

17 through at different times of day, and they checked his 

18 movements and his routes for 5 days. Would that be 

19 lawful?

2  MR. LECKAR: No, Justice Sotomayor. I think 

3 the workable rule and the simplest rule that should be 

4 adopted is this: I think the Court should say to the 

law enforcement agency you came here looking for a rule; 

6 we're going to give you a rule. If you want to use GPS 

7 devices, get a warrant, absent exigent circumstances or 

8 another recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment; 

9 because of their capacity for -- to collect data that 

you couldn't realistically get, because of the 

11 vanishingly low cost, because of their pervasive nature, 

12 that you should get a warrant any time -- you must get a 

13 warrant any time you're going to attach a GPS to a 

14 citizen's effect or to a citizen's person.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets back 

16 to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to 

17 determine that there has been a search first before you 

18 impose the warrant requirement. And it seems to me that 

19 your -- the warrant requirement applies only with 

respect to searches, right? 

21  MR. LECKAR: And seizures. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And seizures. 

23 So, while it might seem like a good idea to impose the 

24 requirement on this particular technological device, you 

still have to establish that it's a search.

as witness this case, every 10 seconds of the day for 28 

6 days. 

7  If you know you're going to do that and you 

8 know, Justice Roberts, that this device -- this device 

9 has an amazingly invasive power and capacity. If you 

know you're going to do that and you're a law 

11 enforcement agent, then you do what they did originally. 

12 You get a warrant.

Your theory, I take it, would apply if you're going to

18 Amendment violation?

6 what society expects. I suppose if you ask people do 

7 you think it's a violation of privacy for the police to 

8 do this for no reason for a month, maybe they'd come out 

9 one way. If you asked the people do you think the 

police have to have probable cause before they monitor

Court; give it to Congress. And what this Court there

21 Circuit, which you should not do, or give us a workable

17 decide the narrow question before it, which I've 

18 articulated several times.

Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely 

21 intrastate operation. Congress can control police 

22 practices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment

9 a live case of controversy in which Antoine Jones' 

control of his vehicle was usurped and his car was 

11 converted into an electronic GPS transceiver serving the

that aren't here before the Court today. You could; we

17 surveillance. We could discuss balloon surveillance and 

18 other types of surveillance. But we don't have to.

22 of the case to me, and maybe there -- it's irrelevant

3 violation of the Fourth Amendment. So, it's a little 

4 strange that we're deciding whether a warrantless search 

here would have been unconstitutional, when there was a 

6 warrant. 

7  MR. LECKAR: They had the choice. They 

8 could have easily -- they could have gone back to the 

9 district judge and said -- given the district judge 

reasons --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: No, that's not my point. 

12 The point is that the violation of the 10-day rule and 

13 the violation of the statutory prohibition on -- or 

14 maybe it's in the rule -- the prohibition on the judge 

in the District ordering the installation only in the 

16 District are not Fourth Amendment requirements.

19 warrantless intrusion. When -- when the warrant --

8 conceivably have gone back there and explained to the

9  MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, advancing 

technology cuts in two directions. Technological 

11 advances can make the police more efficient at what they 

12 do through some of the examples that were discussed 

13 today: Cameras, airplanes, beepers, GPS. At the same 

14 time, technology and how it's used can change our 

expectations of privacy in the ways that Justice Alito 

16 was alluding to. Today perhaps GPS can be portrayed as 

17 a 1984-type invasion, but as people use GPS in their 

18 lives and for other purposes, our expectations of 

19 privacy surrounding our location may also change. For 

that --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dreeben, that -- that 

22 seems too much to me. I mean, if you think about this, 

23 and you think about a little robotic device following 

24 you around 24 hours a day anyplace you go that's not 

your home, reporting in all your movements to the

1 police, to investigative authorities, the notion that we 

2 don't have an expectation of privacy in that, the notion 

3 that we don't think that our privacy interests would be 

4 violated by this robotic device, I'm -- I'm not sure how 

one can say that. 

6  MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kagan, I think the 

7 Court should decide that case when it comes to it. This 

8 was my fundamental point: This case does not involve 

9 universal surveillance of every member of this Court or 

every member of the society. It involves limited 

11 surveillance of somebody who was suspected of drug 

12 activity --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You probably haven't had 

14 the opportunity to go into the cases. A hypothetical. 

Suppose exactly these facts, only the police aren't 

16 involved. A neighbor does it to another neighbor in 

17 order to see where that neighbor is going, and when he 

18 finds out, he tells his wife and other neighbors. Do 

19 you think that in most States, that would be an invasion 

of privacy? 

21  MR. DREEBEN: I'm willing to assume that it 

22 might be, Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that this 

23 Court measures the metes and bounds of the Fourth 

24 Amendment by State law invasions of privacy. The Court 

has --

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: We measure it by 

2 expectations of privacy under the Katz test if -- that 

3 may or may not be controlling. 

4  MR. DREEBEN: Yes, but in Greenwood, the 

Court dealt with a case where California had outlawed 

6 taking somebody's garbage, and this Court said that did 

7 not define an expectation of privacy for purposes of the 

8 Fourth Amendment --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It found that there was no 

expectation of privacy. 

11  MR. DREEBEN: Correct. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am asking you about this 

13 case, whether there would be an expectation of 

14 privacy --

MR. DREEBEN: Oh --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as a general matter 

17 under tort law. 

18  MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think so. And --

19 and the fact that something may be a tort for a private 

person doesn't mean that it's a problem for the police 

21 to do it. For example, in the Dow Chemical case, where 

22 the police used -- EPA in that case actually used 

23 cameras to surveil an industrial plant. There was a 

24 claim that it would have violated trade secret law for 

anybody else to do that. And the Court accepted that

1 and said tort law doesn't define the boundaries of the 

2 Fourth Amendment. 

3  In Knotts, the Court was very careful to 

4 reserve the possibility of 24-hour surveillance of every 

citizen in their persons and in their residences, saying 

6 we haven't seen that kind of abuse. If that kind of 

7 abuse comes up, the legislature is the best-equipped to 

8 deal with it, if in fact our society regards that as an 

9 unreasonable restriction on --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea of 

11 how many GPS devices are being used by Federal 

12 Government agencies and State law enforcement officials? 

13  MR. DREEBEN: The Federal Government I can 

14 speak to, and it's in the low thousands annually. It's 

not a massive universal use of an investigative 

16 technique. The FBI requires that there be some 

17 reasonable basis for using GPS before it installs it. 

18 And as a result, this is a technique that basically 

19 supplements visual surveillance rather than supplanting 

it all together. 

21  There was visual surveillance that was 

22 directed at Respondent. The GPS allowed it to be more 

23 effective. As Justice Kennedy and, I think, Justice 

24 Scalia's hypotheticals illustrated, Respondent is 

essentially conceding that around-the-clock visual

1 surveillance through teams of agents would not have
 

2 invaded any expectation of privacy.
 

3  This Court said in Knotts that police
 

4 efficiency has never been equated with police
 

unconstitutionality. The fact that GPS makes it more 

6 efficient for the police to put a tail on somebody 

7 invades no additional expectation of privacy that they 

8 otherwise would have had. The technology doesn't make 

9 something private that was previously public. When we 

go out in our cars, our cars have driver's licenses that 

11 we carry. We have license plates on the car. These are 

12 for the purpose of identification --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't seriously 

14 argue that there isn't a possessory interest in who puts 

something on your car and who -- like a -- a sign of 

16 some sort. 

17  MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think there would 

18 probably be some sort of State law possessory interest 

19 -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I finish? But there is no 

seizure for the very reason that Justice Breyer 

21 described under the Katz case. This Court has said that 

22 trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to create a 

23 Fourth Amendment violation. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
