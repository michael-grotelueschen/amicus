 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

 Ms. Katze.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. KATZE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The issue in this case is whether DWI is a 

violent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal 

Act sentencing enhancement. Sentencing enhancement 

takes the statutory sentencing range from zero to 10 

years and raises it to 15 years to life. The intent of 

the Armed Career Criminal Act is to punish most severely 

that category of recidivist violent offenders who are 

disproportionately responsible for the violent crimes 

and who, when they possess a weapon, are more dangerous.

 The government is trying to expand the reach 

of the statute by so broadly reading the residual clause 

as to include any crime that presents a serious 

potential risk of injury to another.

 Such a reading of that residual clause would 

swallow the entire statute. Congress had no intention 

of including DWI within the ambit of the Armed Career

Criminal Act. As Justice Breyer, writing for the First 

Circuit in Doe, said, "there is no reason to believe 

that Congress meant to enhance sentences pursuant to the 

Armed Career Criminal Act based on convictions --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you're quoting that, 

then this is what's now bothering me. I'm not saying I 

have an answer one way or the other.

 Let's take two crimes and imagine that the 

same number of people injured or killed is identical for 

the two. One let's say is burglary and the other is 

driving under the influence. Now, let's imagine exactly 

the same number are put at risk, exactly the same number 

hurt, exactly the same number killed.

 When I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me 

that there still is an important difference between the 

two crimes that is controlling here. But if you look at 

what I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very 

well. So I would like you to tell me what I should have 

said in order to have said very clearly just what that 

intuitive difference was.

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, I think what you 

said was sufficient, but you might have added that there 

are other attributes to the -- the crimes in the -- the 

enumerated crimes, those being burglary, arson, 

extortion, use of explosives. There are certain

attributes that they share in common that DWI does not 

share, and those would include those, as you stated, an 

active violent crime. But in addition to that, they're 

all property crimes, as this Court said in Taylor.

 They are also all acts that have the intent 

of causing harm. DWI does not have that. They are all 

more dangerous when committed with a gun. And they're 

all typical of crimes that would be committed by career 

criminals.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Some of those 

characteristics don't seem to apply to all of the 

specific crimes that are mentioned. Take somebody who 

sends a series of letter bombs for the purpose of 

injuring other people. Now, that would fall within a 

crime involving use of explosives. But it's not really 

a property crime and it's not a crime that's more 

dangerous when done with a gun.

 So how -- how can you say that those 

characteristics apply to every crime in the list?

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, arguably they might 

not apply to everyone every time. But I think the vast 

majority of them do. And what we're looking at are in 

ordinary cases. And the example that you gave of the 

letter bomb, I believe that would be a property crime. 

When we're talking about a property crime as with arson

or use of explosives, it's the destruction of property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can say that 

all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and 

DUI doesn't; does it?

 MS. KATZE: Absolutely. Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a big different, 

isn't it?

 MS. KATZE: I think it's a huge difference. 

DUI -- DUI in New Mexico is a strict liability crime. 

It has no mens rea whatsoever. An individual doesn't 

even have to have the intent to drive. And, in fact, we 

have a case in New Mexico where a woman had taken Ambien 

and was driving, and she didn't even know she was 

driving, but she still was convicted because she merely 

was in control of the vehicle. So in New Mexico, a 

strict liability crime where you don't even have to know 

you're driving, as opposed to the four enumerated 

offenses, where there is clearly some intent to cause 

some harm --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have the same 

answer if you had a State statute which defined felony 

drunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which 

causes serious death or serious physical injury to 

another?

 MS. KATZE: I think it would -- the analysis

wouldn't be different. There would be an additional 

element, an additional piece of harm. But the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You would still say that 

that statute does not qualify?

 MS. KATZE: Not unless there is a definition 

of -- if there is an actual intent to cause harm. If 

there is just merely harm that's caused --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, there isn't in the 

usual felony drunk driving statute, there is --

MS. KATZE: And I agree. I think in that 

case, then that also would not fall within the statute. 

There is not the intent to cause harm.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the crime is 

vehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of 

another person while driving intoxicated? Would that be 

a crime that creates a serious potential risk of 

physical injury to another?

 MS. KATZE: That would not fall under 

paragraph 2, because it would not meet any of the other 

attributes of the enumerated crimes. Possibly could it 

fall under paragraph 1, the use of force? It would 

depend how the elements described what the definition of 

use of force. This Court has previously defined use of 

force as an intentionality that I think normally in that 

type of vehicular homicide would not be included.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are assuming, of 

course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the 

statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a 

couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered. And 

we left that issue open in James, didn't we?

 MS. KATZE: Yes, you did. In James you were 

dealing with a clearly analogous case, and DWI is not 

analogous in any way, shape, or form with those four 

enumerated crimes. And I think that it's pretty 

clear --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, in one way -- in 

one way it is, in that like those other crimes it 

presents a serious risk of potential injury to another. 

That's what they all have in common. It's a residual --

one argument that was made was when the statute was 

first drafted all it had was the residual, "presents a 

serious risk of potential injury to another." So 

that's, the argument is, that's what drives this 

statute, and then these, these specific crimes, were 

added just to be sure they would be covered.

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, answering your 

question and the Chief Justice's question, I think it's 

important to remember that the first version of this 

statute came out in 1984, and that just involved 

burglary and robbery. And then in 1986, we have the

version that we have now.

 What we are discussing is the debate in 

Congress that occurred between then and how the actual 

wording was made up. But I submit that if Congress 

wanted to use those four enumerated crimes merely as an 

example, they would have structured the paragraph 

differently. They would have made a third paragraph 

under definition of violent felony and they didn't.

 There are two paragraphs. The second 

paragraph, the one that we're dealing with, clearly 

there's a substantive connection between the four 

enumerated crimes and it says, "or otherwise crimes that 

present a serious potential risk of injury."

 It seems clear to me if we look at this 

under the rules of statutory interpretation -- and this 

is a statutory interpretation case -- that Congress 

added those four crimes as a means of limiting the 

residual clause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why did it use the 

word "otherwise"? Why didn't it use the word 

"likewise"?

 MS. KATZE: I would agree, "likewise" would 

have been a more artful way to have written it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It would have meant 

something different, wouldn't it?

MS. KATZE: I think, in fact --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "Otherwise" means in some 

other way.

 MS. KATZE: That's the dictionary 

definition, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's usually the best way 

to understand each other is by, you know, assuming that.

 MS. KATZE: I would agree that's one thing 

that we look at. But under -- this is a statutory 

interpretation case, not a dictionary case, and we have 

to look at the plain meaning. And that involves looking 

at this turn of the phrase in context, in the whole 

text. What was -- what was the intent of this statute? 

What's the term to be defined, "violent felony."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You've run away from me on 

"otherwise." I think the "otherwise" ties the last 

paragraph to the -- to the preceding four enumerated 

crimes. And if -- if it had just gone on to say "or 

presents a serious risk of injury" without the 

"otherwise," then I don't think you'd have any argument 

that you have to somehow look to the degree of injury, 

the -- the manner of injury that the four enumerated 

crimes have. The "otherwise" ties it together, "or

otherwise presents a risk of serious injury."

 And I think the implication is that the --

that the -- the injury must be similar to the -- at 

least in degree to the enumerated crimes beforehand. I 

wouldn't run away from the "otherwise."

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, and I'm not running 

away from the "otherwise." While I don't agree that 

it's the dictionary meaning, I do agree with you, Your 

Honor, that it is the substantive link. It's the 

connection. It's a word and we have to give meaning to 

every word in the statute --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in doing that, 

you've got, in other words, to understand what 

"otherwise" means. You've got to look at the language 

that follows "otherwise." And that's -- that then 

refers to "risk of serious injury to a person." And in 

effect, it is saying the common element is risk of 

injury to the person. How that risk is raised may be in 

different ways from the way the risk is raised, say, in 

a burglary case or what-not. And if that is the proper 

analysis, then it seems to me you've got a tough row to 

hoe here.

 MS. KATZE: I believe the correct 

analysis -- and I do believe that ejusdem generis does 

apply here, because here we have a list of four specific

offenses followed by a general term, and we have to read 

that general term narrowly so as not to give additional 

breadth to acts of Congress. And we have to remember 

that we're defining the term "violent felony". And 

those four violent felonies that have the certain 

attributes in common then are followed by "or 

otherwise." And in looking at it all in context, there 

has to be some --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then I was 

wondering about that as well, that as a violent felony 

whether that gives you any traction. But extortion, you 

don't normally think of that as a violent felony and yet 

it's clearly included in the definition.

 MS. KATZE: It's violent in the sense that 

extortion is trying to get something from somebody of 

value. It's the idea that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but you don't 

say, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time. 

You may say, give me that or I'll release this 

embarrassing letter. That's extortion. It's not 

violent, though.

 MS. KATZE: I think it is violent in the 

sense of the terms that this Court used in Leocal and 

that Justice Breyer used in Doe, the idea of some kind 

of violent act or more closely related action.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then, releasing 

the letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment 

rather than physical injury. Yet it would qualify as 

extortion.

 MS. KATZE: It absolutely would, and this 

Court in Taylor said that the four crimes all have those 

-- basically, in general, have those attributes.

 But I think we have to look at the ordinary 

case. I believe even in the hypothetical that you have 

given, Your Honor, is that -- that that does involve an 

act of violence against an individual's reputation, that 

reputation in the common law sense --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it says "person," 

not -- it says "person," not "reputation."

 MS. KATZE: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying the violence 

can be against the reputation. That's not what the 

statute is talking about. I mean that is -- that's 

inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.

 MS. KATZE: But the statute does talk about 

violence. If we look at the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't talk about 

violence in the abstract. It talks about physical force 

against the person of another in number 1; and in number 

2, where we are here, "a risk of physical injury to

another."

 MS. KATZE: Yes, Your Honor. And in the 

second paragraph it deals with property crimes. And the 

whole -- it all comes under the rubric of violent 

crimes. That's what Congress was concerned about. Even 

the serious drug offenses, the reason those were added 

to the statute is the concern about violence with drugs. 

So it all has to do with the idea of violence, and so, 

initially, it was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it has to do with the 

idea of risk of violence. A burglar when he commits 

burglary does not want violence. He wants to get the 

silver out of the sideboard and get back down the 

ladder. He doesn't want any violence with anybody.

 MS. KATZE: I would agree with you, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the problem is that, by 

being in the situation he's in, he creates a risk that 

violence will occur. Somebody may show up.

 And the person, likewise, who commits DWI 

doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has placed himself 

in a situation in which, if somebody shows up driving 

another car in front of him or walking across the street 

or maybe even in apprehending him for his DWI, a risk of 

violence is raised. The two cases in that respect are

parallel.

 MS. KATZE: I would disagree, Your Honor, 

and here's why I don't think they're parallel. In a 

burglary, I agree with you, The individual doesn't want 

to get caught, but goes with the fear or the knowledge 

that they may be apprehended. They may arm 

themselves -- again, the concern with those violent 

activities and being armed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: When the drunk leaves the 

bar, doesn't he have the realization, unless he is just 

blind at that point, that he may be apprehended?

 MS. KATZE: It is just --

JUSTICE SOUTER: He's not going to throw 

himself into the arms of the nearest cop.

 MS. KATZE: Absolutely not, but here's the 

big -- the big difference. If somebody is drunk and 

gets in a car, at most their intention is to get from 

Point A to Point B. They have no intention of hurting 

an individual. They don't even have the intent of 

driving.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but when a guy goes 

up the ladder for the silver in the sideboard, at most 

what he wants is the silver.

 MS. KATZE: But he intentionally goes to 

somebody else's property to commit this act that will

cause harm.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the driver 

intentionally drives the car knowing that there's a 

risk.

 MS. KATZE: With all due respect, Your 

Honor, in DWI there is no intention to drive. It's a 

strict liability offense, as the example I gave in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- that is 

because everybody knows there are -- there are two 

conditions: One in which he just is reckless and he 

doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other 

one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent. Both of 

them are covered, and the latter is simply because we 

don't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of 

the two.

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, in New Mexico, DWI 

is a strict liability. There is no intent. There is 

not even negligence. It's merely being in control of a 

vehicle.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's true in almost 

every State, for the reasons that I've indicated, 

because many people have the intent, and those that 

don't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more 

drunk.

some of the discussions about the actions of DWI and 

running into people, it's important to note, if we're 

looking at this with a categorical analysis, just to 

look at the elements of the offense. DWI in New Mexico 

would necessarily -- there would have to be another 

element. If somebody --

JUSTICE ALITO: The residual clause is a 

difficult problem, but I still have not heard what 

characteristic the enumerated offenses have in common, 

all of them, that provides a basis for limiting the 

residual clause.

 They're not all property crimes. A lot of 

crimes involving explosives: Illegal possession of 

explosives, illegally manufacturing explosives, 

obtaining explosives by making false statements. None 

of those are property crimes and none of them involve 

injury to a person -- I mean involve the threat of the 

use of force against a person. So what is the 

characteristic that all of the enumerated crimes have in 

common that would provide a limitation on the residual 

clause?

 MS. KATZE: At their very least, they all 

are acts that intend to cause harm. They all are 

property crimes. This Court reiterated --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, they're not. In 18

U.S.C. 842, explosives, unlawful -- "It shall be 

unlawful to engage in the business of importing, 

manufacturing, or dealing in explosive materials without 

a license issued under this chapter."

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor --

JUSTICE ALITO: There's no intent to cause 

harm there.

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, the term in the 

Armed Career Criminal Act is the "use of explosives." 

This Court has defined "use" as having an 

intentionality, and intent -- and I think it's fair to 

say that that intent to use those explosives -- and, 

from a practical point of view, people who -- and we 

could talk about the ordinary case. People who use 

explosives, they blow up property. They blow up houses. 

They blow up bridges. At the very least, they're 

blowing up explosives. That certainly -- that certainly 

is an act to cause some type of harm to property.

 And, with respect to whether they are 

property, I submit all four are property crimes. This 

Court said in Taylor all four of them are property 

crimes. This Court interpreted the congressional -- the 

legislative history. Those were four property crimes 

that Congress specifically wanted to add to the concern

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

understand this line of argue. You would exclude, let's 

say, physical assault from -- from this, I mean assault 

with intent to kill, because it's not a property crime?

 MS. KATZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That wouldn't be included 

in the "otherwise involved"?

 MS. KATZE: No, Your Honor, that would not 

fit under paragraph 2. That would fit under paragraph 

1, the use of force against an individual.

 Congress carefully crafted this statute. 

They dealt with serious drug offenses and they dealt 

with offenses against people, and then they dealt with 

offenses against property where there was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd, 

when the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical 

injury to another, to say that it's concerned only with 

property crimes.

 MS. KATZE: Property crimes with the 

potential for physical injury to another, not just 

purely property crimes. The four enumerated crimes all 

have the potential for physical injury to another.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 

your argument gives us greater reason to treat the last 

clause as independent just so that we can be sure that

it doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the 

Chief Justice just pointed out, "physical injury" is 

really the term that does the work in the second clause.

 So it seems to me that you're almost giving 

us a reason to make that clause more independent, more 

forceful, more significant.

 MS. KATZE: Absolutely not, Your Honor. You 

wouldn't be able to make that interpretation, which is 

basically what the government is suggesting, which would 

read "otherwise" out of the statute and therefore either 

make it tantamount to a third paragraph, which there is 

not a third paragraph, or would basically make the 

residual clause so broad it would swallow the entire 

statute. And we can't believe that Congress would have 

so carefully delineated the different areas of violent 

felonies and then eviscerate it all with this residual 

clause.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

about your interpretation of the word "otherwise." Do 

you think it is the equivalent of the statute that 

omitted that word, but added in "conduct that presents 

an equally serious potential risk of physical injury"? 

Do you think -- in other words, do you think that the 

four examples define the risk of physical injury that, 

the risk of potential physical injury the statute

contemplates?

 MS. KATZE: Your Honor, I don't know that I 

would agree "equally serious" would be the exact correct 

equivalent. I think that that would be in keeping with 

Justice Scalia's, more or less, my impression of Justice 

Scalia's dissent in James, because I would submit that 

there has to be even more than just an equal balance of 

risk. I do think that is an issue that needs to be 

compared, as this Court did in James. The Court 

compared the risk of attempted burglary to burglary and 

found that they were similar.

 I think in a non-analogous case there are 

other attributes that we'd have to look at, and that's 

why we suggest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't that 

suggest that "otherwise" in the statute is in fact used 

to mean "likewise"? I mean, if we said "attempted 

burglary" in James it's obviously included because 

burglary is -- attempted burglary doesn't present a risk 

in a different fashion from burglary. It presents it in 

the same fashion.

 MS. KATZE: And that was this Court's 

analysis in James, and I think that that's reasonable to

question.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. KATZE: I think it's important not to 

lose sight of the term that we are defining, "violent 

felony," and that -- as well as the purpose or intent of 

the statute was to punish a very small percentage, as 

this -- as this Court said in Taylor, a very small 

percentage of very serious offenders. This isn't a 

statute that is written to say any individual who has 

three felony convictions that may cause serious 

potential risk of injury to an individual is going to 

get 15 years. That simply wasn't the purpose. The --

the intent of the statute was to punish this small 

population of individuals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, particularly 

when you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of 

serious potential risk of (ii), why would -- why would 

Congress mean to exclude a particular category of 

physical injury from the reach of the statute?

 MS. KATZE: Because if it -- if it did 

include absolutely everything, then it would swallow the 

whole statute, because certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, not everything; 

everything that presents a serious potential risk of 

physical injury.

MS. KATZE: I think it -- if it -- for 

example, if it could include DWI, it would be hard to 

imagine what kind of crime wouldn't be included in 

there. Under that type of reading, if we look at the 

structure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Filling out a false income 

tax return. I mean, I thought of one.

 MS. KATZE: Other than maybe some 

white-collar crime.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is a whole 

category of those. So --

MS. KATZE: But the -- the problem with that 

analysis is that Congress was very clear who these --

who this statute was geared at; and as Judge McConnell 

said in his dissent, the name of the statute, the Armed 

Career Criminal Act, is not just window dressing. 

There's a -- I mean, that just reinforces our 

interpretation that there is this very small percentage 

of individuals. It's not supposed to be a general catch 

phrase. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think 

presents the most serious potential risk of injury to 

all of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or 

that we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?

that: I wouldn't argue with you that there are more 

people driving drunk than there are people burglarizing 

houses, but the relevant analysis is what's the risk in 

an individual incident? And in that case statistically 

there is a greater risk of injury in a burglary, under 

this Court's -- in Tennessee v Garner, it said 8.3 

percent, as opposed to a quarter of a percent in an 

individual episode of drunk driving. So we can't put 

the cumulative drunk driving on the back of Mr. Begay. 

We look at the individual incident, doing categorical 

analysis, looking at the elements in that individual 

incident.

 Congress was very concerned about issues of 

federalism. The reason for the Armed Career Criminal 

Act was to support law enforcement efforts on the part 

of States, not to federalize crime, not to federalize 

criminal investigation and prosecution. We are 

suggesting that keeping that in mind and looking at the 

-- the plain meaning of the phrase that we were 

discussing, and looking at the way the statute is 

actually structured and the fact that there are not 

three different paragraphs, as well as the fact that 

Congress could have picked to just say "or" as opposed 

to "or otherwise," and we have to give "otherwise" a 

meaning; and we suggest that our meaning of "likewise"

 Previously this Court has said "or otherwise 

qualified for a position" and found that people were 

qualified in a similar way than other people; "otherwise 

qualified to vote," found that individuals were as

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Drunk driving is an act that by its nature 

endangers people's lives. It is precisely for that 

reason that it is a crime under the laws of all 50 

States. When a person is repeatedly convicted of that 

offense and therefore becomes subject to punishment as a 

felon, he has committed a violent felony as Congress 

defined that term in the Armed Career Criminal Act, that

is because he has committed a crime that in the words of 

the statute involves conduct that presents a serious 

potential risk of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about a habitual 

speeder?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, speeding isn't a felony 

offense under the laws of any State, to my knowledge. 

And we have to recall that the ACCA contains two 

requirements for treatment for prior conviction as a 

violent felony that would support enhanced sentencing 

under that act. The felony requirement is not a trivial 

requirement. It was in fact a focus of congressional 

debate, and it was intended to capture only serious 

crimes. As a general matter, crimes of ordinary 

negligence, simple carelessness, or totally blameworthy 

acts don't merit felony punishment.

 As this Court recognized in Staples, to 

label a criminal act as a felony is indeed a serious 

thing and something that legislatures, by long 

tradition, reserved for truly serious acts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what is the -- if the 

legislature made it a crime to send text messages on a 

cell phone while driving, and the punishment were severe 

enough to qualify here? Would that be treated the same 

way?

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MS. KRUGER: Well, it would present a harder 

question, Justice Alito, and that's because, for one 

thing, we don't have the uniform judgment of 

legislatures that helps us know in this case that drunk 

driving does in all cases present a serious risk of 

injury. And also because the conduct that's defined by 

the DUI statute of New Mexico, as well as other States, 

by definition defines conduct that is unsafe. You only 

violate the statute if you are impaired to such a degree 

that your faculties and motor skills are such that you 

are unable to drive a car safely. With text messaging 

there isn't quite that categorical mapping on of the 

risk to the conduct that's proscribed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So there is no State where 

speeding -- even if maybe you hurt somebody or something 

-- there is no State where speeding is under a statute 

that you could be imprisoned for more than a year?

 MS. KRUGER: To my knowledge, there is no 

State in which speeding itself is a felony offense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, a felony as defined 

here. I just wanted to be sure you're focusing -- it's 

defined here as "subject to by imprisonment for a term 

exceeding one year." Now is --

MS. KRUGER: To my knowledge, at least, 

Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I just want to be 

sure we're on the same wavelength. Fine.

 MS. KRUGER: Reckless driving, on the other 

hand, when it does result in serious physical injury to 

another, is often punished as a felony. But there is 

obviously a difference between speeding by itself and 

reckless driving.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Kruger, what I don't 

understand about this statute as you're interpreting it 

is why you need any of it except the last phrase? Once 

you give the last phrase, "involves conduct that 

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to 

another," all of the rest of it is automatically 

included. "Has as an element the use, attempted use or 

threatened use of physical force against the person of 

another" -- that obviously presents a serious potential 

risk of physical injury to another. Or is burglary, 

arson, extortion, the use of explosives? Congress could 

have saved itself a lot of trouble by simply erasing all 

the rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct 

that presents a serious potential risk of physical 

injury or not. That can't be what they meant.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, what this Court said 

about the structure of the statute in Taylor is that 

Congress's purpose was first to identify crimes that do

have as an element the use force, but also to capture a 

category of crimes that do not have as an element the 

use force but nevertheless present a potential harm to 

another human being.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why would Congress 

go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest 

what other kind of crimes they need to include by this 

residual category of "any conduct" that presents a 

serious potential risk of physical injury?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, indeed as the Court said 

in Taylor and I think as the Court reiterated in James, 

it included the examples of four enumerated offenses in 

clause 2 to provide examples of the kinds of crimes that 

they believed to present a serious --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The degree of risk -- the 

degree of risk, for example?

 MS. KRUGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if it doesn't come up to 

the degree of risk that any of those four would, it 

would not be included?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I don't know that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No.

 MS. KRUGER: -- that the enumerated crimes 

set an absolute four. Congress could have written a 

statute that said that --

What's it do?

 MS. KRUGER: They do provide examples of the 

kinds of crimes that Congress thought did present a 

serious risk.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How? How? How does it 

limit the latter part? Is it because they are all 

crimes that require mens rea, intent? So should we 

limit it by saying it has to be a -- a conduct that's 

intentional conduct that presents a serious risk?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think, as the Court 

said in James, all of these crimes are quite different 

offenses that don't share very many characteristics in 

common, including incidentally intent to cause harm.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it does limit 

it. So tell me how it limits it?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, what it does is it 

provides a useful benchmark against which to assess the 

risks that are associated with any other crime.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice. Benchmark of 

what? Of intent, of degree of risk?

 MS. KRUGER: Of degree -- it's degree and 

kinds of risk. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the degree of 

risk has to be pretty much similar to those four?

is what the Court said in James --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Comparable --

MS. KRUGER: And in this case we do think 

that the risks associated with DUI are comparable to the 

risks --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that? 

I guess this is a question I asked your friend.  I mean, 

degree of risk. I mean what are the odds that we're 

going to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical 

injury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk 

driving.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, I 

guess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of 

drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to 

what percentage of burglars are involved in violent 

confrontations?

 MS. KRUGER: No, Your Honor. I don't think 

that the answer to the question can turn on statistical 

comparisons of the likelihood that harm will result in 

any given episode of any of these crimes. I think that 

that is a proposition that the Court underscored in 

James, when it decided whether attempted burglary 

qualified without reference to hard statistics. And the

fact of the matter is that hard statistics in most of 

these crimes are simply unavailable. So to make the 

answer in any case turn on the availability of 

statistics would lead to fundamentally arbitrary 

results.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the anomalies 

about this, and we start out -- this is an armed career 

criminal. And you can say, well, burglary -- burglary 

and arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career 

criminal; you commit these kinds of crimes. Congress 

doesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're 

going to get the book thrown at you. But there doesn't 

seem to be much of a connection. I mean how -- how is 

it going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more 

or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the 

glove compartment?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, we think that it's clear 

from the enumeration of the offenses in clause 2 in the 

definition of "violent felony" that Congress wasn't 

intending to capture only a set of crimes that are made 

more dangerous when they're committed with a firearm. 

It is, in fact, the kind of statute that Congress wrote 

in 18 U.S.C. 942(c), which concerns the use or carrying 

of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of 

violence. But here what Congress was concerned about

was capturing a set of offenders who, by their criminal 

history, have demonstrated an inherent disregard for the 

value of human life and therefore should not only be 

prohibited from possessing firearms but should face 

particularly severe sanctions for failure to abide by 

that prohibition. Our --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then they could have turned 

it just on dangerousness. I'm back to Justice Scalia 

and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of 

repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific. 

Imagine a universe of crimes. Every member of that 

universe we concede has precisely the same degree of 

danger as arson, explosives, burglary. So there's no 

argument about the risk to human life. It is identical. 

And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is 

to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and 

those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have 

a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum. So 

what we're looking are people who are particularly bad 

that they have a gun. Now go back to our universe, and 

in that universe we have some things on the one hand 

like arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a 

few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or 

recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance 

down the drain or -- here's a good one I found -- if you

are a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat 

company and you fail through negligence or simple 

inadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a 

lifeboat, well, felony or worse. And there are quite a 

few dozens of these things: Failing to stop at an 

inspection station if you are a trucker. You know? 

There are quite a few, where what's at issue is 

negligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even 

recklessness, but it seems to have nothing -- and it's 

dangerous -- but has nothing to do with whether, when 

later on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for 

having a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger, 

you're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him. 

Now, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the initial response to that question is that the 

statute that Congress wrote unequivocally focuses the 

inquiry on the risk of harm to other human beings. 

Congress could very well have written a statute that 

required intent to harm. It could have written a 

statute that required intentional use of force, as it 

did in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but it didn't mean that 

-- you said it didn't mean that because they could have 

said that and nothing else. If that's what they meant,

they could have eliminated everything else that they 

said. They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding 

portions. And when you tie it to the preceding 

portions, you come up with some limitations of the sort 

that Justice Breyer was suggesting.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think you don't, Your 

Honor, because I think the most obvious way to tie it to 

the preceding sections is, again, to import a kind of 

use-of-force requirement such as the 18 U.S.C. 16(b) 

requirements that would look at the risk of force 

intentionally will be used in the course of committing 

the offense, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How much of a 

limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making? I 

mean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver. 

Everybody in town says he always drives drunk. I mean, 

how would they greet the news: Guess what? He's just 

got a gun. I mean, that raises the level of risk 

significantly, doesn't it?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, indeed, I think that it 

does, and I think the facts of this case bear out that 

Congress's concern about possession of firearms by 

people who have committed crimes of a character that 

present a serious risk in a serial manner was indeed 

well-founded.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what test, 

what conclusion, you want me to come to in your 

argument? Drunk driving is within the last clause 

because --

MS. KRUGER: It is because, first of all, 

the risks of drunk driving are commonly understood. 

They're supported by the uniform legislative judgment of 

the 50 States. And also because those risks are 

comparable in both kind and degree to the kinds of risks 

that are associated with crimes that Congress 

specifically enumerated in the statute as meeting the 

test.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: She says not at all. Your 

friend on the other side says that it's something like, 

what, two and a half percent for burglary and point 

something for the chances of hurting somebody if you're 

driving DUI?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think, again, the 

statistical inquiry, while it can be helpful and 

relevant in individual cases, is not dispositive. I 

think if you look at the statistics, the chances of 

injury resulting from a given arson fire are also well 

below 1 percent. What Congress wasn't concerned about 

was the statistical likelihood of any injury in a 

particular episode --

enough?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that Congress was 

entitled to look at --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not trying to be 

captious, but I -- it's difficult to find out what the 

standard is.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the significance of 

Justice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is 

more dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but 

driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or 

not there's a gun in the car?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Stevens, it's 

difficult to see how arson, for example, or explosives 

use is made more dangerous when the criminal is carrying 

a gun. Presumably in those cases the criminal's use --

weapon of choice is fire or explosives rather than a 

gun. The only risk that would inhere would be the risk 

that any criminal would pose when apprehended by the 

authorities, and it's the same risk that a presumably a 

drunk driver would pose to others when apprehended by an 

officer who pulls them over.

deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he

had a gun might pull the trigger? And I will suggest 

that's a reasonable inference. I also will give you 

this: That a person who's so careless as to go drunk 

driving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or 

he might leave it around the house. So I'll give you 

that one. But my instinct is that Congress, in this 

Act, is not worried about guns going off carelessly 

around the house. They are worried about a person being 

the kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and 

pull the trigger. Now, is there something you can say 

that disabuses me of that instinct?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think one way to start 

to answer that question is by looking specifically at 

what Congress likely meant when it referred to "arson" 

in the statute. Under 18 U.S.C. 844(i), arson is 

defined as maliciously damaging property by means of 

fire or explosives. But the way courts have interpreted 

that language is not to require intent to damage 

property in all instances. It also covers situations in 

which the fire is set with willful disregard for the 

likelihood that damage will occur; in other words, in 

situations in which the fire has occurred and recklessly 

poses harm. And we think that that is the kind of 

injury that is at issue in this case; that is, 

fundamentally the same kind of risk that DUI poses.

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think this is 

just limited to intentional arson? You think negligent 

arson? Wow.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly true that 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Negligent extortion, 

negligent use of explosives? I mean, it's in a list of 

things that are talking about, you know, intentional 

crimes that armed career criminals would be likely to 

do.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think that Congress was 

more than likely aware of the fact that 18 U.S.C. 844 

did treat arson in this manner, particularly considering 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think Congress had 

the slightest idea.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the definition of -- the 

reach of the Federal arson statute came to encompass use 

of fire in 1982, only shortly before the ACCA was 

enacted. And certainly it's true that most State 

legislatures have also defined arson offenses to include 

similar kinds of intentional setting of fire with 

reckless disregard to the likelihood of damage or injury 

that would result.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you comment on one 

other point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion? 

Is there significance in the title of this statute, 

"Armed Career Criminal Act." Does this statute intend 

to identify career criminals?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's difficult to 

see how it would support a limitation to the kinds of 

crimes that are normally committed as a means of 

livelihood in that sense of "career." It certainly does 

refer to career criminals in the sense that they are 

habitual offenders, that they are recidivists. But 

certainly not all the enumerated offenses, nor even the 

offenses that are encompassed by the definition that's 

contained in clause 1 of the statute, are normally 

committed as a means of violent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure. It 

seems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion, 

explosives involves at least the stereotype of the armed 

career criminal that you see in movies and hear about in 

organized crimes testimony and so forth. I don't -- I 

don't think it's completely far of the mark.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, it is certainly true that 

the kind of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Obviously -- obviously 

incomplete.

MS. KRUGER: Well, it's certainly true that 

the kinds of crimes that are encompassed by clause 1 of 

the definition, sort of traditional crimes of violence 

like murder, assault, rape, are not ordinarily committed 

as a means of livelihood. People rarely make a 

profession of those types of careers.

 And it's also true that ordinarily arson is 

not committed for insurance fraud, but is committed for 

a large number of other purposes that have nothing to do 

with the profit motive, including covering up evidence 

of other crimes, including simple vandalism.

 So I think it's implausible to think that 

Congress was really focused here on the kinds of crimes 

that are normally committed for profit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What else -- what else 

would be in this catalogue? You rejected my speeder, 

but I think you said something about a reckless driver 

might, habitually reckless driver. What else would fit 

the description "conduct that presents a serious 

potential risk of physical injury to another"?

 MS. KRUGER: We think the category of crimes 

of recklessness that pose an injury, reckless disregard 

of the risk of injury to others, would qualify because 

in those cases juries have necessarily found that there 

was objectively a serious risk and that failures to

appreciate that risk and to act accordingly constitutes 

a gross deviation from the ordinary standard of care 

that a reasonable person would exercise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'd like to know 

specifically. You said reckless driving; and what else?

 MS. KRUGER: Reckless driving that results 

in serious bodily injury or death to another, which is a 

felony under the laws of many States, would qualify.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That has the potential of 

doing that, not --

MS. KRUGER: Yes, but reckless driving 

simple is ordinarily, not punishable as a felony under 

the traffic laws. We think, similarly, reckless 

homicide would qualify.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't that come in 

in the first, the violent crime, the first part?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, presumably it wouldn't, 

because by definition a reckless homicide does not 

involve the intentional use of force, the threatened use 

of force, or attempted use of force. And the definition 

relates solely to the killing of another, whether or not 

by intentional use of force, in situations that 

disregard the great dangerousness to human life and 

those actions.

 The other things that would qualify would be

cases like DUI, where recklessness need not be proved as 

such, but that are underscored by legislative 

determinations that the conduct that is proscribed is by 

definition reckless, by definition poses a serious risk 

that a person should appreciate and should accordingly 

conform their conduct to a different standard.

 Petitioner's argument suffers from the 

fundamental flaw that it describes a statute that 

Congress didn't write. Congress did indeed consider 

incorporating the definition of "crime of violence" that 

is set forth at 18 U.S.C. 16 when it redrafted the 

statute in 1986 and it decided against it, instead 

making the inquiry turn on the potential for risk to 

human life as opposed to the potential that -- the risk 

that force would be used or on the intentional use of 

force.

 We think that that decision is one that 

needs to be given effect in interpreting the statute. 

As this Court recognized in Leocal, the risk of 

intentional use of force is simply not the same thing 

that a risk of -- the risk that an accident will occur 

that will cause serious injury to another.

that it considered too narrow and one that it considered 

as potentially too broad." And the one that it 

considered potentially too broad is "any felony that by 

its nature involves a substantial risk that physical 

force against a person or property of another may be 

used in the course of committing an offense is the" --

this is on page 37 of your brief.

 MS. KRUGER: Yes, Your Honor. That is the 

definition of "crime of violence" that's contained at 18 

U.S.C. 16. And it is, indeed, unquestionably broader 

than the definition of "violent felony" at 

924(e)(2)(D)(ii) in at least two respects. One is that 

it would cover misdemeanors involving use of force as 

well as felonies. And the second is that it would cover 

crimes that involve a risk that force would be used 

against property, rather than focusing exclusively on 

the risk of harm to a human being, as the definition of 

"violent felony" in the ACCA does.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It would, in the case of 

drunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better 

case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this 

statute.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, indeed, I think that that 

is the thrust of the court's decision --

sense as applied to this case.

 MS. KRUGER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask you this 

question? If the government were not to prevail in the 

first case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case, 

because -- because then he -- the fourth felony would 

have been improperly found if we rule against the 

government in Rodriguez?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, if the Court decided to 

reach that issue in this case, even though the issue was 

not pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and 

wasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the 

Court's analysis of the issue in that case applies 

equally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not 

the felony prong of the definition of "violent felony" 

is applicable in this case.

 So were the Court to decide that the 

applicable maximum term of imprisonment that applies to 

a recidivist is the term of imprisonment that would 

apply to a hypothetical first-time offender, then that 

decision would control in this case as well. And the 

Court should dispose of this case accordingly.

 But it bears noting that that would not 

dispose of this question entirely, because there are, of 

course, other reasons why States treat drunk driving

offenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations 

in which they result in serious bodily harm or death to 

another, as Your Honor previously noted.

 The issue in this case comes down to the 

interpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a 

hypothetical statute that Congress could have written. 

And that statute identifies one criterion for 

determining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as 

a violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its 

potential for harming other human beings.

 Drunk driving is commonly understood to 

present a serious potential risks of injury. The 

potential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a 

crime under the laws of 50 States. And the risks 

associated with drunk driving are comparable in both 

kind and degree to the risks associated with arson and 

explosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically 

identified in the statute as satisfying its definition.

 For that reason, we think that the court of 

appeals correctly determined that Mr. Begay was 

sentenced properly under the Armed Career Criminal Act 

and would urge the Court to affirm its determination.

you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. KATZE: The problem with the 

Government's interpretation is that it offers no 

limiting principle whatsoever. It's merely open to say 

absolutely any offense that would present a serious 

potential risk of injury to another would fall within 

the statute. And that clearly does not take Congress's 

intent to heart.

 And there has to be some other limiting 

principle, something more than just the words in the 

residual clause, especially when we are giving every 

word in the statute meaning. We suggest that our test 

of analyzing those four enumerated crimes which were 

intentionally put there by Congress, to look at the 

attributes of those four crimes. That they are active, 

violent property crimes more typical of crimes committed 

by career offenders, more dangerous when committed with 

a gun --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't drunk driving 

be property crime? Doesn't it cause an enormous amount 

of property damage?

there is no element that has anything to do with 

property whatsoever in DWI, which brings me to my next 

point that recidivism is not an element of DWI in New 

Mexico.

 The elements to commit DWI in the first 

offense are exactly the same as the fourth offense. 

There is no difference. And there is -- certainly, 

Congress, intended that there would be a distinction 

between violent, intentional felonies and accidental or, 

at worst, negligent crimes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Extortion doesn't 

involve property as an element.

 MS. KATZE: I believe it does. It's trying 

to get something of value from another person. That 

thing of value is property.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Something of value 

-- something of value could be, you know, a confession 

in a related case or something. It doesn't necessarily 

have to be property.

 MS. KATZE: In the ordinary case, it's 

property even if we think of it as reputation; property 

in the sense of the common law, life, liberty, and 

property; that that includes more than just physical 

property, I think. In addition, this Court has said 

that those four offenses are --

tangible, physical property. Reputation is considered 

property under that definition. Merely stating that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you said that 

you -- you look at the generality of cases. In most 

extortion cases what they want is money.

 MS. KATZE: That is correct, and money is 

property. And that is exactly what -- in addition to 

the fact that this Court said in Taylor that those four 

offenses are property offenses. And, again, in James 

this Court again referred to those four offenses as --

generality of drunk-driving offenses, those that result 

in physical injury almost always involve, or in the 

great majority of cases involve, property damage, too; 

don't they?

crime. We can --

JUSTICE ALITO: It's not an element of some 

of these other crimes, either. Is it an element in 

burglary? Is there a property element in burglary?

breaking and entering into a building, in some type or

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we know that 

attempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to 

enter the house in an attempted burglary.

 MS. KATZE: I think that's exactly the 

situation when there are analogous crimes. It's clear 

to see that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Well, you are 

saying this is an analogous crime to the four that are 

listed, or it is not an analogous crime to the four that 

are listed?

 MS. KATZE: That's correct, but this Court 

has said that the four offenses that were enumerated by 

Congress are, in fact, property crimes. This Court has 

said that in Taylor and again referred to those four 

crimes as property crimes in James.

are property crimes, the bottom line is DWI is so far 

afield of the four enumerated crimes, the attributes 

that they had, at the very least the intent to do crime, 

that it's clearly outside the scope of what Congress
