 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this morning in Case 08-322, Northwest Austin 

Municipal Utility District v. Holder.

 Mr. Coleman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 MR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 After more than 20 years of steadfast 

compliance with the Voting Rights Act, Northwest Austin 

MUD Number One is entitled to be free from the intrusive 

burdens of preclearance. The district is entitled to 

seek a bailout because it is a political subdivision 

under the Court's decisions in Sheffield and Dougherty 

County. This natural parallelism between bailout and 

preclearance allows bailout to serve its ameliorative 

purposes of encouraging, recognizing, and rewarding 

long-term compliance and progress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may be -- it may 

be a political subdivision under those decisions, but 

it's certainly not a political subdivision under the 

statutory definition.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, we disagree with that,

Your Honor. We believe that under Dougherty County in 

particular, the Court specifically recognized that these 

entities such as cities and school boards and utility 

districts are political subdivisions and that that term 

as it's used --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Bailout wasn't involved 

in those cases. And what do you do with a statute that 

has three categories -- the State, political 

subdivision, and then there's "governmental unit"? The 

district qualifies as a governmental unit. Why would 

Congress add that third category if the district came 

within "political subdivision"?

 MR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the term 

"governmental unit" doesn't actually appear in the 

provision that authorizes bailout. What it says is that 

when a political subdivision seeks a bailout that, if it 

has any governmental units within it, it must also 

ensure that they are compliant before it can have a 

bailout. For instance, although the district is not a 

political subdivision of the county, it is in the 

county, and therefore under the substantive criteria, if 

the -- Travis County wanted to bail out, it would have 

to demonstrate compliance of all of those governmental 

units within it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the -- but the

statute does use the term "governmental unit" to 

encompass districts. And if they were also 

subdivisions, why would Congress need to add an 

additional category?

 MR. COLEMAN: Again, I disagree with Your 

Honor that -- that the term "governmental unit" appears 

in the provision that defines criteria.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It appears in the statute 

twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three 

categories.

 MR. COLEMAN: Again, the statute that 

defines who's eligible to bailout says a State, a 

political subdivision that has been separately 

designated for coverage under 4(b), and a political 

subdivision that has not been separately designated for 

coverage.

 We were never separately designated for 

coverage. And under Sheffield and Dougherty County, we 

have long been considered a political subdivision. 

Indeed, we are subject to the process of preclearance 

only because we were a political subdivision. The 

actual requirement that you send in preclearance 

submissions is on political subdivisions. We are 

subject to lawsuits under section 2 because we are a 

political subdivision. We are subject to the

possibility of Federal examiners because we are a 

political subdivision.

 At no place in this Voting Rights Act, in 

any of the dozens of the uses of the term "political 

subdivision" has this Court or Congress, other than the 

designation statute, separately suggested that a 

political subdivision such as the district would not be 

considered a political subdivision under the terms of 

the Voting Rights Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to the extent we 

have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it 

would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's 

just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered 

jurisdiction within a county which is a covered 

jurisdiction. They would have competing election days, 

competing election formulae. And it would seem to me 

that that just makes compliance with the Act much more 

difficult.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, certainly we believe 

that the purposes of the Act suggest that we should be 

considered a political subdivision eligible to bail out. 

This interaction between the county and the district --

we -- we exist within the county, but we are not part of 

the county. The county, as we say, is not the boss of 

us. They don't have any way to ensure or require us to

do things. And as the facts of this case demonstrate, 

not only did the county have different political 

interests, but we've also demonstrated that because you 

have entities that are subject to separate designation, 

like the county, that have dozens and perhaps in this 

case over a hundred separate political subdivisions, 

Travis County could never practically seek a bail out.

 And in order to give effect to what I call 

this ameliorative purpose to bail out, the Court should 

interpret the statute in a way that allows these small 

entities to bail out. These small entities --

JUSTICE ALITO: And how do you account for 

the fact that if your district were located in a 

separately covered political subdivision, you clearly 

could not bail out.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, I -- I -- again, the 

Court doesn't need to reach that question yet, but I'm 

not sure that the answer is that we clearly couldn't if 

we were a separately designated or -- excuse me -- if we 

were in a separately designated county that says --

that's it's not in a covered State, right? There is 

this argument, for instance, that -- that that State 

could be covered in whole or in part. And certainly, 

for instance, in California the State is -- is covered 

in part. And it could be resolved in that way.

The statute is not exceptionally clear on 

it, but the Court doesn't have to reach that because we 

are in a fully covered State, and we are -- under all 

the provisions of Voting Rights Act, have always been 

considered political subdivisions. The district court 

said you're a political subdivision for every purpose 

except this one. You have to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- the district 

court had some assistance from the legislative 

development of this latest extension. There was a 

proposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to 

bail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear 

to bail out?

 MR. COLEMAN: I don't know that there was a 

specific legislative proposal, Justice Ginsburg. There 

was certainly some discussion of that. What -- what is 

particularly clear is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what was the reason 

that it was resisted?

 MR. COLEMAN: I don't know that the record 

actually shows that it was resisted. It was simply part 

of the discussion during the reauthorization 

proceedings. I'm not aware of any specific resistance 

relating to that. There weren't any amendments to the 

statute, but the amendments in 1982, we do believe are

very important to the Court's consideration of that 

because the bailout aspects were considered in City of 

Rome, and in City of Rome the only entities that could 

bail out were a -- were a State or a separately covered 

or a separately designated subdivision. And then 2 

years after that, Congress amends the statute to add 

this third category, which is political subdivisions 

that have not been separately designated for coverage.

 That amendment and that addition is clearly 

in direct response to City of Rome and, we believe, a 

clear indication that Congress did intend and, indeed, 

it said it intended to expand the bailout opportunities. 

Congress believed that many, if perhaps not most, 

political subdivisions in 1982 would be eligible for 

bailout, but because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Department of Justice 

has -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that 

contradicts your reading? And hasn't that been out 

there -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?

 MR. COLEMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but 

unlike the Attorney General's regulations that relate to 

preclearance, bailout is not something that the Attorney 

General actually has any specific say in. The statute 

provides for a lawsuit to seek a bailout. It's not like 

preclearance, where can you get it from either the

Attorney General or the district court.

 Now, the Attorney General may choose, as it 

has for several of the Virginia entities, not to resist 

that. So you can file a friendly suit once the Attorney 

General has been convinced, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we find that you're not 

covered by the bailout provision, that only the county 

is, do you really then have standing to proceed to 

question the workability of the bailout procedures? I 

-- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you 

to question the validity of the Act.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, with respect to our 

constitutionality issue, Justice Kennedy, one thing 

nobody is contesting here is that we are not subject to 

preclearance. And so, if we are not eligible for 

bailout, we obviously do and we believe have standing to 

assert that the reenactment of the preclearance 

provisions is unconstitutional because they, unlike the 

bailout, would clearly continue to apply to us.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, has preclearance been 

denied to you?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, we didn't seek a 

preclearance --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Exactly. I mean, I -- if 

-- if you're basing it simply on your subjection to

preclearance and there's no contest between you and the 

government over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why 

you would be in court.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, there is certainly a 

possibility we may seek to preclear things in the 

future, but this is primarily --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then isn't -- isn't that 

the time for litigating?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Souter. This is 

primarily a facial challenge to the statute. We are 

subject to the obligations of preclearance. And we 

believe that we --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not affecting 

anything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I 

understand it. There's no claim that -- that your 

district is doing anything improper. No claim is being 

made against you. And I guess your whole argument would 

be maybe some day we want to preclear again, and maybe 

we wouldn't be as successful as we had been in each of 

the instances before. But I don't see how that gets you 

in court.

 MR. COLEMAN: I agree with -- I disagree 

with that as well, Justice Souter. While it has not 

been highlighted in the briefs, there is deep in the 

record discussion during a MUD board meeting of

potentially some changes, and discussion on that was 

table pending the outcome of this lawsuit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the last time 

the district applied for preclearance, the last year?

 MR. COLEMAN: The contract in 2004 by which 

we asked the county to actually perform the elections 

itself, that was precleared, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so 2004 is the last 

year. So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not 

sought preclearance?

 MR. COLEMAN: That's correct. This lawsuit 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're subject to 

preclearance and you cannot make changes without going 

to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.

 MR. COLEMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it any different from, 

from a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech? Do 

you have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty 

for that speech before you can attack the law? I don't 

think so.

 MR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the suit -- correct me 

if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought 

this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been

denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on 

the refusal of bailout. I did not understand that you 

had brought a general declaratory judgment action or 

a -- or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the 

statute. Am I wrong about your pleadings?

 MR. COLEMAN: I do think you're wrong about 

that, Justice Souter. We had not been denied bailout. 

The suit sought bailout. The only way to seek a bailout 

is through the lawsuit --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 MR. COLEMAN: -- and this lawsuit seeks the 

bailout and the declaratory judgment that if we cannot 

bail out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You separately asked for 

declaratory judgment?

 MR. COLEMAN: Yes. There are different 

claims in the lawsuit, Your Honor. And indeed, the 

standing point is--

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't challenge -- if 

you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the 

statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of 

the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with 

the right to bail out.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, that's not exactly right 

either, Justice Ginsburg. We certainly contest and

contend that preclearance is unconstitutional. We 

acknowledge that if the Court were to give us bailout 

that the Court might choose on its own not to reach the 

constitutional issues because we would receive relief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- I thought I just 

heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension 

for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional. 

Is that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the 

modification, would suffice to make the statute 

constitutional?

 MR. COLEMAN: No. We do not say that the 

modification would make the statute constitutional. Our 

position is both that we are entitled to bailout and we 

have an alternative claim that we have asserted that is 

independent, it's not dependent on the first one, that 

preclearance is unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well Mr. Coleman, this is 

important to me. Do you -- do you acknowledge that if 

we find on your favor on the bailout point we need not 

reach the constitutional point?

 MR. COLEMAN: I do acknowledge that, Justice 

Souter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably you 

wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't 

be subject to the preclearance requirement.

MR. COLEMAN: Right. But because we had all 

the claims together in one lawsuit, we had to assert 

them all together, and that's what we've done.

 Getting to the heart of this preclearance 

issue, if I may, Katzenbach recognized that preclearance 

really was an extraordinary remedy and it recognized 

that is a remedy that would not otherwise be appropriate 

but for the extraordinary emergency circumstances that 

existed at the time. Nobody has challenged that. But 

we are in a different day. The kinds of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Coleman, may I just 

raise a basic point here. And I'll be candid with you 

that it affects my view of your argument. I just want 

to start with it. Your argument is largely based on the 

assumption that things have significantly changed and 

that therefore Congress could not by whatever test we 

use extend the -- extend section 5.

 But what we've got in the record in front of 

us -- I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean, 

we've got I think at the present time a 6-point -- a 

16-point registration difference on Hispanic and 

non-Hispanic white voters in Texas. We've got a record 

of some 600 interpositions by the -- by the Justice 

Department on section 5 proceedings, section 5 

objections, over a period of about 20 years. We got a

record that about two-thirds of them were based on the 

Justice Department's view that it was intentional 

discrimination. We've got something like 600 section 2 

lawsuits over the same period of time.

 The point that I'm getting at is I don't 

understand, with a record like that, how you can 

maintain as a basis for this suit that things have 

radically changed. They may be better. But to say that 

they have radically changed to the point that this 

becomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within 

Congress's judgment just seems to me to -- to deny the 

empirical reality. I mean, what it your answer to that?

 MR. COLEMAN: Our answer, Your Honor, is --

is a very clear one and that is there is a difference 

between a nondiscrimination statute and a 

noncircumvention statute. Section 2, section 203, the 

prohibition on the uses of tests and devices, these are 

clear nondiscrimination provisions that are textually 

linked back to the -- to the constitutional 

prohibitions. Section 5 was never intended to be a 

nondiscrimination statute. Section 5 is a 

noncircumvention statute, notwithstanding the volume --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the evidence that 

I've been getting into is a pretty good indication -- I 

would have thought Congress thought so and I would have

thought so too -- that there is something to be 

concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in 

fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to 

render circumvention irrelevant.

 MR. COLEMAN: I honestly disagree with you, 

Justice Souter, on that. Notwithstanding --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was -- but 

there was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it 

referred to second generation discrimination, which is a 

frequent pattern with discrimination. You start with 

the blatant overt discrimination, and then in time 

people recognize that that's -- that won't go any more, 

so the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to 

smoke out. But it doesn't go from blatant overt 

discrimination to everything is equal.

 MR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the Court in 

Katzenbach recognized that Congress had been trying for 

several years to try to fix this problem and it walked 

through, as this Court has walked through innumerable 

times, that section 5 is simply not about 

nondiscrimination, but it was about the unremitting and 

ingenious defiance of statutes in a way that made 

ordinary enforcement mechanisms, including litigation, 

simply ineffective, that no matter what the courts did, 

in the South the enforcement mechanisms were unable to

allow minority individuals to register and get out and

stop to that.

 But notwithstanding this record, which I'd 

like to speak to the volume of separately --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'll ask you that 

question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.

 MR. COLEMAN: Notwithstanding that record, 

it is not the kind of record -- Congress put together 

what it believed was a discrimination record, but not a 

circumvention record. There is no indication, for 

instance, in these types of examples that have been 

offered in the briefs and were offered in the 

congressional hearings that these aren't things that can 

be fixed through ordinary enforcement mechanisms through 

section 2 litigation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you take the 

multiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the 

election day so that it will coincide with the -- with 

the holiday of a predominantly minority college. To go 

after every change of that order with a section 2 

lawsuit -- of the two devices, surely section 5 is more 

effective to smoke that out.

 MR. COLEMAN: Two points on that, Justice 

Ginsburg. First, with respect to the Waller County

issue, that was an issue that was very swiftly addressed 

by Texas officials itself in cooperation with the NAACP. 

The Texas secretary of state and the Texas attorney 

general came down very swiftly on that issue. The 

second point is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps they -- perhaps 

they wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were 

section 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit.

 MR. COLEMAN: And that gets at the heart of 

one of our arguments, Justice Ginsburg. That is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you this question 

for a second, please? And just take 2 minutes to answer 

it or not. You don't have to answer it, but it seems to 

me this is the question. This whole issue depends on 

the evidence before Congress. So, in reading the 

briefs, I have six categories of evidence. Compared to 

the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two 

States, Virginia and Texas, with significant 

disparities.

 As to minority officeholders, there is a big 

improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana, 

and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still 

not great.

 The DOJ objections: The number of DOJ 

objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists.

In terms of election observers, which were 

not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics 

that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of 

the six States that are covered. In terms of 

polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have 

testimony that the polarization is significant and 

common in certain places.

 And as to successful section 2, section 5 

suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but 

since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5 

suits and 653 successful section 2 suits. All right.

 I just summarized that because I'd like to 

hear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you 

want to take. I'm trying to lead you to what I think is 

the heart of the case. It seems evidentiary. That is 

what I read. What is your response?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, I'm obviously not going 

to have time to respond to all of that, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Whatever you want.

 MR. COLEMAN: But, for instance, with 

respect to the first point that you raised, which is 

voter registration and turnout issues, those numbers 

don't tell the whole story. In fact -- in fact, with 

respect to both black and Hispanic voters, the record in 

covered jurisdictions is above the national average.

Massachusetts, for instance, you might be learned to 

know, has a white-black voter registration and turnout 

differential that is in the high 20s, far in excess of 

any covered jurisdiction. And that's part of what 

Congress didn't do.

 So in addition to the argument we have that the 

record Congress produced is really a nondiscrimination 

record and not a circumvention record, we also have the 

argument that we've made that it is simply irrational 

for Congress to go back and say the Voting Rights Act of 

1965 was intended to make sure that minority voters 

could register and vote and that's going to be our 

number one priority.

 As Justice Ginsburg recognized, Congress 

believes that that has been satisfied. But now we are 

going to go back and in determining who's going to be 

covered under the 2006 amendment, we are going to use 

the same data from the 1964 election.

 It would have been as if Congress in 1965 

said: We anticipate that there are problems here; and, 

in order to define coverage, we are going to look at the 

Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932 and registration and 

turnout then, because we think that is the best way to 

evaluate --

Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current 

statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth. 

You might want to address those. And in that context, 

was there any control data to compare preclearance rates 

or preclearance events in colored -- in covered 

jurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?

 MR. COLEMAN: That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that -- that's part of 

the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to 

make, that these States that are now covered and that 

were covered are markedly different from the noncovered 

jurisdictions. Was there anything in the record before 

the Congress or the district court to address that 

point?

 MR. COLEMAN: The only comparative data that 

existed was of two kinds. There was a -- there was a --

some data that grouped all covered jurisdictions into 

one lump and all noncovered jurisdictions into another 

lump and counted up section 2 lawsuits. And the 

difference was about 17 successful -- 17 more successful 

section 2 suits in covered jurisdictions than in 

noncovered jurisdictions. That's not a big difference.

 What Congress didn't do, though, is look at 

specific noncovered jurisdictions, for instance, the 

ones I've cited, and say, how do these compare to

covered jurisdictions?

 And the other thing it didn't do is say: 

Among covered jurisdictions and noncovered 

jurisdictions, let's look among -- let's separate out 

among these jurisdictions and see where the problem 

locations are and what areas we think might, if -- if 

preclearance is going to be constitutional, might be 

subject. There is absolutely no evidence in the record 

of that. Preclearance once again is based on the 

results -- well, whether there was a test or device in 

the 1960s and the results of the 1964, 1968, and 1972 

presidential elections.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of coverage 

formula would be adequate? You are attacking Congress' 

preservation of the same coverage formula. But what 

other coverage formula could it come up with?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, just to give one example 

-- and I'm not -- not recommending this -- but if, for 

instance, the same coverage formula had been applied to 

the 2000 and 2004 elections, equalizing for citizen 

voting age population, the only covered State would have 

been Hawaii. Under that formula, using modern data, 

modern information, none of these States would have been 

covered if you account for noncitizen voting age 

population.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was -- and maybe 

the government will refer to it -- I thought, quite a 

bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this 

record.

 MR. COLEMAN: I wouldn't say quite a bit, 

Your Honor. What it did is it lumped all covered 

jurisdictions together and all noncovered jurisdictions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you said all that 

there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think 

there was quite a bit more than that.

 MR. COLEMAN: I -- I actually dispute that. 

There is a lot of discussion of that information, Your 

Honor, but it's not that much information. And, again 

it doesn't -- it doesn't take into account any attempt 

to say: How does the panhandle of Texas do against 

Florida, against parts of northeast Georgia or northwest 

Alabama? How are these -- it makes no attempt 

whatsoever. It is simply all covered jurisdictions as a 

lump and all noncovered jurisdictions as a lump, and 

Congress had no basis to make that -- that declaration.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your -- in your answer 

you said if they used the 2004 the only State would be 

Hawaii. But I asked you what formula would pass if 

Congress wants to get at -- wants to protect the gains 

that have been made but are still fragile against

backsliding? If that's its objective, what can it

 MR. COLEMAN: It needed to make an 

evaluation of where there is an actual risk of 

backsliding and where there is actual evidence of 

circumvention. We don't believe that. We don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the evidence 

that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to? I 

mean those -- that is simply evidence of racial attitude 

and it seems to me in the real world that can be taken 

as evidence that if the -- if the section 5 safeguard is 

taken away, the pushback is going to start.

 MR. COLEMAN: That evidence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It has never stopped.

 MR. COLEMAN: That evidence justifies strict 

enforcement of nondiscrimination statutes, but it does 

not justify a presumption that State and local officials 

in these areas are so racist that they cannot be relied 

on to pass and enforce fair voting laws.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They couldn't -- they 

couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases 

in which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ 

objection.

statistics from about 20 years prior to the 

reauthorization.

thousands of jurisdictions. But the objection rate is

of the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with 

Congress's action in 2006. Congress's reauthorization 

in 2006 was the paradigmatic attempt of what to do in 

Congress. It didn't redefine a rate, nor did it cast 

aspersions at Supreme Court doctrine. Rather, it took 

that doctrine seriously, both this Court's teachings 

with respect to the Voting Rights Act specifically, as 

well as the -- as the scope of the Congress's 

Reconstruction enforcement powers, and arrived at a 

considered judgment.

 After 16,000 pages of testimony, 21 

different hearings over 10 months, Congress looked at 

the evidence and determined that their work was not 

done.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the -- the 

-- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that 

action under section 5 has to be congruent and 

proportional to what it's trying to remedy. Here, as I 

understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the 

submissions are not precleared. That, to me, suggests 

that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need 

to, to address the intentional discrimination under the 

Fifteenth Amendment.

 MR. KATYAL: I -- I disagree with that, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I think what that represents is that

section 5 is actually working very well; that it 

provides a deterrent. This was a debate in Congress. 

Indeed, Mr. Coleman himself testified before Congress 

and said the low objection rate is evidence that it 

isn't congruent to proportional.

 The Congress disagreed with that. What it 

found instead was that section 5 was deterring the 

problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's like 

the old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle. You 

know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants. 

You know, well, that's silly. Well, there are no 

elephants, so it must work.

 I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these 

being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too 

broadly.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, let me suggest another 

example. Yesterday the Administrative Office for the 

United States Courts said there were approximately 

17,500 requests for Title 3 wiretaps in the past 10 

years. Four of them had been rejected. That's a .023 

percent rejection rate.

 But I don't think one could use those 

numbers and say, oh, that means that Title 3 doesn't 

deter or prevent abusive wiretaps. What it suggests

instead, if Congress would have found -- I agree that if 

we were just standing up with no record whatsoever, 

that's one thing, but if Congress heard testimony, they 

found example after example of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, the parallel -- the 

parallel isn't there. I mean, there are laws against 

intentional discrimination. So there should be laws 

against wiretapping. There should also be laws against 

intentional discrimination. But where the -- the 

argument here is not that those laws be eliminated. 

It's just that the preclearance requirements be 

eliminated.

 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And Congress found 

with respect to those intentional -- laws that prevent 

intentional vote discrimination, which is section 2, 

which you hear Mr. Coleman relying on today, that that 

is ineffective for the same reasons that this Court has 

found them repeatedly in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 

in City of Rome.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A long time ago. How much 

of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically 

circumvention evidence?

 MR. KATYAL: Quite a bit of evidence about 

the ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy. So -- and

statement filed before the district court which excerpts 

the congressional record. In the pages 270 to 279 you 

see a long series of -- a long analysis by Congress 

about how section 2 is ineffective, that it costs too 

much to bring the litigation, that there are few 

attorneys that will handle it, that -- that there isn't 

enough money and that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if section 2 is 

ineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5 

to the entire country? Could Congress have reauthorized 

section 5 without identifying significant differences 

between the few jurisdictions that are covered and the 

rest of the country?

 MR. KATYAL: I don't believe so. I think 

Congress had to make some showing. And here there are 

explicit legislative findings that say that section 5 is 

needed in these areas --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not comparative, however. 

Not comparative with the rest of the country except 

in -- in --

MR. KATYAL: Well, I disagree with that for 

several reasons. First of all, and most I think what 

this utility district can argue about is Texas, and 

Congress found very specific evidence about 

discrimination in the State of Texas. They found that

they led the country in the number of objections. They 

found that the -- that the registration rates, as 

Justice Souter said, between Hispanics and whites was 

great.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it's 18 percent. If 

these statistics are correct, the difference between 

Latino registration and white registration in Texas was 

18.6 percent, which is not good, but it's substantially 

lower than the rate in California, which is not covered, 

37 percent; Colorado, 28 percent; New Mexico, 24 

percent; the nationwide average, 30 percent.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, again, I think that what 

Congress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with 

its historical amount of discrimination together 

justified -- justified the reauthorization of section 5.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let me focus 

on that historical aspect. Obviously no one doubts the 

history here and that the history was different. But at 

what point does that history seek -- stop justifying 

action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with 

respect to others that show greater disparities?

 MR. KATYAL: Again, I think what this Court 

has -- has answered that question in Katzenbach by 

saying it may be the case that there are other 

jurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with

the problem one step at a time. And the -- and Congress 

has said that the Court should be particularly worried 

about trying to predict the future and say that 

discrimination is now over. We have fairly good --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so your answer 

is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment 

forever because of the history in the south?

 MR. KATYAL: Absolutely not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When can they --

when can they -- when do they have to stop?

 MR. KATYAL: Well, Congress here said 25 

years was -- 25 years was the appropriate 

reauthorization period.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they said five 

years originally and then another 20 years. I mean, at 

some point it begins to look like the idea is that this 

is going to go on forever.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, again, if Congress can't 

make the findings, then I think this Court would be well 

within its powers to -- to strike it down. But here the 

Court is being asked to do something that has never been 

done before, which is to use its Fifteenth -- to say 

that Congress exceeded the balance of its Fifteenth 

Amendment powers and its Fourteenth Amendment powers in 

an area involving race and voting. That has never

Justice budget for preclearance processes each year, do

30 attorneys who work in the voting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thirty attorneys. Do you 

quarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the 

Senate Judiciary Committee that it costs the States and 

the municipalities a billion dollars over 10 years to 

comply?

 MR. KATYAL: Again, I don't quarrel with 

that, but Congress certainly --

that is relevant?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But yet -- yet the 

Congress has made a finding that the sovereignty of 

Georgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio. The 

sovereignty of Alabama, is less than the sovereign 

dignity of Michigan. And the governments in one are to 

be trusted less than the governments than the other. 

And does the United States take that position today?

 MR. KATYAL: I wouldn't put it at all in 

those terms. I would say what Congress found is that 

there is a historical amount of discrimination coupled 

with recent evidence and comparative data between 

covered and noncovered jurisdictions that justifies 

continuation of a remedy that States now overwhelmingly 

appreciate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then my point 

stands. You say that there is a basis for treating 

States quite differently as to the -- this fundamental 

right that we all agree on with respect to voting. And 

what's happened in part is that because of section 5 

preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is 

protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered 

jurisdictions.

States is saying that our States must be treated 

differently. And you have a very substantial burden if 

you're going to make that case.

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, their burden 

is the same as it has always been in South Carolina 

versus Katzenbach and City of Rome. The burden is on 

Congress to say is continuation of this landmark 

achievement, one of the most transformative acts in 

American history, still justified, because with this act 

what Congress -- what Congress did was essentially 

redeem itself in the eyes of the world.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No one -- no one questions 

the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the 

Voting Rights Act. The question is whether or not it 

should be continued with this differentiation between 

the States. And that is for Congress to show.

 MR. KATYAL: And Congress did show precisely 

that. They showed, for example, Justice Kennedy, 

that -- that the differential between covered and 

noncovered States with respect to section 2 lawsuits was 

57 percent of successful section 2 lawsuits were filed 

in covered jurisdictions, even though they are 25 

percent of the population --

your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and 

non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions 

that are covered?

 MR. KATYAL: Because that -- because, again, 

that is only one aspect of the overall problem, the 

amount of registration rates or something like that. 

What Congress has historically done ever since the 

inception of the Voting Rights Act is target those 

States where discrimination is so rooted that it is hard 

to get rid of without preclearance.

 Preclearance will transform the landscape 

and enfranchise millions of Americans. And Congress 

heard evidence and said, after 16,000 pages of 

testimony, that the extension in these specific areas 

was necessary in order to root out and prevent 

discriminatory changes.

there is some oddities in this coverage formula? 

Isn't -- is it not the case that in New York City the 

Bronx is covered and Brooklyn and Queens are not?

 MR. KATYAL: There -- there -- there are 

certainly some oddities, as there always have been, from 

Katzenbach and from City of Rome. And what this Court 

has said is that Congress can act on the state-by-state 

level and -- and that there is a remedy for the problem,

which is the bailout provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, let's talk about the 

bailout provision. That -- that was inserted in 1982.

 MR. KATYAL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How many years is that? 

Over a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts 

that have gone through? All of them in the State of 

Virginia?

 MR. KATYAL: There -- there have been 18 

under the new provision, which is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You bring this before us as 

a justification for the legislation.

 MR. KATYAL: I am saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's obviously quite 

impracticable --

MR. KATYAL: Again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for anybody to bail out.

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that precise 

argument was made to Congress in 2006 and it was 

rejected. And it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The question is whether 

it's right, not whether Congress rejected it.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. KATYAL: And I think it's not right 

because what the testimony found was that States are

able to bail out, but they don't, and this goes back to 

my point to Justice Kennedy, because today States are 

finding that preclearance actually serves their 

interests; it increases --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It fends off Section 2 

suits, I assume. I mean, that's great. You get a 

declaratory judgment, here -- you know, a benediction, 

and you skip off without having to face suits. That may 

be one reason. Another reason may be that they like the 

packing of minorities and the other -- the other 

districting tricks that can be -- that can be pulled 

because - because of the requirements of the Voting 

Rights Act.

 MR. KATYAL: Well, I don't think that's a 

quite fair characterization. After all, here, Congress 

in 2006 -- all Senators voted for this bill, and indeed 

90 of the 110 Representatives from covered jurisdictions 

voted for it, so if the Court is concerned about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they get elected 

under this system. Why should that they take it away?

 MR. KATYAL: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I say, everybody who voted 

for this -- this system was elected under this system. 

Should it be surprising that they think it it's a good 

thing?

MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that we shouldn't 

-- this Court should be loathe to second-guess the 

motivations of Congress under --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have -- we have before 

us the representations of the county in which the 

district is located, and of several of the covered 

jurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they 

think that the benefits, many of which have nothing to 

do with districting, outweigh whatever burden 

preclearance puts on them. It's first, bringing 

minority groups into the discussion of what the change 

will be in the first place, and then warding off the 

kind of examples that appear in the -- in the Louis -- I 

think we -- we can't impugn their integrity by saying 

that that host of reasons, having nothing to do with 

redistricting, is why they are not asking for bailout.

 MR. KATYAL: That's precisely right, Justice 

Ginsburg, and what the covered jurisdictions also say is 

something about how this -- the test before this Court 

shouldn't be the narrowest time slice of today, but 

rather the test should be to think about historically 

what has happened.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We are not insisting that 

they -- the other side is not insisting that they be 

kicked out. If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine.

In fact, you should let other States and other 

jurisdiction opt in if they want to.

 MR. KAYTAL: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you want to make this a 

voluntary system that's something entirely different, 

but the question is assuming a State or -- or a covered 

jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the 

right to coerce them to be in? That's all we are 

talking about.

 MR. KAYTAL: Yes, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If they want to stay in, 

that's fine.

 MR. KATYAL: And this Court has recognized 

and the brief of the covered jurisdictions recognizes 

the fact that it's a separate sovereign requiring in 

this provides an additional deterrent element and 

increases the integrity of the elections.

 If I could return to the point I was saying 

a moment ago, what these covered jurisdictions are 

saying is that this moment in time isn't the right test. 

Rather you should look at the overall historical 

record --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the overall 

historical record, Katzenbach said there had been 

unremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was

certainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act. 

Democracy was a shambles in those -- that's not true 

anymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield 

their sovereign authority and their sovereign 

responsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work.

 We've said in Clinton s New York that 

Congress can't surrender its powers to the President, 

and the same is true with reference to the States. 

Wouldn't you agree?

 MR. KATYAL: That is correct. And here this 

Court has repeatedly said this isn't any sort of 

surrendering of power. It was justified because of the 

record of discrimination. South Carolina v Katzenbach, 

Justice Kennedy, I don't quite think said that defiance 

was the precondition; rather it found that the onerous 

amount of case-by-case litigation itself wasn't enough. 

And I would caution this Court because this Court has 

had examples before in which the historical record 

looked good at a narrow moment in time. If we think 

back 100 years to Reconstruction, 95 percent of 

African-Americans in franchise, 600 black members in the 

State legislatures, 8 black members of Congress, 8 black 

justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court. Things 

looked good, and that led this Court in the civil rights 

cases over Justice Harlan's lone dissent to say the era

of special protection was over.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this 

question about -- about bailout? I mean we have --

there's a very odd aspect to this case. We have an 

immense constitutional question and then on the other 

hand you have this little utility district, which -- and 

you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I got from 

the briefs, they have never done anything wrong, and 

they would like to bail out and the Voting Rights Act 

was intended to permit jurisdictions that were not 

committing transgressions to bail out. Now if the 

statute doesn't allow them to do it, the statute doesn't 

allow them to do it, but is there any good reason why a 

district like that should not be permitted to bail out?

 MR. COLEMAN: Again, this Court has 

repeatedly said that this Congress, of the United 

States, can legislate on the State-by-State level. 

After all, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment speaks of 

"any State." So I think the relevant test is the amount 

of discrimination in Texas, and there the evidence is 

not just registration rates; it's the fact that they 

lead the country in objections under section 5, that the 

greatest deterrent effect of the more information 

process is in the State of Texas.

is no discrimination going on, no evasion going on in 

this little utility district, is there any good reason 

why they shouldn't be able to bail out?

 MR. KATYAL: Yes, absolutely, because that's 

what City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court 

said in rejecting precisely that argument over Justice 

Powell's dissent, was that it's not that discrimination 

can't be to be at the individual unit-by-unit level. It 

rather, if Congress so chooses, can do it on a more 

broad level.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That was 1980?

 MR. KATYAL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The bailout provision was 

adopted in 1982, 27 years ago. There have been 15 

bailouts since then. Is that what you think Congress 

contemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in 

1982?

 MR. KATYAL: First of all there was a 

bailout provision at issue in 1980. It was amended in 

1982. And yes, I think Congress contemplated a process 

-- the legislative record on this is very clear.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Less than one a year?

contemplated was to make it easier for political

divisions to bail out, and what Congress --- what 

Congress anticipated, certainly more than one a year, 

that didn't materialize. And again, I think, Justice 

Scalia, the reason why it didn't materialize is because 

States generally -- general appreciate Section 5's 

preclearance process as well as its -- covered 

jurisdictions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I thought 

-- I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the 

problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be 

widespread and persisting. Do you think the record that 

is before us today shows widespread and persisting 

discrimination in voting?

 MR. KATYAL: I do. I think that Congress, 

Congress' reports, it's 16,000-page track record --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In covered States as 

opposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the 

Chief Justice's question, please.

 MR. KATYAL: I do agree that they went State 

by State and showed -- showed tremendous amounts of 

discrimination in those places. Of course I disagree 

with the notion that this utility district can point to 

any one place in the country, be it Massachusetts or 

some corner in Georgia, and say well, the evidence 

wasn't there. I think Congress has far more latitude

under its Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendment powers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just one thing on bailout. 

It's like Eurystheus keeps telling Hercules, "Oh, you 

did a good job, but now you've got another -- got 

another thing to do." That's the bailout provision. 

Anybody who has tried to fill out a government form 

realizes they make a mistake, so that the DOJ rejects 

it, that counts as a rejection. You have to have a --

what, a clean record for how many -- how many years --

before you can preclear? I mean, this is simply 

impracticable. And it seems to me a cornerstone of the 

Act and of your argument for upholding the Act, and if 

we find that it doesn't work, that it's just -- it's 

just an illusion, that gives me serious pause.

 MR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, the only 

evidence in the record is that the bailout provision 

works nothing like the way that it might be 

hypothesized. That is, every single county, every 

single political subdivision that has asked for a 

bailout has received one, and in 2006 there was an even 

amendment offered to minimize the bailout provision. 

That amendment was rejected overwhelmingly, and the 

reason it was rejected was that jurisdictions that are 

covered have now come to appreciate the power of Section 

5 to deter voting discrimination, and that's why

Congress made a judgment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What I understand it, is 

this incorrect? As I understand it for Travis County to 

get a bailout, it would -- it has within Travis County 

something like 106 political subdivisions that are 

covered, and Travis County would have to go to all of 

those 106 and demonstrate that there has been no 

violation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever 

it is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is.

 You think that's -- you think that's 

feasible?

 MR. KATYAL: For the way the statute works, 

they have to go to the 107 subunits, which is absolutely 

feasible because they are under contract with all 107 

subunits to administer their elections. They have all 

of the voting data to put together that bailout, and in 

previous --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Travis County is not the 

superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this 

district here. This district is a subdivision of the 

State, but not of Travis County.

 MR. KATYAL: Again, I think that's a 

distinction without a difference. They have all of the 

registration data and everything else necessary to make 

the bailout provision. And the only record Congress and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBO P. ADEGBILE

 ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENOR-APPELLEES

 MR. ADEGBILE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Our long experience demonstrates that racial 

discrimination in voting has been persistent and 

adaptive. Only after careful assessment of the record 

did Congress find that the case-by-case method was 

inadequate and that section 5 continued to do important 

work within the covered jurisdictions.

 There are a couple of things that I want to 

call the Court's attention to in light of the discussion 

that we've been having. First, the pernicious nature of 

voting discrimination is such that small changes in the 

rules of the game can affect many people. In addition, 

the Court has observed, as Congress has on multiple 

occasions when reauthorizing the Act, that the 

case-by-case method is slow and inadequate to the task. 

Indeed, Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boerne spoke to

this problem of the case-by-case method.

 I want to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's absolutely 

right. Section 2 cases are very expensive. They are 

very long. They are very inefficient. I think this 

section 5 preclearance device has -- has shown -- has 

been shown to be very very successful. The question is 

whether or not it can be justified when other States are 

not covered today.

 MR. ADEGBILE: As -- as the Court said in 

Katzenbach when it first was presented with this 

question of the coverage formula, Congress is permitted 

to use so much of its power as is necessary to target 

the problem as it finds it. The discrimination that was 

manifest in the covered jurisdictions was different in 

character at that time and -- but Congress did not stop 

and get frozen in time in 1965. The periodic 

reauthorizations have given Congress an opportunity to 

revisit the progress.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it your -- is 

it your position that today southerners are more likely 

to discriminate than northerners?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I wouldn't frame it in that 

way, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts. I think the 

record does reveal that discrimination in the covered

jurisdictions has a repetitive form. There are very --

there are brief talks about over six dozen examples. 

Those are illustrative and not exhaustive, but 

repetitious violations, that is, violations in covered 

jurisdictions after a section 2 case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer is 

yes?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think that it's fair to say 

that the pattern has been more repetitious violations in 

the covered jurisdictions and -- and more one off 

discrimination in other places.

 That is not to say that there isn't voting 

discrimination in other States. The record shows that 

there is discrimination in other States. But the -- but 

Congress found that the nature of the way the 

discrimination is practiced, viewed through the lens of 

history, is that repetitive violations happen. For 

example, after this Court decided the LULAC case, a case 

that was litigated over a number of months and very 

expensive and complicated, the State then tried to 

shorten the period for early voting. And the plaintiffs 

in that case needed to file a section 5 enforcement 

action, post-2000 redistricting, to give effect to this 

Court's judgment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- but I guess

that point depends upon the assumption that shortening 

the time period for early voting is discriminatory as 

opposed to good policy.

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think in the context of 

that circumstance, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, the 

issue was that you had a long-standing incumbent and 

that the early voting -- the timing of the early voting 

period was such that it was going to conflict with a --

a holiday of -- of a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that was largely 

to protect the incumbent.

 MR. ADEGBILE: To protect the incumbent, but 

to disadvantage the community that was prepared to 

exercise its voice, as this Court found in the LULAC 

opinion. That is to say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, incumbent --

MR. ADEGBILE: -- the incumbent was not the 

candidate of choice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Incumbent protection 

takes place in the North as well as the South.

 MR. ADEGBILE: By all means, but the -- but 

the incumbent protection in this instance was designed 

to cut off the minority community, the Latino voters who 

had been disadvantaged by virtue of that plan. But 

certainly that is not the only example.

read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was. What 

was the vote on this 2006 extension -- 98 to nothing in 

the Senate, and what was it in the House? Was --

MR. ADEGBILE: It was -- it was 33 to 390, I 

believe.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 33 to 390. You know, the 

-- the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to 

have a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced 

unanimously, it was invalid, because there must be 

something wrong there. Do you ever expect -- do you 

ever seriously expect Congress to vote against a 

reextension of the Voting Rights Act? Do you really 

think that any incumbent would -- would vote to do that?

Fifty years from now? When?

members of Congress did of course vote against the Act.

House and nobody in the Senate.

 MR. ADEGBILE: Thirty-three members of the 

House, indeed. But I think the -- the reason that they 

voted for it is what's more important. Congress did not 

assume that section 5 was necessary. It took a very

careful examination to see how it was operating, and the 

determination was that in the absence of section 5, 

because of the repetitive violations, because of 620 

objections -- there was evidence that approximately 60 

percent of those show some evidence of intentional 

discrimination.

 If you take away the prophylaxis, the 

discrimination will return in a way that we don't need 

to revisit. The history has been that voting 

discrimination manifests itself through repetitive 

efforts and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is, do 

you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by 

people who are in wheelchairs? There has to come a 

point where it will end, and perhaps Congress was just 

picking up on what this court said a few years before in 

the University of Michigan law school case, this court 

came up with a 25-year figure so maybe Congress thought 

this court thinks 25 years is about right, must be about 

right.

 MR. ADEGBILE: Congress had a more specific 

reason as I understand the record. There was a specific 

amendment proposed to shorten the time to 10 years.

Sensenbrenner rose to it explain part of the experience

most of the infractions not all but most when many 

voting changes are necessary through reapportionment. 

Not all of them involved reapportionment but many of 

them are necessitated and the judgment was that it was 

going to capture two censuses and they also looked back 

to see how much discrimination they found from 1962 to 

reauthorization.

 And indeed Congress has been a little bit 

surprised they have not been able to dislodge more of 

the discrimination. They acknowledged the progress. 

Progress didn't happen by itself and the experience had 

been that it was helping us to move forward and that is 

reflected I think in the State's brief to come to 

Justice Kennedy's point. I think there is an intrusion. 

This Court's decisions have recognized that Section 5 

does intrude but even in Bernie as the court 

distinguished Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act from 

the, many of the statutes that were there at issue in 

this case, RFRA, certainly other cases followed, the 

court kept returning to section 5 because the problem 

had been demonstrated by Congress. The gravity of the 

harm was so severe that Congress needed a special 

mechanism to dislodge it because if we don't have the 

vote as this court's decisions have recognized, our 

whole system is undermined.

JUSTICE BREYER: So what is the reason in 

your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence 

or two, you would say that the reason that Congress 

didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add 

to this or go into these States district by district and 

decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that 

Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply 

renewed it?

 MR. ADEGBILE: Is that it wanted to stay the 

course of ridding the covered jurisdictions from 

discrimination. Katzenbach spoke in items of the case. 

Subsequent have spoke about ridding the country of this 

scourge as it manifested itself in the covered 

jurisdictions and I think this was some State-by-State 

analysis and the reports of the covered jurisdictions 

that do it --

JUSTICE ALITO: Would you say from your 

experience and I'm sure you're very knowledgeable about 

this that there is no great are discrimination in voting 

in Virginia than in North Carolina or in Tennessee or in 

Arkansas or in Ohio?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I can't precisely quantify 

the quantum of discrimination in each of those stays but 

I think that Congress' judgment was there had been a 

demonstrated pattern of discrimination in the covered

jurisdictions, covering formula had --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't Virginia the first 

State in the Union to elect a black governor.

 MR. ADEGBILE: Yes, indeed it was.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it has a black chief 

justice of the supreme court currently.

 MR. ADEGBILE: Yes, Justice Scalia, I take 

the point. But I think it's not quite fair to say. As 

my predecessor at the podium made the point, that there 

have been African-Americans to rise to high office 

throughout our history, but that occasion of a single 

person sitting in a seat doesn't change the experience 

on the ground for everyday citizens.

 It is -- it has an important salutory effect 

and it tells us about the possibilities of our 

Constitution, but it doesn't mean that voters that are 

trying to vote in a school board election in Louisiana 

are going to have an easy time of it where racially 

polarized voting is as extreme as it is and when 

election officials manipulate the rules of the game to 

try and disadvantage the minority community.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the brief filed by 

the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think 

makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory 

acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor

Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in 

different -- my concern is it's just not clear to me 

that Congress addressed this for the rest of the 

country. That's my concern.

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think the close -- the best 

evidence of the comparison question to which you're 

returning is the section 2 cases that were examined in a 

report that was submitted to Congress. And as 

Appellants recognize in their brief, 600 --

notwithstanding the powerful section 5 remedy, there 

were 653 successful section 2 cases in covered 

jurisdictions, and the success rate in covered 

jurisdictions was much higher than in noncovered 

jurisdictions.

 So when you put together the objections, the 

requests for more information followed by withdrawals, 

the section 5 enforcement actions, the section 2 cases, 

it is a picture that far exceeds the record that was 

before this august body when considering enactments of 

Congress in other contexts in Hibbs and in Lane, and the 

record was of intentional discrimination, not simply 

disparities but purposeful efforts to disadvantaged 

minority groups. And I think that's the fundamental 

difference between the covered jurisdictions and the 

noncovered.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the cases 

you're talking about include both intentional and impact 

cases. And the Constitution that section 5 is designed 

to implement covers only intentional discrimination. So 

even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a 

prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance 

of course sweeps even more broadly. So we do have a 

situation, despite the evidence that was -- that you 

have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent 

of the submissions that the States make are denied 

preclearance.

 Again, it seems to me that that means that 

section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think there are two 

responses. First, the relevant assessment is not simply 

the rate. As the lower court found, the rate of 

objections even at the time of the 1975 re-authorization 

in Rome was very small. Judge Tatel spoke to this point 

in his opinion and in the oral argument. The rate has 

always been small. But what section 5 is designed to do 

is to vindicate the principles of our Constitution, and 

the gravity of the harm is such that if we have 620 

examples of discrimination and 60 percent of those are 

intentional discrimination together with some of the 

other indicia and under this Court's cases Congress is

entitled to look broadly, not simply at the decided 

case, but to look broadly and to be the factfinder of 

this important information.

 This is a pattern. It's a widespread 

pattern of intentional discrimination, and I think that 

that is something that this Court needs to focus on as 

it works through this important and serious issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

 I have another question. How long did it 

take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?

 MR. ADEGBILE: Approximately 10 months, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And how long would it have 

taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the 

record to figure out what's happening in this respect in 

every State or in these States district by district?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think that I can't put a 

precise time on it, but it would have been certainly a 

couple more years. The time that is necessary to 

compile these investigations and the expertise that's 

necessary to assemble them and cull the data takes some 

time in my personal experience.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 

that it makes no difference if discrimination in the 

noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more

persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can 

focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered 

since 1965?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I make a slightly different 

point. I don't think that it doesn't matter at all. I 

think Congress has to act reasonably, but in light of 

the record before it its judgment to stay the course in 

the covered jurisdictions because of the way voting 

discrimination has manifested itself in those 

jurisdictions, that judgment is reasonable on the record 

it had before it. It made a judgment in effect that 

section 2 has proven more adequate to the task in other 

jurisdictions that don't have the same history of 

repetitive violations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess your 

answer is that they can address the covered 

jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without 

looking at all to the rest of the country?

 MR. ADEGBILE: I think that if things were 

flipped and discrimination was much worse outside, that 

would reflect on the reasonableness of Congress' 

judgment. But that's a fact situation that was not 

present before Congress.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. ADEGBILE: Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 MR. COLEMAN: But, as Justice Alito pointed 

out, Congress didn't know, because it didn't ask, 

whether discrimination is worse in Tennessee or Arkansas 

than in Virginia and other States. Nobody knows sitting 

here today.

 I respectfully disagree that Congress 

couldn't have put together that effort. What we really 

do hear is that this, this badge that is preclearance, 

this Congressional judgment that State and local 

officials in covered jurisdictions who in my experience 

are strongly --

JUSTICE BREYER: You should have a chance to 

answer the same question. You heard my question, the 

time question. What's your estimate?

 MR. COLEMAN: Oh, I strongly disagree with 

that. AEI put in a number of reports that evaluated 

things on the ground in a variety of noncovered 

jurisdictions such as Milwaukee. I certainly think 

within the time that Congress took to look at this if 

they had been interested they could have easily 

evaluated this. It would have been easily available to

them.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they now have 25 years 

to look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the 

country. Are they doing that? Are they holding 

hearings?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, nobody is doing that. In 

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that's what 

Congress did in 1982. It said 25 years. That 25 years 

has gone by. Times have changed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this Court said --

-- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something. This 

Court thought from two thousand something 25 years was a 

reasonable period.

 MR. COLEMAN: Congress' justification simply 

does -- I think as we've heard from counsel, in light of 

our mobile society and the fact that people don't live 

in the same place people lived 40 years ago. This is a 

bad --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question 

just as sort of background. Does your case challenge at 

all the standards that Congress has used throughout the 

statute for causing States to become covered 

jurisdictions?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well the only standards that 

exist are whether they use a test or devise in the

1960s.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. Have you ever 

challenged those as a basis for making a State or county 

or election district covered?

 MR. COLEMAN: I don't think we've challenged 

the action that took place --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you have a history 

that some States are covered and some are not because of 

certain requirements that the statute imposed. And I 

didn't understand the case to involve a challenge to the 

method by which States became -- become covered.

 MR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens, we do 

challenge that. In fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then why is it relevant 

there are a lot of States out there that are not 

covered?

 MR. COLEMAN: Because this Court's 

discussions of these issues in Morris and in Garrett and 

even in Hibbs indicate that it does matter what the 

evidence shows with respect to a coverage determination, 

and Congress' decision to not update it, which we 

believe was for political reasons, simply bears no 

resemblance to reality. And looking back to see who was 

registered and who was voting in the '60s doesn't --

statute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to 

extend it to other -- other parts of the country?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, I don't think that's our 

argument. I think our argument is it's partially 

unconstitutional because it even failed to look at the 

coverage criteria and that it used the criteria 

literally off the books from the '60s and '70s without 

even looking at the information.

 Again, if Congress had done that in 1965 and 

said, we want to look at this Franklin-Hoover -- excuse 

me -- this Franklin Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932, I 

think the Court would have been pretty surprised that 

that was the best and most relevant information that 

Congress could come up with.

 This idea of -- of a badge that really runs 

with the land is -- is something that we -- we think is 

inherently unjustifiable.

 I'd also like to address the point about 

racial bloc voting. Racial bloc voting is not 

discrimination, and it's not unconstitutional. And, 

indeed, the way the Court has interpreted section 2 --

and I realize there are divisions in the Court about 

this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district will -- the 

district will never be involved in racial bloc voting

for districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's 

boundaries don't change.

 MR. COLEMAN: That's true, Justice Ginsburg. 

But in terms of this facial challenge, it is important 

for the Court to understand and to consider the fact 

that Congress really thumbed its nose at the Court in 

terms of rejecting the constitutional concerns that the 

Court raised in -- in Miller and in Bossier Parish and 

in Georgia versus Ashcroft.

 The new enactment has been changed in a way 

that -- that really requires covered jurisdictions to 

engage more and more in race-based redistricting and 

race-based -- and it's not only redistricting, Justice 

Ginsburg -- in race-based decisionmaking. And so here 

we are 40 years --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't one 

construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well, 

Congress obviously had in mind that this would be 

enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw, 

this Court's decision in Miller?

 MR. COLEMAN: We believe that the 

interpretation of the Act or -- excuse me -- the passage 

of the amendments in 2006 go far beyond what 

preclearance was in 1965. We have a more restrictive 

form of preclearance that requires State and local

the Court has noted, creates additional constitutional
