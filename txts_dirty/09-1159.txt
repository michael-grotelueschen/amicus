3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in Case 09-1159, the Board of 

Trustees of Stanford v. Roche Molecular Systems. 

6  Mr. Ayer. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. AYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

11  The Bayh-Dole Act sets forth a comprehensive 

12 disposition of rights in inventions made by nonprofit 

13 organizations and small business organizations under 

14 Federal funding agreements. That disposition 

specifically defines the rights of inventors and it puts 

16 them in the third position behind the contractor, the 

17 nonprofit contractor, and behind the government, and 

18 specifically says that the inventor may only receive 

19 rights -- that is to say, take title -- when the -- when 

the contractor has declined to take title or defaulted 

21 in some respect, and the government itself has -- has 

22 likewise declined to take title. 

23  In this case Roche's sole claim rests on an 

24 assignment from an inventor who was at that time I think 

without question a Stanford employee who was working on

1 a project under a Federal funding agreement. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if the inventor had 

3 not been an employee? If it had been an independent 

4 contractor who was working in combination with the 

university, how does this automatic vesting -­

6  MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, the act deals 

7 specifically with independent contractors, and -- the 

8 regulations at least do. And they indicate that the -­

9 that the contractor in that instance, if in fact working 

on a Federally funded project, would step into the shoes 

11 of the contractor. But I don't believe it would affect 

12 the outcome in terms of whether it would be a Bayh-Dole 

13 invention. 

14  The -- the critical fact here is that the 

inventor was working on a project that was already 

16 funded, his work at Cetus was part of that project. And 

17 then that result was -­

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That seems to be a 

19 factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that. 

According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this 

21 scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal 

22 funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the 

23 Stanford project, came about after the scientist had 

24 spent his 9 months at Cetus. At least that's the 

picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that

1 they got their assignment from the scientist at a time 

2 when there was no Federally funded project. 

3  MR. AYER: That's what they say, Your Honor, 

4 and I would submit that is plainly not correct. We deal 

with this at pages 21 and 22 of our yellow brief, and we 

6 specifically talk about the fact -- there's several 

7 critical facts here. One is that the article which was 

8 written about the work at Cetus, the JID article at page 

9 135 of the joint appendix, specifically has a footnote 

indicating that the work reported on -- that is the work 

11 at Cetus on the assay -- was funded by the two specific 

12 grants in issue. 

13  Dr. Merigan, who is the head of the lab at 

14 Stanford that Dr. Holodniy worked in, talks in his 

declaration at 98 and 99 of the joint appendix -­

16 specifically talks about how Dr. Holodniy's work was 

17 part of the AIDS research center at Stanford and part of 

18 an AIDS clinical trial at Stanford, and all of that work 

19 was federally funded.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just -- just as a 

21 hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice 

22 Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual 

23 even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much 

24 less employed by a Stanford project funded by the 

Federal Government, entered into this kind of an

1 agreement with somebody that he had been working for. 

2 How -- how would it -­

3  MR. AYER: Well, I think you have to look 

4 very carefully at the facts, and I don't want to speak 

loosely and categorically about the facts, but what -­

6 what I will say is that in a situation where -- and this 

7 is very clearly true -- in a situation where prior work 

8 is done by persons who are, to start with a clearer set 

9 of facts, not affiliated with the university, and 

they -- let's say that person conceives of an invention, 

11 and that later the university takes that conception of 

12 an invention and reduces it to practice. The conception 

13 by a person who is not a university employee, if -- if 

14 there's no university person involved in the conception, 

then it can't be an invention of the contractor, because 

16 you can't be an inventor without being part of the 

17 conception. 

18  So that's a variation on Your Honor's -- on 

19 Your Honor's question, but it's a -- it's a clear 

example where Bayh-Dole would not apply. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that change when 

22 you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was 

23 already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as 

24 an employee of Stanford when he was at this other 

company? You could still say that -- that Stanford was

1 not the inventor. 

2  MR. AYER: Well, you would -- you -- I think 

3 you are now in a zone where one of the things that has 

4 to be considered is the equitable character of any 

assignment of a future interest, that is to say a future 

6 invention. Because if in fact what was assigned was, as 

7 here, the possibility that there might at some future 

8 time be an invention, then equitable considerations come 

9 into play; and one of the equitable considerations we 

think the one that is of paramount significance, is the 

11 fact that the Congress of the United States has said in 

12 the context of Bayh-Dole that when the United States 

13 invests money in research, it wants certain things to 

14 happen that are very carefully set out in the -- in the 

Bayh-Dole Act. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me, assume 

17 no Federal act, let's just talk about two -- or parties 

18 that are not involved with the Federal Government. 

19 Inventor agrees to assign to A; then inventor -­

inventor in fact assigns to B; then A gets the patent -­

21  MR. AYER: Well, it depends what's assigned, 

22 Your Honor. If -- if B is a bona fide to purchaser 

23 under 35 U.S.C. 261, then B would prevail. If B is not 

24 a bona fide purchaser, and that can only apply under 

261, where you are dealing with an assignment in law of

1 a patent or a patent application, then I think you are 

2 in the difficult zone where there are two competing 

3 interests in the future possibility of an invention; and 

4 I don't know that I can, without knowing all the facts, 

even intelligently try to tell you what would end up 

6 happening. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case, if you do 

8 not prevail on your principal argument, have you 

9 preserved the point that the assignment to Cetus was 

contrary to public policy? 

11  MR. AYER: I think we have, Your Honor. I 

12 think -- essentially I would say, frankly that that 

13 is -­

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the court of appeals 

didn't seem to discuss that. 

16  MR. AYER: Well, I think that is at the 

17 heart of -- of our -- of our core argument and of the 

18 government's argument, and it is that, as the trial 

19 court here held, and as we've said in our brief several 

times, the inventor, because he is working here at the 

21 time of the assignment on a Federally funded project as 

22 an employee of Stanford University, is essentially 

23 working on something covered by Bayh-Dole; and being 

24 covered by Bayh-Dole means that he lacks the power to 

transfer title to this future invention to someone else

1 because the statute has already spoken for it. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ayer, it seems the 

3 Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the 

4 scientist saying "I will assign," which was the language 

used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do 

6 assign," and it seems that that was critical to the -­

7 to the Federal Circuit's decision. 

8  They say -- they cite a whole bunch of 

9 cases. The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had 

said "I hereby do assign," there would be no case 

11 because Stanford would have been first in time. 

12  MR. AYER: Well, one interesting thing about 

13 that discussion is that the very first case that we know 

14 anything about, that we're aware of, making that 

distinction and relying upon the immediate effect of an 

16 assignment using the words "I hereby assign," was the 

17 FilmTec case in 1991. That was 2 years after the events 

18 in this case, so how was Stanford supposed to know that 

19 that fine distinction was going to be made?

 We think the critical -- the critical issue 

21 here is whether the inventor, while working on a 

22 federally funded project as an employee of the 

23 contractor -- and there's no doubt that his work at 

24 Cetus was part of his Stanford research. All you have 

to do is look at pages 16a to 18a of the petition

4 work on his Stanford research, which was in fact funded, 

as we show at pages 21 and 22. And the Bayh-Dole -­

6  JUSTICE ALITO: What have universities been 

7 doing for the last 30 years? Have they been proceeding 

8 on the assumption that title to inventions vested in 

9 them automatically or have they been very careful about 

getting assignments from all of their employees? 

11  MR. AYER: Universities, and -- and I think 

12 everybody engaged in research, is generally careful. 

13 They have policies in place to get assignments, and 

14 there are lots of reasons why that would be true. It 

was true before the Bayh-Dole Act. It's a -- it's a 

16 wise and prudent practice to have an understanding with 

17 your employees about who is going to own what. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do those policies ever 

19 distinguish between Federally funded projects and 

Non-Federally funded projects? 

21  MR. AYER: I don't -- I don't know about the 

22 universe of them. I -- I know that the -- that the 

23 Stanford policy in this case relevant at this time was a 

24 policy that indicated employees could retain title in 

many instances, but not where Federal law, applicable 

10

1 law, says that they can't retain title; and in that 

2 sense they do. 

3  But those policies I think are very 

4 clearly in virtually every case I know anything about 

policies that are signed by an employee pretty much the 

6 day they walk in the door, as I think was the case here 

7 with Dr. Holodniy back in 1988. And it's a general 

8 understanding of what the expectations are, and I don't 

9 want to here be heard to say at all that we think this 

is an unwise thing or that it isn't a good thing that it 

11 goes on. It's a very good thing that it goes on, 

12 because people need to understand what the situation is. 

13  The critical issue is whether, in the event 

14 that that fails to happen for some reason or that there 

is a slip-up here where a fellow going to visit 

16 somewhere on the first day there has something put under 

17 his nose called a visitor's confidentiality agreement 

18 which he happens to sign, and down in paragraph 2 it 

19 talks about assigning away everything that he ever might 

do as a consequence of this. 

21  The point is that in that situation you 

22 can't have the interest of the United States, which is 

23 the critical paramount interest in this case -- I want 

24 to make that very clear. It's the interest in the 

United States when it spends millions and billions of

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you ever have 

13 different arrangements with respect to the assignments 

14 depending upon who the researcher is? I mean, I suppose 

-- I would have supposed there are very prominent 

16 researchers that you would like to have at Stanford, and 

17 you would be willing to negotiate less than a 

18 requirement of full assignment of their inventions in

3 to break the law. And we would submit that that's 

4 what's going on here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I thought 

6 the law meant that the United States got whatever 

7 interest the contractor got, right? And if -- it 

8 doesn't say what the contractor can or can't do with 

9 respect to the employees it has.

 MR. AYER: The statute -- the statute 

11 defines a universe of covered cases which are inventions 

12 of the contractor, which we think the other side uses 

13 those words to argue that -- that inventions of the 

14 contractor are only the ones the -- the contractor 

already owns by virtue of -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus the word "retained," 

17 don't forget that, too. 

18  MR. AYER: Right. Those two provisions are 

19 essentially their argument for narrowing the universe of 

inventions that is covered. 

21  And I want to just say at the outset, the 

22 critical thing about narrowing the universe of 

23 inventions covered is that it narrows the universe of 

24 inventions in which the government's rights to, number 

one, itself receive title under several provisions of 

13

1 the act; number two, itself to enforce a whole series of 

2 requirements under 202(c)(4), (5), (6), (7) and a 

3 variety of other provisions, to itself march in and do 

4 things.

 When you define out of that category 

6 instances where inventions exist and were produced with 

7 Federal money, then you're limiting the coverage of the 

8 government's interests. But on the two provisions at 

9 issue, we think clearly they do not mean what the other 

side says they mean. The word "invention of" someone is 

11 conventionally understood, if you hear the light bulb 

12 was an invention of Thomas Edison, you don't think 

13 Thomas Edison owns the patent; you think he invented it. 

14 The same thing is true. Even though -­

JUSTICE ALITO: There are two things that 

16 cut very strongly against your argument. I mean, there 

17 are many things that cut in favor of it, but the two 

18 things that seem to me to cut pretty strongly against 

19 your argument are: First, that it has long been the 

rule that inventors have title to their patents 

21 initially, even if they make those inventions while 

22 working for somebody else. 

23  And the second is that you are relying on a 

24 provision that says that the nonprofit organization may 

elect to retain title, which means hold onto a title,

1 that the -- the organization already has. There's just 

2 no accepted definition of the word "retain" that 

3 corresponds to the meaning that you want to assign to 

4 that word. "Retain" does not mean obtain.

 MR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. Can I 

6 answer? Basically, what I would say is, on the first 

7 point: You're quite correct, obviously, that that's the 

8 general rule, that inventors receive title. However, 

9 just in this case, in this fact pattern, the array of 

so-called vesting statutes that predated the Bayh-Dole 

11 Act throughout the 30 years in between are statutes that 

12 specifically, in most instances without any discussion 

13 of an assignment, simply vested title directly in the 

14 United States. So Congress clearly had the power to do 

that, and they did it, and no one ever seriously argued 

16 that they couldn't. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: But this isn't vesting it 

18 in the United States. This is -- this is speaking of 

19 the -- the university retaining title. If -- if the 

government was going to make such a huge change from 

21 normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention 

22 until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set 

23 forth clearly? All they needed was one paragraph. 

24  MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor -­

1 on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no 

2 right to your invention as an -- as an employee. It 

3 automatically vests in the -- in the university. I 

4 would have expected that to be set forth very clearly 

if -- if they were making such an immense change in 

6 patent law. 

7  MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I would take 

8 exception to how immense it is, given the prior history 

9 in which the government simply took title to these very 

same inventions. 

11  But on the issue of the meaning of the word 

12 "retain," that's actually a word that has a lot of 

13 potential connotations. The one thing we can be sure of 

14 here without any doubt is that it doesn't mean that you 

had to have ownership before, because in section 202(d) 

16 of the act, the act specifically talks about the 

17 inventor's opportunity to itself be considered for 

18 retention of title, and everyone agrees that that phrase 

19 is one that never applies when the inventor already has 

title. So "retain" doesn't mean that. 

21  We would submit that what the word "retain" 

22 means is -­

4 And it says that if a contractor does not elect to 

retain title -- 9a of the blue brief, I'm sorry. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you. 

7  MR. AYER: -- "does not elect to retain 

8 title to a subject invention in cases subject to this 

9 section, the Federal agency may consider and, after 

consultation with the contractor, grant a request for 

11 retention of rights by the inventor." 

12  On 38 of the red brief, you will see the 

13 other side vehemently arguing that that only applies 

14 when the inventor doesn't have title to start with. So 

you can't have "retain" mean one thing in one place and 

16 place -- and one thing in the other.

1  As the Chief Justice's question suggests, 

2 although Stanford and the government's interests are 

3 aligned in this case, that won't invariably be so, and 

4 the government has perhaps different reasons for 

supporting the same position that Stanford is 

6 supporting. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, could I ask you

9  When the Federal Government contracts with 

universities or other nonprofits, does it require those

12 And if so, how? 

13  MR. STEWART: The government-wide regulation 

14 that -- which was promulgated by the Department of 

Commerce and which identifies certain things that should 

16 be in the funding agreements, it does not require an 

17 assignment of title from the university's employees. 

18  The regulation does require the university 

19 to make assurance -- give assurances that it has 

contractual obligations from its employees to cooperate 

21 in filing the documents necessary to process a completed 

22 patent application. But that would be necessary -­

1  MR. STEWART: Well, under our theory -­

2 first, under our theory it wouldn't be necessary, 

3 because the statute itself would give the university 

4 title. And second, under Respondent's theory I think 

there is a substantial doubt whether it would be 

6 permissible. That is, Respondent's vision of the 

7 Bayh-Dole Act is that Congress imposed elaborate 

8 requirements on inventions as to which the contractor 

9 has obtained title from the researcher, but that 

Congress left entirely to private ordering, was 

11 indifferent as to whether the contractor took title in 

12 the first instance. 

13  And if that view of the statute were 

14 accepted, there would at least be a substantial doubt 

whether the Commerce Department could promulgate 

16 regulations that would validly require the contractor to 

17 do something that, in Respondent's view, Congress left 

18 to private ordering. 

19  Now, I don't want to argue that point too 

vigorously, because certainly, if this Court holds that

 MR. STEWART: We would certainly like to

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the Patent Office 

7 require the assignment for purposes of showing ownership 

8 of the patent? 

9  MR. STEWART: Not -- in most cases, but not 

necessarily. There's a provision of the Patent Act, 35 

11 U.S.C. 118, which says that if an inventor refuses to 

12 execute an assignment or cannot be found after 

13 reasonable diligence, a person to whom the patent 

14 application has been assigned or to whom the inventor 

has promised to assign it, or some other person with a 

16 sufficient proprietary interest in the invention, can 

17 file its own patent application. It will identify the 

18 inventor as the inventor, and it will provide 

19 documentation that establishes its own interest in the 

invention. 

21  And this is the kind of thing that we might 

22 in some instances have to do with respect to Federal 

23 employees. That is, there's an executive order that

assignments, even in the patent law, that you -- the 

6 section that you just recited to me says a promise to 

7 assign will get you an assignment if the inventor won't 

8 give it to you. 

9  MR. STEWART: It could be a -- I mean, there 

are two different things. It could be a promise to

12 where the employee is not -- doesn't necessarily have in 

13 mind any particular invention, but he exercises a 

14 contractual commitment to assign to the -- to the 

employer at a later date.

9 whether that is right or wrong is a matter of contract 

law, our view is it was not within Stanford's power to 

11 essentially convey to the inventor or allow the inventor 

12 to retain title, and that's clear in a couple of 

13 different respects. The provision that Mr. Ayer was 

14 reading, section 202(d), says that if the contractor 

does not elect to retain title, then the inventor can 

16 make a request for retention of title, which the agency 

17 will consider after consultation with the contractor.

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, do you know, is 

this a Stanford-specific problem or is it a more general 

11 problem? In other words, are there many universities 

12 that have agreements like Stanford's that would be 

13 subject to the Federal Circuit's ruling? Or is this 

14 just an example of one university that unfortunately has 

a bad agreement? 

16  MR. STEWART: I think there are probably a 

17 lot of universities that use this language, and indeed, 

18 as one of the amicus briefs points out, it's very 

19 natural to distinguish between a present assignment and 

a promise to assign in the future with respect to an 

21 invention that now exists. It seems a little ethereal 

22 to distinguish between a present assignment of an 

23 invention that has not yet been created and an agreement 

24 to assign that in the future.

 Now, certainly universities could change

1 their contracts if that was what was necessary. I think 

2 one of the concerns that the government has, and this 

3 was hinted at by the Chief Justice's question, is that 

4 we're -- we're worried not just about what can be done 

to universities, but what universities could do to us. 

6 That is, it's standard university practice to say 

7 employees agree to assign their inventions to the 

8 university, and the two parties will divide the 

9 royalties; and if that is done, then even under 

Respondent's view it becomes a subject invention; and 

11 the university's commercialization of the invention is 

12 subject to all the requirements of Bayh-Dole. The 

13 government -­

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it the case that at

16 Federal Government for the last 30 years have been 

17 proceeding on that assumption that assignments were 

18 necessary? The grants here were -- were from NIH, isn't 

19 that right?

 MR. STEWART: Right. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: And one of the amicus briefs 

22 points out that the NIH compliance guidelines say by law

24 awardee organizations are required by the Bayh-Dole Act 

to have in place employee -- employee agreements

2 invention to the organization -­

3  MR. STEWART: -- well, the -- the NIH 

4 document is internally inconsistent, because it says at 

the beginning that title passes automatically to the 

6 university, but then, as you say, it states later on 

7 that an assignment is required, but that the contractor 

8 is required to get it. 

9  And I think some people have proceeded on 

that assumption because it never -- so long as 

11 assignments were in place and were enforceable, it never 

12 really mattered whether they were needed. 

13  But to continue my answer to Justice Kagan, 

14 I wanted to point out, under Respondent's theory, 

universities could make a conscious, calculated decision 

16 that, rather than obtain an assignment for their 

17 inventors, they would simply agree with the inventor 

18 that royalties would be split in -- in the same manner 

19 as previously, but that the inventor would retain title 

and, perhaps with the assistance of the university's 

21 technology transfer office, would negotiate with 

22 commercial entities. And the effect would be to 

23 contract around Bayh-Dole; commercialization could occur 

24 without complying with any of the prerequisites.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  The Bayh-Dole Act had the laudable objective 

8 of taking inventions off of government shelves and 

9 putting them into the market, and it succeeded; but it 

did not change the long-standing rule dating back to 

11 this Court's decisions in Hapgood and Dubilier that 

12 title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to 

13 assignment, not in the inventor's employer. We submit 

14 that, in light of this long-settled rule which Congress 

nowhere purported to change, the Act should be given its 

16 straightforward meaning. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a reason 

18 that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on 

19 we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody 

else until they have an agreement making clear that the 

21 inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with 

22 the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act? 

23  MR. FLEMING: Mr. Chief Justice, I know of 

24 no reason why the Federal Government cannot make that 

requirement. In fact, in the case of FilmTec v.

1 Hydranautics, a Federal Circuit decision, the decision

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have no 

4 problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his 

client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the 

6 government could impose that, even though there's 

7 nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though 

8 somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat 

9 inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it 

wants to promote commercialization. 

11  MR. FLEMING: As far as I know that has 

12 never been litigated, but I know of no reason why a 

13 Federal agency couldn't say to a contractor, we want to 

14 be absolutely certain that the assumption that underlay 

not only Bayh-Dole contracting, but contracting going 

16 all the way back to Attorney General Biddle's report in 

17 1947, that everyone assumed was in place, which is an 

18 assignment from an employee, whether it's a Federally 

19 funded invention or a privately funded invention -­

1 and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the 

2 line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to 

3 pursue it. 

4  They say the strongest analogy is with 

government employees, and if you look at government 

6 employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid 

7 for it, they should have the invention. And the way 

8 they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have 

9 the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, 

assignment of an exclusive license. 

11  And there are cases which are cited here 

12 that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his 

13 way around that and simply goes and before the 

14 government can get it assigns the interest to a third 

party, that that third party assignment is void as a 

16 matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the 

17 government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter 

18 of law, a legal implication from the executive order in 

19 the circumstance.

 That brings me back to where Justice 

21 Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy. The analogy is so 

22 strong. The government has paid for it. There is a 

23 statute here that really seems to assume, though not 

24 explicitly say, that the universities will have title -­

1 say that an effort to assign by the employee in 

2 contravention of what this statute takes as its basic 

3 assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of 

4 public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed 

to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, 

6 though I don't need the second part; for this case, the 

7 first part suffices. 

8  MR. FLEMING: Justice Breyer, let me begin 

9 with the assumption that I agree underlies the AAU brief 

about the situation with respect to government 

11 employees. Actually, I think the situation of 

12 government employees supports our side, because, as this 

13 Court ruled in Dubilier, just because the government 

14 pays for an invention does not mean that it 

automatically owns it. 

16  In Dubilier, there were employees of the 

17 Bureau of Standards who came up with particular 

18 inventions and they got patents on them, and the 

19 government said: We own that because these are 

government employees. And this Court ruled that's not 

21 the case. Government employees are in no different 

22 position from employees of private entities with respect 

23 to ownership of their inventions.

executive order or after?

6 as the same applies in private industry. Employees sign

24 procedures, as set out in many of the regulations. We

4 the bulk of the royalties.

 MR. FLEMING: If that were to happen, 

6 Justice Sotomayor, the remedy that Mr. Stewart kept in 

7 his pocket, which is that the agency would say to the 

8 university: You're not getting any more Federal money 

9 until we are assured that the assumption that has 

underlaid Federal contracting since 1947 and before is 

11 in place, namely, that -­

14 get away from, which is a variety of different 

arrangements across the vast array of government 

16 agencies, because they will have differing degrees of 

17 interest, differing leverage with respect to what they 

18 insist on from the different contractors. 

19  MR. FLEMING: Well, Congress, Mr. Chief 

Justice, in the Bayh-Dole Act, was considered with a

7 the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much. 

8  MR. FLEMING: Well, certainly there are 

9 different approaches, and that is the system that 

Bayh-Dole left in place, which is that the relationship 

11 between the contractor and the inventor would be 

12 governed under ordinary patent contract law principles.

23 that -- the Cetus agreement said "I hereby assign," and

was second in time, it takes precedence. Stanford just

1 said "I will assign." 

2  So if Stanford had instead used exactly the 

3 formula that Cetus used -- "I agree to assign and hereby

 MR. FLEMING: The question presented before

7 arguments we might have as to whether that earlier 

8 assignment was enforceable as against Cetus in light of 

9 representations that were made at the time Dr. Holodniy

11  But Justice Ginsburg, your question is -- is

14 future expected interests. That has been the law for 

decades. There are plenty of settled expectations based

1 of the invention would have been the assignment that 

2 Stanford got subsequently from all three coinventors and

Stanford, but rather, we need an assignment, and it got 

6 one. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: We -- we have a number of 

8 sample clauses in this record, and some say "I will 

9 assign." Some say "I hereby do assign." The notion 

that the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should 

11 turn on whether one drafter says "I agree to assign" and 

12 the other says "I hereby assign" does seem very odd. 

13  MR. FLEMING: That's a distinction, Justice 

14 Ginsburg, that goes back to the Federal Circuit decision 

in Arachnid by Judge Giles Rich, who is a notable 

16 authority on the patent act. He relied on the Curtis 

17 treatise from 1873. But if that were an issue that the 

18 Court wished to reconsider, I think -­

regular contract law? Doesn't it apply in other fields 

21 as well? I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a 

22 peculiar doctrine applicable to patent law. 

23  MR. FLEMING: No, not in particular. An

4  MR. FLEMING: That's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we're talking about 

6 nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, 

7 exist? 

8  MR. FLEMING: That comes from the FilmTec 

9 decision, which relied on Justice Storey's decision in 

Mitchell, and it's used, again, by universities like 

11 Caltech and MIT that rely on the validity of a present 

12 assignment of future expected interest. 

13  I mean, I know that the issue of the 

14 interpretation of agreements to assign was addressed in 

the cert petition in ProStar v. IP Venture, which this 

16 Court denied cert on three terms ago. But if this Court 

17 were to wish to reconsider that doctrine, I would submit 

18 it can be done in an appropriate case where there is an 

19 amicus briefing on that issue. That's not been 

considered here at all. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in the future, the

12  MR. FLEMING: I think in that situation, Mr. 

13 Chief Justice, there would be other doctrines that the

invoke, including section 261 of the Patent Act or a 

16 lawsuit for a reassignment, as is happening in Fenn v.

 Mr. Fleming: In that event the government 

6 has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about. 

7 As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by 

8 eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low 

9 if in fact it has funded all of the research.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund. 

11  MR. FLEMING: Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: It could refuse to fund 

13 without a clear assignment upfront.

can't do is relitigate Dubilier and just say that 

16 because we funded it, we own it. It doesn't make that 

17 rule even for Federal employees. An assignment is 

18 required. I mean, I think -­

1 and to say, well, we have these interests with respect 

2 to patents that the university owns, but we don't have 

3 those same interests with respect to patents that the 

4 individual researcher owns, just seems bizarre.

 MR. FLEMING: There is an explanation, 

6 Justice Kagan. Which is that the universities had shown 

7 they didn't need a vesting rule in order to get title 

8 from their inventors, just the same as private industry 

9 does not need a vesting rule to get title to 

nonfederally funded inventions. This was something that 

11 Attorney General Biddle in 1947 -­

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sorry. They -- they do. 

13 I mean, the general rule is that the inventor owns the 

14 patent.

 MR. FLEMING: Correct, Justice Sotomayor. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there -- there is 

17 proof that they can go into court, an employer can go 

18 into court and show that the inventor was hired for this 

19 specific item and the law would presume or recognize the 

employer's rights; but why would Congress leave all of 

21 that up to the nature of the contract that the

4 ordinary patent law. There was no need for a new -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the -- but the 

6 question I started with and Justice Kagan has picked up 

7 on, why would Congress create this act relying on 

8 assignments and not have a provision requiring one? 

9 Nothing in the Act, nothing in its regulations, nowhere 

is there a requirement that Federal contractors seek 

11 assignments. 

12  MR. FLEMING: Because there was no need for 

13 such a requirement. The universities and industry were 

14 able to do it without the vesting rule.

 I think in order for Stanford to prevail 

16 here, to Justice Scalia's point, the Court would have to 

17 be satisfied that -- that Congress worked a highly 

18 transformative change in the law of patent ownership and 

19 assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect 

way. It didn't do it through an express provision, like 

21 it does in section 201 of the Copyright Act, which 

22 expressly says that an employer can be treated like an 

23 author for purposes of the copyright. It didn't do it 

24 in the way that was done under the IPAs, which is it was 

left entirely up to private contract.

did it without a peep in the legislative history that

1 that happens to only to inventions in those areas that

3 invents nothing. Human beings invent things, not 

4 entities like universities.

 MR. FLEMING: That's quite so. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And on your view what that 

7 means is it applies to nothing. It only applies to 

8 those things that the contractor freely or not freely 

9 decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right 

words and so forth. 

11  That also seems a little surprising, that

3  (Laughter.) 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about 

the provision that says there shall be -- this is a 

6 provision of the law, that the universities are supposed 

7 to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the 

8 government to make this thing effective. 

9  Hmm -- effective. Effective for what? 

Effective just to apply to some of the things that 

11 universities got money to pay for? Or to a lot of them, 

12 to all of them? 

13  MR. FLEMING: Effective in terms of 

14 inventions of the contractor to which the university has 

the right to retain title. Try as Stanford may, 

16 "retain" does not mean "get." It doesn't mean to take 

17 away from somebody. An invention of the contractor for 

18 exactly the reason you say, Justice Breyer, is not an 

19 invention created by a contractor employee. Contractors 

don't invent. 

21  When Congress wanted to refer to employees 

22 in the Act, it did; in section 202(c)(7), it refers to 

23 contractor employees. In 202(e), it refers to employees 

24 of Federal agencies. If -- if Congress had wanted to

1 leaving the relationship between contractor and inventor 

2 to private contract, it had plenty of examples of how to 

3 do so. It had the NASA statutes, it had the Copyright 

4 Act, or it could have just written something clear that 

said that. 

6  It did none of those things because it 

7 didn't need to. Over $200 billion of -- of funding 

8 comes from the private sector to -- to technology and 

9 inventions like this without the benefit of a vesting 

rule. If there's any lack of clarity or lack of 

11 certainty in this world, it is worked out through the 

12 patent law, ordinary provisions, or through the common 

13 law, and that is exactly the way Congress envisioned it 

14 would be done in -- in the federally funded situation.

16  MR. FLEMING: There's no need to state a 

17 separate rule for Stanford for -- for inventions that 

18 funded out of its endowment, versus inventions that are 

19 funded out of a Federal grant.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there a big difference 

21 between the statute and the prior vesting statutes? The 

22 prior vesting statutes said if the government pays for 

23 the research, then the taxpayers ought to get the 

24 benefit of the patent. But this statute says if the 

taxpayers pay for the research, if the research is 100

1 percent funded by the taxpayers, taxpayers don't get the

statute. This is a Federal subsidy for universities and 

6 other nonprofits, isn't it?

things that the government had and more under the prior 

16 system? 

17  MR. FLEMING: Yes. That's -- well, that's 

18 certainly right. It will all depend on what the 

19 individual Federal contract has, but yes, in many ways 

the government was giving up rights in the Bayh-Dole 

21 Act, and that was deliberate, because it was felt that 

22 the -- that private entities would do a better job of 

23 commercializing inventions than the Federal government 

24 was doing, and that's not disputed, but it has nothing

1 has not taken on obligations from the government, like 

2 Cetus, that simply invited Mr. Holodniy in, in order to 

3 collaborate, but before it did so, said: We need an 

4 agreement to protect our intellectual property.

 One of the hypotheticals that underlies 

6 Mr. Ayer's presentation here is that Dr. Holodniy was 

7 some kind of rogue, faithless employee who was out on a 

8 frolic of his own and simply decided to assign away all 

9 his inventions in satisfaction of a personal debt. But 

the record is quite the contrary. He showed up because 

11 he did not know how to do the PCR technique that is at 

12 the core of this invention. The Court only needs to 

13 read pages 55 to 57 of the Joint Appendix, where he has 

14 marched through each of the steps of this invention 

that's ultimately claimed in the patents and admits that 

16 he had not done any one of them. 

17  He went to Cetus, he took the -- he had the 

18 benefit of a free flow of information from Cetus 

19 scientists, and he also got confidential, proprietary 

materials that were not available in stores, including, 

21 particularly, the RNA standard, which is used every 

22 single time one of these assays is run. It's the thing 

23 that gives you the standard curve against which you can

1 That was, you know, not available at Stanford. It was 

2 designed by Alice Lang of Cetus. It was built by 

3 Clayton Casipit in the Cetus lab. It was named after 

4 him, using his initials, CC 2, and Mr. Casipit handed it 

to Dr. Holodniy in a tube for free. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that Cetus 

7 would have let the doctor in absent the agreement 

8 between Cetus and Stanford? Wasn't that the primary 

9 reason they permitted the doctor in? It wasn't for this 

ephemeral assignment of an unknown invention. It was 

11 because the university and the company had entered into 

12 a share agreement of what would happen if they 

13 contributed to a Stanford invention. 

14  MR. FLEMING: I wouldn't quite agree with 

the end of the question, Justice Sotomayor. What 

16 happened is that Dr. Holodniy's supervisor at Stanford, 

17 Dr. Merigan, sat on Cetus's scientific advisory board. 

18 When it became clear that Dr. Holodniy could not figure 

19 out how to do a PC assay that would quantitate HIV at 

Stanford, he arranged for Dr. Holodniy to visit Cetus in 

21 order to learn how to do that. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they had a 

23 preexisting cooperative arrangement, correct? 

24  MR. FLEMING: It was a materials transfer 

agreement, that's right. So when Dr. Holodniy went

1 there, he signed a separate assignment, the one that 

2 assigned his inventions, as a result of the 

3 collaboration or as a consequence of the collaboration, 

4 to Cetus. And that was the consideration.

 To this day, Stanford has not explained what 

6 Cetus could have done to protect its intellectual 

7 property so that it could have been able to practice its 

8 invention without having to go to Stanford for a license 

9 and pay a royalty. As far as I know, the only thing 

under Stanford's theory that Cetus could have done is 

11 told Dr. Holodniy to take a hike, because they couldn't 

12 have any assurance that his employer would subsequently 

13 say, You know what? There was a thousand dollars, ten 

14 dollars, one dollar -- we don't know -- of Federal 

funding under an agreement that has never been produced, 

16 that is of indeterminate scope, and they suggest, simply 

17 by averring in a patent application, that this is all of 

18 a sudden a Bayh-Dole invention, even though it was -­

19 indisputably now, under the findings of the District 

Court, conceived before Dr. Holodniy left Cetus and 

21 subject to this agreement, and it was done at a time 

22 when Dr. Holodniy was being paid not by a 

23 Bayh-Dole-related grant, but by a National Research

16 should be a remand, but it's certainly not before this 

17 Court. But to answer the question, here's the record on 

18 this point. The salary was not paid by NIH grants. It 

19 was paid by a National Research Service Award that is 

exempted. The grants were never produced. The grant 

21 titles, on their face, do not apply to the work that was 

22 done at Stanford. One of them deals with establishing a 

23 center for AIDS research. Of course, this is work that 

24 was not done at the Stanford Center; it was done at

declaration, which Mr. Ayer referenced on JA98, says 

6 only that Dr. Holodniy's research at the lab at Stanford 

7 was covered by Bayh-Dole Act. It says nothing about the 

8 work at Cetus.

repeatedly to the Federal Circuit that the federally

1 that because the government wasn't any good at getting 

2 the stuff developed. And so they -- they defined the 

3 coverage in terms of -- to cover these two phrases, 

4 inventions of the contractor.

 There is no question, if you look at section 

6 200 on 1A of the blue brief, you will see in the middle 

7 of this initial policy and objective section a reference 

8 to what they thought they were talking about. At the

about ensuring that inventions made by nonprofit 

11 organizations and small business organizations. That's 

12 the universe they wanted to cover. The same words -­

13 "inventions made by those organizations" -- are in the 

14 heading of the regulations, and they appear elsewhere 

throughout the regulations. So they meant to cover the 

16 universe of inventions that those institutions create. 

17  We talked earlier about the word "retain." 

18 The word "retain" cannot, consistent with its usage in 

19 202(d), mean that whoever is retaining it must have 

owned it before they started, because it's a hundred 

21 percent clear, just from thinking about the statute and 

22 from reading page 38 of the red brief, that when an 

23 inventor is allowed to be considered for retention of 

24 title, he never has ownership of it. And so the word 

"retain" can't mean that.

1  What does the word "retain" mean? I would 

2 submit the word "retain" means what it often means. It 

3 means that sometimes in a situation, someone is allowed 

4 to continue holding something subject to conditions that 

may change, and perhaps in spite of realities that make 

6 you think that's surprising. For example, a parent may 

7 be allowed to retain custody after a disputed custody 

8 hearing. That's a temporary thing, perhaps. The court 

9 may allow it to change.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

11 The case is submitted. 

12  MR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. 

13  (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the 

14 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
