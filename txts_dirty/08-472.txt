 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono.

 General Kagan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Establishment Clause does not prohibit 

the sensible action Congress took in enacting Section 

8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the 

property at issue in this case.

 The district court gave Congress two basic 

options when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial 

unconstitutional. First, Congress could accede to 

permanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute, 

but also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years 

had commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had 

acquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community.

 Or, second, Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Kagan, just as a 

factual matter, is there any other national memorial 

that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol 

and no other?

GENERAL KAGAN: I don't believe that there 

is, Justice Ginsburg. There are national memorials that 

have some religious content to them. There is, for 

example, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very 

large cross, but most national memorials are -- are not 

religious. Some are.

 The -- the -- you know, I think that it 

would even be possible, for example, to make a church or 

a synagogue a national memorial.  If -- if Dr. King's 

church were selected as a national memorial because of 

-- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be 

permissible. If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I was just curious 

as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if 

there was any other memorial like that, and your answer 

is no, but there could be other religiously oriented 

memorials?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, and there is at least 

one religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which 

is a priest holding a cross.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What are the practical 

consequences of something being designated as a national 

memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Very little, Justice Alito. 

In fact, it has no consequences in terms of the

government's supervision of the land. National 

memorials can be on private land or on public land. If 

they are on private land, nothing goes along with the 

designation by way of more extensive regulation or 

supervision by the National Park Service.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the -- is the private 

property owner who has this designation free to destroy 

it after it's been designated a national memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The 

Veterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down 

this memorial once it is transferred to them, if the 

Court allows that transfer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they then 

substitute whatever other memorial they chose?

 GENERAL KAGAN: The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or would there have to be 

some government approval?

 GENERAL KAGAN: No, no, no. The 

reversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part 

of the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have 

to put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that 

veterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't 

automatically require acquire a national memorial 

status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it,

hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial 

status, the government has to approve what you put up.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's correct. If the 

VFW took down this memorial and substituted a different 

memorial, that memorial would not at that point have 

national memorial status.

 There is a little bit of a dispute as to 

whether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the 

memorial or whether it's designation as a national 

memorial would prevent them from doing that. I think 

it's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the 

Section 1369, which is what the Respondents point to, 

would not prevent the VFW from taking down this 

memorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only 

to national memorials which are on public property. If 

the transfer were to take place, of course, it would not 

be on public property, or it would not be under the 

supervision, in any way, of the Federal Government. 

So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: General Kagan, before you 

go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as --

as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of 

the land. But is it?

 What this was was simply an affirmation of 

the prior injunction. The court of appeals said the

prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the 

transfer of the land. So isn't really the issue whether 

that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed 

belong to the government, whether that prior injunction 

was valid?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, there is a question in 

this case whether the prior injunction was valid and was 

the display itself a violation of the Establishment 

Clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 GENERAL KAGAN: But the government argued 

below that that question had been mooted out because of 

the passage of the transfer legislation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But didn't the court of 

appeals say no?

 GENERAL KAGAN: The court of appeals did say 

no, but it remands the government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so what we have 

before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the 

prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public 

land.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think what you have 

before you, there were of course two stages in this 

litigation, and the first stage declared the display 

unconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the

transfer as well unconstitutional or at least a 

violation of the prior injunction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if I -- if I 

thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the 

transfer would a fortiori not --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, that is correct. We 

do think that the issue before the Court now is the 

congressional legislation which has been passed, which 

is the transfer legislation, that that has essentially 

changed the situation on the ground, so that no longer 

is the question whether the display from the -- whether 

the display by the government would be constitutional, 

but only whether the government has the ability to 

transfer this property and -- and to give up all 

supervision, all control over it.

 So that the message --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why that's the 

issue before us. Look, procedurally this is a little 

boring, but it seems pretty well established in the law. 

I read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a 

bunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to 

name them because I'm sure you looked at them, but 

Travelers Indemnity, et cetera. And it seems to me they 

make absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the 

others, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and

now the case is over, done, but for an injunction that 

stays in, all those issues that they previously raised 

or could have raised are gone; that the only question 

left is whether the government has complied with the 

injunction.

 So I read the injunction. The injunction 

says the government is enjoined from permitting the 

display of the Latin cross, period. Once this law takes 

effect and you follow it, you are violating that 

injunction. You don't need nine proceedings to see 

that. You are violating it.

 Now, if you don't like the injunction 

because you think the statute has so changed the 

circumstances there is no need for it, there is a 

remedy. You go back to the district court and you say: 

Judge, change the injunction. But you haven't done 

that. And therefore, the only question before us is 

whether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you 

carry the statute into effect, you are violating this 

injunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.

 Now, now, that -- that's a very technical 

boring issue. I don't know why we heard this issue, but 

I don't see how we could reach any other issue in this 

case.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think we

are in perfect compliance with the injunction and have 

been since the day it was issued. Now, in fact there 

were two injunctions issued. As I said, there were two 

stages of this litigation. The first stage ended in an 

injunction that said do not display the war memorial. 

In compliance with that injunction, the next day the war 

memorial was covered. So we were in compliance from 

the -- from the moment that the decision issued.

 Now then, Respondents went back to the 

district court and asked for additional relief, because 

what -- during the first court of appeals hearing, 

Congress had passed this transfer statute. And so the 

Respondents went back and said: In addition to the 

injunction that you previously gave us, we essentially 

need a new injunction and that injunction will be to 

stop the transfer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But that's not what I'm 

talking about.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Respondents 

asked to have the injunction enforced. It is typical, 

you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the 

government has recognized that that was indeed a final 

decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit 

under 1291 as a final decision. Then the question is, 

are you complying with the injunction. One side says,

the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing 

to enforce the injunction that is now final that that 

party obtained -- the winner says: Court, please 

enforce the injunction. They are not asking for a new 

injunction. They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer 

just explained, says, do not permit the cross. The 

party comes in and says: Here's my injunction; court, 

all I want you to do is enforce it.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is 

much more than an enforcement action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We are talking about the 

first. We are talking about the first injunction. The 

first injunction says that the government may not permit 

display. You've covered it up, so you are not 

permitting display. You are in compliance.

 GENERAL KAGAN: That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what the plaintiff here 

said is that when you comply with this statute, you will 

not be in compliance, because you will turn it over to 

the VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted 

it to be displayed. Now, that I can see is an issue 

before us. But I don't see any other issue before us.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, again, the 

Respondents had to go back to the district court in 

order not just to enforce the injunction, which said

don't display the statue, but to get additional relief, 

which was don't transfer the statue. If the transfer 

had taken place, it would no longer have been the 

government's property, the government would not have 

permitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't 

the government's property to permit or not to permit the 

display.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me unreasonable 

to read the injunction to say the government shall not 

permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter 

who owns the land. I assume the injunctions meant you 

will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel 

of government land.

 GENERAL KAGAN: And the Ninth Circuit 

specifically said -- when this came to the Ninth 

Circuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents. 

In order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth 

Circuit specifically said: We are not going to do that; 

that's a decision for another day, a separate decision. 

Because of that, the Respondents had to go back to the 

district court and had to get the district court 

essentially to modify the injunction and to provided 

additional relief.

 Now, there is some question as to whether 

the standing question here, just the standing question

is precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude, 

because the way the government views this is it's one 

entire litigation in which all issues are open.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, General 

Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent 

injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, 

where -- and standing was in question, raised, 

litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won 

the injunction comes to the court and says, court, 

please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we 

can go back to square one and argue again about 

standing? I don't see how you can revive what has been 

determined by a final judgment.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, either this is one 

litigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or 

it's too entirely separate litigations, in which case 

the Court has an obligation to independently consider 

the standing question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know it isn't 

that because, as I think you pointed out, the same 

docket number. This wasn't a new complaint. This was a 

motion to enforce the judgment.

 GENERAL KAGAN: It couldn't have been a 

motion to enforce the judgment because the government 

was in compliance with the judgment and because the

Ninth Circuit had said that the question that 

respondents were raising was an entirely separate issue 

for another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose -- I 

guess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the 

same action or it's entirely separate. I would suppose 

it could be some issues carry over and are the same, and 

perhaps standing is one of those. Other issues are 

completely new, such as the effect of the legislation, 

which couldn't have been before the district court since 

it hadn't been passed.

 But standing is different. I mean, once 

it's been determined that there is standing and that is 

reflected in a final judgment, then I think the later 

aspects are simply whether the person -- once it's 

embodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for 

standing and not the earlier questions of whether he 

visited it enough or planned to visit enough.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, we could 

not have taken the standing question to this Court in 

the -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at 

that point. It would have been really an irresponsible 

action on our part to ask this Court to address the 

standing issue after the first court of appeals judgment 

where -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate

the question of the validity of the transfer. We 

couldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you, 

as the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to 

adjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to 

be irrelevant.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand -- I 

don't understand that point at all. If you thought that 

he didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all 

and that the injunction itself directing you to cover up 

the cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court. 

It was a permanent injunction. You were told you have 

interlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment 

rights. At any point you could have come and said: The 

order for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off 

this land was just plain wrong.

 GENERAL KAGAN: I think, Justice Sotomayor, 

you are right that we could have, but I don't think that 

we would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking 

on this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office 

discretion, in order to ask you to decide a question 

that was as likely or not going to be completely 

irrelevant depending on what happened with respect to 

the transfer statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But interlocutory appeal 

or finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to

get away from the injunction. The issue is did you give 

up any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in 

that injunction and you haven't answered why not. You 

may have a right, and you do, to challenge a 

modification of that injunction. That's what you are 

here to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying 

the injunction and stopping the transfer. Perfectly 

legitimate point, because the injunction has been 

changed. But you can't go back and relitigate whether 

he had standing to challenge that -- the presence of 

that cross.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

appreciate the distinction that you are making between 

the standing question and the merits question and I 

think you are exactly right as to that point. But 

whatever the question as to whether we have given up the 

standing question, certainly there is no such question 

on the merits of this -- of the validity of this 

transfer. But with respect, I think that the standing 

question is -- is not the way you described it. And 

it's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court 

or we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it. We 

would have thought that it was not the right kind of 

position to ask the Court to take certiorari on a 

question that basically was very likely, we thought, was

very likely to go away.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that's 

because -- that's because you assume the act is going to 

be valid. You could have come here and said: This is 

such an important case Congress is taking action, and 

therefore, you should hear our standing argument to 

avoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to 

come in. You could have said that.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, but we didn't, because 

we did think that Congress had acted appropriately and 

that the congressional act was valid, and continue to do 

so, continue to think that this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the standing 

issue was independently important to the government, 

because the government can face this kind of question 

again, and if you right -- if you were right on the 

standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the 

government would not have had a strong incentive to say, 

we want to get rid of these cases on the standing 

ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.

 But in any case, you didn't do that, and I 

think that you started your argument this morning in the 

right place when you said, let's talk about this law. 

Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was 

right, here's a law that cures the constitutional

defect. And that's where you were -- that's where you 

started your argument. Maybe you can pick up with that. 

But --

JUSTICE BREYER: But just I want to just get 

this clear procedurally. I'm sorry. It'll take one 

more second.

 As I read this, there is no modification of 

any injunction. What the -- what the Respondent asked 

for, he said: Judge, either hold that the transfer 

violates the current injunction, or modify the 

injunction. Then what the district court did do is he 

said the proposed transfer violates the permanent 

injunction. The permanent injunction is in the, like, 

the third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says, 

you are permanently enjoined from permitting the display 

of the Latin cross. Therefore, he rejected the need to 

modify it, and held that --

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- this violates the 

injunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed 

that.

 So is there any question in this case of 

modifying? Is there any question other than the one 

that I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument 

about, whether the proposed statute violates the

July 24th injunction? That's what the case is about. 

Or why am I wrong?

 GENERAL KAGAN: You -- you are incorrect, 

Justice Breyer, because in addition to saying this 

violates the previously given injunction, the district 

court said, you are enjoined from transferring this 

property in accordance with this statute. And so there 

was additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth 

Circuit said was additional relief that it wasn't 

deciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that 

places the question, the merits question of the validity 

of this transfer, directly before the Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before we get --

before your time expires, we would like to spend a 

couple of minutes on the merits.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I wonder if you 

could focus on a particular question. What if the 

government sold simply one square foot, or whatever the 

area that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the 

ground? Would your argument be the same?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, there are 

certainly limits to the way that the government can 

transfer property, and I would give you a few of them.

If -- if it was not a bona fide sale, so that there 

wasn't proper consideration; if -- if there was only 

religious purpose, so that there was no secular purpose 

involved; or if after the sale the property was 

indistinguishable from government property, so that 

everybody naturally thought that this was government 

property. In those cases --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't that 

-- why isn't that the case here?

 GENERAL KAGAN: In fact, it's not the case 

here. And it's not the case for two reasons. First, 

the preserve is riddled with private inholdings. There 

are 1800 private landowners with -- excuse me, 1,000 

private landowners with 1800 plots of land.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But what percentage of the 

total area do they represent?

 GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What percentage of the 

total area do they represent?

 GENERAL KAGAN: It's about -- between the 

State and the private inholdings, it's about 10 percent 

of the total area. But they are dotted all over the 

place. So tomorrow, 1,000 crosses could go up and 

nobody would know whether they were on private land or 

on public land. Moreover --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you concede there 

was a violation at the time the case was decided?

 GENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you concede that the 

Establishment Clause was violated at the time this case 

was decided?

 GENERAL KAGAN: We do not, Justice Stevens. 

The government has argued -- argued below that there was 

no violation prior to the transfer statute, and that 

remains the government's position, although, as I said 

to Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been 

overtaken by events and that the only question before 

the Court is the transfer statute.

 I was going to go on to say to the Chief 

Justice that, in addition to the fact that private 

inholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is 

perfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that 

the -- the plot in question will not in fact be the 

government's, but will be the VFW's.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that an 

interference or it's singling out someone, private 

property owner, who's using his property in a particular 

way, a religious way? You are going to be putting up 

signs only for people putting up religious symbols.

 GENERAL KAGAN: I don't think that that is

correct, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that the preserve 

would put up signs for various historic or cultural or 

otherwise important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it hasn't done 

anything like that. It doesn't say for other property 

owners that have maybe something that -- you know, a 

ramshackle shack, that they want people to know this 

isn't the government's property. They don't do anything 

like that.

 It's -- under your hypothetical, it would be 

only religious property that would have these special 

warning signs.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I suspect that there 

are a great many identification signs throughout the 

preserve, although I don't know precisely what they are. 

And this would be one of those, saying essentially that 

there is this war memorial, that it was put up by the 

VFW, that it is maintained and owned by the VFW.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would see it, General 

Kagan? Who would see it? I mean, the Seventh Circuit 

case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people 

used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required 

a fence and a sign. But here, this cross is high on a 

cliff in a desolate area. And if you had a little sign, 

who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.

GENERAL KAGAN: I actually think, Justice 

Ginsburg, that it would be easy to do. I was out there 

three or four weeks ago. The superintendent drove me to 

the site. There is virtually nobody who could see this 

war memorial in any other way than by going in one of 

two directions on Cima Road. And you could put signs up 

on Cima Road that said exactly what you were going to 

see, you know, in 100 yards or a mile or whatever it 

was.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the question 

of -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but 

briefly, how is the question of whether signs are or 

aren't valid or required before us in this case? There 

are no signs there, and you are asking us to consider 

whether the statute is valid or not.

 GENERAL KAGAN: I think, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that if we were not going to put up signs, it would 

still be valid. So I should make that completely clear.

 And as I said, there are many, many private 

holdings within the preserve, people who could put up 

whatever religious symbols they wanted to. One simply 

wouldn't know whether it was on private land or on other 

land. But I will say, in addition to that, that the 

preserve's superintendent himself would like to put up a 

sign essentially telling preserve users what the war

memorial was and what its provenance was. If some --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there legislation 

that requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the 

plaque recognizing the donation and what it means?

 GENERAL KAGAN: That's correct, Justice 

Sotomayor. But I have to say that that's more of the 

kind of sign that maybe Justice Ginsburg had in mind, 

which is, it's smaller and you would have to go right up 

to the war memorial in order to see it.

 I think it would be very easy to put up 

signs just on the road to make clear that anybody who 

was in the area would know that this was land --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This would be on 

government land, that sign? It wouldn't be on the acre 

that you transferred. I'm a little confused.

 GENERAL KAGAN: The small plaque.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are talking about 

putting --

GENERAL KAGAN: The small plaque --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would go on the cross?

 GENERAL KAGAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The larger sign you're 

talking about that you are willing to do is a sign that 

you would put on government land.

to do and I think would be consistent with signage in 

the area. If I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you raise that 

alternative with the Ninth -- with the district court 

and the Ninth Circuit?

ever came up below.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. ELIASBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ELIASBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Justice Breyer, I would like to direct my 

beginning remarks to you. I believe you've correctly 

stated the procedural posture exactly right. The only 

question, point that I would make, is that I don't 

believe we did -- there was a modification of the 

injunction here. Any time a defendant passes a piece of 

legislation after an injunction is first entered, there

may be a question as to whether that new statute or 

legislation is consistent with the injunction. But it's 

not new relief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see what the judge did. 

He said: The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction 

is granted. He said: Buono's motion to amend it is 

denied. Then he did two other things, which he listed 

some people and he said they are enjoined from 

implementing the law.

 Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 

are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he 

granted, not a new injunction.

 MR. ELIASBERG: That's exactly correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the issue here 

that we were just possibly debating. The issue in the 

case is whether the district judge might lawfully 

enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which 

was to add paragraphs 3 and 4. That question you 

concede is here.

 MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that's -- that is 

here and that is really the only question that is here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your 

approach that this is looking to see if the injunction 

is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an 

act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard,

not -- not de novo?

 MR. ELIASBERG: That's correct. But for 

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever done 

that before?

 MR. ELIASBERG: I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever said 

that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a 

de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?

 MR. ELIASBERG: I am not aware of that, but 

I am also not aware of a situation where the act of 

Congress is being put forth as the response to an 

already adjudicated constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Eliasberg, I thought 

that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken 

meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the 

validity of the statute would not be before the Court in 

the first round. Judge Kozinski wrote: "We express no 

view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 

8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this 

question for another day."

 That's on page 104a of the petition.

 And then the district judge said: Yes, I 

recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of 

that statute, left it for another day. The day has

come. So it is for the first time that the Court is 

deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes 

constitutional muster.

 MR. ELIASBERG: The only thing I would 

disagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is 

that the question is whether the act of Congress 

remedies the already adjudicated constitutional 

violation and is consistent with the injunction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you get to 

the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it 

was your position that we should review this question 

solely under an abuse of discretion standard?

 MR. ELIASBERG: It is our position --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because while the 

Court did not decide the validity of the act in the 

first case, it certainly did in the second case, which 

is why we have the case before us.

 MR. ELIASBERG: That is correct. We 

believe -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice?

 First, we believe in the enforcement context 

where the question is, is this a violation of an already 

entered injunction that was part of a final judgment, 

that that is traditional equity principles that you 

review for an abuse of discretion. Nonetheless, we 

believe that we win even under a de novo standard.

So -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for 

that.

 I think, Justice Breyer, that you have it 

exactly correct, that what the government has done here 

by selecting a particular transferee who has been given 

preferential access to the land in the past to the 

exclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols, 

that the government is taking affirmative steps to 

permit, through this transfer statute, the display of 

the cross that they are enjoined from doing.

 Now, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is 

at some point if this is on private land and the 

government is not making any efforts to further this 

display, that it couldn't possibly be that the 

injunction forbids that. And that may well be correct, 

but that is not the case we have in front of it.

 The government in this transfer statute has 

made a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure 

that the cross remains up. It has selected --

JUSTICE ALITO: When this injunction was 

first entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that 

this statute was going to be enacted; isn't that 

correct?

 MR. ELIASBERG: When the district court 

entered the injunction, that is correct.

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. So isn't the sensible 

interpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting 

the government from permitting the display of the cross 

on government property, and not on private property that 

happens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?

 MR. ELIASBERG: I don't believe so, Justice 

Scalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of 

reasons. One of the bases for the entry of the 

injunction in the first instance was the way that the 

government had favored one party to come on, contrary to 

the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent 

symbol, while not allowing others.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't your argument that 

this was a violation of the Establishment Clause because 

it was on government land? Did you make the argument 

that even if this was on one of the ranches within the 

Mojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation 

of the Establishment Clause?

 MR. ELIASBERG: We did not make that 

argument because it wasn't presented to the Court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, it was a totally -- so 

the situation completely changed and the district court 

either modified the injunction -- it seems to me 

modified the injunction by interpreting it to mean 

something quite different from what anybody contemplated

it meant when it was originally entered?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think that, as is 

traditional equity principles, the district court is at 

some level the master of its injunction and that's why 

we give an abuse of discretion standard. The district 

court very clearly said: I see this as an attempt by 

the government not to abide by my injunction; they are 

favoring the same parties they favored when -- that was 

part of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course, it was 

that, but the question is whether it was a permissible 

amendment by the government of the situation. Of 

course, I will stipulate that the government was trying 

to arrange it so that the cross could remain there. But 

that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the 

injunction. I mean, that's --

MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless the injunction 

clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private 

land that the government had -- had transferred.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, but it's not the 

erection of the cross. It is the transfer of something 

where the government has a reversionary interest. It 

very much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the 

land. It selected a particular transferee who has been

favored from the beginning. They didn't say: We're 

going to neutrally sell the land in order to allow this 

constitutional violation to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I will -- I will concede 

that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in 

violation of the injunction. But that doesn't mean that 

it's invalid.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I believe it's invalid 

because I think that the affirmative steps they are 

taking here really make them -- put them in a position 

where they are permitting --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can -- what, 

what -- let's start from the beginning. Can -- would it 

be proper for the government or would the government be 

alleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on 

another ranch that cross -- a cross went up?

 MR. ELIASBERG: No, they would not.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So really 

your argument is that the reason this Court -- this 

cross on private land, if it becomes private, is 

offensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the 

government's prior history with respect to that cross, 

correct? That's -- that's your argument?

argument. But there is another part. The government

has taken the step of designating this cross one of 49 

national memorials in the whole country and the only 

national memorial commemorating American service in 

World War I, even though it's clear in the record --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you alleging that 

doing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or 

designating a religious symbol as a national memorial, 

that that violates the Establishment Clause?

 MR. ELIASBERG: We are alleging that under 

the totality of the circumstances, which includes the 

national memorial designation, the government's asserted 

purpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the 

government's favoritism of the same parties that it has 

always favored in this case to the exclusion of others, 

and the maintaining of the property interest in the land 

in the form of a reversionary interest, all of those 

things --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that apply to all 

lands in this preserve?

 MR. ELIASBERG: I'm sorry, does what apply 

to all lands?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the reversionary 

interest apply to all of lands on this preserve? Maybe 

your adversary has to answer that instead of you, but 

all of the other private property owners.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Are all of 

the private owners on this preserve required to give the 

land back to the U.S. if they put it to some different 

use?

is true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if -- if --

if the government sold this land to a private party, no 

cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement 

and at settlement the private landowner who is going to 

buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up 

on this property once I get it, can the government still 

sell it to him?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Yes, absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. ELIASBERG: If the basis for the 

government's decision to sell the -- sell the land was a 

neutral basis. And that's what we are saying here. If 

what the government has done --

situation you have here in the middle of the preserve 

and all, that's perfectly okay?

 MR. ELIASBERG: No, it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you said 

before the government sold the land if they find out the 

new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no 

problem.

 MR. ELIASBERG: The difference between those 

two scenarios, Mr. Chief Justice, is one is a remedial 

context. The government has been held to violate the 

Constitution. They have to, under Milliken v. Bradley 

and U.S. v. Virginia, take all steps necessary to erase 

that constitutional violation.

 The situation in the first hypothetical you 

gave me, there has never been an adjudicated 

constitutional violation. It's a very different 

situation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also a very 

different case if a condition of the transfer is that 

the transferee will preserve a memorial that has been 

designated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white 

cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG: I think that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it is a condition of 

the transfer.

MR. ELIASBERG: As I was stating to Justice 

Sotomayor, that is one of the factors that we believe 

separates this situation from the kind of hypotheticals 

that you're setting forth.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you disagree with 

what she told us, which is that the private property 

owner can tear down the cross at any time?

 MR. ELIASBERG: I think that there are very 

significant obstacles to their doing that. One, I don't 

-- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's 

description of the criminal statute that prohibits the 

defacement of memorials on private land, because one of 

the provisions is that we will consider it a situation 

that is covered by the statute that the land be under 

the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Well, the 

land -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve 

very clearly says that the land is being transferred 

from the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management 

to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the 

Interior, so it is therefore clearly under the 

jurisdiction of the Federal Government. So I think that 

there is -- there are possible criminal violations. 

There is also a significant question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say under the 

jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Does that -- do

you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?

 MR. ELIASBERG: That's correct. But that's 

the way the statute is written, under Federal 

jurisdiction, so I believe that those two terms --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose they 

have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land 

that they don't own.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well I think that in this 

case when the government is actually -- there's quite a 

bit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief --

where they talk about the government's power over land 

that's within a national preserve, so I do think that 

the criminal statutes may very well apply.

 It certainly would be a barrier to the VFW's 

thinking, well, no risk to us if we tear this cross 

down. In addition, the government is required, as I 

believe one of the Justices and I don't remember 

which -- the government has been required to go back and 

put up a plaque that says: This cross erected in honor 

of the foreign war dead. It would be very odd indeed, I 

believe for the VFW --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What else -- what 

else does the plaque say.

 MR. ELIASBERG: The plaque says: "This 

cross" -- in big letters -- "erected in honor of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's it? 

Nothing else?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Nothing else. I think it 

would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was 

free to take down the cross and put up, for example, a 

statues of a soldier which would honor all of the people 

who fought for America in World War I, not just 

Christians, and say: Well, we were free to do that 

because even though there's the sign that says, this 

cross is designated to honor all the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The cross doesn't honor 

non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that -- is 

that --

MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that's actually 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that?

 MR. ELIASBERG: It doesn't say that, but a 

cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it 

signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to 

redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that's why 

the Jewish war veterans --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's erected as a war 

memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the 

war dead. It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most

common symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the 

dead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have 

them erect? A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a 

Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and 

star?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I 

may go to your first point. The cross is the most 

common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I 

have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross 

on a tombstone of a Jew.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ELIASBERG: So it is the most common 

symbol to honor Christians.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you can leap 

from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that 

that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think 

that's an outrageous conclusion.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, my -- the point of 

my -- point here is to say that there is a reason the 

Jewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel 

honored by this cross. This cross can't honor us 

because it is a religious symbol of another religion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to 

your plaque question? Am I wrong? I think the 

government told us the plaque reads: "The cross erected

 MR. ELIASBERG: That is correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and I apologize. I forgot --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a big 

difference. I mean, the whole point is that the plaque 

tells you, this is not a government memorial, government 

structure. It was put up by members of the Veterans of 

Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

context of your question was would VFW feel constrained 

to keep the cross up? And my point was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The context of my 

question was what does the plaque say?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well -- I -- I apologize for 

not giving the full text, that was not my intention to 

-- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.

 MR. ELIASBERG: My only point is that in 

that scenario, because did I believe we were talking 

about, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to 

the criminal statute that I said I believe said that 

they couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down. 

But second of all, that it would be odd indeed for them 

to take it down when there is a big plaque that says

this cross erected. With all of the --

JUSTICE ALITO: When the Solicitor General 

represents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to 

modify this memorial in any way it chooses if they 

obtain title to this land, do you think that there's any 

realistic fear that they will be required to maintain 

this cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some 

way?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think that there is 

a real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases 

turn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you 

that we are not going to enforce the statute. I think 

we have to look at the words of the statute and the 

words of the reversionary interest, and I think they 

both create significant doubt as to whether the VFW 

would feel free to turn this -- to take it down, in the 

same way that in a context where you are talking about 

pre-enforcement --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought your 

argument was that although there was going to be a 

formal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the 

government was still involved with the maintenance of 

the cross on this land. And when the government says 

that that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't 

cure the practical problem.

MR. ELIASBERG: Well, that -- the -- the 

question of government -- continued government 

involvement with the land, I believe, continues, because 

of the reversionary interest and because of the 

designation as a national memorial. Whatever the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think -- I think 

General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't 

substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a 

national monument it has to have the government's 

approval. And the only one that has the government's 

approval is the cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG: That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. I don't want to speak for General Kagan but 

with respect to the question --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I thought the 

government's position was it had to be maintained as a 

national war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had 

to be maintained as a cross.

 MR. ELIASBERG: That is the government's 

position. But Justice Ginsburg, your question is would 

something else they put up be a national memorial, and 

the answer is no. Only Congress has the power to 

designate a national memorial. Congress has chosen to 

designate this particular stand-alone Latin cross as a 

government -- as a national memorial.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

government's argument that suppose the government took 

down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign 

Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal 

value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was 

ours to begin with. Now the land is ours, so we just 

put it back. If that would be consistent with the 

injunction?

 The government now has nothing to do with 

the cross. It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and 

it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally 

the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the 

government didn't put it up.

 MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that that --

obviously not the facts presented by our case, Justice 

Ginsburg, but that likely would be consistent with the 

injunction, that's correct. But it is not the scenario 

we have here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we are talking about 

something that is rather formal rather than substantial. 

If -- if all the government would have to do is say, 

Congress, you didn't get it right. You should have just 

made the land swap. And then the government would take 

down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and 

then it goes right back the next day.

MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think if there -- if 

there were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your 

Honor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming 

that in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is 

gone. That is continuing government ownership, future 

ownership in property, and one of the government's 

principal arguments is when we sell to it a private 

owner everyone presumes that the private owner is the 

speaker.

 But when the government maintains a 

substantial future property interest, they haven't sold 

the land. They've sold part of their interest in the 

land. So if you take away the reversionary interest and 

you remove the national memorial designation and then 

the VFW independently does choose to put up the cross, 

it's more than formalism. It is the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is also the 

point that I don't think you stressed, that if the 

reversionary interest was activated -- say they 

abandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back 

to the government. And if I read the -- the designation 

of the national memorial statute correctly, the 

Department of Interior would have to rebuild the old 

cross and put it up. There's an affirmative duty to 

replace the cross if there is a reversion.

MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that that is 

correct, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point 

that is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary 

interest also continues the government's ownership in 

the land, when their whole position is, if we privatize 

it, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a 

private owner, then we don't associate this cross with 

the government. We associate it with the private owner.

 But the government hasn't done that. It has 

maintained an important ownership interest in the land 

through that reversionary interest. If there are no 

further questions, I will --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 

Do you think the issues in this case would be -- stay 

the same or different, if this whole scenario occurred 

on the Mall in -- right out in front of the 

Washington -- the Lincoln Memorial?

 Would the -- the issues be any different if 

it were not an isolated memorial in the desert?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Context has always mattered 

to this Court in Establishment Clause cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And which way would it 

cut, if it is different?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, I do think that 

Washington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is,

obviously, a close tie between something that is put on 

the National Mall in the seat of government, but I do 

think that the designation of a national memorial is 

also significant.

 So, even though this may be an area that is 

not nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very 

significant that Congress has taken the step with this 

particular symbol, one of only 49 in the country, 

grouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in 

this country and tied it.

 So I don't think that the distinction, 

although it might have some bearing in the Court, in 

thinking of the context, I don't think it would change 

the result.

 Justice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to 

one question you had asked earlier about the posture, 

and I just want to reiterate. You, very clearly, said, 

when the government was saying, well, we didn't have a 

good reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why 

we didn't, I think your question recognized that the 

government had very good reasons.

 But -- but in addition, it's not really 

important, when you have a final judgment, why a party 

chooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a 

final judgment, and that's the United States v.

Munsingwear case.

 The government chose not to make that step. 

The judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no 

basis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether 

Mr. Buono had standing in the first instance.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wasn't -- isn't this 

very different from the situation in Toledo 

Steel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the 

merits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if 

not technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they 

reached it, because of the passage of the new statute.

 This wasn't -- they said it's not moot 

because this is simply the voluntary cessation of 

conduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is 

typically applied in the situation where there is a 

legitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held 

to be violating the Constitution may simply return to 

its bad old ways, once the litigation is over.

 But, here, you have the intervening 

enactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the 

Congress of the United States, and I think it would be 

quite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply 

going to repeal the statute and go back to the way 

things were, once the litigation is over.

 So you have a merits issue that's not -- if

technically moot, nearly moot. The real merits issue in 

the case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth 

Circuit. They say, take that back to the district 

court. And you say that the standing issue goes away 

because the government didn't appeal the standing issue 

at a time when the real merits issue in the case had not 

been decided.

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, two points, if I may, 

Justice Alito. First, the first reason that the Ninth 

Circuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not 

voluntary cessation. The government conceded the land 

transfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in 

the Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot.

 Two years is more than enough time to file 

the government to file the petition for certiorari and 

had a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the 

cross on government property, but more important, as a 

number of Justices had pointed out, the question of 

standing to bring an Establishment Clause case, the 

government always have an interest in saying, this case 

should never have been brought. We never should had 

have had a judgment entered against us.

 For the government to say, we didn't really 

care at that point because, two years from now, the 

transfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to

argue that there was no final judgment and no reason for 

us to appeal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think General Kagan 

recognized that there isn't an example of a final 

injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you 

can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the 

standing question that's already been determined.

 But there was something that I did want to 

ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion. He said, 

if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in 

Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross 

Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right 

here in Arlington, what happens to them?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Going back, Justice 

Ginsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a 

cross on government property, I believe that the Argonne 

Cross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is 

extremely different.

 There are, in the national cemeteries, 

the -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a 

choice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on 

their tombstones. In Arlington, there is a cross that 

is surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the 

faith of all of the different service members.

 In that context, I don't think anyone would

perceive that the government was favoring one particular 

religion because of the variety of choices and religious 

symbols expressed there. That's very different from a 

stand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not 

surrounded by any other context, other than --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has the government ever 

turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request 

to put up a war memorial on --

MR. ELIASBERG: They did. There was a 

request made for -- to put up a memorial on the site, 

and the government said no and said, our regulations 

forbid it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am talking about -- on 

this site?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, well, I'm not 

talking about this site, where there already was a 

memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I 

don't agree with you, that -- that every time the 

government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it 

has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the 

same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory 

in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect 

religious symbols in different places.

 I don't see why the government is convicted

of being discriminatory.

 MR. ELIASBERG: I think the context here is 

what has the government done with respect to national 

memorials. The only two national memorials that are 

stand-alone religious symbols are of one particular 

religious denomination, and that's Christianity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you don't --

and they -- were both of them proposed by a private 

group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, it's Congress -- I 

don't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever 

proposed that this be a national memorial. Congress 

designated it as one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it was erected by 

the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I mean, do you know of 

any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is 

an organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to 

erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?

 MR. ELIASBERG: As I said before --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I just don't see why they 

all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order 

for the government to be impartial.

have lots of different symbols, but what the government

has done here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you are 

saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a 

public forum. In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your 

brief would limit it to religious symbols. You say it 

has to be an open forum. Right?

 MR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I 

make one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to 

this Court the merits of the question of whether the 

cross was permissible on government property.

 There is a final judgment set in this 

circumstance. In this context, it is not. So that 

question is not properly before us, but context matters, 

and I do think, in other circumstances, there may be 

religious symbols. There may be a myriad of religious 

symbols and the context of the situation will matter.

 But I think if, in Arlington, for example --

with respect to Justice Ginsburg's question. If, for 

example, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian 

Cross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its 

brief, was donated by a foreign government to honor 

people -- Americans who fought for Canada and the 

British Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the 

State of Israel made a similar request to the United 

States, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in

Operation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was 

an important defense of the State of Israel, and the 

United States said, no, we are not interested, I think 

that that would create a quite significant 

constitutional violation -- or constitutional question, 

but it's not the case in front of us.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a different 

question, just based on your understanding of all these 

monuments? Are there any other federal monuments that 

contained crosses, other than those associated with the 

cemeteries?

 MR. ELIASBERG: The one national memorial 

that I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father 

Marquette, who was a significant historical figure. It 

is not a stand-alone cross. It is Father Marquette 

surrounded by a number of various objects that show his 

role as a historical figure, exploring the middle west, 

and he is holding a cross.

 But, again, I think -- I agree with General 

Kagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a 

priest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old 

North Church which had significant historical 

significance, that would create a very different issue 

than simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this 

probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but 

I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up --

you know, in the middle of nowhere?

 (Laughter. )

 MR. ELIASBERG: Because the man who 

originally put up the cross -- not this one, because it 

has been replaced a number of times, but the man who put 

up this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in 

the area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land 

Management, and I believe was a miner on the land. I 

hope that is correct historically. I believe it is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 General, you have 2 minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KAGAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 To pick up right there, this stand-alone 

cross was erected as a World War I memorial by veterans 

of World War I who had gone to the desert in California

to recuperate and to restore their lives.

 And it was that situation that the -- that 

the Congress was presented with, was when the Ninth 

Circuit ruled and said that this memorial was 

unconstitutional, Congress had a choice. And the choice 

was to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous 

amount to veterans in the community, or to completely 

dissociate the government from that memorial. And what 

Congress did was to completely dissociate the government 

from that memorial while allowing some war memorial to 

stand.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How can you say that when 

there's a reversionary interest? How can you say it's 

completely dissociated? There is a reversionary 

interest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the 

monument, it goes back to the government.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, with 

respect, the reversionary interest says that the holder, 

the VFW, has to maintain a war memorial. It does not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the particular 

memorial described by Congress was this cross.

 GENERAL KAGAN: No, the reversionary 

interest simply says: A war memorial. It does not have 

to be this war memorial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but then it doesn't

-- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's 

interest to being and preserving this memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN: To the contrary, Justice 

Stevens. When Congress wanted to say "this memorial," 

it knew to how to say it, because it said it in the 2002 

act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 GENERAL KAGAN: In the 2004 act, it said 

something very different. That was after the injunction 

had issued, so it was a completely different set of 

circumstances. Congress understood that an injunction 

against this war memorial had issued. Congress said: 

We are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's 

going to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with 

it, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial. 

A reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often 

uses to -- when it transfers land. Congress -- it's a 

completely --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think anyone 

thought there is the remotest possibility they would put 

up a different memorial?

 GENERAL KAGAN: I think it's left to the 

VFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice. So if tomorrow 

or ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW 

decides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an

inappropriate war memorial, then they can take down that 

war memorial. It's no longer the government's message.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How can they say it's an 

inappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated 

the national memorial as, quote, "the five-foot-tall 

white cross" and so forth and so on? That is what is 

the memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN: But there is no -- there is 

no prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial. We 

will just have one fewer national memorials. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you really think there 

is any possibility that would happen?

 GENERAL KAGAN: Again, I think it is 

entirely up to the VFW.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That is not my question.

 GENERAL KAGAN: I don't know, because I am 

not the VFW. It is up to the VFW as to what happens to 

this war memorial. That's also true of the plaque, that 

the plaque could -- the VFW could take down the plaque 

once the -- the VFW gains title to this property.

 So what the government has done here -- and 

Justice Stevens, I don't want to -- of course, you are 

right that Congress started out thinking they --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They not only started it 

out, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in

order to replace the very cross they had designated as a 

memorial.

 GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, you are, of 

course, right that Congress thought at the beginning, 

prior to the injunction, that this war memorial should 

not be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in 

the local community, and that it was -- that it should 

be retained. Not an unnatural thing for Congress to 

want, to preserve war memorials.

 When the injunction issued and when the 

court found that the -- when the Congress found that the 

courts had declared this display of this memorial 

unconstitutional, Congress said: How can we preserve 

this -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war 

memorial? How can we preserve a war memorial but have 

it not be our choice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
