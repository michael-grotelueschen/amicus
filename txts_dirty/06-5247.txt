 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler.

 Mr. Haltom.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. HALTOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The constitutional error that occurred in 

Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can 

result in a conviction of an innocent person. 

Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in 

Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of 

that error or evaluated the effect of that error under 

the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard.

 Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is 

entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple. In the 

California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court 

should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional 

trial error that occurred in this case. Had that court 

complied with this Court's precedent, that court would 

have first identified the constitutional error that 

occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and 

second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the

effect of that error under the Chapman test.

 The failure of that court to do so, the 

unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated 

Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings.

 It scarcely seems reasonable --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose he could have 

come here on direct.

 MR. HALTOM: He could have, Your Honor, 

however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come 

following his appeal to the State appellate court, and 

then after the denial of his petition, it would be a 

discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he 

no longer had the right to counsel.

 And the fact of the matter is if he had 

filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, 

it would have effectively been asking at that stage for 

a type of error correction.

 It scarcely seems logical that the scope of 

the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the 

constitutional violation that he suffered, that that 

should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable 

decision-making of the State appellate court in the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if we're talking 

about what -- where is the logic in the result that I 

believe you're position produces, which is that a

prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness 

grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, 

obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the 

error actually prejudiced him. Whereas if the State 

court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred 

on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred, 

whether there was any constitutional violation, then he 

would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable 

probability of harm.

 Now, you know, why would there -- what does 

he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in 

an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous 

determination that there was no violation? Why should 

there be a different standard of review between the two?

 MR. HALTOM: Justice Scalia, that's the 

point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief 

here. And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that 

there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit 

truncated, by the State appellate court. But it was not 

a Chapman analysis. And that failure of the State 

appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is 

contrary to this Court's precedent. It ignores Chapman, 

it also would be an attack on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume another 

violation, the court erroneously determines --

erroneously -- that there was no constitutional 

violation at all. Its error is not with regard to the 

harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a 

constitutional violation. Why should there be one 

standard of review for one error and a different 

standard of review for the other, regardless of whether 

the State court conducted Chapman or not?

 MR. HALTOM: I don't know that necessarily 

there has to be one standard of review for the other --

for one or the other, Your Honor. Our position in this 

case is simply following the logic of this Court's 

decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or 

any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the 

State appellate court did. You cannot divorce -- there 

is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred 

in Mr. Fry's trial. Then that error is compounded when 

a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of 

that error under the Chapman standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same 

thing when the State court has erroneously determined 

that there was no violation.

 In that case, you apply the Kotteakos 

standard. I just don't understand the rationale of 

applying a higher standard to the other error.

 MR. HALTOM: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the State court 

didn't find that there was error. I thought the State 

court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it 

in.

 MR. HALTOM: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't until we got 

into the Federal court that there was an error found. 

As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason 

to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman 

or not, because there was no error.

 MR. HALTOM: That's correct. That's in 

pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix. The State 

appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter 

of State law in this case. The court also concluded 

that there was no constitutional error.

 Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 

of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated 

in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice 

that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case. 

However, in making that alternative holding, the State 

appellate court, the California court, was applying 

what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court 

has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent 

of the Kotteakos type standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it is that

determination that you are objecting to here. The 

harmlessness determination.

 MR. HALTOM: I am, Your Honor. Obviously, 

we are objecting to the State court's finding of no 

underlying substantive constitutional violation, as well 

as the State court's determination that there was no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But for the former, you are 

perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos. And for 

the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. 

I just don't see the logic of that.

 MR. HALTOM: Well, first of all, this case, 

since it has now been determined in the Federal courts 

that there was an underlying constitutional violation, 

does not present that question. We do -- and I 

understand the position that you are raising, 

Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the 

logic there. I don't think the Court has to resolve 

that here.

 Some of the lower Federal courts have 

determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht 

standard has been completely supplanted. Some courts 

have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus 

is Esparza to lead to that conclusion. And that may 

very well be the case. However, I don't think the Court 

needs to ultimately address that proposition in this

case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I read the 

Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on 

harmlessness is based on the structural consideration 

that your under collateral review at that point, rather 

than under direct review. You would apply a different 

harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into 

account the fact that it's collateral review rather than 

direct.

 MR. HALTOM: Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, 

collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht, 

can result in a more deferential standard of harmless 

error inquiry. The -- those considerations that led 

this Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than 

Chapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases.

 However, a central theme of the Brecht 

decision was that there have been Chapman analysis 

conducted by the State appellate judiciary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess that's 

where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the 

central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review, 

and that calls for a different standard, or whether the 

central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken, 

and therefore, that calls for a different standard.

 I'm not sure I agree with you that the

latter is the case.

 MR. HALTOM: I agree that it could be -- it 

is a debatable point. But the -- to ignore the 

circumstance that this Court stressed, I think 

undoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that 

State appellate review is to basically divorce the 

holding in Brecht from the factual context in which that 

case -- or out of which that case arose.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The dissenters certainly 

thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in 

Brecht. They said that Kotteakos would apply even where 

the State court has found that "no violation has 

occurred."

 MR. HALTOM: That's true, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, never 

approached the harmlessness thing. That's what the 

dissenters thought.

 MR. HALTOM: The dissenters thought that the 

import of Brecht was that it was going to apply 

across-the-board in Federal habeas --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't think the 

majority said the contrary. I mean, I wrote it. I 

mean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not 

what I thought. But if you read it, I don't think it 

decides this question.

What I wonder, though, is why does the --

how does this case present the issue you want to argue? 

I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that. As I 

understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to 

let this witness testify, it is cumulative. All right. 

And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a 

mistake. And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that 

this witness added nothing. There could no possible 

prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that 

person. That means it was cumulative, that means it did 

nothing, and that was the appeals court. So the appeals 

court finds no error.

 Now, we get over to the Federal court. And 

they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot. Well, they 

couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the 

point where the constitution is violated unless they 

disagreed with that decision of making no possible 

difference. Very well. We disagree, send it back. End 

of case.

 Now, where does it raise all this stuff 

about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard 

for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so 

complicated. How does this case raise it?

 MR. HALTOM: Well, I suppose, Your Honor, 

because of the fact that the State appellate court

didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at 

that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised 

the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner, 

that there is no possible --

JUSTICE BREYER: Was that as a reason for 

there not being error? Or was it in the context of 

saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no 

possible prejudice. What does the footnote mean, in 

your opinion? The second?

 MR. HALTOM: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the footnote 

number?

 MR. HALTOM: It's footnote 17.

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I'll read it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page what?

 MR. HALTOM: It's 97 in the Joint Appendix, 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. Very helpful. 

The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well 

get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a 

decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression 

on me. And he was a very good judge. It's in a 

different context, it's the same problem.

 He said, I originally thought this was the

case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could 

conscientiously say, although I consider the findings 

clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's 

decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial 

evidence. And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes 

from an agency.

 But when I think about it, I don't think 

there's substantial evidence either. Okay. In other 

words, has there ever been a case in the history of 

mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to 

himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that 

this is harmless, so I'll affirm. But I don't think 

it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll 

reverse.

 I mean, I find it very difficult to get 

myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing 

is possible.

 MR. HALTOM: I agree with you, Your Honor. 

It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the 

phrase here, and this case may be a case where the 

difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of 

consequence. If you'd look at the district court's 

treatment of this case, at the district court level the 

court stated: "Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating 

actionable error," and that court is applying the Brecht

standard. The district court states: "I cannot rule 

out prejudice in this case." So seemingly had that 

court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in 

the district court.

 Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the 

dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice 

even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the 

panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the 

prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples' 

testimony been admitted that would have substantially 

bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence. That 

statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is 

harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not 

inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying 

the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in 

Mr. Fry's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If I could come back to, 

may I ask this question: Is part of your argument that 

even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?

 MR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: This is a case, am I 

correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then 

a five-week deliberation in this case? And there was a 

harmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen 

a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?

MR. HALTOM: Correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that in the 

question presented?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It says that if the Brecht 

standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear 

the burden? I guess that's the narrower question, who 

has the burden.

 MR. HALTOM: Well, the Respondent has 

essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear 

the risk of non-persuasion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But O'Neal, I thought 

O'Neal just says that this word "burden of proof" is out 

of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading 

the record.

 MR. HALTOM: I think that that was what the 

holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as 

Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion, 

the effect of that is to allocate the risk of 

non-persuasion to the State. And so I think that 

that's -- I could be wrong, but it seems to me a 

semantic point.

 And to Justice Stevens' question, as you 

pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos 

standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an 

exacting standard. And in applying that standard, if

you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions, 

Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the 

jury. Here we have a jury in the third trial that 

deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're now arguing 

that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is 

that the point you're making?

 MR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor.

 THE COURT: Okay. Now, I didn't hear the 

answer to my question. I'm not sure that is in the 

question that you presented and on which we granted 

cert. It says which standard applies, who bears the 

burden. I don't see anything saying is this -- was it 

erroneous to conclude that this was harmless under 

Brecht.

 MR. HALTOM: Well, I believe, number one, 

does it matter which standard applies as part of the 

question presented? Does it matter which harmless error 

standard is implied? My answer to that is no, because 

Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman.

 And this Court could in this case simply 

decide this case on that very narrow question, like many 

court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually 

challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply, 

Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman

analysis in the State court or when there has been an 

objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State 

court. Most courts confronted with that issue say, we 

don't need to decide the question here because either 

the error was plainly harmless under both of those 

standards or plainly not harmless under both of these 

standards. And I simply recounted the history of the 

litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that 

this could be a case where that make a difference. It 

seems like --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The trouble with reading 

that second question that way is that, you know, it 

follows from your first question, which speaks in the 

generality of cases. It's not speaking to this case. 

Your first question presented is, if constitutional 

error in a State trial is not recognized by the 

judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is 

the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set 

forth in Chapman or in Brecht? That's the first 

question. Very generalized.

 Second question: Does it matter which 

harmless-error standard is employed? I didn't take that 

to mean does it matter in this case which of the two. I 

thought it meant, you know, is there any difference 

between the two standards? Don't you think that's fair

reading of it.

 MR. HALTOM: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it means, does it 

matter in this case which harmless -- you think that 

second sentence means would, would the defendant be 

entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which 

harmless error standard is employed? You think that's 

what it means?

 MR. HALTOM: I think that that is the import 

of that portion of the question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that a question on 

which we would be likely to grant cert?

 MR. HALTOM: Perhaps not if that was the 

only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because, 

as I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in 

his concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard 

is a demanding standard. And look at this case. If the 

error in this case can be deemed harmless under any 

standard, then what cannot? What is prejudice when 

you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury 

where nine days into the deliberations at least five of 

them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty. They told the 

judge that they were at an impasse. This jury struggled 

mightily with this evidence.

thing I'm not terribly clear about, though. Is it clear 

which -- what side the magistrate thought had the burden 

of persuasion?

 MR. HALTOM: It is not, and it seems as 

though, looking at the language that the magistrate 

judge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that 

he was looking to me, to Mr. Fry, to meet that burden. 

And I quoted his language in my brief and to the Ninth 

Circuit and I argued to the Ninth Circuit that the 

burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to 

Mr. Fry. However, that issue was simply not addressed 

in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does your opponent now 

concede that the State has the burden?

 MR. HALTOM: Yes, Respondent concedes that 

their burden -- that it's their burden --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do they say that after 

I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the 

Court which said this concept is not applicable in --

when you're reviewing a record for harmless error. It's 

not a question of presenting evidence. What I think it 

said is that it's not a question of presentation of 

evidence. In such a case, we think it's conceptually 

clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge 

think that the error substantially influenced the

judge's -- the jury's decision? Now, maybe I was wrong, 

but I think there was a majority of the Court that 

agreed with it.

 MR. HALTOM: Yes, Your Honor. And I think 

your point, as I understood it, in O'Neal was that it 

analytically does not make sense --

JUSTICE BREYER: To talk about burdens of 

proof?

 MR. HALTOM: -- when the appellate court is 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. But that's my basic 

question in this case and it's a serious question. 

Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can 

conscientiously review a record and decide for myself 

whether I think this error of the judge was harmless, 

and if I really try I can bring myself to understand 

this question. Regardless of what I think, could 

another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have 

thought the opposite? I can do that mentally.

 You try to get me to make more fine 

distinctions than that, I cannot do it. I can't. I'm 

sorry. I admit it.

 Now, if that's the state of mind that I can 

get myself into -- and I believe that's true of many 

judges -- how do I write words that are realistic in

this area?

 MR. HALTOM: I think that that's a question, 

Your Honor, that this court has struggled with. As 

Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in 

Dominguez Benitez, that we're talking about with these 

harmless error standards ineffable gradations of 

probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to 

grasp. But I think if we just tie it to the facts of 

this case, I think that in the explanation you just gave 

that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this 

case and conclude --

JUSTICE ALITO: There are many situations in 

which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard 

to facts in criminal cases and civil cases. In a 

criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether 

there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Do 

you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on 

all of those issues?

 MR. HALTOM: With respect to a standard 

sufficiency analysis, no, Justice Alito. It's just a 

question for the appellate judge to discern, was there 

sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence 

in the light most favorable to the prosecution.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between that and applying any harmless error standard?

It's exactly the same kind of analysis. It's a 

different legal test, but you're applying, you're 

applying the law to facts.

 MR. HALTOM: I agree. And I don't quarrel 

at all with the way that the court described -- said 

that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless 

error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to 

look at it in terms of the allocation of burden. I 

don't think that this case ultimately turns on that, 

except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he 

wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted 

by the district court judge did state that he was 

looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you talking about 

what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? 

That was the only place that I found where the 

magistrate expressed a view on this. It reads: "The 

court does not find that there has been" -- "the court 

does find that there has been an insufficient showing. 

So that "insufficient showing" means showing by the 

Petitioner." Is that what you're relying on?

 MR. HALTOM: Yes. That's exactly what I'm 

relying on, Your Honor.

 So, going back to specifically the facts of 

this case, this Court could, as I indicated earlier,

without regard to the thorny Chapman versus Brecht 

question, decide this case solely in terms of, under 

Brecht, does Mr. Fry prevail; and we look at the nature 

of the constitutional violation that occurred.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That wouldn't help 

us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which 

standard is applicable, though, right?

 MR. HALTOM: No, it certainly would not, 

Your Honor. And this Court may very well deem that to 

be necessary. But I think also that this Court 

fashioning a decision which is faithful to the 

requirement that -- or the principle that Kotteakos is 

an exacting standard, would also be an important 

constitutional principle. In a case like this, where 

there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman 

court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error 

standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard 

against erroneous convictions where there is a close 

question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in 

this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to 

fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure 

that that happens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would put 2254 

out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a 

Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on

post-conviction relief?

 MR. HALTOM: As I understand that question, 

the Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of 

its amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where 

there's been an intervening change in the law which 

could involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman. 

And I've cited in my brief a district court case, United 

States versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in 

accordance with the position that I'm advocating, that 

it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas 

proceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without 

regard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather 

there's no need for deference, where the -- the big 

issue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was 

concerned about simply repeating a harmless error 

analysis that the State court had already done; and 

we're not asking this Court to do that in this case.

 The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds 

over in certain limited 2255 cases.

 If I may save the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Haltom.

MR. MOODY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Federal habeas is limited in scope and 

purpose. It is not a continuation of the appellate 

process. Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited 

by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State 

sovereignty. In Brecht, this court held that the 

stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on 

collateral review. Instead, in order to strike a proper 

balance between State and Federal interests, the actual 

prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect 

on the verdict should be used in collateral cases.

 Petitioner is asking for an exception to 

this rule. He claims that if he did not receive Chapman 

review in State court, he should receive it on Federal 

habeas. That was not the rule in Brecht and it should 

not be adopted by this Court here. The Brecht decision 

did not state an exception based on the State standard 

used. The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance 

between the Federal Government and the State. This 

Court has never treated cases where there was not a 

state Chapman finding differently from other cases. It 

applies Brecht throughout. In the Penry case and in the 

O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court, 

yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about

that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said in your brief 

that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's 

going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should 

have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's 

conviction. Did you say that?

 MR. MOODY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But realistically, the 

likelihood that such a petition would be successful, 

passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to 

have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would 

grant cert on such a question is very slim.

 MR. MOODY: I agree, the likelihood of the 

cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not 

change the fact that once you come to court under 2254, 

you are asking for collateral review. And in collateral 

review, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman 

standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose you could say 

that of all the questions that go into habeas under 

2254, that they could have brought up directly but the 

chances are their being taken here are negligible?

 MR. MOODY: I, I agree with that, Your 

Honor.

State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, 

how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas? You 

would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable 

application of Chapman?

 MR. MOODY: Yes, Your Honor. First you 

would ask if it was an unreasonable application of 

Chapman. If you found that it was not, then the case is 

over, there's no need to grant the writ. If you found 

that it was, you would proceed and do a Brecht analysis. 

And that's what we learned from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems awfully 

refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses? Is 

this an -- is this an unreasonable application of 

Chapman? And then apply the Brecht standard after 

determining that it was an unreasonable application of 

Chapman?

 MR. MOODY: I don't disagree. I'm merely 

trying to make sense of the various decisions in this, 

in this arena. There's some tension between the Esparza 

decision and other decisions of the Court; and one has 

to find a place for AEDPA standard. So we would not 

object to simply an application of Brecht which is what 

this Court has always done. But as far as it seems to 

suggest there may be an interim step.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we apply Brecht.

This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd 

appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. 

The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG 

in the briefs. He states them very well. The first is 

let's look at this witness. The testimony was excluded. 

Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was 

unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of 

clearly established Federal law, because that testimony 

of the witness that was excluded was not only material, 

it would have substantially bolstered the claim of 

innocence. So that's their finding on the merits.

 Then they go on to say, but the exclusion 

was harmless.

 How could both those things be true? How 

could it be true that the reason that there was error in 

excluding it was that the evidence is so important that 

it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? 

That's one thing they say.

 But the exclusion was harmless. I just fail 

to understand how anyone could think both those things. 

But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, 

but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.

 MR. MOODY: I think that the explanation is 

as follows. When you're analyzing the denial of a 

defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first

look to see how it fit into the defense. And that is 

what they were doing. You're not looking at the entire 

case. You're looking only at the defense.

 And so in the sense that something is better 

than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven 

may improve the defense case.

 And yet nonetheless, when you move to the 

next question, which is, was there a substantial and 

injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now 

you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking 

at everything that was available to the jury -- it may 

be that there was still so much other evidence that it 

could overcome whatever increase you received on the 

defense.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it necessary for us 

to try to reconcile those two statements? The Ninth 

Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there 

was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for 

purposes of the question that's presented to us. So why 

shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question 

independently of what they said about whether there was 

a Chambers violation?

 MR. MOODY: We would not object to that. 

I'm trying to -- I'm trying to assist Justice Breyer in 

that perceived imbalance between a finding of a

substance above and then a finding of harmless error 

before.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, every time evidence is 

excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the 

equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's 

not a constitutional error under Chambers and related 

cases, is there?

 MR. MOODY: Yes. We agree. That's 

certainly the law of this Court. And in this, in --

well, let me move on. I'd like to make a couple of 

other points.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go just back to 

Justice Breyer's question for a second?

 MR. MOODY: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I mean, I think your 

answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as 

sort of a general statement. But in -- would you agree 

that in this case, if we -- if we do proceed, number 

one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and 

we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine 

whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this 

particular case, the, the record indicates that the case 

was so close that there would have to be a finding of 

harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to 

find harmless error. Even applying Brecht clear.

And you know what I'm getting at. I mean, 

five weeks of deliberation. The question after, 

whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on. 

Obviously this -- this case was just to tottering on the 

edge. So even if we, if we do get to the point of 

applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that 

he's -- he gets no relief under Brecht?

 MR. MOODY: No, I would disagree with that. 

You've the sixth court to hear this case. The prior 

five have all rejected his claim. And while --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But two or three of those 

did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now, 

don't you?

 MR. MOODY: No, I don't agree with that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: For purposes of argument.

 MR. MOODY: For purposes of argument I do. 

The district court and the Ninth Circuit both applied 

Brecht and found that this was not an error which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was two to one in the 

Ninth Circuit.

 MR. MOODY: This is true.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Judge Rawlinson I think

actual prejudice.

dissent in the Ninth Circuit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't this the -- I may 

have it wrong -- but isn't this the case in which the 

witness was unique not cumulative because she was the 

only one who was completely disinterested.

 MR. MOODY: No. I would disagree with that. 

She's been characterized that way. But, and I want to 

point out that, I would like to clarify the record in 

response to your question, Justice Stevens. You asked 

whether or not she saw another man commit the murder. 

And counsel appeared to agree with you. That was not 

her testimony. Her testimony was that she overheard 

someone else confessing to murders that may or may not 

have been these murders.

 And the -- and this was a very long case. 

This case lasted eleven weeks, it involved a hundred 

witnesses. You can look at the opinions it produced in 

state court and in the district court. They're each 100 

pages long. It's not unreasonable to expect the jury to 

take a long time to decide that case.

 Now there are 25 court days of 

deliberations --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Five, five weeks?

 MR. MOODY: Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of 

which were taken up with read back. Several -- several

holidays. I mean if you want to go through and look at 

it, now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any other 

case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?

 MR. MOODY: I haven't attempted to find one. 

It is a long deliberation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sure there's an example 

somewhere, but I -- I practiced law for over 40 years, 

and I never heard of it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point, how many 

weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?

 MR. MOODY: I believe that was -- I keep, 

I've been switching back and forth between calendar days 

and court days. So forgive me. I believe that was on 

the eighth court day. And at that point, when they 

announced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson 

and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and 

deliberated the case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So --

MR. MOODY: And after --

JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.

 MR. MOODY: After they selected the new 

foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the 

crucial evidence in the case. The ballistics experts. 

They asked for that. They asked for the testimony of

the in-custody witness who heard the confession of 

Mr. Fry. They asked for Mr. Fry's testimony.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did they ask for a read 

back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?

 MR. MOODY: Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was 

not admitted. It was excluded.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, that's right. Of 

course.

 MR. MOODY: But they did not --

significantly they did not ask for read back of the 

witnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples. 

The third party culpability case was basically not 

credited by the jury. They did not a read back of those 

witnesses.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, maybe, maybe you'd 

end up --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe a critical 

witness was left out. That argues the other way, I 

think.

 MR. MOODY: I would encourage the Court to 

carefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say. If 

you look in her own words, and I'm quoting: I was just 

in and out of the room. I just listened to bits and 

pieces of it. And that's at joint appendix 10. This,

his ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but 

she did not have very much to say about this. She said 

she didn't hear the beginning of the statement. She 

could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion. 

She was in and out of the room. She heard only bits and 

pieces.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what she heard was that 

they were going to kill, this other person was going to 

kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was 

the crime at issue.

 MR. MOODY: With respect, that's not what 

she heard.

 MR. MOODY: What she heard was a statement 

that he had killed a man and a woman. And this was not 

immediately after the offense. This is 18 months after 

the offense, this is not next day.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you think -- do you 

think, do you think I should do this? I'm still 

looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, 

having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and 

having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a 

mistake for a judge and then you never finish a 

proceeding. I'm worried about that, as are you.

JUSTICE BREYER: At the same time, I think 

what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. 

Not what -- quite what the test says.

 So there has to be a conscientious effort to 

decide, was there -- was it harmless? Could a 

reasonable jurist in California have concluded the 

opposite? Okay.

 So maybe we should do it in this case. We 

simply try ourselves to go through this record, make 

that determination to show by example, rather than by 

trying to find a form of words.

 MR. MOODY: Well, you don't do it very 

often. I understand that that's something you could do 

if you wanted to. I think that this is just a classic 

case where two courts applied the Brecht standard and 

reached their conclusions and there's nothing really 

remarkable about it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The third party 

perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about 

according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or 

Hearst?

 MR. MOODY: Hurtz. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there -- there was a 

link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship 

between Hurtz and the victim?

MR. MOODY: That's right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was that established in 

other testimony or would that all have come out just 

only through Maples?

 MR. MOODY: Actually, I'm thinking about my 

answer because I was thinking about Borelli. There were 

three third party culpability, potential targets in this 

case. And I believe that Hurtz, the testimony of 

several of the witness who were admitted did testify of 

a link between Cindy Bell and Hurtz.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Otherwise, I mean, they 

couldn't have found it was cumulative if -- if that had 

not been the case.

 MR. MOODY: In order to -- I need to correct 

the record on that as well. The trial judge did not 

find that this was cumulative. He found a lack of 

foundation. What happened was, was Ms. Maples was 

offered as a witness --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- on appellate review 

in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?

 MR. MOODY: The alternative prejudice 

holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been 

cumulative.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. Okay.

 MR. MOODY: Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And they -- they couldn't 

have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on 

Hurtz, apart from Maples?

 MR. MOODY: Oh, that's right. Yes. There 

was, and that's really my point. My point is that 11 

third party culpability witnesses were allowed to 

testify in this trial. And one was excluded.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How did Hurtz's name enter 

into the trial?

 MR. MOODY: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did anybody mention 

him?

 MR. MOODY: Well, for one thing, he was 

called to testify and asked if he killed these people. 

Mr. Hurtz testified at this trial. The jury got to see 

him, they got to look him in the eye, they got to hear 

him on direct, they got to hear him on cross. And they 

did not ask for a read back of that testimony.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if Maples' testimony 

had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined 

him on the basis of Maples' testimony?

 MR. MOODY: Well, he stated he never said he 

killed these people. And he, he stated he'd never said 

he killed a man and a woman in a car. So it -- it went 

to what Maples would have said, and also --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did he say he'd killed

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MOODY: He also denied doing that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then at that 

point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples' 

testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, 

becomes more relevant.

 MR. MOODY: I would disagree, simply because 

she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to 

really give her testimony any true probative value in 

the case because she was in and out of the room. She 

didn't hear the beginning. She didn't hear the end. 

And when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she 

says, I don't know. So this could be -- this could be 

something very different --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's classic going to 

the weight of the evidence. That goes to the weight, 

not the admissibility.

 MR. MOODY: Ordinarily I would agree with 

that. And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking 

about these killings, then certainly it would go to the 

weight. But since he was speaking about killings that 

she said she didn't know if they were in California, New 

Jersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and

therefore -- in California we ask that before you 

present third party culpability evidence you tie it to 

this crime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So we don't assume that 

he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?

 MR. MOODY: Well, it's -- he may have 

committed other killings, but if did not confess to 

committing these killings then there's no probative 

value to her testimony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the 

question of the application of Brecht is included within 

the questions presented?

 MR. MOODY: No. I briefed it because I was 

concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't 

think it is fairly presented.

 The only other point that I wanted to make 

is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will 

basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a 

near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral 

review. As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many 

times Petitioners come to court and they have a case 

where there was no finding of constitutional error in 

State court and therefore no Chapman application, but 

they're going to assert that in Federal court. And so 

if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then

you really have reduced application of Brecht.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But on the other side, 

State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother 

in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into 

the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.

 MR. MOODY: I don't think we should assume 

that the State courts are going to do that. I think 

that what -- it's sort of like what we said earlier in 

the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary 

ruling is a constitutional violation. I would say most 

of them are not. And this Court has not drawn a bright 

line of exactly where that is. So in many cases, this 

is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best. And 

so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a 

Chapman standard because it would not be finding error.

 And with that, I'm prepared to submit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS

 CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The distinction between collateral review 

and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what

Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review 

for harmlessness in collateral review become the same 

standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct 

review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it. 

That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this 

Court. He got Chapman review. They cited Chapman. 

They didn't cite it here. That's the only difference.

 Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they 

unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it 

again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a 

deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral 

review and direct review and that distinction turns upon 

the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not 

to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a 

long record where difficult calls were made. It is to 

correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous 

wrongs that have caused custody in violation of 

constitutional --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two questions 

and then you can proceed. One, do you take a position 

on who has the burden of persuasion? That's the first 

question. And do you have an opinion on proper 

application of Brecht in this case?

 MS. MILLETT: If I can adopt 

Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this

Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of 

burden of persuasion. We accept O'Neal's holding what 

then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in 

this case, the tie goes to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree if it 

were in equipoise the State would have the burden?

 MS. MILLETT: The tie would go to the 

prisoner, yes. Were it in equipoise, because the State 

would have the burden the State would lose. I don't 

think that's what happened in this case. I think what 

Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the 

way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is 

that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court 

and what the judge will say in, what the court said in 

O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially 

contributed to the jury's verdict? And that is 

essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very 

bottom when it said "The court doesn't find that there's 

an insufficient showing" -- that's the same way of 

saying I haven't been persuaded -- that the error 

contributed to the verdict. So I don't think that this 

case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it 

the burden of persuasion or the proper level of 

conviction on the part of the court. This court was not 

persuaded and that is all that matters. When the court

is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner 

loses.

 The second question you asked was whether we 

have a position on application of Brecht, and we do. 

We've laid it out in our brief. We think that in no 

sense does this record support the notion, support the 

argument, that there was a substantial and injurious 

effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was 

excluded, talking about third party culpability. And 

that requires not just looking at what, in isolation, 

what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz. There was I 

think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him 

either say he did it or he was there or he was involved.

 But it requires looking at the whole record. 

And there were -- the defense here was not a Hurtz 

versus Fry. This was a case where the defense did an 

excellent job. It was a well defended case, and threw 

up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it 

bought on.

 In the third trial you had what you didn't 

had in the prior trials. You had ballistics evidence 

that linked his gun to the crime. You have his own 

admission, his own testimony, that he left the house 

that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out 

in the truck that was seen at -- a truck of the same

type, that was seen at the crime scene.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I have the same problem 

Justice Souter does, in all candor. The jury takes five 

weeks to decide the case and there's a fairly 

interesting bit of testimony that doesn't get in. And 

to say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an 

injurious effect on the deliberations is a close 

question, I think.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, two answers. If it's a 

close question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht 

mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State 

and are not overturned by the sixth court on review.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but an equally divided 

call goes the other way.

 MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If it's not just a close 

call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.

 MS. MILLETT: It is, and no one has thought 

this was equal. The two courts -- the three courts, the 

California Court of Appeals also said in any event 

there's no possible prejudice.

 Now, how they could say no possible 

prejudice under a State standard and still say, ah, but 

it would have affected the verdict under Chapman, is not 

something I'm able to understand. So I think you have

JUSTICE SOUTER: Neither am I. But I draw a 

different conclusion from it from the one you're 

drawing.

 MS. MILLETT: I guess I misunderstand your 

point, because I think when the court said there's no 

possible prejudice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I cannot accept the 

State -- the conclusion that there was no possible 

prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment 

ago and I a moment before sort of put out. I just do 

not find that a reasonable conclusion.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, again, even if the Court 

thinks there may have been some chance, may have been --

you know -- relevant testimony -- this Court can well 

disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of 

discretion. If it were Federal Rule of Evidence 403, 

you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion. 

Whether it was unconstitutional, so clearly 

unconstitutional as to merit under AEDPA and under 

Brecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the 

fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the AEDPA 

question was out of it because that hasn't been -- there 

was no cross-appeal on that question. I thought it was

a given, a given in this case, that the California 

courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly 

established Federal law.

 I didn't think that was an issue in the 

case. I think we took it on the assumption that it was 

such an error.

 MS. MILLETT: Again, the Respondents in this 

case have not conceded constitutional error, and in 

their brief they repeat that. And I think there's a 

question whether a court should --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not raised here. 

There was no cross-appeal from that.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, a Respondent is entitled 

to defend on any ground supported by the record. But 

even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that 

there was an error and one assumes that it was -- which 

is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly 

unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call 

that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing 

this, and the combination of lack of foundation and 

cumulativeness. It's hard for me to understand when 

that rises to the level of unconstitutionality.

 But if we assume that it did, you have the 

two courts that applied the Brecht standard here. And 

the district court decision here is nearly 100 pages

long. It's a very careful, methodical analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's because there were 

many, many issues raised.

 MS. MILLETT: There's many issues, but also 

it was being careful and it was being very methodical. 

And it went through this and it went through this 

record. That court went through true this record, more 

than 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than 

100 witnesses. And it was on that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose if we're 

going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would 

have to do the same thing.

 MS. MILLETT: I think that's what this Court 

has said.

 The other thing I want to get back to is the 

question about the length of jury deliberations. Sure, 

this was really wrong. Now, they changed forepersons in 

midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction 

repeated. Who knows what happened. But what I will not 

concede -- I will concede it's long, but I will not 

concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations 

says anything about if this one particular error in 

applying a balancing test substantially affected the 

verdict. I think the length of deliberations is so 

incredibly speculative.

 MS. MILLETT: I will concede it was, I will 

concede it was a difficult case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If you take five weeks 

it's pretty clearly a close case.

 MS. MILLETT: That's right. But you know, 

the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that 

this is not filling in the gaps in direct review. We're 

not going to give you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no evidence 

or inference that it was close on the alternative 

murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples' 

testimony goes to.

 MS. MILLETT: That's exactly right. In 

fact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz 

has a couple of references in a two-day closing 

argument. That was not the centerpiece of his case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It has to be close on an 

alternative murderer. It wasn't suicide. Obviously, if 

he didn't do it, somebody else did. So if it's a close 

case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the 

second.

 MS. MILLETT: No, but as to who did it and 

whether Hurtz did it or whether -- remember, what the

defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that 

this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or 

someone else is what we don't know.

 Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before 

this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of 

a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court 

has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were 

involved, was so -- that simply disallowed the twelfth 

out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so 

clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the 

verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years 

after the crime.

 And yes, the jury -- it was close in the 

sense that they worked a long hard time. But at the end 

of the day, they were unanimous. There's nothing close 

about unanimous. And I think it would be the wrong 

message to say that a jury that works as hard as this 

one did, did the readbacks, culled through this 

record --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but we don't know 

what they would have done if they had this evidence that 

was excluded. That's the problem.

 MS. MILLETT: One never knows that in habeas 

corpus. But what you do when you look at what they were 

focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics

experts. They had them read back right next each other. 

They made that call. It's their job to do it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason they may 

have been doing that is that they may very well have 

thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt 

was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to 

know was whether the evidence going specifically to this 

defendant was strong enough to overcome it.

 MS. MILLETT: May I answer? One would have 

expected at least one readback on third party 

culpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's 

testimony which put himself that night with the gun in 

the truck, and which he said -- you know -- and 

beforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to 

blow them away.

case, I have one question. Two cases. A, Hurtz did not 

testify at all. B, he did. Is the foundation ruling 

any different in the two cases insofar as Maples' 

testimony or is it the same? I.e., is there a lesser 

showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?

 MR. HALTOM: I think that possibly the 

foundation with Hurtz there could be increased. The 

jury sought Mr. Hurtz.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you mean, oh, you mean 

more? You have to be more strict for foundation after 

Hurtz testified? I was suggesting the opposite.

 MR. HALTOM: Well, I was just thinking that 

his presence there would be relevant. The jury actually 

saw him. They heard a truck driver describing, a 

neutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who 

in no way fit the description of Mr. Fry. 

Unfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr. 

Hurtz looked like, but the jury saw it. And if the jury 

saw that that truck driver was describing a man that 

looked like Mr. Hurtz, then that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were all kinds 

of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, 

including the time, the timing of the murder.

 MR. HALTOM: There were infirmities in his 

testimony, Your Honor. However, he came from Missouri,

so maybe he was looking at a Missouri clock. We don't 

know. But why would that man make up a story? He has 

no axe to grind in this case. And then his testimony is 

corroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately 

after it and says: He looked like he had just seen a 

ghost, and described seeing a double execution-style 

murder. Now --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That was all presented to 

the jury, right?

 MR. HALTOM: That was all presented to the 

jury. However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and 

counsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz' 

guilt. She certainly did argue it, but the reason that 

she didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the 

California Court of Appeals, said, the other seven 

witnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the 

Bells were all described as having been flimsy witness 

who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how strong is 

this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious 

conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and 

didn't -- couldn't tell whether he was talking about 

something that happened 10 years before or 2 days 

before?

Official - Subject to Final Review 

extremely strong. Page JA-78 in the joint appendix, 

Respondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness 

concerning Mr. Hurtz's -- concerning Mr. Hurtz. She 

heard this, her cousin, saying he shot a man and a woman 

in a parked car, first shooting the woman in the head, 

then shooting the man, getting blood all over himself. 

That linked up with all the other confessions in this 

case. Interlinking confessions just like in Chambers 

were deemed to provide adequate assurance of 

reliability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m. the case in the 

above entitled matter was submitted.)
