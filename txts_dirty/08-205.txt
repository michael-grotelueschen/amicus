 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument today in Case 08-205, Citizens United v. The 

Federal Election Commission.

 Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Participation in the political process is 

the First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee. Yet 

that freedom is being smothered by one of the most 

complicated, expensive, and incomprehensible regulatory 

regimes ever invented by the administrative state.

 In the case that you consider today, it is a 

felony for a small, nonprofit corporation to offer 

interested viewers a 90-minute political documentary 

about a candidate for the nation's highest office, that 

General Electric, National Public Radio, or George Soros 

may freely broadcast. Its film may be shown in 

theaters, sold on DVDs, transmitted for downloading on 

the Internet, and its message may be distributed in the 

form of a book. But its producers face 5 years in 

prison if they offer it in the home through the vehicle

 Because the limitation on speech, political 

speech, is at the core of the First Amendment, the 

government has a heavy burden to establish each 

application of a restriction on that form of speech is a 

narrowly tailored response to a compelling governmental 

interest. The government cannot prove and has not 

attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made 

available to people who choose affirmatively to receive 

it, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small 

corporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption 

or its appearance. Indeed, this documentary is the very 

definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject 

of intense political interest that the First Amendment 

is there to guarantee.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, if the film were 

distributed by General Motors, would your argument be 

the same?

 MR. OLSON: Well, it wouldn't -- definitely 

would not be the same because there are several aspects 

of the argument that we present. However, in one 

respect, it would. A 90-minute documentary was not the 

sort of thing that the -- the BCRA -- the Congress was 

intended to prohibit. In fact, as the -- as the 

Reporters Committee for -- for Freedom of Speech points

out, the documentary is indistinguishable from other 

news media commentary --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the point, then, 

of similarity is you would, whether it was offered by 

General Motors or offered by -- by this Petitioner, in 

effect call for some qualification of the -- the general 

rule allowing limitations on corporate political 

activity of the speech variety?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, we would, although it is a 

very important factor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So how would we draw the 

line?

 MR. OLSON: Well, one of the reasons that --

one of the bases upon which you would draw the line is 

to look at the documentary -- the voluminous documentary 

record that the government cites and this Court cited in 

the McConnell case as a justification for the 

restrictions themselves. As --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would every -- in 

effect, every limitation on corporate speech or on 

corporate expenditure and the nature of speech be 

subject, then, to in effect this all-factor balancing 

test?

 MR. OLSON: Well, I think what I'm trying to 

say is that what the -- what the Congress was concerned

with -- and Judge Kollar-Kotelly in the district court 

opinion that you considered in McConnell discusses this 

on page 646 of her opinion -- that this sort of 

communication was not something that Congress intended 

to prohibit. You would look at, if Congress intended to 

prohibit 90-minutes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so your -- your 

argument then is there's something distinct about the 

speech, which could be considered regardless of the 

corporate form?

 MR. OLSON: Well, that's part of our 

argument, yes. It's not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is the case, what 

is -- what is the answer to this? That -- that still is 

going to involve a -- a fairly complicated set of 

analyses, probably in a lot of cases. Why is that 

necessary or worthwhile to preserve First Amendment 

values when you could have done this with a PAC?

 MR. OLSON: Well, as this Court said in the 

Wisconsin Right to Life case just a couple years ago, 

that the PAC vehicle is burdensome and difficult.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. You've got 

reporting. You've got limitations on -- on corporate 

contributions and so on, but in this case, for example, 

most of your contributions, as I understand from the

record, were individual. They weren't corporate. There 

was one perhaps. There was some corporate contributions 

MR. OLSON: Yes, on page 252 of the appendix 

and 251, it points out -- you're absolutely correct --

that 1 percent of the contributions --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. OLSON: -- were from corporations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- was that 

established? I thought that the record was hardly made 

of the contributors to this film. I think there was 

something like $200,000 accounted for, and the film cost 

-- to get the Channel '08, whatever it was, to put it on 

cost over a million dollars?

 MR. OLSON: The government sent an 

interrogatory, Justice Ginsburg, asking for the major 

contributions with respect to this project, and the ones 

that they sought -- the government sought what they 

thought was important; the answer to that interrogatory 

is at page 251a and 252a -- that the government was 

seeking information with respect to contributions at a 

$1,000 or more; 198,000 came from individuals. And, by 

the way, the three largest contributors that are listed 

on page 252 of the Joint Appendix are given credit in 

the film itself. So there's no effort to -- to conceal

those individuals.

 So that it's possible -- it's possible that 

corporations throughout America were giving small 

amounts of money to this. That record doesn't establish 

one way or the other. What it does establish is what 

the government felt was necessary for its case that the 

major contributors were individuals and not 

corporations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You have answered Justice 

Souter. I took your answer to be the following: That 

if the corporation had paid -- paid for a program and 

the program was 90 minutes which said vote for Smith, 

vote for Smith over and over -- that's the program --

that you concede that the government could ban this 

under the Act.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it is difficult --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think they would. 

We agree. It's an imaginary hypothetical. But, in 

fact, if they did have 90 minutes of vote for Smith or 

vote against Jones, you concede for purposes of this 

argument that the government can ban it. Is that bright 

or not?

 MR. OLSON: If -- not by this organization. 

We think that if it's a small, nonprofit organization, 

which is very much like the Massachusetts --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. So one of your 

arguments is this is a special corporation. You can't. 

Now suppose it's General Motors. Can they?

 MR. OLSON: Well, General Motors may be 

smaller than the client that we are representing.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would just like to get --

I want to get an answer to the question.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I think that's a big step.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, in my question 

that I'm driving towards is: Since General Motors can 

in your view be forbidden to have our film of 90 minutes 

vote for Smith, vote for Smith, vote for Smith, or vote 

against Jones, vote against Jones, vote against Jones, 

how is this film, which I saw -- it is not a musical 

comedy. What --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- how does this film 

vary from my example, and why does the variance make a 

difference?

 MR. OLSON: The difference is: It's exactly 

what the Court was describing in Wisconsin Right To 

Life. It is a 90 -- it is -- it informs and educates, 

which is what the Court said, or the Chief Justice's 

opinion, the controlling opinion said, was the mark of

an issue communication. And as this Court said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I thought you 

conceded in the -- at least as I read your reply brief, 

that you were no longer saying this is about an issue 

unrelated to any election. I thought you said that this 

was a 90-minute movie "concerning the qualifications, 

character, and fitness of a candidate for the Nation's 

highest office." And that's just what Wisconsin Right 

to Life was not. It was not about the character, 

qualifications, and fitness of either of the Senators.

 MR. OLSON: What the -- what the Court said 

in Wisconsin Right to Life was that the distinction 

between an issue -- issue advocacy and campaign advocacy 

dissolves upon practical application. This is exactly 

what the Court was talking about there. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't the Court 

there say this is not about character, qualifications, 

and fitness?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it did, Justice Ginsburg, 

but what my point is: That there isn't just two boxes 

in the world of communications about public issues, one 

box for so-called issues and one box for campaign 

advocacy. That's what I think the Court meant when it 

said, not just in Wisconsin Right to Life but in earlier 

cases, that the distinction dissolves upon application.

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- how many boxes we have? 

Doesn't this one fall into campaign advocacy? I mean 

I've got the government's brief open at -- open at pages 

18 and 19 with the quotations: She will lie about 

anything. She is deceitful. She is ruthless, cunning, 

dishonest, do anything for power, will speak 

dishonestly, reckless, a congenital liar, sorely lacking 

in qualifications, not qualified as commander in chief. 

I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy.

 MR. OLSON: It -- what -- what the court was 

talking about and as Justice Kollar-Kotelly talked about 

is broadcast advertising, these 10-minute -- 10-second, 

30-second, 60-second bursts of communication that are --

that are the influence in elections.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to get the answer to 

what I was asking.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it seems to me, 

the answer to Justice Breyer's question: This is a 

don't vote for Jones.

 MR. OLSON: This is a long discussion of the 

record, qualifications, history, and conduct of someone 

who is in the political arena, a person who already 

holds public office, who now holds a different public 

office, who, yes, at that point, Justice Souter, was 

running for office. But the fact is that what could the

individual making a -- as I said, the Reporters 

Committee for the Right to Life said this is 

indistinguishable from something that is on the public 

media every day, a long discussion. It might be -- what 

you're suggesting is that unless it's somehow 

evenhanded, unless it somehow says -- which would be 

viewpoint discrimination or prevention of viewpoints, 

which is the safe harbor that the government has written 

into its so-called safe harbor, if you don't have a 

point of view, you can go ahead and express it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't -- that 

isn't the suggestion. The suggestion I was going to, or 

trying to get to, is we know you can't just say vote 

against Smith, vote against Smith, vote against Smith. 

Now, I wanted to know the difference between that and a 

film that picks out bad things that people did -- no 

good ones, just bad ones the candidate did. And then we 

have another film that picks out just good things 

candidates do. And so candidates run films that show 

the good things they do, and then someone else shows the 

bad things they do.

 Now, why is that not the same as vote 

against Smith? Though I grant you, it's more 

intelligent. It's more informative. It's even better 

electioneering. So we're after electioneering. Why

doesn't that fall within the forbidden category?

 MR. OLSON: The government has the burden to 

prove -- and there's a compelling governmental interest 

narrowly tailored, Justice Breyer, because all kinds of 

things of the type that you're talking about are 

permissible if your name is General Motors -- I, mean if 

your name is General Electric rather than General 

Motors, if your name is Disney, if your name is George 

Soros, if your name is National Public Radio.

 What you're suggesting is that a long 

discussion of facts, record, history, interviews, 

documentation, and that sort of thing, if it's all 

negative, it can be prohibited by -- and it's a felony. 

You can go to jail for 5 years for sharing that 

information with the American public, or if it's all 

favorable, you can go to jail. But if you did half and 

half, you couldn't.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I guess it's the same 

as if you were to say, you know, I think Smith is a 

great guy. That's all. I'm sharing information. And 

what I don't see is if you agree that we could ban the 

commercial that says, I see Smith is a great guy, why is 

it any different to supplement that with the five best 

things that Smith ever did?

 MR. OLSON: Because -- because of the First

Amendment. Congress shall make no law abridging the 

freedom of speech. When -- when the government had --

when this Court has permitted that to happen, it has 

only done it in the most narrow circumstances for a 

compelling governmental interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I guess what --

what Justice Breyer is asking is -- I have the same 

question. If we concede -- and at the end of the day 

you might not concede this, but if we take this as a 

beginning point, that a short, 30-second, 1-minute 

campaign ad can be regulated, you want me to write an 

opinion and say, well, if it's 90 minutes, then that's 

different. I -- it seems to me that you can make the 

argument that 90 -- that 90 minutes is much more 

powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate. 

That's I -- that's the thrust of the questioning.

 MR. OLSON: I understand that, Justice 

Kennedy, and it is difficult. But let me say that the 

record that you were considering in McConnell -- and I 

specifically invite, as I did before, page -- the 

Court's attention to 646 of this -- of the district 

court's opinion, which specifically said the government 

and Congress was concerned about these short, punchy ads 

that you have no choice about seeing, and not concerned 

about a thorough recitation of facts or things that you

would have to make an affirmative decision to opt into.

 And the reason why it's difficult is that we 

are talking about an infinite variety of ability of 

people to speak about things that matter more to them 

than anything else, who will be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think you 

have kind of shifted your focus here from the difference 

between a 10-second ad and a 90-minute presentation and 

how that presentation is received, whether it's over the 

normal airwaves or on this Video On Demand. What --

what is the distinction between the 10-second commercial 

and, say, the 90-minute infomercial?

 MR. OLSON: The thing that I think it's --

it's pointed out specifically in your opinion, 

controlling opinion for Wisconsin Right To Life. That 

which informs and educates and may seek to persuade is 

something that is -- is on the line of being 

permissible. The government hasn't established -- never 

did try to establish -- I did shift -- I didn't shift 

but all of these are factors. It's who's doing the 

speaking.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can educate in 30 

seconds. I mean in -- in a 30-second ad you present 

just one of these criticisms of the candidate instead of 

lumping all of them together for 90 minutes.

MR. OLSON: The point, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that education?

 MR. OLSON: The point, I think, Justice 

Scalia, is, yes, you can educate in 10 seconds, you can 

educate in 30 seconds. But what -- what the Court was 

trying to do -- what Congress was trying to do is get at 

the things that were most potentially corruptive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, are you making a 

statutory argument now or a constitutional argument? 

What Congress was trying to do has nothing to do, it 

seems to me, with the constitutional point you're 

arguing.

 MR. OLSON: The government makes the point 

that it established a voluminous record of evidence. 

Both Congress had before it and this Court had before it 

a voluminous volume of evidence because it had the 

burden of proving that something was really bad with 

these -- these types of advertisements.

 And what the -- what the Court did is say, 

well, okay -- in McConnell -- yes, there is a 

substantial burden that the government met that these 

types of communications -- not the Internet, not books, 

not other types of things -- are really bad enough that 

the government could pick those out, and it has narrowly 

tailored its solution to that problem by prohibiting

those things. And the government talks about today in 

its brief the things that Congress felt were the most 

acute problems. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're making a 

statutory argument now?

 MR. OLSON: I'm making a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that this --

this isn't covered by it.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, I am making a statutory 

argument in the sense that you will construe the statute 

in the ways that doesn't violate the Constitution. The 

Constitution, as -- as the Court said in Wisconsin Right 

to Life, gives ties to the speaker, errs on the side of 

permitting the speech, not prohibiting the speech. And 

so all those things may be statutory arguments, Justice 

Scalia, but they are also constitutional arguments.

 And in response to every one of these 

questions, the government has the burden of proving this 

sort of speech, which the Reporters say is 

indistinguishable, than the kind of information that 

news media puts out all the time, not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this argument 

doesn't depend upon whether this is properly 

characterized as express -- the functional equivalent of 

express advocacy? Your contention is that even if it

is, that because it wasn't in the factual record in 

McConnell or before Congress, it is a type of functional 

-- it is a type of express advocacy that's not covered 

by the Act?

 MR. OLSON: I don't think, Chief Justice 

Roberts, that it is remotely the functional equivalent 

of express advocacy, because what the Court and Congress 

was thinking about with respect to express advocacy was 

short, punchy things that you have no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

that's why I'm trying to figure out, the distinction in 

your argument. I mean, if we think that this is the 

functional equivalent of express advocacy, are you 

contending that it is nonetheless not covered in light 

of the record before the Court in McConnell and before 

Congress?

 MR. OLSON: I -- I think I would agree with 

that, but I would also say that the -- the idea, the 

functional equivalent of express advocacy is the very 

magic word problem that this Court has struggled with in 

McConnell and in -- in each of the cases.

 I would -- I said at the beginning that this 

is an incomprehensible prohibition, and I -- and my -- I 

think that's demonstrated by the fact that since 2003 

this Court has issued something close to 500 pages of

opinions interpreting and trying to apply the First 

Amendment to Federal election law. And I counted 22 

separate opinions from the Justices of this Court 

attempting to -- in just the last 6 years, attempting to 

figure out what this statute means, how it can be 

interpreted. In fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

it's mandatory appellate jurisdiction. I mean, you 

don't have a choice.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. OLSON: There would be fewer -- there 

would be fewer opinions. I guess my point is that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And maybe those cases 

presented more difficult issues than this one.

 MR. OLSON: I think this presents a much 

easier issue, Justice Stevens, because this is the type 

of -- if there is anything that the First Amendment is 

intended to protect in the context of elections that are 

occurring -- which, by the way, occur 4 years running, 

but the last election, presidential election occurred 

throughout the entire 2008 -- if the American people 

need to have that kind of information. And the statute 

is both overly broad because if it were a hotel ad, if 

it was a hotel saying Senator Clinton stayed here or 

Senator McCain stayed here, it would be prohibited

because it was a hotel saying so, even though it really 

had nothing to do with the election. If it is -- but 

it's -- if it's a corporation that put together an 

analysis of the earmark positions of each of the 

senatorial candidates -- most all of the candidates were 

running from the Senate, they all had this -- these 

issues where they may have voted or not against 

earmarks, that would --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Olson, this is 

-- I think you were right in conceding at the beginning, 

this is not like the speech involved in Wisconsin Right 

to Life. This is targeted to a specific candidate for a 

specific office to be shown on a channel that says 

Election '08, that tells the viewer over and over again 

what, just for example, it concludes with these are 

things worth remembering before you go in potentially to 

vote for Hillary Clinton.

 Now, if that isn't an appeal to voters, I 

can't imagine what is.

 MR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I 

understand your point. There is much in there that if 

you saw it, you would form an opinion with respect to 

how you might want to vote. You might -- it might form 

a different -- you might form all kinds of different 

opinions.

But it was -- it was an analysis of the 

background record and history and qualifications of 

someone running for president, of course I concede that. 

But what is the -- what is the maker of a movie to take 

out in order to prevent that from happening?

 I understand from some of the questions that 

if it was more evenhanded -- if it said, well, this 

candidate did this, but this candidate did this or this 

candidate was born in the Panama Canal Zone and this 

candidate was born in Hawaii, and that affects whether 

or not they are natural-born citizens or not, and it was 

more evenhanded, would that then not be a felony?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: As you -- as you've said 

yourself, as you pointed out, there -- there is a point 

at which there is no nonporous border between issue 

discussion and candidate discussion. But I think the --

the problem that -- that Justice Ginsburg is having, I'm 

having, and others is that it does not seem to me that 

with the quotations we're dealing with here, as Justice 

Breyer said, it's not a musical comedy. I think we --

we have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue 

advocacy; this is express advocacy saying don't vote for 

this person.

 And if that is a fair characterization, the 

difference between 90 minutes and 1 minute, either for

statutory purposes or constitutional purposes, is a 

distinction that I just cannot follow.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it is a distinction that 

Congress was concerned about, and it's a distinction 

that's all over the record --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You say that. Why --

what -- what is your basis for saying that Congress is 

-- is less concerned with 90 minutes of don't vote for 

Clinton than it was with 60 seconds of don't vote?

 MR. OLSON: Because -- because the record in 

Congress and the record in this Court is that those 

types of advertisements were more effective because they 

came into your home --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They are the characteristic 

advertisement. There is no question about that. That 

is the paradigm case. I agree with you. But I don't 

see how you -- you then leap-frog from saying -- from 

saying that is the paradigm case to saying that this 

never covers anything but the paradigm case when the 

only distinction is time.

 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- I think the --

what -- what Congress was concerned about is the most 

severe and the most acute problem, as Justice 

Kollar-Kotelly said, which everyone acknowledges was the 

problem Congress sought to address with BCRA. It's not

just that, however.

 The point that you just made about a 

nonporous border, it is the government's responsibility 

to the extent that you can't figure out how evenhanded 

you must be or what you must take out of your 

communication in order not to go to jail for airing it, 

it is the functional equivalent -- if everything is the 

functional equivalent that mentions a candidate during 

an election, which is what the government says, it's the 

functional equivalent of a prior restraint, because you 

don't dare --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, I -- I think 

we've been led astray by -- by the constant reference to 

what Congress intended. As I understood your point, it 

was not -- it was not that, well, one is covered by the 

statute and the other isn't, but it is that one is 

covered by the Constitution and the other isn't. And it 

may well be that -- that the kind of speech that is 

reflected in a serious 90-minute documentary is entitled 

to greater constitutional protection. And it may well 

be that the kind of speech that is not only offered but 

invited by the listener is entitled to -- is entitled to 

heightened First Amendment scrutiny, which is -- which 

is what this is since you have pay for view --

MR. OLSON: I agree with that completely,

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life 

didn't just use the term "functional equivalent of 

express advocacy"; it explained what that term meant, 

and on page 2667 of volume 127 of the Supreme Court 

Reporter, the plurality or the lead opinion stated: "In 

light of these considerations, a Court should find that 

an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy 

only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable 

interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or 

against a specific candidate."

 So the functional equivalence test doesn't 

depend on the length of the advertisement or the medium 

in which the advertisement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the length of 

the advertisements wasn't remotely at issue in either 

Washington Right to Life or McConnell or before Congress

when they passed this law.

 MR. STEWART: Well, certainly Congress 

considered a variety of evidence bearing on campaign 

practices that had been undertaken in the past. They 

were primarily -- most of the examples on which they 

focused were 30-second and 60-second advertisements. It 

had certainly been a recurring phenomenon in the past 

that candidates would air, for instance, 30-minute 

infomercials.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any discussion 

either in McConnell -- any citation either in McConnell 

or the Congressional Record to those types of 

documentaries?

 MR. STEWART: I'm not sure about the 

citation; I'm not aware of any citation in McConnell or 

the Congressional Record, but it was certainly a known 

phenomenon. And I think the real --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, how do 

we know it was a known phenomenon in terms of the 

evolution of the statute and the decision of this Court 

upholding it? There is no reference to it.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the real -- I think the 

real key to ascertaining Congress's intent is to look to 

the definition of electioneering communication that 

Congress enacted into the statute, and that definition

requires that the communication be a broadcast, cable or 

satellite communication in order to qualify as an 

electioneering communication, and that it be aired 

within a certain proximity to a Federal election, and 

that in the case of an --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so if Wal-Mart 

airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action 

figures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an 

electioneering communication?

 MR. STEWART: If it's aired in the right 

place at the right time, that would be covered. Now, 

under this Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life 

it would be unconstitutional as applied to those 

advertisements, because those advertisements certainly 

would be susceptible of a reasonable construction of the 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the 

Constitution required Congress to draw the line where it 

did, limiting this to broadcast and cable and so forth? 

What's your answer to Mr. Olson's point that there isn't 

any constitutional difference between the distribution 

of this movie on video demand and providing access on 

the Internet, providing DVDs, either through a 

commercial service or maybe in a public library, 

providing the same thing in a book? Would the

Constitution permit the restriction of all of those as 

well?

 MR. STEWART: I think the -- the 

Constitution would have permitted Congress to apply the 

electioneering communication restrictions to the extent 

that they were otherwise constitutional under Wisconsin 

Right to Life. Those could have been applied to 

additional media as well. And it's worth remembering 

that the preexisting Federal Election Campaign Act 

restrictions on corporate electioneering which have been 

limited by this Court's decisions to express advocacy.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's pretty incredible. 

You think that if -- if a book was published, a campaign 

biography that was the functional equivalent of express 

advocacy, that could be banned?

 MR. STEWART: I'm not saying it could be 

banned. I'm saying that Congress could prohibit the use 

of corporate treasury funds and could require a 

corporation to publish it using its --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, most publishers are 

corporations. And a publisher that is a corporation 

could be prohibited from selling a book?

 MR. STEWART: Well, of course the statute 

contains its own media exemption or media --

statute says. The government's position is that the 

First Amendment allows the banning of a book if it's 

published by a corporation?

 MR. STEWART: Because the First Amendment 

refers both to freedom of speech and of the press, there 

would be a potential argument that media corporations, 

the institutional press, would have a greater First 

Amendment right. That question is obviously not 

presented here. But the other two things --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it were an 

advocacy organization that had a book. Your position is 

that under the Constitution, the advertising for this 

book or the sale for the book itself could be prohibited 

within the 60 -- 90-day period -- the 60 -- the 30-day 

period?

 MR. STEWART: If the book contained the 

functional equivalent of express advocacy. That is, if 

it was subject to no reasonable interpretation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose it could 

even, is it the Kindle where you can read a book? I 

take it that's from a satellite. So the existing 

statute would probably prohibit that under your view?

 MR. STEWART: Well, the statute applies to 

cable, satellite, and broadcast communications. And the 

Court in McConnell has addressed the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to make it clear, 

it's the government's position that under the statute, 

if this kindle device where you can read a book which is 

campaign advocacy, within the 60-30 day period, if it 

comes from a satellite, it's under -- it can be 

prohibited under the Constitution and perhaps under this 

statute?

 MR. STEWART: It -- it can't be prohibited, 

but a corporation could be barred from using its general 

treasury funds to publish the book and could be required 

to use -- to raise funds to publish the book using its 

PAC.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it has one name, 

one use of the candidate's name, it would be covered, 

correct?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a 500-page 

book, and at the end it says, and so vote for X, the 

government could ban that?

 MR. STEWART: Well, if it says vote for X, 

it would be express advocacy and it would be covered by 

the pre-existing Federal Election Campaign Act 

provision.

produced -- again, to leave -- to leave to one side the 

question of.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, right. 

Forget the --

MR. STEWART: -- possible media exemption, 

if you had Citizens United or General Motors using 

general treasury funds to publish a book that said at 

the outset, for instance, Hillary Clinton's election 

would be a disaster for this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my 

hypothetical. It doesn't say at the outset. It funds 

-- here is -- whatever it is, this is a discussion of 

the American political system, and at the end it says 

vote for X.

 MR. STEWART: Yes, our position would be 

that the corporation could be required to use PAC funds 

rather than general treasury funds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they didn't, 

you could ban it?

prohibit the publication of the book using the corporate 

treasury funds.

mean, I take it the answer to the question, can the 

government ban labor unions from saying we love this 

person, the corporations, we love them, the 

environmentalists saying we love them, is of course the 

government can't ban that. The only question is, who's 

paying for it. And they can make a determination of how 

much money the payors can pay, but you can't ban it.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's 

correct, then I take it the interesting question here 

would be -- I don't know if it arises in this case --

suppose there were a kind of campaign literature or --

or advocacy that either a corporation had to pay for it, 

it couldn't pay for it through the PAC, because for some 

reason -- I don't know, the PAC -- and there's no other 

way of getting it to the public -- that would raise a 

Constitutional question, wouldn't it?

 MR. STEWART: It would raise a 

Constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that present in this 

case?

 MR. STEWART: It's not present in this case. 

I don't think it would raise a difficult constitutional 

question because presumably if the reason the

reason I could think of is that it couldn't find 

PAC-eligible donors who were willing to contribute for 

this speech. And if that's the case, the corporation 

would -- could still be forbidden to use its general 

treasury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know about that. 

But I guess I would be worried if in fact there was some 

material that couldn't get through to the public. I 

would be very worried. But I don't think I have to 

worry about that in this case, do I?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct, both because 

the question isn't presented here and because 

Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but if we accept 

your constitutional argument, we're establishing a 

precedent that you yourself say would extend to banning 

the book, assuming a particular person pays for it.

 MR. STEWART: I think the Court has already 

held in, both in Austin and in McConnell, that Congress 

can or that Congress or State legislatures can prohibit 

the use of corporate treasury funds for express 

advocacy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To write a book, to 

pay for somebody to write a book?

the communication was not a book, but it was a 

newsletter, it was written material; and the Court held 

this was express advocacy for which the use of corporate 

treasury funds would ordinarily be banned. It held that 

because of the distinctive characteristics of the 

particular corporation at issue in that case, MCFL was 

entitled to a constitutional exemption. But I think the 

clear thrust of MCFL is that the publication and 

dissemination of a newsletter containing express 

advocacy could ordinarily be banned with respect to the 

use of corporate treasury funds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just a -- I 

suppose a sign held up in Lafayette Park saying vote for 

so and so. Under your theory of the Constitution, the 

prohibition of that would be constitutional?

 MR. STEWART: Again, I do want to make clear 

that if by prohibition you mean ban on the use of 

corporate treasury funds, then, yes, I think it's 

absolutely clear under Austin, under McConnell that the 

use of corporate treasury funds could be banned if 

General Motors, for instance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you -- you get 

around the fact that this would extend to any publishing 

corporation by saying that there is a media exemption

speech but also of the press?

 MR. STEWART: Well, there is always --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But does "the press" mean 

the media in that Constitutional provision? You think 

in 1791 there were -- there were people running around 

with fedoras that had press -- little press tickets in 

it, "Press"? Is that what "press" means in the 

Constitution? Doesn't it cover the Xerox machine? 

Doesn't it cover the right of any individual to -- to 

write, to publish?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think the difficult 

Constitutional question of whether the general 

restrictions on use of corporate treasury funds for 

electioneering can constitutionally be applied to media 

corporations has never had to be addressed because the 

statutes that this Court has reviewed have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't see any 

reason why it wouldn't. I'm saying there's no basis in 

the text of the Constitution for exempting press in the 

sense of, what, the Fifth Estate?

 MR. STEWART: In -- in any event, the only 

question this Court would potentially need to decide in 

this case is whether the exemption for media companies 

creates a disuniformity that itself renders the statute 

unconstitutional, and the Court has already addressed

that question in McConnell. The claim was made that 

because media corporations were exempt, there was 

inequality of treatment as between those and other 

corporations. And Congress said no, Congress -- I mean, 

this Court said no, Congress can protect the interests 

of the media and of the public in receiving information 

by drawing that line. With respect to your --

JUSTICE SOUTER: To point out how far your 

argument would go, what if a labor union paid and 

offered to write a book advocating the election of A or 

the defeat of B? And after the manuscript was prepared, 

they then went to a commercial publisher, and they go to 

Random House. Random House said, yes, we will publish 

that. Can the distribution of that be in effect subject 

to the electioneering ban because of the initial labor 

union investment?

 MR. STEWART: Well, exactly what the remedy 

would be, whether there would be a basis for suppressing 

the distribution of the book, I'm not sure. I think 

it's clear under --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does it come within 

electioneering because of the initial subvention to the 

author?

 MR. STEWART: It wouldn't be an 

electioneering communication under BCRA because BCRA

potentially be covered by the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We're -- we're talking 

about how far the constitutional ban could go, and we're 

talking about books.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- we would certainly 

take the position that if the labor union used its 

treasury funds to pay an author to produce a book that 

would constitute express advocacy, that that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the book was then taken 

over as a commercial venture by Random House?

 MR. STEWART: The labor union's conduct 

would be prohibited. The question of whether the book 

that had already been --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but prohibition only

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. STEWART: The question whether the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So for the -- for the labor 

union simply to -- to hire -- is there -- is there an 

outright violation when the labor union -- I guess this 

is a statutory question: Is there an outright violation 

when the labor union comes up with the original 

subvention?

MR. STEWART: I guess I would have to study 

the Federal Election Campaign Act provisions more 

closely to see whether they --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume for the sake 

of argument that they would not be. The subvention is 

made, the manuscript is prepared, Random House then 

publishes it, and there is a distribution within the --

what is it -- the 60-day period. Is the -- is the 

original subvention (a) enough to bring it within the 

prohibition on the electioneering communication, and (b) 

is that constitutional?

 MR. STEWART: Well, again, it wouldn't 

qualify as an electioneering communication under BCRA 

because that statutory definition only applies --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're right. I 

stand corrected. If the statute covered that as well, 

if the statute covered the book as well.

 MR. STEWART: I think the use of labor union 

funds, as part of the overall enterprise of writing and 

then publishing the book, would be covered.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be enough to 

bring it in, and --

MR. STEWART: And I -- I don't --

constitutional to forbid the labor union to do that. 

Whether it would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, just to 

follow up, even if there's one clause in one sentence in 

the 600-page book that says, in light of the history of 

the labor movement, you should be careful about 

candidates like John Doe who aren't committed to it?

 MR. STEWART: Well, whether in the context 

of a 600-page book that would be sufficient to make the 

book either an electioneering communication or express 

advocacy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it does by its 

terms, doesn't it? Published within 60 days. It 

mentions a candidate for office. What other 

qualification is there?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think the Court has 

already crossed that bridge in Wisconsin Right to Life 

by saying the statute could constitutionally be applied 

only if it were the functional equivalent of express 

advocacy, and -- so that would be the -- and we accept 

that constitutional holding. That would be the relevant 

constitutional question.

 I wanted to return for a second, Justice 

Alito, to a question you asked about the purported 

interchangeability of the Internet and television. And

it's certainly true that -- that a growing number of 

people are coming to experience those media as 

essentially interchangeable, but there are still a lot 

of people either who don't have computers at all or who 

use their televisions and their computers for 

fundamentally different purposes. And I think it's 

evident that Citizens United perceived the two media to 

be distinct because it was willing to pay $1.2 million 

to a cable service in order to have the film made 

available on -- by Video On Demand, when Citizens United 

could have posted the film on its own Web site, posted 

the film on YouTube and could have avoided both the need 

to make the payment and the potential applicability of 

the electioneering communications provisions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If they had done either of 

the things you just mentioned, putting it on its Web 

site or putting it on YouTube, your position would be 

that the Constitution would permit the prohibition of 

that during the period prior to the primary or the 

election?

 MR. STEWART: Our position is not that the 

Constitution would permit it. Our position is that BCRA 

wouldn't prohibit it because those are not covered 

media. Now --

JUSTICE ALITO: Would the Constitution -- if

in light of advances in the Internet, would the 

Constitution permit that?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, I mean, the Court in 

McConnell upheld on the electioneering communications on 

their face, and this Court -- a majority of this Court 

in Wisconsin Right to Life said those provisions are 

constitutional as applied --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm a little 

disoriented here, Mr. Stewart. We are dealing with a 

constitutional provision, are we not, the one that I 

remember which says Congress shall make no law abridging 

the freedom of the press? That's what we're 

interpreting here?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. STEWART: But, again, this -- the Court 

obviously has grappled in the past with the question of 

how to apply that provision to use of corporate treasury 

funds either for express electoral advocacy or its 

functional equivalent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in this case, Mr. 

Stewart, I take it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that 

you think the distinction the Petitioner draws between 

the 90-minute film and the -- and the short 30-second or

1-minute ad is a baseless distinction?

 MR. STEWART: It is of no constitutional 

significance. Congress certainly could have drafted the 

electioneering communication definition.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if -- if we think that 

the application of this to a 90-minute film is 

unconstitutional, then the whole statute should fall 

under your view --

MR. STEWART: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because there's no 

distinction between the two?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think the Court has 

twice upheld the statute as applied to communications 

that are the functional equivalent of express advocacy. 

So --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm saying if 

we -- if we think that this is -- that this film is 

protected, and you say there's no difference between the 

film and the ad, then the whole statute must be declared 

MR. STEWART: It would depend on the ground 

under which you reached the conclusion that the film was 

protected. If you disagreed with our submission and 

said there is a constitutional difference between 

90-minute films and 60-second advertisements, then

obviously you could draw that constitutional line. If 

you concluded that they're all the same but they're all 

protected, then obviously we would lose both cases. 

But, again, you would have to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want us to say 

they're both the same? You want -- you argue that 

they're both the same.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. Now, it may 

be the case -- it may be rarer to find a 90-minute film 

that is so unrelenting in its praise or criticism of a 

particular candidate that it will be subject to no 

reasonable interpretation other than to vote for or 

against that person, but when you have that, as I think 

we do here, there's no constitutional distinction 

between the 90-minute film and the 60-second 

advertisement.

 And we would stress with respect to the film 

that what makes this, in our view, an easy case is not 

simply that the film repeatedly criticizes Hillary 

Clinton's character and integrity. The clincher is that 

the film repeatedly links Senator Clinton's purported 

character flaws to her qualifications for president.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just from the 

standpoint of literature, that's very odd. Suppose you 

have a film which is quite moving with scenery and music

and magnificent acting, and the subtle message that may 

be far more effective in advocating, and everyone knows 

that. Everyone knows that.

 MR. STEWART: That's essentially the 

argument that a majority of this Court rejected in 

Wisconsin Right to Life. That is, that was part of the 

basis on which Congress enacted BCRA, part of the reason 

that it wanted to establish a purely objective test 

based on naming an identified candidate and airing in 

proximity to the election. Congress recognized that in 

many situations the most effective advocacy is the 

subtler advocacy.

 And the lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to 

Life said -- I think recognized -- that it will 

foreseeably be the case that corporations will craft 

advertisements that are, in fact, intended to influence 

federal elections, but that are sufficiently subtle and 

opaque that they won't constitute the functional 

equivalent of express advocacy. And -- and the lead 

opinion simply said that's the price that we have to pay 

in order to ensure that an unduly broad range of 

corporate speech is not restricted.

 And we accept that holding, but in this case 

what we have, people may feel -- it is not subtle. 

People may feel that because it's not subtle, it's less

likely to be effective. But the Court's decisions have 

never drawn a Constitutional line between advocacy that 

is likely to be effective and advocacy that is not.

 Clearly, if this were express advocacy -- I 

think clearly, if the -- the narrator had said in the 

first 30 seconds of the film: A Hillary Clinton 

presidency would pose a danger to the country, it's 

important for all citizens to vote against Hillary 

Clinton, what follows are extended analyses of episodes 

in her past that reflect Hillary Clinton's unsuitability 

for that office. And if then in the last 89 minutes of 

the film the film-maker had made no overt reference to 

the upcoming election but had simply given a negative 

portrayal of Hillary Clinton, the person, that would be 

express advocacy that would be proscribable even without 

regard to BCRA. So that if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though that 

type of case was never presented to the Court in 

McConnell and was never presented to Congress when it 

considered BCRA?

 MR. STEWART: Well, it's not clear whether 

it was presented to Congress or not. It is certainly 

true that it was not the focus of congressional 

attention. But we know from the definition of 

"electioneering communication" what attributes Congress

wanted to make relevant to the coverage determination. 

That is, it chose to restrict this to broadcast, cable, 

and satellite communications and to leave out the print 

media.

 It chose to restrict it to advertisements or 

other communications that were aired within a specific 

proximity to the election. If it had been unconcerned 

with communications over a certain length, it could 

certainly have made that part of the statutory 

definition, but it chose not to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This film has been 

compared to "Fahrenheit 911," which had the pervasive 

message that President Bush was unsuited to be 

President. And so if that film had been financed out of 

corporate -- corporations' general treasury funds and 

put on an election channel, that would similarly be 

banned by the statute.

 MR. STEWART: I am afraid I am not familiar 

enough with that film to know whether it would have 

constituted -- to -- to make an informed judgment about 

whether that would have constituted the functional 

equivalent of express advocacy under Wisconsin Right to 

Life. And, of course, the "electioneering 

communication" definition would apply only if the film 

had been broadcast within a specified proximity to a

primary or general election in -- in 2004. But I think 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, do you think 

that there's a possibility that the First Amendment 

interest is greater when what the government is trying 

to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say 

something but also a hearer who wants to hear what the 

speaker has to say?

 I mean what is somewhat different about this 

case is that unlike over-the-air television you have a 

situation where you only get this -- this message would 

only air -- if somebody elects to hear it. So you 

really have two interested people, the speaker and the 

listener who wants to -- who wants to get this.

 Isn't that a somewhat heightened First 

Amendment interest than just over-the-air broadcasting 

of advertising which probably most listeners don't want 

to hear?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think -- I think the 

-- first of all, I think if we had tried to make the 

argument in McConnell that the BCRA provisions -- or --

or in any other case that the BCRA provisions are 

constitutional as applied to 30- or 60-second 

advertisements because they are defensible means of 

protecting listeners who, by hypothesis, don't want to

hear the message in the form of a captive audience, I 

don't think we would have gotten very far.

 I think it's certainly true that people have 

a wide variation of attitudes towards campaign 

advertisements. Some of them find them irritating, and, 

of course, they can hit the mute button or -- or leave 

the room, or in the case of people who use TiVo or VCRs 

can simply fast-forward through them.

 But the whole premise of the congressional 

regulation and the whole premise of the corporations' 

willingness to spend these massive amounts of money was 

that enough people will be interested in the 

advertisements that they will ultimately have an 

electoral effect. And -- and so if you compare the--

the film to the advertisement, the advertisements in one 

sense you could say are a less effective mechanism 

because a lot of the people who reach them are unwilling 

listeners or uninterested. But, on the other hand, 

they're more effective because they reach more people.

 The -- the flip side is that with a film you 

reach a smaller audience. It is certainly a more 

limited group of people who will sign up to receive the 

movie, but they are more interested in the message. I 

don't think you can operate on the hypothesis that there 

is no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are talking about 

effectiveness. That wasn't my point. My point was the 

-- the seriousness of the First Amendment interest 

that's being impinged where -- where you have both 

somebody who wants to speak and someone who 

affirmatively wants to hear what he has to say, and the 

government says, no, the two of you can't do this.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think that's 

somewhat worse than the government just saying to 

somebody who wants to speak, no, you can't speak?

 MR. STEWART: I think it would be impossible 

to divide media up in that way based on the relative 

likelihood that the recipient of the message will want 

to hear it. With respect to the -- the newsletters in 

MCFL, for instance, on the one -- in many instances they 

were made available in public places. They were also 

mailed to a variety of people. You could say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I am not saying will --

will want. I mean you have a situation here where you 

don't get it unless you take the initiative to 

subscribe. I'm not -- I'm not trying to figure out 

person by person who wants to hear it and who doesn't. 

Here you have a medium in which somebody listens only if 

that person wants to listen. So the -- the person

speaking wants to speak, and the person hearing wants to

First Amendment interest.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the potential viewers in 

this case had other alternatives if they wanted to see 

the film. The film was available --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was -- was this issue 

aired before the three-judge court, the distinction 

between, say, putting something on network TV and 

putting something on View On Demand that the listener 

has to opt into?

 MR. STEWART: No. Indeed, the appellant in 

its complaint simply alleged affirmatively that his 

communication, if aired on DVD -- I mean if aired on VOD 

would fall within the statutory definition of 

"electioneering communication."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before you 

run out here, can I -- we haven't talked about the 

disclosure requirements yet. You understand the test to 

be that disclosure is not required if the names of those 

disclosed -- if those people would be reasonably subject

disclosure requirements in cases where disclosure would

test? Is it inconceivable to you here that people 

contributing to such a clearly anti-Clinton 

advertisement are not going to be subject to reprisals?

 MR. STEWART: It seems unlikely that 

reprisals would occur because Citizens United -- this is 

obviously a new film, but it is of a piece with 

communications that Citizens United has engaged in.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't work, 

because maybe they are going to change the nature of the 

documentaries that they fund, or somebody who gave a 

contribution 5 years ago may decide, boy, I don't like 

what they're doing. I'm not going to give anymore. It

they've disclosed in the past by compulsion of law 

doesn't seem to answer the question of whether they are 

going to be subject to reprisals.

have disclosed in the past and have provided no evidence 

of reprisals. But I think the Court's decisions are 

clear that the burden is on the organization to show a

reasonable likelihood, at least to -- to set the -- the 

ball in motion. And the three-judge district court here 

said essentially what this Court said in McConnell with 

regard to a variety of plaintiffs who included Citizens 

United. That is, the Court said in McConnell and the 

three-judge district court here that the plaintiffs had 

made vague allegations of the general possibility of 

reprisals but had offered no concrete evidence that 

their own members --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that seems to me 

you are saying they've got to wait until the -- the 

horse is out of the barn. You can only prove that you 

are reasonably subject to reprisals once you've been the 

victim of reprisals.

would be to say that disclosure requirements are 

categorically unconstitutional, which would be an 

extreme departure from this Court's prior precedents or

is, leave it up to the organization to establish 

particularized proof of a reasonable likelihood of 

reprisal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the Boy Scouts 

run an ad and they're subject to disclosure, are the 

donors who support that ad reasonably subject to 

reprisals.

 MR. STEWART: I mean, it would depend to 

some extent on the characteristics of the ad. Probably 

not, but I think if the alternative -- the two 

alternatives to the approach that the Court has taken 

previously would be first to say these requirements are 

unconstitutional across the board; or the Court could 

say as applied to organizations that engage in 

especially intemperate or extreme speech of the sort 

that might seem more likely to subject its proponents to 

reprisal, the disclosure requirements are categorically 

unconstitutional there.

 I think that would be itself an anomalous 

and counterproductive content-based distinction if the 

mere fact of the extremity of your speech insolated you 

from a constitutional -- from a requirement that would 

otherwise be constitutional.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 It is unquestionably the case that the 

government takes the position that any form of 

expression, of expressive advocacy can be prohibited if 

it's done by a corporation. They say that on page 25 

and 26 of their brief, whether it be books, yard signs, 

newspapers or -- or something printed -- in printed 

form, and it's only because Congress decided to address 

the most acute problem that they haven't -- Congress 

didn't go ahead and decide to do that, which we submit 

would raise very, very serious constitutional questions, 

the same type of constitutional questions that we are 

talking about here, and that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you about 

that, but I thought what saves this -- many people 

thought it doesn't save it, it's -- whole thing's 

unconstitutional, whole Act. That isn't what I thought. 

So what saves this is of course you can't prohibit all 

those things. What you do is put limitations on the 

payment for them. See that there are other ways of 

paying through it, say as PACs, and then limit very 

carefully the media that are affected and the times for

which they are affected. Now, that's the statute 

reforms, and it's I think you need to address.

 MR. OLSON: Precisely, and the five justices 

in Wisconsin Right to Life made the fact that the PAC 

mechanism is burdensome and expensive. There are briefs 

in this case that demonstrate how much it is. And the 

-- and it's easier if you have lots of money, if you are 

a big corporation, and you can afford a PAC or you 

already have one. So it's a burden on the least capable 

of communicating.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, can I ask this 

question? Coming up with Wisconsin Right to Life, Judge 

Randolph thought the Chief Justice's opinion in that 

case was controlling in that case. Do you think the 

Chief Justice's opinion in that case correctly stated 

the law?

 MR. OLSON: Of course.

 MR. OLSON: By definition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Good answer.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure because 

you're -- sometimes I don't think you're quite saying 

that. But you agree that that opinion is correct?

 MR. OLSON: What I am saying is I -- we

accept the Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life. 

To the extent that the Court did not get to this type of 

documentary where the issue distinction, the false 

dichotomy between issues and candidates --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you accept the test 

that was stated in his opinion?

 MR. OLSON: The -- the -- that no 

reasonable, not reasonably susceptible to any other 

interpretation? Of course we do, Justice Stevens, but 

we submit, a 90-minute discussion of various different 

issues are subject to all kinds of interpretation, and 

when you get a long exposition of issues that are 

important to the public and someone says -- the 

government says, it's going to be -- well, we can 

prohibit it, and by the way, the government says, well, 

when we mean prohibit we mean, you just can't use your 

union, or corporate treasury funds -- what they mean by 

prohibit is that they will put you in jail if you do it. 

They will put you in jail for five years. That means 

prohibited.

 Now, what -- what we're getting at here, 

when -- when you're trying to make a 90-minute movie 

that discusses things that are important to the public 

during an election of the highest officer of the United 

States, many people will interpret that as critical;

many people will interpret it as supportive; there are 

things all over the lot. So it's subject to lots of 

different interpretations.

 The other thing is I heard Justice -- I mean 

Mr. Stewart say that there's one minute at the 

beginning, it doesn't happen -- it doesn't matter what 

the other 89 minutes are; we can prohibit it. Well, 

where is the person making a movie who wants to address 

the American public about something that's important to 

the American public -- there isn't any question about 

that -- where does he edit his movie? What cuts? What 

does he leave on the drawing -- on the cutting room 

floor so that he won't have to go to bail -- jail? He 

won't dare take a chance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
