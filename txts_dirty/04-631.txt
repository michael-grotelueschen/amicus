 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will now hear 

argument in Wagnon vs. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. 

Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

Kansas imposes a tax on the distributors of 

motor fuel. The legal incidence of that tax is 

explicitly, by statute, imposed on the distributor of the 

first receipt of the fuel. The tax is, thus, imposed and 

collected off-reservation from non-Indians. The who, 

when, and where of the tax is all off-reservation and non-

Indian.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, may I ask you to go 

one step beyond that on an issue of fact that I just don't 

understand from reading the briefs? Let me give you three 

quick quotations.

 First, the court of appeals opinion contains 

this statement, "An expert on behalf of the tribe reported 

that basic economic theory teaches that the nation's 

station cannot charge prices high enough to allow 

collection of both the Kansas and the nation's fuel

taxes."

 The red brief says, on page 8, "It is undisputed 

that enforcing the State tax on fuel sold and delivered to 

the station would effectively nullify the tribal fuel 

tax."

 Finally, the yellow brief, on page 13, says, "By 

selling its fuel at market prices, respondent" -- the 

tribe -- "is making both a profit and collecting a tax."

 My question is, Do we know, from the record, 

whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in 

fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic 

effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass-through, the 

State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at 

market prices?

 MR. OLSON: I had -- I had the same question, 

Justice Souter, as I was looking at this yesterday. And I 

investigated it. And it is my understanding, but I did 

not find this completely in the record, that the 

distributor is, indeed, paying the tax, and that the tribe 

is also collecting a tax. Now, I don't quite understand 

how you reconcile those two points that you've just 

raised. If it's -- if it's something that is economically 

not possible, how can it -- how is it that it's being 

done. Despite the fact that the tenth circuit held the 

tax impermissible, it's my understanding that the

distributor is still paying the tax. Now, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Make it up on volume, I think.

 MR. OLSON: Maybe they make it up on volume. 

Maybe people that are at the casino are willing to pay 

more of the tax. There is a differential between the 

amount of the State tax and the tribe tax. It's only a 

couple of cents, as I understand it. But I think the 

point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if -- if I may interrupt 

you -- if it's getting passed through, and they're still 

selling their gas, then there's no -- then the tribe 

cannot make an argument here that their sovereign taxing 

authority is being compromised or threatened. And the 

argument, basically, would boil down to the argument that 

they want to make a bigger profit.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I agree with that. And I also 

would point out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to impose a higher tax.

 MR. OLSON: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or want to impose a higher tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

 MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

 MR. OLSON: Yeah. And what -- I think that what 

-- what this boils down to -- and I'm skipping ahead of

myself -- is that the tribe would like to be able to 

market a product without having to pay the burdens of 

taxation all the way upstream. There are taxes on the 

distributors' property, there's taxes that are imposed 

when the fuel comes out of the ground and at the refinery 

stage. So, the tribe would like to market a product 

unburdened by any upstream taxation, the cost of doing 

business --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but aren't they going to 

tell us that -- as a practical matter, that the tax is 

really being collected for the retailers? It's just being 

passed on to the retailers, but paid by the -- I take it 

that the distributor -- the way this works -- I, again, 

had problems with effect -- I take it the distributor 

sends out a truck. And if he sends out the truck to the 

tribe, then the distributor just pays the tax, and the 

tribe would want that tax to be -- that fuel to be 

distributed, less the cost of the tax.

 MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if the tribe view 

prevails, then the distributor still sends the truck to 

the stations that are in the State and passes on the tax 

for those --

MR. OLSON: It's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- distributors only. I take

it that's --

MR. OLSON: It's my understanding -- and this is 

explained -- the details of this are explained in Section 

3410 -- I can't give you a citation to the record, but the 

statutes, I'm presuming, are available -- that the 

distributor pays a -- pays a tax as a result of taking the 

fuel down from what they call the rack, and then taking it 

to various service stations --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what event triggers, if 

you will, the incidence of the tax on the distributor? 

MR. OLSON: It's --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it -- is it the obligation 

-- is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas? Is 

it when it is delivered to the distributor?

 MR. OLSON: It's --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or is it later?

 MR. OLSON: The statute explicitly says, Justice 

O'Connor -- this is on page 2 of the petition -- the 

incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the 

first receipt of the motor fuel. And then Section --

that's Section 3408(c) -- Section 3410 then describes, in 

a little bit more detail, the physical operation of the 

reports that the distributor has to make, and the 

distributor has to pay the tax.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So, the distributor gets the

fuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether or 

not it's resold.

 MR. OLSON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't incur it, or gets 

a credit or get it back, if it sells to the United States 

or if it sells out-of-State. In other words, it's not 

just the receipt.

 MR. OLSON: It's -- Justice Ginsburg, it is the 

receipt that triggers the liability for the tax. There is 

a -- an exemption that may be taken in connection with 

sales to the United States, and that's a part of a massive 

quid pro quo operation, where fuel is sold to the United 

States, and the United States pays the State back 

substantially all of the tax that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And out-of-State or abroad --

MR. OLSON: And out-of-State, there is a 

deduction for fuel sold out-of-State. That's logical, 

because the purpose for the tax is to pay for the roads in 

Kansas, and it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then that's the problem, right 

there, because I thought -- first, there is a tax -- you 

get a credit if you don't sell the fuel to anybody. So, I 

don't think it's quite -- if you just sit there with --

MR. OLSON: I don't --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe not --

if you sat on that fuel for the next year --

JUSTICE BREYER: You'd still have to pay tax.

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. OLSON: -- the tax.

distribution --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine.

 MR. OLSON: -- Kansas highways, presumably.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You are Kansas. You sell --

the retailer in Kansas sells it to Nebraska. Nebraska is, 

in a sense, a foreign and independent State. And I guess, 

at some level, the tribes are arguing, "Well, you sell to

us, our local retailer. We, too, are a foreign and 

independent State, even more so. So, if you're going to 

treat them this way -- give the people in Nebraska a 

credit so they don't have to pay -- why don't you treat us 

that way? We drive on Kansas roads sometimes. So do the 

Nebraskans" --

MR. OLSON: Well, sometimes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- -- "sometimes."

 MR. OLSON: The vast --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, they say -- get into 

interest balancing.

 MR. OLSON: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what -- now you have the 

whole argument that I'm thinking of. What do you respond?

 MR. OLSON: Well, one of my responses is that 

the tribe is located entirely within the State. The 

record is clear that most of the fuel purchased at that 

station is used on highways paid for by Kansas. An 

overwhelming majority of the fuel is not used on a 

reservation road; its used on the highways of the State of 

Kansas to get to the casino or to leave the casino. The 

road that's at issue in this case is 1.5 miles long. The 

rest of the driving, according to the record, is on the 

highways of Kansas. So, there's a clear difference there.

 When you sell -- when the distributors market

fuel in Nebraska --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Olson, would it make 

any difference if all of the driving was inside the 

reservation? Would it --

MR. OLSON: No, we would --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- make any difference?

 MR. OLSON: -- we would argue that it would not 

make any difference, Justice Stevens, because this is a 

tax on distributors. It is -- the Legislature of Kansas 

followed the specific advice of this Court in its 

unanimous opinion in the Chickasaw Nation that if there is 

an issue with respect to the tax being imposed on --

arguably burdening the tribe, the State can change the 

legal incidence of the tax. That's a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that has been 

what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court, 

in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence 

on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further. 

That's what it said. When the State levies a tax directly 

on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no 

balancing. But then it also said that if the incidence 

rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here, 

then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in. 

So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule, 

is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the

tribe.

 MR. OLSON: I -- that's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. But the answer is that this is an entirely off-

reservation tax on non-Indians. We're -- we submit that 

there's no balancing necessary in this case unless you're 

going to involve an -- require States to submit to 

litigation and engage in balancing every time an off-

reservation tax on non-Indians has some downstream 

economic effect. But what about the tax on the car that 

brings the casino patron to the reservation? What about 

the tax on the cigarettes or the alcohol or the gambling 

machinery?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Olson, the 

Solicitor General tells us that -- and here we have -- you 

have the statute, but they have the Kaul case that 

suggests that this tax is imposed on the reservation.

 MR. OLSON: But the Kaul case, in the context of 

deciding whether other retailers there had standing, 

basically said that there was an economic impact that 

affected the retailers. The Kaul case specifically 

referred, Mr. Chief Justice, to the fact that the 

legislature had -- and this is on page 67 of the Pacific 

2nd cite of the Kaul opinion -- the legislature amended 

the statute -- this is at the bottom of the second column 

-- or the first column -- to clarify the question where

the incidence of taxation falls. The legislature provided 

that, unless otherwise specified, the incidence of the tax 

falls on the distributor. Then, Mr. Chief Justice, the 

court went on to evaluate the standing question and 

allowed the distributors the -- to raise the issue, 

because the economic burden did come through the 

distributors.

 It's important, in that context, to note that 

the ultimate burden of any of these taxes is not falling 

on the retailer, it's falling on the consumer. It's 

falling on the consumer of the gasoline. The consumer 

puts the gasoline in the car, and then the car is driven 

overwhelmingly -- the facts are unquestionable in this 

case -- overwhelmingly on the highways of the State of 

Kansas. So that the burden -- ultimately, the burden --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but, again, that would 

still be true if the incidence -- the tax was on the 

retailer rather than the wholesaler.

 MR. OLSON: It still would be true. And -- but 

the fact is, in this case you have a -- off-reservation 

tax, on the -- all distributors --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which the statute contemplates 

will be collected when the gas is sold to the -- by the 

retailer.

 MR. OLSON: It -- what the statute specifically

says -- this is Section 3409 -- it says that the 

distributor may pass on -- "may" -- it's a permissive 

provision -- may pass on the cost of the taxation as a 

part of the cost of doing business. And, of course, the 

distributor does that with respect to the cost of its 

vehicles, the cost of other taxes it pays. It may include 

those provisions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But what a strange provision. 

I mean, who would have thought that he couldn't? Why did 

MR. OLSON: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they ever put that provision 

in, unless it means something different from --

MR. OLSON: I think what it means -- I 

understand, Justice Scalia, and I -- because I've had the 

same reaction, "Well, of course he could. Why does he 

need a statute to do that? It is a cost of doing 

business." I think that provision is a part of the effort 

to make clear one of the factors that distinguishes this 

case from the Chickasaw Nation case, where the court found 

that it was significant that the distributor was required 

to pass on the tax, act as a collection agent for the 

retailer, and took a 1.5 percent commission. So, this 

court thought that might be significant. Kansas, in part, 

I think, want to make -- wanted to make it very clear that

the -- what was happening in the economic chain is cost of 

production of gasoline, including tax paid by the 

distributor, could be passed on in the form of cost of 

business to the retailer. 

Now, of course its cost -- it passed on, also, 

to the consumer. The question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what does it 

mean when they say, in law, the "incidence of the taxes on 

the distributor"? Does that mean anything other than that 

he has to pay it?

 MR. OLSON: It is unclear from this court's 

decisions precisely what "legal incidence" means. At 

least it was unclear to me as I was looking through the 

court's decisions. But I think it's a combination of the 

liability for the tax, the responsibility to pay the tax, 

the fact that -- in this case, the retailer has no 

liability for the tax. The only liability for the tax is 

on the distributor. The relationship is between the State 

of Kansas and the distributor. And all of those factors 

together make it clear to me, from this court's previous 

decisions, that "legal incidence" is a term of art, 

especially in the field of taxation. And, as the court 

pointed out in the Chickasaw Nation case, it's important 

to have a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the reason

for my question is, they look back at the court's 

decisions and see that it turns on where the incidence of 

the tax is. And so, there's some bright lawyer in Kansas 

who said, "All we have to do is pass a law saying the 

incidence is -- of the tax is on the distributor, and 

we're going to win." 

MR. OLSON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it suggests that we 

shouldn't give too much weight to that.

 MR. OLSON: Well, the bright lawyer in Kansas 

who may have done that was the Kansas Legislature, 

following the unanimous decision of this court in 

Chickasaw Nation, saying, "If you want to avoid the 

potential problems that would exist, change" -- and it's 

not just the incidence of the tax, it's the legal 

incidence of the tax, it's -- of course, the economic 

burden of taxation is spread out throughout the chain of 

distribution. The legal incidence of the tax, as I read 

this court's opinions, are -- is, it is exactly what it is 

here, the distributor must pay for the tax, the 

distributor must account for the tax, the distributor is 

liable and may be penalized if the tax is not paid. 

Nobody else is liable for it. The distributor has to pay 

the tax even if it doesn't sell the gasoline.

 Here, not only the language is as clear as it

could be -- I mean, the legislature specifically says it 

-- but the operation of the statute -- and the two -- the 

-- twice, the tenth circuit considered this -- the tenth 

circuit decided the legal incidence of the tax was on the 

distributor. The two district courts that decided it 

before those two tenth circuit decisions, decided that the 

legal incidence was on the distributor. The facts support 

that the legal incidence is on the distributor. And 

respondents, on page 16 of the respondent's brief, it 

seems to me, acknowledge precisely that. They, in their 

effort to distinguish the Central Machinery case, which is 

the Indian taxation statutes -- and we're not --

specifically said there, referring to Central Machinery, 

"The State tax was imposed on the sale of merchandise. 

The legal incidence of the tax there, as here, fell on the 

non-Indian seller." So, the respondents have even said 

that, on page 16 of their own brief.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to one factual 

nuance on that? Apart from legal incidence, somebody 

mentioned earlier that the tax would not necessarily be 

payable until, in fact, the gasoline was distributed to 

the retailer. Is that correct?

 MR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. I may 

be wrong. But, as I read Section 3410, the distributor 

must file monthly reports with the State describing the

amount of tax it's drawn down at the rack when it takes 

the -- unloads fuel into its trucks. And it's responsible 

monthly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that a surrogate for 

sale to the -- well, I guess what I'm getting at, the tax 

apparently is not payable when the distributor receives 

the fuel, but only when the distributor transfers the fuel 

to a retailer.

 MR. OLSON: No. I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No?

 MR. OLSON: That's not my understanding. The --

it is not -- the incidence -- or the occasion for the 

payment of the tax isn't a sale to a retailer. You'd have 

-- I can imagine the practicalities of that would drive 

everybody crazy. The distributor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why would he be drawing 

it down, except to sell --

MR. OLSON: Well, of course -- of course, the 

distributor is drawing it down to sell fuel to gasoline 

stations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.

 MR. OLSON: It may -- there may be some storage 

involved, there may be other occasions. But the fact is 

that the distributor files a monthly report describing how 

much fuel is -- it receives.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, in terms of the 

text of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the 

distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this 

language -- and it appears in a few places -- "the tax is 

hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery." What does 

-- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the 

use, sale, or delivery?"

 MR. OLSON: Well, this is -- this is an effort 

by the legislature to say that fuel, which is going to be 

used in Kansas, by and large -- there's always going to be 

exceptions -- fuel that is used, by and large, in Kansas 

on the roads of Kansas, shall be subject to a tax so that 

those roads can be built and maintained. Now, how shall 

we, mechanically, impose and collect that tax? We will do 

it on the first receipt by the distributor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean, Mr. Olson, 

that the tax that the -- the fuel, rather, that's sold to 

the United States Government, later, out-of-State, when is 

the credit for the sales out-of-State made? Is that made 

at the time of the initial delivery, or is -- do they ask 

for a refund a month later?

 MR. OLSON: I don't know the answer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I couldn't tell from the --

MR. OLSON: I don't know the answer to that, 

Justice --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that might be a 

way of identifying whether the term "legal incidence" 

really has any significance.

 MR. OLSON: Well, I would say that the -- that 

if the -- this Court's prior decisions have any consistent 

meaning, that the person who has the obligation to pay the 

tax, and who might claim some credits or deductions, like 

we all do when we file our tax returns, the legal 

incidence of the tax is on us, as taxpayers. The taxpayer 

here is the distributor. The statute says so. The way 

the statute works --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I, sort of, take "legal 

incidence" to mean the duty to pay the tax. And I'm just 

wondering whether -- when fuel is sold to a distributor 

that the -- I mean, the distributor knows the fuel is 

going to be resold to the United States -- does he have an 

exemption from the tax, because he knows what's going to 

happen to it, or does he have to pay the tax, or accept 

the obligation to pay the tax, and then --

MR. OLSON: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- subtract, later on?

 MR. OLSON: -- I think, but I can't represent to 

you know that I know for sure, that that is an accounting 

process that takes place. Because these are transactions 

-- thousands of transactions that are taking place all of

the time. Kansas also has a practical reason for imposing 

this tax on the distributors. There are X number of 

distributors. You can imagine how many times X there 

might be retailers and how many different disputes and so 

forth.

 The point -- one of the points that this Court 

has repeated made in connection with tax cases, and inter-

sovereign immunity issues with respect to tax cases, is 

vitally important that there be certainty, predictability, 

and some understanding of fixed events with respect to 

taxation. States can't be engaged in litigation 

constantly, depending upon how many casino customers were 

here, how many people bought this gasoline, how many 

people bought that gasoline the next month, and how much 

did the tribe charge for the gasoline on its reservation. 

That kind of balancing process makes no sense whatsoever, 

and it -- and it sentences the States to litigation, and 

this Court to repeated decisions, based upon specific 

facts. That's why, we submit, that although the balancing 

is overwhelmingly in favor of the State, because it's a 

tax for gas that will enable someone to drive on roads 

that the State has to pay for, that, in this situation, 

one balancing test makes little sense. It simply invites 

litigation --

either, in the briefs. It's -- the Kansas -- it's the --

it's in the Kansas statutes, of course, but I couldn't 

find it set out verbatim in the -- in the briefs. I 

suspect it's in there someplace, but I couldn't find it 

when I was looking.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I couldn't either.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- could we go back --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- excuse me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to the question that 

Justice Souter raised at the outset? Because I'm really 

puzzled. This is the picture I have of the case. And 

please tell me where it's wrong.

 Two jurisdictions, both with authority to impose 

a tax, the State and the tribe. So, if the other weren't 

taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can 

tax and the State can tax. But the two can't coexist, 

because the consumer's not going to pay the price. So, 

only one can. And the issue is, which one dominates, and 

which is one is subordinate? But you have unquestionable 

authority to tax in both. And I thought it was clear that

the two taxes did -- this is not a case where the tribe 

can impose a tax, the State can im- -- oppose. I read the 

briefs to accept that the tribe tax -- couldn't put its 

tax on top of the State tax.

 MR. OLSON: The -- it's a matter of economics, 

Justice Ginsburg, just as your question suggests. The 

tribe would not -- would like to be able to market tax-

free fuel at its non-regulated casino. It would --

probably would like -- and if this case is decided against 

the State, it would probably not like to pay the tax on 

the -- on the car that brings the patron --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not tax-free. I mean, 

the -- a big thing that was made in this case was that, 

unlike the cigarette sales in the smoke shops, the tribe 

is not trying to market a tax exemption. It is putting on 

its own tax, which will cost the customer, in the end, the 

same as if there had been a State tax.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it wouldn't have to use a tax 

to do that. It owns the station. It would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who is it taxing? Is it taxing 

itself?

 MR. OLSON: It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the tribe sells the gas

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't it?

 MR. OLSON: -- precisely the point, that the 

tribe would probably not like to pay the taxes that are 

paid by the distributor or the refiner or the person that 

brings the fuel -- the petroleum product out of the 

ground. What it -- what it simply means is, the margin 

between the cost and the sale, that's what the tribe would 

like. It's perfectly understandable. But it would like 

to have that and -- that tax -- and I'd like to save the 

balance of my time for rebuttal -- but that tax is 

overwhelmingly used on the roads of Kansas -- overwhelming 

used on the roads of Kansas -- which are paid for, built, 

and maintained with the revenue produced by that taxation. 

That's what it's for.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Olson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN HEATH GERSHENGORN

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In the tribe's view, the State's defense of its 

tax today depends on a tax that does not exist. Two 

distinct sovereigns have imposed fuel taxes here. The 

Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation has imposed a tribal tax on 

a tribal station operating on tribal trust land.

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the taxation?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- the record is clear that 

the two taxes cannot coexist in the long run, because it

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if the tribe is collecting 

-- it's assuming that -- if the tribe is collecting its 

tax, and it does not have a claim to greater taxation or 

greater profit, then how is its sovereign right as a 

taxing authority being interfered with?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the tribe is being 

forced right now to subsidize the sales at the station at 

a loss, which it's doing for the balance of this 

litigation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- I mean, isn't 

that necessarily the case? If it's collecting all of its 

tax, then what it's complaining about is that it's getting 

less profit as the -- as the retailer.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, that's correct, at 

the moment --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then is that an 

issue that we should consider on a question of preemption 

which arises from the tribe's assertion of sovereignty?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think it is, Your Honor, 

because the tribe should not be put to the choice, as a 

sovereign, where it's running a tribal business, of 

choosing between -- of generating revenues by the tax 

versus generating revenues by the profit. There is no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in other words --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- suggestion, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- should we, in effect, say 

there is no distinction between the tribe's position as 

sovereign and the tribe's position as retail gasoline-

seller.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think, in that 

situation, that the two are very similar, in the same way 

when a State sells at a State liquor store --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they're similar, because 

it -- ultimately, it's all going into the same pocket. We

realize that. But, unless there is a claim that its 

taxing authority, as such, is being threatened or 

interfered with, I don't quite see why a preemption theory 

that rests upon tribal sovereignty has any place in the 

analysis.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, the -- it 

is exactly the tribal taxing authority that interfered. 

It's a -- it's quite a strange form of taxing authority 

that says you can tax the -- you can tax the station, but 

then -- but then essentially have to operate the station 

at a loss. That's not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not operating at a 

loss.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's strange about it? I 

mean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the 

price of goods and services. And it's harder to retail 

them, because they cost more. So, that's true of every 

single good sold on the reservation. So I take it your 

claim must -- and, of course, it may or may not be true

principle, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any 

upstream taxes on.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor --


JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that so?


 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because that does not describe


the tax that's at issue here. The tax at issue here is 

imposed on the sale or delivery of fuel to the tribe on 

the reservation, and that is plain --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, isn't it -- but they 

say no, that it's imposed on the delivery to the 

distributor --

MR. GERSHENGORN: And --


JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of fuel.


 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- and that, Your Honor, is


not correct. What they have done is conflate two

I don't think it is what the statute says. The statute 

says, in 3408, "a tax per gallon is hereby imposed on the 

use, sale, or delivery of fuel." It does not say "the 

receipt of fuel." "The distributor" is defined as 

somebody who receives and uses, sells, or delivers fuel. 

All of the critical exemptions in the statutes are based 

on the distributor's subsequent sale or delivery of fuel 

to the United States, out-of-State, the Federal contract 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's just a 

subsequent deduction. I mean, if we get income, we're 

taxed on it. If we make a charitable contribution, we get 

a deduction. But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay 

and are subject to the income tax.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, this would be a 

very different case if the State had -- if the legislature 

had passed a tax that said, "This is a tax on receipt," 

and we were trying to argue that these -- that somehow 

these exemptions made it not a tax on receipt. But the 

legislature has said it is a tax on the "use, sale, or 

delivery." And if I could point to two provisions that I 

think make this crystal clear, that it is not a tax on 

receipt, but on the subsequent use, sale, or delivery.

 The first is 3417, which provides --

 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- at 10(a) in the appendix,


has received the fuel, if he subsequently loses the fuel 

-- has it lost or burned -- gets a refund of the tax, if 

it's -- if that happens before he uses, sells, or 

delivers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that --

MR. GERSHENGORN: The other thing that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- works with the income 

tax, too. You have casualty losses and things like that. 

It turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't 

have to pay it, because you get a deduction. But that 

doesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, there are -- there 

is literally nothing in the statute except for the 

incidence provision, which is what the State relies on, 

that makes this a tax on receipt. And, if I could, in 

Central --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we ought to know, because 

they've been -- haven't they had this for a while? So, 

there must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the 

reservation -- he's a distributor -- somebody delivered to 

him a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his

that you're -- that he would pay the tax in that instance

is wrong -- if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever --

Exxon or somebody -- and he puts it in the tank, and he 

hasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would 

seem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not 

the sale on his distribution to somebody else. Now, why 

is that wrong?

fuel and holds it, he's not a distributor under the 

statute. A distributor is somebody who receives and uses, 

sells, or delivers. That's in -- on page 2(a) of the red 

brief, Your Honor. So that --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, now you're telling me 

something different from what I understood. I thought you 

said it probably has happened in the history of this tax 

MR. GERSHENGORN: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that a distributor picked up

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I think we can decide it on 

the basis that we know that when the distributor puts --

delivers gas to the gas station, it's not instantly sold. 

I mean, even we know that.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: No, Your Honor -- that's 

correct, Your Honor. But the statute provides that the 

tax is on the sale by the distributor to the tribe on its 

reservation. It is exactly like what happened in Central 

Machinery. In Central Machinery, the incidence of the tax 

was indisputably on the off-reservation seller. This 

Court, nevertheless, said, correctly, that the taxable 

event, the thing that was being taxed, was the sale of 

tractors to the tribe on the reservation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the statute says 

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- that was, therefore, 

preempted.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the statute says it's 

a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the 

first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and 

that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: With respect, Your Honor, what 

part (c) says, which is what you're reading from, it says, 

"the incidence of the tax is imposed on the distributor of 

first receipt." That is the "who." That is not the

"what." The "what" is in -- is in 79-3408(a), and it is 

clearly imposed on the use, sale, or delivery of the fuel.

 If I could, another provision of the statute 

that also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But nobody -- but it's 

not sold -- it's not taxed twice. If it's sold to a 

distributor, that distributor has to pay the tax. The 

distributor then sells it to someone else. That someone 

else doesn't have to pay the tax.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: That's right, Your Honor. But 

the question is, What exactly is the State purporting to 

tax? This is a situation in which the State is not being 

unambiguous -- is being unambiguous about what it's 

taxing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what -- perhaps the 

State expresses it that way just to cover some people who 

get their gas illegally, and they would say the tax is 

still due, even if you haven't gotten your gas from a 

distributor who has paid the State tax. Wouldn't that 

suffice for why the court imposes the tax on the use, 

sale, or delivery? Use, sale, or delivery.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think the term 

"use" is the distributor's use. The scheme that Kansas 

has set up is a sensible one. It is, the distributor gets 

the tax and then has three choices. It can use it, sell

it, or deliver it. And if the distributor -- if the 

distributor is -- hasn't done one of those things, then 

it's -- then it -- then the distributor can be made liable 

for any tax increases that have -- that happen while the 

distributor is holding the tax. And so, in our view, and 

in every court that we're aware of's view -- tenth circuit 

didn't decide this case on the assumption that this was a 

tax on receipt of fuel off the reservation. What the 

tenth circuit said was that Kansas is now attempting to 

collect its tax for the first time, a tax on motor fuel 

distributed to Indian lands. It is, again, the same thing 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose you're 

right. Can you answer my first question? Can you even 

remember it? I'll summarize. On your assumption. Look, 

the Indians, if there is a tax -- they have a retail shop 

or they have things on the reservation, they go buy them 

-- Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the 

reservation. We go through the balance. But they 

certainly could impose a tax on the department store in 

Kansas City, couldn't they?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the Indian then goes to 

the department store and buys it. He has to pay the tax, 

doesn't he?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now what he does, he 

says, "Call up and" -- he says, "Please deliver it." Now 

he doesn't have to pay the tax?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, the answer is: 

that's correct, and that's exactly what happens in the 

commerce clause when a person from Virginia buys something 

from Illinois and has it delivered to himself in Virginia. 

They don't pay the sales tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is the commerce 

constitutionally --

MR. GERSHENGORN: No, Your Honor, under 

interstate sales tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well --

MR. GERSHENGORN: It's the same situation --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- we're now talking Federal 

rules. Go ahead.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry. It was -- it's the 

same situation there. The question is, Where does the 

relevant sale take place? And it takes place -- in the 

Virginia/Illinois situation, the sale takes place in 

Virginia, which is why you don't pay Illinois sales tax, 

though you may pay Virginia use tax. It would be the same 

thing in the tribal situation. The sale in that place, 

just like the sale in Central Machinery, takes place on

the reservation. And what this Court said, in Central 

Machinery, is that a sale to a tribe of goods on the 

reservation is -- cannot be taxed by the State. And, 

indeed, because this tax is on the sale on the 

reservation, the broader balancing principles apply. The 

tribe here has imposed the -- its tax on a tribal station, 

on a tribal land, right where this Court has said its 

tribal taxing authority is strongest, and has dedicated 

those revenues to improving the miles of dirt and gravel 

road on the reservation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it relevant --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you what the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the balancing test --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- may I ask you a question 

about the Federal exemption? In your view, is that made 

available at the time of the initial purchase by the 

distributor, or does he have to, in effect, claim a credit 

later on?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: It -- that way it works, in 

practice, Your Honor, is -- and their form is in the back 

of the red brief -- is that the distributor writes down 

the number of gallons received, and writes down the number 

of gallons sold to the United States, nets that out, and 

pays the tax on the net, so that it's -- it's essentially 

done at the -- at the same time.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that he -- his obligation

purchase.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm not sure his obligation to 

do so, but the form is due on the 25th of the month -- of 

the next month. And so --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it shows both what they 

resell to the United States and what they acquired.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Correct, Your Honor. It shows 

gallons received, gallons exported, gallons sold to the 

United States.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And let me ask you this 

question, too, on that subject. Do you think that the 

exemption that the State allows for resales to the United 

States is constitutionally compelled?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think the answer 

to that is yes, under our theory of the case, but no, 

under their theory of the case. The exemption to the 

United States --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's no under our --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- is constitutionally --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- our precedent, I think, 

isn't it?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's no, under our precedent.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Well, it depends, Your Honor, 

on whether the legal incidence is on the United States or 

whether the incidence is on the seller. Under this --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, on that --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- Court's precedence --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- on the legal incidence of 

the tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that 

a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence 

would be dispositive. So, why don't we read the statute 

and say the incidence is on the distributor, and that's 

the end of it?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because, Your Honor, I don't 

think that's what this Court's cases say. I think what 

this Court's --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I thought that's --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- cases say --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- what we suggested in 

Chickasaw Nation.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Chickasaw said when the tax 

was imposed on the tribe, we would take the State at its 

word. It said it's taxing the tribe. If the State put 

the tax on a non-Indian, then there would be balancing. 

And that's what Chickasaw --

MR. GERSHENGORN: That's my understanding, as

well. And this Court has always held it's a Federal 

question where legal incidence lies, and has not deferred 

-- has given --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if balancing --

MR. GERSHENGORN: But if I --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- then how do you come out? 

Because what they're saying is, "Okay, balance. Fine. 

You want to balance? Here's how you balance."

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor?

 JUSTICE BREYER: On the one hand, the Indians 

have to pay the tax. Okay, that's true. And it's harder 

for them to impose their own tax. That's true of every 

upstream tax. And it goes for roads that they use all the 

time. And they just have a one-and-a-half mile -- and why 

shouldn't they be treated every -- like everybody else, 

when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for? So, 

the balancing works in their favor. Now, what's your 

response?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: That the -- Your Honor, we 

disagree with that at every level. This -- the tribal tax 

is addressed to a specific road -- road problem that the 

Federal Government has identified and addressed in the 

Reservation Road Program. The reservation roads are in 

abysmal shape, as the Federal Government has recognized. 

More than 70 percent are in poor shape, poor condition.

The fatality rate is four times the national average. And 

the tribe is using those revenues to fix -- advance that 

particular Federal interest, which is reflected in Federal 

statutes and in the Federal regulatory scheme.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should all of that make a 

difference? You make a big point in the briefing, "Well, 

you're not marketing the exemption, you're taxing, you're 

using" -- if the -- if the tribe does have the sovereign 

right to tax or not to tax, why can't it use it not to tax 

at all and say, "We're giving" -- why is there a 

presumption in favor of imposing taxes? Why can't the 

tribe say, "We're not going to tax you if you come to the 

reservation. Come on in and buy our gas. No tax"?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: This --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't -- why isn't that 

part of the tribal sovereign right?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Because this Court has held, 

in Colville -- and we don't dispute here -- that when the 

tribe is marketing an exemption, it has no -- it has no --

there are no Federal and tribal interests implicated. And 

we're not challenging that here. What this Court has said 

is that when a tribe is generating real value on the 

reservation so that it has created a market, as this tribe 

has, to draw people onto the reservation and can sell its 

fuel at market value, it has a sovereign right and

interest in taxing that -- in imposing a tax that the 

State can't interfere with. And the State here has 

accommodated --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who is -- who is the tribe 

taxing? Is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas? Is 

that --

MR. GERSHENGORN: No, it taxes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- the retailer. It taxes the 

retailer, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the retailer was the 

tribe.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: It is. It taxes the tribal 

station.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's taxing itself.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: It is, Your Honor, but that 

tax is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's real neat. I have never 

heard of that before.

 [Laughter.] 

MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, actually, it 

happens all the time. Pennsylvania imposes a tax on 

State-sold liquor. North Carolina does it. All the 

State-run liquor stores are subject to a State-imposed 

tax. But --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, did I 

understand your earlier discussion, about the department 

store, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck, 

and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back, 

that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even 

though the economic incidence and effect is going to be 

the same?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, at that point, 

Central Machinery wouldn't apply. I think that would be a 

closer case for the balancing, in that situation. The --

so, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't concede that. But, in this 

case, it's much stronger, because the tax is on the 

reservation. 

If I could also just point to one thing that 

Justice Breyer raised about the -- about the exemptions 

for other States. What this -- what Kansas has done is 

provide an exemption for every other sovereign that's 

implicated -- for other States, for other countries, for 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it --

MR. GERSHENGORN: -- the United States --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- constitutionally compelled 

to do so?

 MR. GERSHENGORN: It's -- it is, Your Honor, in 

this sense. It comes in, in two situations. First, it is

-- the Constitution and the Federal preemption doctrine 

prohibit discrimination. And so, it is, in that sense. 

But it also goes to the strength of the State interest 

here. The State has not only -- has accommodated the out-

of-State interest, it has also accommodated the in-State 

Government interests, other than the tribe. It gives 30 

to 40 percent of the fuel revenues to counties and to 

cities for roads. Every other sovereign is accommodated 

here except for the tribe, and we think that's exactly 

what Federal law prohibits and why the strength of the 

tribal interest here, and the tribe's interest in imposing 

the tax to fix reservation roads, to advance that Federal 

interest, is exactly what deserves protection.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Cities and counties --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- aren't sovereign.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- your claim wouldn't 

disappear if they decided to tax all these other 

sovereigns.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your claim, as a tribe, would 

not disappear if they decided to become nondiscriminatory 

and tax all of the sales.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, it wouldn't 

disappear, but it might alter the -- it would alter the

balance. If the -- what is troubling here is that the 

State has asserted a right in predictability, but the 

State's right in predictability is only coming at the 

expense of a refusal to accommodate the tribal interests 

in the say way it accommodates every other sovereign. And 

so, we do think that that goes to the strength of the 

State's interest here, and to the State -- the strength of 

the -- of the State's assertion of its tax.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your view generally was 

that it was -- that it was indicative of discrimination.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: I think it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And I thought that was the 

stronger argument, because the -- you're saying, "Look, 

the State has only the most trivial interest in the amount 

of taxation it would get here." That would be equally 

true whether it forgives taxes that -- on fuel that goes 

to the United States or not. But the discrimination 

point, if it's a fair one, would be the same.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, I think -- that's 

correct, and we've made both arguments, that it's a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it would matter.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: -- that the discrimination is 

a freestanding reason that, even under an express 

preemption test like the State has articulated, we would 

prevail and that --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All the other sovereigns you 

mentioned do not consume the gas -- or the gas sold to 

them is not consumed primarily on the roads of this State, 

except for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns. 

I mean, they simply aren't sovereign. That's the State, 

itself. They're subdivisions of the State. So, it's 

making exemptions for its own -- its own State, plus 

exemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those 

sovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the 

roads of this State. 

MR. GERSHENGORN: Your Honor, there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes perfect sense. I 

don't see there's any discrimination.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The tribe here has imposed a tribal tax on sales 

at a tribal business on the tribe's own reservation on 

tribal land. The exercise of that power of taxation is at 

the core of tribal sovereignty, as this Court has long 

recognized, and that power --

would point the Court to page 142 of the joint appendix, 

or page 12 of the petition appendix, in which the Court 

discusses the expert opinion that the tribe introduced 

into the record.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that expert opinion is 

that, as an economic matter, you can't collect both.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, he says --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't impose both. But the 

tribe is still imposing its tax, and it's getting every 

penny that it -- that it purports to impose.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But it is operating at a loss. 

As I understand it, the tribe has chosen to subsidize --

that is true. What difference does that make to an 

analysis based on a preemption theory which is supposed to

take account of tribal sovereignty? The sovereign act is 

not selling gas, it's taxing. They are taxing. They're 

getting everything they want under their tax statute. 

Where, then, is there a basis for a preemption --

MR. KNEEDLER: I think, for example, in this 

Court's decision in Colville, where the Court stressed 

there that the Court was marketing an exemption from State 

taxation; that portion of the analysis of the Court there 

did not turn on whether the tribe was imposing its own 

tax. It turned --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I mean, it was --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- it turned on economic --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an entirely separate -- an 

entirely separate rationale. It was saying the tribe is 

getting this tremendous advantage by -- or wants this 

tremendous advantage -- by marketing the exemption.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But the flip side of that in 

Colville was that if the -- if the tribe, in that case, 

had been selling to people who would have been on the 

reservation anyway -- in other words had not come onto the 

reservation to take -- just to take advantage of an 

exemption from State taxation -- but would have been on 

the reservation anyway, the Court specifically 

contemplated, in that situation, that the tax might well 

be preempted, because it would be interfering --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe -- maybe it 

contemplated that, and maybe it simply contemplated that 

that particular -- that particular argument against it --

i.e., that it was simply selling a tax exemption -- would 

not have been an argument against it. But it doesn't 

follow, from that, that the tribe would necessarily have 

had a winning argument on a preemption theory.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but we -- but we believe it 

is a winning argument. I think the fair reading of 

Colville is that the Court would have seen that as quite 

different.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if that's a winning -- of 

course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in 

fact, it's an interference -- look, every upstream tax 

raises the price of goods and services. Every upstream 

tax -- indeed, every tax in the world -- makes it harder 

to sell the product. So, every tax makes it harder for 

the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody 

else. Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an 

interference, then every tax is an interference. And I 

don't see how that could be.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. This is -- this is not 

just any upstream tax, and it -- and the theory here is 

not based on economic impact.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But, so far, your theory is

based on economics, as I've heard it.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if it isn't, I would like 

to know what it is.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Under the -- first of all, 

in our -- it is our position that, under the Kansas 

Supreme Court's decision in Kaul, which should get 

deference in terms of understanding operative incidence of 

the State tax. The incidence of the tax is, in fact, on 

the retailer. And the court there found it critical --

JUSTICE BREYER: The incidence of the tax --

MR. KNEEDLER: The legal incidence --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh.

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- was -- is on the retail --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's very surprising. When I 

read the statute, it doesn't have one word about the 

retailer being obliged to pay --

MR. KNEEDLER: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- anything.

 MR. KNEEDLER: As we read the Kansas Supreme 

Court's decision, it's not without ambiguity, but we 

believe the better reading of that -- of that decision is 

that, as a matter of legislative intent, the incidence of 

the tax, who is ultimately going to pay the tax --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's --

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- is on the retailer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- the legal incidence of the 

tax, I would think their side would win, in my mind. Now 

suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not 

on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That would tell -- that would 

tell you -- I'm sorry --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, and if we get 

into balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in 

favor of the Indian side? It sounded to me as if it's 

harder for them to tax. So, I'm thinking, well, that's 

true of every tax. And then, put it on something else. 

Put it on the tires. Put it on anything else, if you can. 

It'll be harder for them to tax non-Indians. But I didn't 

know they had a Federal right to tax the non-Indians.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, they do. And, again, this 

is the situation contemplated in Colville. It's analogous 

to what this Court said in Cabazon with respect to the 

gambling facility, where the tribe has introduced on-

reservation value. And in Colville, the court 

contemplated if the tribe puts a service station and sells 

to people who would be there anyway, that is on-

reservation value; they are not simply marketing a tax 

exemption and drawing people in by virtue of a tax 

exemption.

 But, beyond that, just because -- if the Court 

concludes that the incidence of the tax is on the 

distributor, notwithstanding the Kansas Supreme Court's 

decision, the subject matter of the tax, the "what is 

being taxed," is the sale or distribution, and that is a 

sale between the distributor and the retailer. That is 

clearly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't it the 

sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and 

the distributor?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- because if you look in -- it 

becomes particularly clear if you look at the form that is 

at the back of the respondent's brief, but we also believe 

it's clear from the -- from the provisions of the statute 

that are on page 8(a) of the brief. One that hasn't been 

discussed, for example, is exemption D5 -- excuse me --

the exception for deliveries to other distributors. In 

that -- in that situation, there is no tax. And, in fact, 

the form, on page 19(a), makes it clear that any sales by 

one distributor to another are automatically exempted and 

not counted in the computation at all.

 So, distributor-to-distributor taxes are 

exempted. And this Court, in the Chickasaw case, said 

that's very instructive, that the incidence of the tax is 

on the retailer. Whether or not the incidence is there,

the transaction --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me exempting 

distributor-to-distributor taxes just means that only one 

distributor has to pay.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Only one distributor has to pay, 

but it means that a sale between the first distributor and 

the second distributor, for example, is not taxed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's because there 

was a tax on the first sale to the first distributor. And 

may I ask this? Supposing --

MR. KNEEDLER: Actually, there is not. The tax 

is on the last distributor, with respect to his sale to 

the -- to the retailer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but that's because when a 

distributor sells to another distributor, he is not 

acting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you sell to another 

distributor, you're not being --

MR. KNEEDLER: That makes -- that makes my 

point, that the -- that the statute, in applying to any 

use, delivery, or sale, the sale at issue is the sale that 

ultimately comes from a distributor to a retailer. And, 

under this Court's decisions in Central Arizona Machinery 

and the Bracker case, a sale by a -- by someone residing

off the reservation, but where the sale takes place on the 

reservation, as this one clearly does -- the gasoline 

that's delivered there -- that is absolutely preempted 

under Central Arizona Machinery and the Indian Trader 

Statutes, because you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But none of this -- none 

of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it? I 

mean, they didn't care where the incidence was. They just 

went right into the balancing, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right, that's true. And if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think that was 

wrong.

 MR. KNEEDLER: We think the court was wrong to 

conclude that the incidence was on the -- was on the 

distributor. And if the Court has a question about that, 

it could remand to certify that question to the Kansas 

Supreme Court to clear it up, any ambiguity after Kaul. 

But, even on the tenth circuit's own way of approaching 

it, we believe that it was then correct, because it 

properly applied this Court's approach of looking at the 

particular context of the Federal, State, and tribal 

interests. And here, there are very powerful tribal 

interests in maintaining --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is the one other -- the 

interest other than the interest on being able to tax an

item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because

MR. KNEEDLER: It is the very same --

there other ones?

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- it's the very same interest 

that the State is asserting, which is the interest to 

impose a fuel tax in order to --

I just want to be sure I get them all. One is -- one is 

that one.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Is this --


JUSTICE BREYER: What else?


 MR. KNEEDLER: -- is the general -- the general


ability to impose a tax. But here, the interest is 

augmented by the fact that the tax is dedicated by tribal 

law to maintaining tribal roads, not just this one-and-a-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why does the balancing only 

work if it taxes?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We don't think it does. Under 

the Colville's decision, if the State is not just -- or 

the tribe is not just marketing an exemption from State 

taxation, we think that the tribe -- that the State tax is 

preempted there, as well. But here, where the tribe is 

asserting not simply a commercial interest, selling at 

market value and not marketing a tax exemption of States 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. You say that it 

could --

market its exemption?

tribe cannot market an exemption, at least to people who 

would not otherwise be on the reservation. But here, the 

tribe is asserting both a commercial interest -- selling 

at profit; and also a sovereign interest -- in taxing. 

And where you have a tribe asserting both --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't that sovereign 

interest in not taxing?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It could. But here, the tribe 

has asserted a sovereign interest in its tax, and that is 

what is being substantially interfered with.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE OLSON

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the Supreme Court's 

characterization of this as being --

MR. OLSON: The Kaul --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. OLSON: -- Kaul case? I read -- I don't 

think the Kansas Supreme Court could have been any more 

clear. It said the legislature amended the legislation to 

clarify where the incidence of taxation falls. It 

provided that the incidence of the tax falls on the

distributor. Then, in Victa, in connection with the 

standing issue, because economic burden fell on the 

retailers, it found that the retailers and -- those other 

retailers had standing.

 Kansas could not have been more clear. In 

Section 3401(f)(3), it defines a "distributor" as someone 

who receives the product. In 3408(c), it's -- taxes the 

distributor on the first receipt of the tax. In 3410, it 

again says it's on the distributor. Two district courts 

and two courts of appeals found that the legal incidence 

of the tax was on the distributor. The Kansas Supreme 

Court said the same thing, the distributor is liable for 

the tax, pays the tax. The retailer has no liability for 

the tax. What in the world can Kansas do to make it 

clearer?

 Now, the Central Machinery case that's -- that 

my opponents have been speaking about is a case that was 

decided under the Indian Trader Statutes with respect to 

the trading with the Indians, with respect to Central 

Machinery case, was -- over tractors sold on the 

reservation for use on the reservation. It fell within 

the scope of the Indian Trader Statute. But this Court 

has made clear, in a number of cases, the Indian Trader 

Statutes would not remotely apply.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it Kansas has not

indicted the distributor for failing to register under the 

Indian Trading Statute.

 MR. OLSON: No, they're -- it hasn't really been 

mentioned until the -- I mean, hardly mentioned at all, 

until the Government decided to -- the United States 

Government decided to discuss that point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there usually two 

incidents? You talk about the incident of the taxes on a 

person, but it's also on an event. And what event is --

in your -- in your judgment is --

MR. OLSON: Well, the statute could not be more 

clear, Justice Scalia. It is the receipt by the 

distributor of the fuel. That is what the statute says. 

It is as plain --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if the fuel --

MR. OLSON: -- as it could be.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- were destroyed by flood or 

lightning or something like -- before it was resold to the 

retailer, there would be no tax --

MR. OLSON: There's an exemption for losses like 

-- one of the Court's questions with respect to a casualty 

loss or something that -- but it's limited. The 

liability, nonetheless, exists on the distributor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any incidents in 

which the distributor would pay the tax if he was not able

to resell it to somebody else?

 MR. OLSON: I think that -- I think the reading 

of the statute is plain. If the distributor took the 

fuel, kept it, decided to warehouse it because the costs 

are going up or something like that, it would still have 

to pay the tax, because the tax is on the receipt by the 

distributor. 

In answer to your question, Justice Stevens, 

Would those other exemptions, the United States Government 

be required by the Constitution, or the other States? No, 

not under this Court's decision in the Blaze case, which, 

as I understood it, was unanimous. The Fresno case, U.S. 

vs. New Mexico, it's not a tax on the United States. It's 

-- or an agency of the United States. So they wouldn't be 

required. But they make sense, because the sales to other 

States are for people that drive on other States' 

highways. The sales to the United States Government is an 

exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes 

back. So, there's a rational purpose. It's not 

discrimination.

 The tribe makes the point that it's generating 

real value and reservation value. This is fuel that's 

used in cars that are -- drive all over the State of 

Kansas. The casino is there, so people come to the 

casino. And, under Cabazon, there might be some value

added by the casino, which, by the way, is an exempt value 

created by an exemption from regulation. But the value 

for someone who puts fuel in their car is so that that car 

will then drive. And that -- cars that drive, in this 

case, drive on Kansas highways.

 This, ultimately is --
