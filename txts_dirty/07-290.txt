3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia 

versus Heller.
 

6  Mr. Dellinger.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 

9  MR. DELLINGER: Good morning, Mr. Chief
 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

11  The Second Amendment was a direct response 

12 to concern over Article I, Section 8 of the 

13 Constitution, which gave the new national Congress the 

14 surprising, perhaps even the shocking, power to 

organize, arm, and presumably disarm the State militias. 

16 What is at issue this morning is the scope and nature of 

17 the individual right protected by the resulting 

18 amendment and the first text to consider is the phrase 

19 protecting a right to keep and bear arms. In the 

debates over the Second Amendment, every person who used 

21 the phrase "bear arms" used it to refer to the use of 

22 arms in connection with militia service and when Madison 

23 introduced the amendment in the first Congress, he 

24 exactly equated the phrase "bearing arms" with, quote, 

"rendering military service." We know this from the 

3

1 inclusion in his draft of a clause exempting those with 

2 religious scruples. His clause says "The right of the 

3 people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, a 

4 well armed and well regulated militia being the best 

security of a free country, but no person religiously 

6 scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render 

7 military service in person." 

8  And even if the language of keeping and 

9 bearing arms were ambiguous, the amendment's first 

clause confirms that the right is militia-related. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're right, 

12 Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second 

13 Amendment to phrase the operative provision. If it is 

14 limited to State militias, why would they say "the right 

of the people"? In other words, why wouldn't they say 

16 "state militias have the right to keep arms"? 

17  MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 

18 that the phrase "the people" and the phrase "the 

19 militia" were really in -- in sync with each other. You 

will see references in the debates of, the Federalist 

21 Farmer uses the phrase "the people are the militia, the 

22 militia are the people." 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if that's right, 

24 doesn't that cut against you? If the militia included 

all the people, doesn't the preamble that you rely on 

4

1 not really restrict the right much at all? It includes 

2 all the people. 

3  MR. DELLINGER: Yes, I do believe it 

4 includes all the people in the sense of 

Verdugo-Urquidez, all those who are part of the polity. 

6 What -- what defines the amendment is the scope and 

7 nature of the right that the people have. It's, it is a 

8 right to participate in the common defense and you have 

9 a right invocable in court if a Federal regulation 

interferes with your right to train for or whatever the 

11 militia has established. So that --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the concerns, 

13 Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a 

14 practice of amending the Constitution and its important 

provisions, and it seems to me that there is an 

16 interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from 

17 that of the district court and in Miller and not 

18 advanced particularly in the red brief, but that 

19 conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them. 

The first clause I submit can be read consistently with 

21 the purpose I've indicated of simply reaffirming the 

22 existence and the importance of the militia clause. 

23 Those were very important clauses. As you've indicated, 

24 they're in Article I and Article II. And so in effect 

the amendment says we reaffirm the right to have a 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 militia, we've established it, but in addition, there is 

2 a right to bear arms.  Can you comment on that? 

3  MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And this makes, it does --

I think you're write right in the brief to say that the 

6 preface shouldn't be extraneous. This means it's not 

7 extraneous. The Constitution reaffirms the rights, 

8 reaffirm several principles: The right of the people to 

9 peaceably assemble, the right to be secure in their 

homes, the Tenth Amendment reaffirms the rights, and 

11 this is simply a reaffirmation of the militia clause. 

12  MR. DELLINGER: Justice Kennedy, I think any 

13 interpretation that delinks the two clauses as if they 

14 were dealing with related but nonetheless different 

subject matters has that to count against it, and what 

16 you don't see in the debates over the Second Amendment 

17 are references to, in those debates, the use of weapons 

18 for personal purposes. What you see is the clause that, 

19 that literally transposes to this: "Because a well 

regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free 

21 State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms 

22 shall not be" --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well the subject is "arms" 

24 in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common 

subject, and they're closely related.

1  MR. DELLINGER: I think, as this Court
 

2 unanimously held in Miller, or at least noted in
 

3 Miller -- I'll leave aside the debate. The court
 

4 unanimously said in Miller that the Second Amendment
 

must be interpreted in light of its obvious purpose to 

6 ensure the continuation and render possible the 

7 effectiveness of the military forces. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how there's 

9 any, any, any contradiction between reading the second 

clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the 

11 first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not 

12 necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia 

13 that resisted the British was not State- managed. But 

14 why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to 

assume that since the framers knew that the way militias 

16 were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing 

17 a law against militias, but by taking away the people's 

18 weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. 

19 The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need 

a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms 

21 shall not be infringed. 

22  MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but once you assume 

23 that the clause is designed to protect the militia, it 

24 -- surely it's the militia that decides whether personal 

possession is necessary. I mean, Miller -- what makes

1 no sense is for Miller to require the arm to be 

2 militia-related if the right is not, and the key phrase 

3 is "bear arms." If people --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you think the 

clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is 

6 related to something other than the militia? 

7  MR. DELLINGER: No. I think --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then --

9  MR. DELLINGER: -- the second clause, the 

phrase "keep and bear arms," when "bear arms" is 

11 referred to -- is referred to in a military context, 

12 that is so that even if you left aside --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It had nothing to do with 

14 the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and 

his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, 

16 wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that? 

17  MR. DELLINGER: That is not the discourse 

18 that is part of the Second Amendment. And when you read 

19 the debates, the congressional debates, the only use of 

the phrase "keep and bear arms" is a military phrase, 

21 and --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Blackstone thought it was 

23 important. Blackstone thought it was important. He 

24 thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the 

framers were devoted to Blackstone. Joseph Story, the

1 first commentator on the Constitution and a member of 

2 this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee. 

3  MR. DELLINGER: When Blackstone speaks of 

4 the personal guarantee, he describes it as one of the 

use of weapons, a common law right. And if we're 

6 constitutionalizing the Blackstonian common law right, 

7 he speaks of a right that is subject to due restrictions 

8 and applies to, quote "such weapons, such as are allowed 

9 by law." So Blackstone builds in the kind of 

reasonableness of the regulation that the District of 

11 Columbia has. Now, the --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that may be 

13 true, but that concedes your main point that there is an 

14 individual right and gets to the separate question of 

whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable. 

16  MR. DELLINGER: I don't dispute, Mr. Chief 

17 Justice, that the Second Amendment is positive law that 

18 a litigant can invoke in court if a State were to decide 

19 after recent events that it couldn't rely upon the 

Federal Government in natural disasters and wanted to 

21 have a State-only militia and wanted to have everybody 

22 trained in the use of a weapon, a Federal law that 

23 interfered with that would be a law that could be 

24 challenged in court by, by an individual. I mean, I 

think the better --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger --

2  MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- short of that, just to 

4 get your position clear, short of reactivating State 

militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have 

6 any effect today as a restraint on legislation? 

7  MR. DELLINGER: It would, Justice Ginsburg, 

8 if the State had a militia and had attributes of the 

9 militia contrary to a Federal law. And if it didn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't, as far as 

11 I know. 

12  MR. DELLINGER: As far as I know, today it 

13 doesn't. And I'm not -- and the Respondents make that, 

14 that argument that the amendment is without a use. But 

you don't make up a new use for an amendment whose 

16 prohibitions aren't being violated. I mean --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that its 

18 purpose was to prevent the disarming of the organized 

19 militia, isn't that correct?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: And if that was the purpose, 

22 then how could they -- how could the Framers of the 

23 Second Amendment have thought that it would achieve that 

24 person, because Congress has virtually plenary power 

over the militia under the militia clauses?

1  MR. DELLINGER: That is because, I think, 

2 Justice Alito, that those who wanted to retake State 

3 authority over the militia didn't get everything they 

4 wanted. Madison actually did this somewhat reluctantly 

and wanted to maintain national control. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: They got nothing at all, 

7 not everything they wanted. They got nothing at all. 

8 So long as it was up to the Federal Government to 

9 regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed, 

the Federal Government could, could disband the State 

11 militias. 

12  MR. DELLINGER: Yes, but if -- well --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: So what, what was the 

14 function served by the Second Amendment as far as the 

militia is concerned? 

16  MR. DELLINGER: It is by no means clear that 

17 the Federal Government could abolish the State militia. 

18 It may be presupposed by the Article I, Section 8, 

19 clauses 15 and 16, and by the Second Amendment that the 

States may have a militia. That issue has been left 

21 open as to whether you could do that, and it can be 

22 called into Federal service but only in particular 

23 circumstances. 

24  Now I think the better argument for the 

other side, if, if there is to be a militia relatedness

1 aspect of the Second Amendment, as we think clear from 

2 all of its terms, then Heller's proposed use of a 

3 handgun has no connection of any kind to the 

4 preservation or efficiency of a militia and therefore 

the case is over. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your 

7 reading of the militia clause, the militia clause 

8 specifically reserves concern rights to the States by 

9 its terms. And as I understand your reading, you would 

be saying the Second Amendment was designed to take away 

11 or expand upon the rights that are reserved, rather than 

12 simply guaranteeing what rights were understood to be 

13 implicit in the Constitution itself. 

14  MR. DELLINGER: I'm not sure I followed the, 

the question exactly, but --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the militia 

17 clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are 

18 reserved to the States with respect to the militia. And 

19 yet you're telling us now that this was a very important 

right that ensured that they kept arms, but it wasn't 

21 listed in the rights that were reserved in the militia 

22 clause. 

23  MR. DELLINGER: The debate over the militia 

24 clause -- what is shocking about the militia clauses is 

that this is a, a new national government that for the

1 first time has the power to create a standing army of 

2 professionals. The militia were people who came from 

3 the people themselves, put down their weapons of trade. 

4 The States were devoted to the ides of their militia of 

volunteers, and of all the powers granted to the Federal 

6 Government one of the most surprising was to say that 

7 Congress shall have the power to organize, arm, and 

8 discipline the militia and to -- even though the 

9 officers could be appointed by the State, the discipline 

had to be according to Congress. And this was -- this 

11 caused a tremendous negative reaction to the proposed 

12 Constitution. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Second -- the 

14 Second Amendment doesn't repeal that. You don't take 

the position that Congress no longer has the power to 

16 organize, arm, and discipline the militia, do you? 

17  MR. DELLINGER: No. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it was supplementing 

19 it. And my question is, the question before us, is how 

and to what extent did it supplement it. And in my view 

21 it supplemented it by saying there's a general right to 

22 bear arms quite without reference to the militia either 

23 way. 

24  MR. DELLINGER: It restricted in our view 

the authority of the Federal Government to interfere 

13

1 with the arming of the militia by the States. And the 

2 word that caused the most focus was to "arm" and that is 

3 to disarm. 

4  Now, what I think is happening is that two 

different rights are being put together. One was a 

6 textual right to protect the militia. I think the 

7 better argument for the -- for the other side, for 

8 Mr. Heller, is that the amendment's purpose is militia 

9 protective, but it was overinclusive in the way that 

several of you have suggested, and that is that, as the 

11 court below said, preserving the individual right, 

12 presumably to have guns for personal use, was the best 

13 way to ensure that the militia could serve when called. 

14  But that right, this right of personal 

liberty, the Blackstonian right, is an unregulated right 

16 to whatever arm, wherever kept, however you want to 

17 store it, and for the purposes an individual decides, 

18 that is a libertarian ideal. It's not the text of the 

19 Second Amendment, which is expressly about the security 

of the State; it's about well-regulated militias, not 

21 unregulated individual license, as is --

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: So what you are -- what you 

23 are saying is that the individual has a right to 

24 challenge a Federal law which in effect would disarm the 

militia and make it impossible for the militia to

1 perform those functions that militias function. Isn't 

2 that the nub of what you're saying? 

3  MR. DELLINGER: Yes. That is correct. 

4  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. DELLINGER: And if the Court --

6  JUSTICE STEVENS: May ask this question, 

7 Mr. Dellinger? To what extent do you think the similar 

8 provisions in State constitutions that were adopted more 

9 or less at the same time are relevant to our inquiry?

 MR. DELLINGER: I think they are highly 

11 relevant to your inquiry because now 42 States have 

12 adopted constitutional provisions. 

13  JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not talking about 

14 those.

 MR. DELLINGER: You're talking about at the 

16 time. 

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about the 

18 contemporaneous actions of the States, before or at the 

19 time of the adoption of the Second Amendment.

 MR. DELLINGER: I think that the -- the 

21 State amendments are generally written in different --

22 in different terms. If you're going to protect the kind 

23 of right that is -- that is being spoken of here, 

24 different from the militia right, the plain language to 

do it would be "Congress or the States shall pass no law 

15

1 abridging the right of any person to possess weapons for 

2 personal use." And that's not the right that is created 

3 here. 

4  One of the troublesome aspects of viewing 

this as a right of personal use is that that is the kind 

6 of fundamental liberty interest that would create a real 

7 potential for disruption. Once you unmoor it from -- or 

8 untether it from its connection to the protection of the 

9 State militia, you have the kind of right that could 

easily be restrictions on State and local governments 

11 and --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's no question 

13 that the English struggled with how to work this. You 

14 couldn't conceal a gun and you also couldn't carry it, 

but yet you had a right to have it. 

16  Let me ask you this: Do you think the 

17 Second Amendment is more restrictive or more expansive 

18 of the right than the English Bill of Rights in 1689? 

19  MR. DELLINGER: I think it doesn't address 

the same subject matter as the English Bill of Rights. 

21 I think it's related to the use of weapons as part of 

22 the civic duty of participating in the common defense, 

23 and it's -- and it's -- it's --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that would be more 

restrictive.

1  MR. DELLINGER: That -- that could well --

2 the answer then would be --

3  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well isn't it -- isn't it 

4 more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of 

Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not 

6 preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would 

7 regulate and perhaps limit --

8  MR. DELLINGER: Well --

9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Here there is some 

guarantee against what Congress can do. 

11  MR. DELLINGER: Parliament could regulate. 

12 And Blackstone appears to approve of precisely the kinds 

13 of regulations here. Now --

14  JUSTICE STEVENS: The Bill of Rights only 

protected the rights of protestants. 

16  MR. DELLINGER: This is correct. 

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: And it was suitable to 

18 their conditions then as allowed by law, so it was -- it 

19 was a group right and much more limited.

 MR. DELLINGER: I think that is -- that's 

21 correct. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And as I recall the 

23 legislation against Scottish highlanders and against --

24 against Roman Catholics did use the term -- forbade them 

to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking

1 about their joining militias; they were talking about 

2 whether they could have arms. 

3  MR. DELLINGER: Well, the different kind of 

4 right that you're talking about, to take this to the 

question of -- of what the standard ought to be for 

6 applying this, even if this extended beyond a 

7 militia-based right, if it did, it sounds more like the 

8 part of an expansive public or personal -- an expansive 

9 personal liberty right, and if it -- if it is, I think 

you ought to consider the effect on the 42 States who 

11 have been getting along fine with State constitutional 

12 provisions that do expressly protect an individual right 

13 of -- of weapons for personal use, but in those States, 

14 they have adopted a reasonableness standard that has 

allowed them to sustain sensible regulation of dangerous 

16 weapons. And if you --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is 

18 reasonable about a total ban on possession? 

19  MR. DELLINGER: What is reasonable about a 

total ban on possession is that it's a ban only an the 

21 possession of one kind of weapon, of handguns, that's 

22 been considered especially -- especially dangerous. The 

23 --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law 

that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right

1 if you allow the possession of newspapers? 

2  MR. DELLINGER: No, it's not, and the 

3 difference is quite clear. If -- if you -- there is no 

4 limit to the public discourse. If there is an 

individual right to guns for personal use, it's to carry 

6 out a purpose, like protecting the home. You could not, 

7 for example, say that no one may have more than 50 

8 books. But a law that said no one may possess more than 

9 50 guns would -- would in fact be I think quite 

reasonable. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The regulation --

12 the regulation at issue here is not one that goes to the 

13 number of guns. It goes to the specific type. And I 

14 understood your argument to be in your brief that 

because rifles and shotguns are not banned to the staple 

16 extent as handguns, it's all right to ban handguns. 

17  MR. DELLINGER: That is correct because 

18 there is no showing in this case that rifles and 

19 handguns are not fully satisfactory to carry out the 

purposes. And what -- and what the court below says 

21 about -- about the elimination of this --

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The purposes of what? 

23  MR. DELLINGER: I'm sorry.

showing that rifles and handguns. I think you meant

2  MR. DELLINGER: Yes, I'm sorry. Rifles and 

3 handguns. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is necessary for the 

purpose of what? What is the purpose? 

6  MR. DELLINGER: The purpose -- if the 

7 purpose -- if we are shifting and if we assume for a 

8 moment arguendo that you believe this is a right 

9 unconnected to the militia, then the purpose would be, 

say, defense of the home. And where the government 

11 here, where the -- where the correct standard has been 

12 applied, which is where a State or the district has 

13 carefully balanced the considerations of gun ownership 

14 and public safety, has eliminated one weapon, the court 

below has an absolutist standard that cannot be 

16 sustained. The court below says that once it is 

17 determined that handguns are, quote, "arms," unquote, 

18 referred to in the Second Amendment, it is not open to 

19 the District to ban them. And that doesn't promote the 

security of a free State. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't there a leeway 

22 for some weapon prohibition? Let me ask you, in 

23 relation to the States that do have guarantees of the 

24 right to possess a weapon at home: Do some of those 

States say there are certain kinds of guns that you

2  MR. DELLINGER: Yes. And here what the 

3 opinion below would do instead -- would -- it's hard to 

4 see on the opinion below why machine guns or 

armor-piercing bullets or other dangerous weapons 

6 wouldn't be categorically protected --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back to the --

8  MR. DELLINGER: -- in those States --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could just have one 

follow-on on Justice Ginsburg real quick. Do those 

11 States -- Justice Ginsburg asked -- - that distinguish 

12 among weapons, State constitutional provisions do not do 

13 so? 

14  MR. DELLINGER: No, it's not in the text of 

the State constitutional provision; it's in their --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's in interpretation. 

17  MR. DELLINGER: -- reasonable application. 

18 And here, the question is how has the balance been 

19 struck? The District allows law-abiding citizens to 

have functioning firearms in the home. From the time it 

21 was introduced in 1976, it has been the consistent 

22 position that you're entitled to have a functioning 

23 firearm. At issue is the one type of weapon --

1 allowing armor-piercing bullets and machine guns. I 

2 didn't read it that way. I thought the opinion below 

3 said it had to be the kind of weapon that was common for 

4 the people --

MR. DELLINGER: That is --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that is common for the 

7 people to have. And I don't know -- I don't know that a 

8 lot of people have machine guns or armor-piercing 

9 bullets. I think that's quite unusual. But having a 

pistol is not unusual. 

11  MR. DELLINGER: The number of machine guns, 

12 I believe, is in excess of a hundred thousand that are 

13 out there now, that are --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: How many people in the 

country? 

16  MR. DELLINGER: Well, there are 300 million, 

17 but whether that's common or not, but the --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's common. 

19  MR. DELLINGER: But it's the -- the court 

protects weapons suitable for military use that are 

21 lineal descendants. I don't know why an improved bullet 

22 wouldn't be covered, unless you adopt the kind of 

23 reasonableness standard that we suggest, where you look 

24 to the fact that -- and I don't -- some people think 

machine guns are more dangerous than handguns -- they

1 shoot a lot of people at once -- but a handgun is 

2 concealable and movable. It can be taken into schools, 

3 into buses, into government office buildings, and that 

4 is the particular danger it poses in a densely populated 

urban area. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure 

7 that it's accurate to say the opinion below allowed 

8 those. The law that the opinion, the court below, was 

9 confronted with was a total ban, so that was the only 

law they considered. 

11  If the District passes a ban on machine guns 

12 or whatever, then that law -- that law would be 

13 considered by the court and perhaps would be upheld as 

14 reasonable. But the only law they had before them was a 

total ban. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or a law on the carrying of 

17 concealed weapons, which would include pistols, of 

18 course. 

19  MR. DELLINGER: Let me fight back on the 

notion that it's a -- it's a total ban. It's not as if 

21 every kind of weapon is useful. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you allowed to 

23 carry the weapons that are allowed? I read the "carry 

24 clause" to apply without qualification. So while you 

say you might be able to have a shotgun in the home, you

1 can't carry it to get there. 

2  MR. DELLINGER: No. You can -- you can with 

3 a proper license.  The District has made it clear that 

4 there is no doubt that it interprets its laws to allow a 

functioning gun. And to say that something is a total 

6 ban when you own only one particular kind of weapon 

7 would apply to a machine gun if it were or came into 

8 common use and --

9  JUSTICE ALITO: But even if you have -- even 

if you have a rifle or a shotgun in your home, doesn't 

11 the code prevent you from loading it and unlocking it 

12 except when it's being used for lawful, recreational 

13 purposes within the District of Columbia? So even if 

14 you have the gun, under this code provision it doesn't 

seem as if you could use it for the defense of your 

16 home. 

17  MR. DELLINGER: That is not the city's 

18 position, and we have no dispute with the other side on 

19 the point of what the right answer should be.

 It is a universal or near universal rule of 

21 criminal law that there is a self-defense exception. It 

22 goes without saying. We have no argument whatsoever 

23 with the notion that you may load and have a weapon 

24 ready when you need to use it for self- defense.

4 rebuttal.


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I did interrupt 

6 Justice Breyer. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I just wondered if you 

8 could say in a minute. One possibility is that the 

9 amendment gives nothing more than a right to the State 

to raise a militia. A second possibility is that it 

11 gives an individual right to a person, but for the 

12 purpose of allowing people to have guns to form a 

13 militia. Assume the second. If you assume the second, 

14 I wanted you to respond if you -- unless you have done 

so fully already, to what was the Chief Justice's 

16 question of why, on the second assumption, this ban on 

17 handguns, not the other part, of the District of 

18 Columbia, a total ban, why is that a reasonable 

19 regulation viewed in terms of the purposes as I 

described them? 

21  MR. DELLINGER: It's a reasonable regulation 

22 for two kinds of reasons. 

23  First, in order -- the amendment speaks of a 

24 well-regulated militia. Perhaps it's the case that 

having everybody have whatever gun they want of whatever

1 kind would advance a well- regulated militia, but
 

2 perhaps not. But, in any event --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: It means "well trained,"
 

4 doesn't it?


 MR. DELLINGER: When you -- when you have 

6 one --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't "well regulated" 

8 mean "well trained"? It doesn't mean -- it doesn't mean 

9 "massively regulated." It means "well trained."

 MR. DELLINGER: Well, every -- every phrase 

11 of the amendment, like "well regulated," "security of 

12 the State," is something different than a -- a 

13 libertarian right. Here you have, I think, a fully --

14 on this, particularly on a facial challenge, there is no 

showing that rifles and shotguns are not fully available 

16 for all of the purposes of defense. 

17  There is no indication that the District 

18 militia is an entity that needs individuals to have 

19 their own handguns. You -- you -- there is a step that 

is -- that is missing here. The well-regulated militia 

21 is not necessarily about everyone having a gun. A 

22 militia may decide to organize -- be organized that way, 

23 in which case you would have a different notion. 

24  But here, I think, when you come down to 

apply this case, if you look at about five factors, that

1 other weapons are allowed, important regulatory 

2 interests of these particularly dangerous weapons are --

3 is clearly a significant regulatory, and important 

4 regulatory, interest. In two respects this is removed 

from the core of the amendment. Even if it is not 

6 limited to militia service, even in the court below, no 

7 one doubts that that was, as the court below said, the 

8 most salient objective. 

9  So this is in the penumbra or the periphery, 

not the core. It was undoubtedly aimed principally, if 

11 not exclusively, at national legislation which displaced 

12 the laws in all of the States, rural as well as urban. 

13  Here you've got local legislation responsive 

14 to local needs, and this is local legislation in the 

seat of the government where Congress, which was created 

16 in order to protect the security of the national 

17 government, and where it would be extraordinary to 

18 assume that this is the one place that you're not going 

19 to incorporate it, the one area in the United States 

where no government, free of restrictions of the Second 

21 Amendment, could control dangerous weapons.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

2  AS AMICUS CURIAE 

3  GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

4 it please the Court:

 The Second Amendment to the Constitution, as 

6 its text indicates, guarantees an individual right that 

7 does not depend on eligibility for or service in the 

8 militia. 

9  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a 

preliminary question. Do you think it has the same 

11 meaning that it would have if it omitted the 

12 introductory clause referring to militia? 

13  GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 

14 Stevens, because we don't take the position that the 

preamble plays no role in interpreting the amendment. 

16 And we would point to this court's decision in Miller, 

17 for example, as an example of where the preamble can 

18 play a role in determining the scope --

19  JUSTICE STEVENS: So you think some weight 

should be given to the clause. And also, the other 

21 question I wanted to ask you is: Does the right to keep 

22 and bear arms define one or two rights? 

23  GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, I suppose it probably 

24 does define two rights that are closely related.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There's a right to keep 

28

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 arms and a right to bear arms? 

2  GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's the better 

3 view, and a number of State courts that have interpreted 

4 analogous provisions have distinguished between the two 

rights and looked at them differently. 

6  And, obviously, the term "keep" is a word 

7 that I think is something of an embarrassment for an 

8 effort to try to imbue every term in the operative text 

9 with an exclusively military connotation because that is 

not one that really has an exclusive military 

11 connotation. As Justice Scalia pointed out, "keep" was 

12 precisely the word that authorities used in statutes 

13 designed specifically to disarm individuals. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't means all. It 

doesn't mean -- "keep," on your reading, at least if 

16 it's consistent with Miller, keep and bear some arms, 

17 but not all arms. 

18  GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice 

19 Ginsburg, and just -- I mean, to give you a clear 

example, we would take the position that the kind of 

21 plastic guns or guns that are specifically designed to 

22 evade metal detectors that are prohibited by Federal law 

23 are not "arms" within the meaning of the Second 

24 Amendment and are not protected at all.

 And that would be the way we would say that 

29

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 you should analyze that provision of Federal law, as 

2 those are not even arms within the provisions of the 

3 Second Amendment. 

4  I think to make the same argument about 

machine guns would be a much more difficult argument, to 

6 say the least, given that they are the standard-issue 

7 weapon for today's armed forces and the State-organized 

8 militia. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your view this 

amendment has nothing to do with the right of people 

11 living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite 

12 maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is 

13 what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their 

14 weapons?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

16 wouldn't say that it has no application there. As I 

17 say, I think the term "arms," especially if Miller is 

18 going to continue to be the law, is influenced by the 

19 preamble. But the way we would look at it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree that Miller is 

21 consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to 

22 me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion 

23 writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe -- to 

24 describe the interests that must have been foremost in 

the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns

1 being taken away from the people who needed them for 

2 their defense. 

3  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, we 

4 would analyze it this way, which is we would say that 

probably the thing that was foremost in the framers' 

6 minds was a concern that the militia not be disarmed 

7 such that it would be maintained as a viable option to 

8 the standing army. But especially when you remember, as 

9 Justice Alito pointed out, that the Constitution in 

Article I, Section 8, clauses 15 and 16, the militia 

11 clauses, as unamended, gave the Federal power -- the 

12 Federal authorities virtually plenary authority to deal 

13 with the organization and regulation of the militia. 

14 The most obvious way that you could protect the militia 

--

16  JUSTICE STEVENS: 

17 Not plenary authority. 

18  GENERAL CLEMENT: 

19 reserved in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: 

21  GENERAL CLEMENT: 

Not plenary authority. 

Except for that which is 

Who appoints the officers? 

Yes -- no, absolutely. 

22 There is something reserved in clause 16. 

23  But let me just say, if the Second Amendment 

24 had the meaning that the District of Columbia ascribes 

to it, one would certainly think that James Madison,

1 when he proposed the Second Amendment would have 

2 proposed it as an amendment to Article I, Section 8, 

3 clause 16. 

4  He didn't. He proposed it as an amendment 

to Article I, Section 9, which encapsulates the 

6 individual rights to be free from bills of retainder and 

7 ex post facto clauses. 

8  JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think he was guided 

9 at all by the contemporaneous provisions in State 

constitutions? 

11  MR. DELLINGER: I am sure he was influenced 

12 by that, although I think, honestly --

13  JUSTICE STEVENS: And how many of them 

14 protected an individual right? Just two, right?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think -- I think 

16 Pennsylvania and Vermont are the ones that most 

17 obviously protected. 

18  JUSTICE STEVENS: And the others quite 

19 clearly went in the other direction, did they not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't know about 

21 quite clearly. The textual indication in the State 

22 amendments that probably most obviously goes in the 

23 other direction is the phrase "keep and bear arms for 

24 the common defense." And, of course, there was a 

proposal during the debate over the Second Amendment to

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: There was also a proposal 

4 to make it clear there was an individual right, which 

was also rejected. 

6  GENERAL CLEMENT: I'm sorry, Justice 

7 Stevens. Which aspect of that did you have in mind? 

8  JUSTICE STEVENS: The Pennsylvania proposal. 

9  GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but I don't think that 

ever made it to the floor of the House or the Senate 

11 that I'm aware of. And I think that this happened at 

12 the actual Senate floor. There was a proposal to add 

13 the words "in the common defense," and that was 

14 rejected. I mean, but --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think Madison was 

16 guided by the experience and the expressions of the 

17 right in English law, including the Bill of Rights of 

18 1689? 

19  GENERAL CLEMENT: I do, Justice Kennedy, and 

I think in that regard it is telling that -- I mean, 

21 there are a variety of provisions in our Bill of Rights 

22 that were borrowed from the English Bill of Rights. Two 

23 very principal ones are the right to petition the 

24 government and the right to keep and bear arms. I don't 

think it's an accident --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we're going back to 

2 the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to 

3 be subject to the control and limitation and restriction 

4 of Parliament. And I don't think there's any doubt 

about that. And that's what we're talking about here, 

6 are legislative restrictions. 

7  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

8 think you could say the same thing for every provision 

9 of the English Bill of Rights. And obviously, when 

those were translated over to our system you had to make 

11 adjustment for --

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't there one 

13 difference? Not every provision of the English Bill of 

14 Rights had an express reference to permission by law, 

which is a reference to parliamentary authority. So 

16 that there -- there -- there was a peculiar recognition 

17 of parliamentary legislative authority on this subject. 

18  GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right, 

19 Justice Souter. And the way I counted it, I only found 

three provisions in the English Bill of Rights that had 

21 a comparable reference to Parliament. 

22  JUSTICE STEVENS: This provision has the 

23 additional limitation to "suitable to their conditions," 

24 and a large number of people were not permitted to have 

arms. 

34

1  GENERAL CLEMENT: Again, that is also true 

2 and is also relatively unique to this amendment. And if 

3 I get to the point in the argument where I talk about 

4 why we think that something less than strict scrutiny is 

appropriate, I think I would point precisely to those 

6 elements of the English Bill of Rights as being 

7 relevant. 

8  But what I was about to say is I think what 

9 is highly relevant in considering the threshold question 

of whether there's an individual right here at all is 

11 that the parallel provisions in the English Bill of 

12 Rights that were borrowed over included the right to 

13 petition and the right to keep and bear arms. Both of 

14 those appear with specific parallel references to the 

people. They are both rights that are given to the 

16 people. 

17  And as this Court has made clear in 

18 Verdugo-Urquidez, that's a reference that 

19 appears throughout the Bill of Rights as a reference to 

the entire citizenry. 

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to another 

22 point, which is to the same point, and that is 

23 consistent with your emphasis on the people was your 

24 emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping 

and bearing arms. The "keep" part sounds in your, in

1 your mind at least, to speak of an individual right not 

2 necessarily limited by, by the exigencies of military 

3 service. 

4  My question is, if that is correct and 

"keep" should be read as, in effect, an independent 

6 guarantee, then what is served by the phrase "and bear"? 

7 In other words, if the people can keep them and they 

8 have them there for use in the militia as well as to 

9 hunt deer, why do we -- why do we have to have a further 

reference in there to a right to bear as well as to keep 

11 arms? And my point is it sounds to me as though "keep 

12 and bear" forms one phrase rather than two. But I want 

13 to know what your answer is to that. 

14  GENERAL CLEMENT: The way I would read it, 

Justice Souter, is that "keep" is really talking about 

16 private possession in the home. And the way that I 

17 would look at it is in order to exercise, for example, 

18 an opportunity to hunt, that you would need to bear the 

19 arms as well. And I would point you -- I think it's a 

useful point --

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: But wait a minute. You're 

22 not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is 

23 bearing arms, or are you? 

24  GENERAL CLEMENT: I would say that and so 

would Madison and so would Jefferson, I would submit.

1 They use --

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: Somebody going out to -- in 

3 the eighteenth century, someone going out to hunt a deer 

4 would have thought of themselves as bearing arms? I 

mean, is that the way they talk? 

6  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I will grant you 

7 this, that "bear arms" in its unmodified form is most 

8 naturally understood to have a military context. But I 

9 think the burden of the argument on the other side is to 

make it have an exclusively military context. And as a 

11 number of the briefs have pointed out, that's not borne 

12 out by the framing sources. 

13  In one place, although it's not bearing 

14 arms, it's bearing a gun, I think it's highly relevant 

that Madison and Jefferson with respect to this hunting 

16 bill that Jefferson wrote and Madison proposed, 

17 specifically used in the hunting context the phrase 

18 "bear a gun," and so I do think in that context --

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's "arms" that has 

the kind of the military -- the martial connotation, I 

21 would have thought. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't -- wasn't it the 

23 case that the banning of arms on the part of the 

24 Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used 

the term, forbade them to "bear arms"? It didn't mean

1 that could just not join militias; it meant they 

2 couldn't carry arms. 

3  GENERAL CLEMENT: And again, I think various 

4 phrases were, were used. I also think that some of the 

disarmament provisions specifically used the word
 

6 "keep." And so I think there is some independent
 

7 meaning there, which is one point.
 

8  And then I do think that, even in the
 

9 context of bearing arms, I will grant you that "arms"
 

has a military connotation and I think Miller would 

11 certainly support that, but I don't think it's an 

12 exclusively military connotation. 

13  JUSTICE STEVENS: Not only Miller, but the 

14 Massachusetts declaration. "The right to keep and bear 

arms for the common defense" is what is the normal 

16 reading of it. 

17  GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely. And I 

18 grant you if this, if the Second Amendment said "keep 

19 and bear arms for the common defense" this would be a 

different case. But --

21  JUSTICE STEVENS: --- the right to keep and 

22 bear -- I'm sorry. It's one right to keep and bear, not 

23 two rights, to keep and to bear. 

24  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean it's -- it's

8 talk about the standard and my light is indeed on, so 

9 let me do that.

 I think there are several reasons why a 

11 standard as we suggest in our brief rather than strict 

12 scrutiny is an appropriate standard to be applied in 

13 evaluating these laws. I think first and foremost, as 

14 our colloquy earlier indicated, there is -- the right to 

bear arms was a preexisting right. The Second Amendment 

16 talks about "the right to bear arms," not just "a right 

17 to bear arms." And that preexisting always coexisted 

18 with reasonable regulations of firearms. 

19  And as you pointed out, Justice Souter, to 

be sure when you're making the translation from the 

21 English Bill of Rights you always have to deal with 

22 parliamentary supremacy. But it is very striking that, 

23 as Justice Stevens said, the right was conditioned on 

24 the conditions, which I think meant what class you were, 

and also subject expressly to the Parliament, the laws

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: The freedom of speech that 

3 was referred to in the Constitution was also "the" 

4 freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing 

freedom of speech. And there were indeed some
 

6 restrictions on that such as libel that you were not
 

7 allowed to do. And yet we've never held that simply
 

8 because it was pre-existing and that there were some
 

9 regulations upon it, that we would not use strict
 

scrutiny. We certainly apply it to freedom of speech, 

11 don't we? 

12  GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, let me 

13 make two related points. One, even in the First 

14 Amendment context, this Court has recognized -- and I 

point you to the Court's opinion in Robertson against 

16 Baldwin, which makes this point as to both the First and 

17 the Second Amendment. This Court has recognized that 

18 there are certain pre-existing exceptions that are so 

19 well established that you don't really even view them as 

Second Amendment or First Amendment infringement. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Like libel. 

22  GENERAL CLEMENT: Like libel, and I would 

23 say like laws barring felons from possessing handguns.

1 protecting yourself against intruders in the home? 

2  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, that gets to the 

3 self-defense component and I don't know that I ever got 

4 a chance to fully answer your question on that, Justice 

Kennedy, which is we would say, notwithstanding the fact 

6 that the preamble makes it clear that the preeminent 

7 motive was related to ensuring that the militia remained 

8 a viable option vis-a-vis the standing army, the 

9 operative text is not so limited. And I think in that 

regard it's worth emphasizing that the framers knew 

11 exactly how to condition a right on militia service, 

12 because they did it with respect to the grand jury 

13 clause, and they didn't do it with respect to the Second 

14 Amendment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the amendment is intended 

16 at least, in part to protect the right to self-defense 

17 in the home, how could the District code provision 

18 survive under any standard of review where they totally 

19 ban the possession of the type of weapon that's most 

commonly used for self-defense, and even as to long guns 

21 and shotguns they require, at least what the code says 

22 without adding a supposed gloss that might be produced 

23 in a subsequent case, that even as to long guns and 

24 shotguns they have to be unloaded and disassembled or 

locked at all times, even presumably if someone is

1 breaking into the home? 

2  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, let 

3 me answer the question in two parts if I can, because I 

4 think the analysis of the trigger lock provision may 

well be different than the analysis of the other 

6 provisions. 

7  With respect to the trigger lock provision, 

8 we think that there is a substantial argument that once 

9 this Court clarifies what the constitutional standard 

is, that there ought to be an opportunity for the 

11 District of Columbia to urge its construction, which 

12 would allow for a relatively robust self-defense 

13 exception to the trigger lock provision. And this Court 

14 could very well, applying Ashwan to prevent --

principles allow for that kind of --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

17 What would that be -- that you can, if you have time, 

18 when you hear somebody crawling in your -- your bedroom 

19 window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and 

then fire? Is that going to be the exception? 

21  GENERAL CLEMENT: If that's going to be the 

22 exception, it could clearly be inadequate. And I think 

23 that -- I mean the District of Columbia can speak to 

24 this, but it seems to me that if, for example, the 

police were executing a warrant at evening and had cause 

42

1 for doing it at evening and saw somebody with a loaded 

2 gun on their night stand, no children present without a 

3 trigger lock, it seems to me that that would be a good 

4 test case to decide whether or not their construction 

would provide for an exception to the trigger lock
 

6 provision in that case.
 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I interrupt for a
 

8 minute?
 

9  GENERAL CLEMENT: If it did, I think then
 

the statute might well be constitutional. If it didn't, 

11 in my view, it probably wouldn't be. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a lot of talk 

13 about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny. 

14 Does it make a practical difference whether we take your 

standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C. 

16 Circuit's opinion? And specifically there is a whole 

17 panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession. 

18 Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard? 

19 And the same question with the District scrutiny, does 

it make any difference? 

21  GENERAL CLEMENT: In our view it makes a 

22 world of difference, Justice Ginsburg, because we 

23 certainly take the position, as we have since 

24 consistently since 2001, that the Federal firearm 

statutes can be defended as constitutional, and that

1 would be consistent with this kind of intermediate 

2 scrutiny standard that we propose. If you apply strict 

3 scrutiny, I think that the result would be quite 

4 different, unfortunately.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, these various 

6 phrases under the different standards that are proposed, 

7 "compelling interest," "significant interest," "narrowly 

8 tailored," none of them appear in the Constitution; and 

9 I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an 

all-encompassing standard. Isn't it enough to determine 

11 the scope of the existing right that the amendment 

12 refers to, look at the various regulations that were 

13 available at the time, including you can't take the gun 

14 to the marketplace and all that, and determine how 

these -- how this restriction and the scope of this 

16 right looks in relation to those? 

17  I'm not sure why we have to articulate some 

18 very intricate standard. I mean, these standards that 

19 apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over 

the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment 

21 picked up. But I don't know why when we are starting 

22 afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that 

23 would apply in every case? 

24  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

let me say a couple of things about that, which is to

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 say that if this Court were to decide this case and make 

2 conclusively clear that it really was focused very 

3 narrowly on this case and it was in some respects 

4 applying a sui generis test, we think that would be an 

improvement over the court of appeals opinion, which is 

6 subject to more than one reading, but as Justice 

7 Ginsburg's question just said, it's certainly 

8 susceptible to a reading that it embodies strict 

9 scrutiny. In fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it did. It said 

11 it's just like the First Amendment. First Amendment has 

12 exceptions, but strict scrutiny applies. It says strict 

13 scrutiny applies here too. 

14  GENERAL CLEMENT: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that opinion also, it 

16 didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the 

17 kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and 

18 that are commonly -- commonly held today. Is there any 

19 Federal exclusion of weapons that applies to weapons 

that are commonly held today? I don't know what you're 

21 worried about. Machine guns, what else? Armored 

22 bullets, what else? 

23  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

24 think our principal concern based on the parts of the 

court of appeals opinion that seemed to adopt a very 

45

1 categorical rule were with respect to machine guns, 

2 because I do think that it is difficult -- I don't want 

3 to foreclose the possibility of the Government, Federal 

4 Government making the argument some day -- but I think 

it is more than a little difficult to say that the one 

6 arm that's not protected by the Second Amendment is that 

7 which is the standard issue armament for the National 

8 Guard, and that's what the machine gun is. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this law didn't 

involve a restriction on machine guns. It involved an 

11 absolute ban. It involved an absolute carry 

12 prohibition. Why would you think that the opinion 

13 striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a 

14 narrow one -- narrower one directed solely to machine 

guns? 

16  GENERAL CLEMENT: I think, Mr. Chief 

17 Justice, why one might worry about that is one might 

18 read the language of page 53a of the opinion as 

19 reproduced in the petition appendix that says once it is 

an arm, then it is not open to the District to ban it. 

21  Now, it seems to me that the District is not 

22 strictly a complete ban because it exempts pre-1976 

23 handguns. The Federal ban on machine guns is not, 

24 strictly speaking, a ban, because it exempts pre --

pre-law machine guns, and there is something like

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that passage doesn't
 

3 mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of
 

4 arms. Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that
 

the opinion referred to it, which is -- which is the 

6 type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is --

7 it is nowadays commonly held. 

8  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: If you read it that way, I 

don't see why you have a problem. 

11  GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I hope that you 

12 read it that way. But I would also say that I think 

13 that whatever the definition that the lower court 

14 opinion employed, I do think it's going to be difficult 

over time to sustain the notion -- I mean, the Court of 

16 Appeals also talked about lineal descendants. And it 

17 does seem to me that, you know, just as this Court would 

18 apply the Fourth Amendment to something like heat 

19 imagery, I don't see why this Court wouldn't allow the 

Second Amendment to have the same kind of scope, and 

21 then I do think that reasonably machine guns come within 

22 the term "arms." 

23  Now, if this Court wants to say that they 

24 don't -- I mean -- I mean -- we'd obviously welcome that 

in our -- in our obligation to defend the

characterizations of it. The Goldwater Institute calls

1 ban. 

2  The Petitioners have had two opportunities 

3 to urge courts to adopt this so-called self-defense 

4 exception which they construed in the amendment. The 

first opportunity came in 1978 in McIntosh versus 

6 Washington, where the petitioners urged the Court of 

7 Appeals of the District of Columbia to uphold the law 

8 because it was irrational in their view to prohibit 

9 self-defense in the home with firearms. They deemed it 

to be too dangerous, and this was a legitimate policy 

11 choice of the City Council, and they actually prevailed 

12 in that view. 

13  The second opportunity that the Petitioners 

14 had to urge this sort of self-defense construction was 

actually in this case in the district court. We had a 

16 motion for summary judgment and we made certain factual 

17 allegations in this motion, and on page 70a of the joint 

18 appendix we see portions of our statement of undisputed 

19 material facts. Fact number 29, which was conceded by 

the District of Columbia, reads: The defendants 

21 prohibit the possession of lawfully owned firearms for 

22 self-defense within the home, even in instances when 

23 self-defense would be lawful by other means under 

24 District of Columbia law. The citation for that is a 

functional firearms ban, and that point was conceded.

1  Certainly the idea that people can guess as 

2 to when it is that they might render the firearm 

3 operational is -- is not a one that the Court should 

4 accept, because a person who hears a noise, a person who 

perhaps is living in a neighborhood where there has been 

6 a spate of violent crimes, has no idea of when the 

7 District of Columbia would permit her to render the 

8 firearm operational. And, in fact, there is a 

9 prosecution history not under this specific provision, 

but certainly other under gun prohibition -- laws that 

11 we are challenging here today to prosecute people for 

12 the possession or for the carrying of a prohibited 

13 firearm even when the police ruled the shooting has been 

14 lawful self-defense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that this is 

16 unreasonable, and that really is my question because I'd 

17 like you to assume two things with me, which you 

18 probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with 

19 them, either.

 (Laughter.) 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But I just want you to 

22 assume them for the purpose of the question. All right. 

23  Assume that the -- that there is an 

24 individual right, but the purpose of that right is to 

maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's

1 the basic purpose. So it informs what's reasonable and 

2 what isn't reasonable. 

3  Assume -- and this is favorable to you but 

4 not as favorable as you'd like -- assume that we are 

going to decide whether something is proportionate or 

6 apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose. 

7 All right. 

8  Now, focus on the handgun ban. As I read 

9 these 80 briefs -- and they were very good, I mean 

really good and informative on both sides -- and I'm 

11 trying to boil down the statistics where there is 

12 disagreement, and roughly what I get -- and don't 

13 quarrel with this too much; it's very rough -- that 

14 80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States 

are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or 

16 crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more 

17 questionable. That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000. 

18  In the District, I guess the number is 

19 somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's 

similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded. All right. 

21  Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on 

22 handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets, 

23 a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of 

24 the District of Columbia?

 MR. GURA: Because, Your Honor, for the same

1 reason it was offered by numerous military officers at 

2 the highest levels of the U.S. military in all branches 

3 of service writing in two briefs, they agree with us 

4 that the handgun ban serves to weaken America's military 

preparedness. Because when people have handguns --

6 handguns are military arms, they are not just civilian 

7 arms -- they are better prepared and able to use them. 

8 And, certainly, when they join the military forces, they 

9 are issued handguns.

 And so if we assume that the sort of 

11 military purpose to the Second Amendment is an 

12 individual right, then the handgun ban, as noted by our 

13 military amici, would impede that. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I didn't read -- I 

read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature 

16 of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument 

17 there that the nature of the right is to maintain a 

18 citizen Army. 

19  And to maintain that potential today, the 

closest we come is to say that there is a right for 

21 people to understand weapons, to know how to use them, 

22 to practice with them. And they can do that, you see, 

23 with their rifles. They can go to gun ranges, I guess, 

24 in neighboring States.

that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is

12 getting you to focus on that. 

13  MR. GURA: The answer is yes, as Justice 

14 Scalia noted, and it's unreasonable, and it actually 

fails any standard of review that might be offered under 

16 such a construction of individual rights because 

17 proficiency with handguns, as recognized as a matter of 

18 judicial notice by the First Circuit in Cases back in 

19 1942 -- that was a handgun case where the First Circuit 

examined the restriction on the carrying of the 

21 30-caliber revolver. And the First Circuit accepted, as 

22 a matter of judicial notice, that proficiency in use and 

23 familiarity with the handgun at issue would be one that 

24 would further a militia purpose. And so --

1 In answering yes, do you attach any significance to the

3  MR. GURA: Yes, I do, Your Honor. 

4  JUSTICE STEVENS: You think that is -- to 

understand the amendment, you must pay some attention to 

6 the militia requirement? 

7  MR. GURA: Yes, Your Honor, we must --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a conscientious 

9 objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say, 

has no rights under the Second Amendment. He is not 

11 going to be part of the militia. He is not going to be 

12 part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear 

13 arms. You would say that he doesn't have any rights 

14 under this amendment?

 MR. GURA: No, Your Honor. I think that the 

16 militia clause informs the purpose -- informs a purpose. 

17 It gives us some guidepost as to how we look at the 

18 Second Amendment, but it's not the exclusive purpose of 

19 the Second Amendment. Certainly, the Founders cared 

very much about --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a limitation? Is 

22 it any limitation on the legislature? Is the first 

23 clause any limitation on the legislature? 

24  MR. GURA: It is a limitation to one extent, 

Your Honor, the extent recognized in Miller where the

1 Miller Court asked whether or not a particular type of 

2 arm that's at issue is one that people may individually 

3 possess. It looked to the militia clause and, 

4 therefore, adopted a militia purpose as one of the two 

prongs of Miller. 

6  And so, certainly, if there were -- if the 

7 Court were to continue Miller -- and Miller was the only 

8 guidance that the lower court had, certainly, as to what 

9 arms are protected or unprotected by the Second 

Amendment. And yet --

11  JUSTICE STEVENS: If it limits the kinds of 

12 arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not 

13 also limit the kind of people who may have arms? 

14  MR. GURA: It does not eliminate the kind of 

people, Your Honor, because the Second Amendment is the 

16 right of the people. And it would certainly be an odd 

17 right that we would have against the Congress, if 

18 Congress could then redefine people out of that right. 

19 Congress could tomorrow declare that nobody is in a 

militia, and then nobody would have the right against 

21 the government. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you were thinking of 

23 "the people," what those words meant when the Second 

24 Amendment was adopted, it was males between the ages of 

what -- 17 and 45? People who were over 45 had no --

1 they didn't serve in the militia. 

2  MR. GURA: Well, certainly, there were many 

3 people who were not eligible for militia duty, or not 

4 subject to militia service, who nevertheless were 

expected to, and oftentimes did, in fact, have guns. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which shows that maybe 

7 you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second 

8 clause is not broader than the first. It's not at all 

9 uncommon for a legislative provision or a constitutional 

provision to go further than is necessary for the 

11 principal purpose involved. 

12  The principal purpose here is the militia, 

13 but the -- but the second clause goes beyond the militia 

14 and says the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

 Now, you may say the kind of arms is colored 

16 by the militia. But it speaks of the right of the 

17 people. So why not acknowledge that it's -- it's 

18 broader than the first clause? 

19  MR. GURA: Well, we do acknowledge that, 

Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why have the first 

22 clause? I mean what is it doing -- I mean what help is 

23 it going to be?

remind us -- the Framers certainly felt that a militia

1 was very important to the preservation of liberty. The

3 heavily on militia forces, and so they wanted to honor 

4 that and remind us as to the purpose -- one purpose, not 

the exclusive purpose, but a purpose -- of preserving 

6 the right --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could it also be simply to 

8 reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the 

9 Constitution remain intact?

 MR. GURA: That's correct, Your Honor. In 

11 fact, that view was taken by William Rawle in his 1828 

12 treatise, view of the Constitution. Rawle was, of 

13 course, a ratifier of the Second Amendment. He sat in 

14 the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1790. And if you look at 

his description of the Second Amendment, he bifurcates 

16 it. First, he discusses the militia clause, and he 

17 lavishes some qualified praise on it. And then --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you were about to tell 

19 us before the course of the questioning began about the 

other purposes that the amendment served. I'm -- I want 

21 to know whether or not, in your view, the operative 

22 clause of the amendment protects, or was designed to 

23 protect in an earlier time, the settler in the

common-law English right which the Founders wanted to
 

6 expand.
 

7  In fact, the chapter in which Blackstone
 

8 discusses this in his treatise, his fifth auxiliary
 

9 right to arms, is entitled --

JUSTICE BREYER: That brings me back to the 

11 question because Blackstone describes it as a right to 

12 keep and bear arms "under law." And since he uses the 

13 words "under law," he clearly foresees reasonable 

14 regulation of that right. And so does the case not 

hinge on, even given all your views, on whether it is or 

16 is not a reasonable or slightly tougher standard thing 

17 to do to ban the handgun, while leaving you free to use 

18 other weapons? 

19  I mean, I notice that the militia statute, 

the first one, spoke of people coming to report, in 

21 1790, or whenever, with their rifles, with their 

22 muskets, but only the officers were to bring pistols. 

23 So that, to me, suggests they didn't see pistols as 

24 crucial even then, let alone now.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to the 

2 question? 

3  MR. GURA: Well, my response is that the 

4 government can ban arms that are not appropriate for 

civilian use. There is no question of that. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That are not appropriate 

7 to --

8  MR. GURA: That are not appropriate to 

9 civilian use.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: For example? 

11  MR. GURA: For example, I think machine 

12 guns: It's difficult to imagine a construction of 

13 Miller, or a construction of the lower court's opinion, 

14 that would sanction machine guns or the plastic, 

undetectable handguns that the Solicitor General spoke 

16 of. 

17  The fact is that this Court's Miller test 

18 was the only guidance that we had below, and I think it 

19 was applied faithfully. Once a weapon is, first of all, 

an "arm" under the dictionary definition -- and Webster 

21 has a very useful one -- then you look to see whether 

22 it's an arm that is meant to be protected under the 

23 Second Amendment, and we apply the two-pronged Miller 

24 test. And usually one would imagine if an arm fails the 

Miller test because it's not appropriate for common

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why wouldn't the

4 standard issue in the military.


 MR. GURA: But it's not an arm of the type 

6 that people might be expected to possess commonly in 

7 ordinary use. That's the other aspect of Miller. 

8 Miller spoke about the militia as encompassing the 

9 notion that people would bring with them arms of the 

kind in common use supplied by themselves. And --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any 

12 parallel --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: At this time -- I would 

14 just like to follow up on what you said, because if you 

were right that it was at that time, yes; but that's not 

16 what Miller says. It says that the gun in question 

17 there was not one that at this time -- this time, the 

18 time of the Miller decision -- has a reasonable 

19 relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a 

well-regulated militia. So it's talking about this 

21 time. 

22  MR. GURA: That's correct. The time frame 

23 that the Court must address is always the present. The 

24 framers wished to preserve the right to keep and bear 

arms. They wished to preserve the ability of people to

1 act as militia, and so there was certainly no plan for, 

2 say, a technical obsolescence. 

3  However, the fact is that Miller spoke very 

4 strongly about the fact that people were expected to 

bring arms supplied by themselves of the kind in common 

6 use at the time. So if in this time people do not have, 

7 or are not recognized by any court to have, a common 

8 application for, say, a machine gun or a rocket launcher 

9 or some other sort of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any 

11 parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to 

12 the machine gun? In other words, I understand your 

13 point to be that, although that's useful in modern 

14 military service, it's not something civilians possess. 

Was there anything like that at the time of the 

16 adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as 

17 the ones you'd use in the military? 

18  MR. GURA: At the time that -- even at the 

19 time Miller was decided, the civilian arms were pretty 

much the sort that were used in the military. However, 

21 it's hard to imagine how a machine gun could be a 

22 "lineal descendent," to use the D.C. Circuit's wording, 

23 of anything that existed back in 1791, if we want to 

24 look to the framing era. Machine guns --

1 Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea 

2 that the militia clause has a major effect in 

3 interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive 

4 and underinclusive. I would have to agree with Justice 

Ginsburg that a machine gun is probably more related to 

6 the militia now than a pistol is. But that -- that 

7 seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no 

8 sense out of the operative clause in present-day 

9 circumstances.

 MR. GURA: Your Honor, even within the 

11 militia understanding, the understanding of the militia 

12 was always that people would bring whatever they had 

13 with them in civilian life. So if a machine gun, even 

14 though it may be a wonderful --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My point is: Why is that 

16 of any real relevance to the situation that faces the 

17 homeowner today? 

18  MR. GURA: It's only of relevance if the 

19 Court wishes to continue reading the militia clause as 

informing the type of weapon which is protected. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're being 

22 faithful to Miller. I suggest that Miller may be 

23 deficient. 

24  MR. GURA: I agree with Your Honor, and 

certainly in our brief we suggest that the militia

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 emphasis of Miller is not useful as a limiting principle 

2 to the type of arms that may be -- that may be 

3 permitted. Because, on the one hand, there's a great 

4 deal of weaponry that might be wonderful for military 

duty but is not appropriate for common civilian use,
 

6 which would not be protected even under the Miller
 

7 test's first prong.
 

8  And, on the other hand, everything that
 

9 civilians today might wish to have in ordinary common
 

use -- handguns, rifles, and shotguns -- are militarily 

11 useful weapons. 

12  So we de-emphasize the military aspects of 

13 Miller as being ultimately not very useful guidance for 

14 courts. And the better guidance would be to emphasize 

the commonsense rule that I think judges would have 

16 really no trouble applying, and we do this all the time 

17 in constitutional law: To simply make a decision as to 

18 whether or not whichever arm comes up at issue is an arm 

19 of the kind that you could really reasonably expect 

civilians to have. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- now, when say "keep" 

22 and "bear," I mean you are -- I think you're on to 

23 something here. Because you say let's use our common

1 Massachusetts had a law that said you cannot keep loaded 

2 firearms in the house, right, and you have to keep all 

3 of the bullets and everything and all of the powder 

4 upstairs, why did they have that law? To stop fires 

because it's dangerous? They didn't have fire
 

6 departments. Now we do -- or they weren't as good.
 

7  We now have police departments, and the
 

8 crime wave might be said similar to what were fires
 

9 then. And, therefore, applying the similar kind of
 

thing, you say: Fine, just as you could keep pistols 

11 loaded but not -- not loaded. You had to keep powder 

12 upstairs because of the risk of fire. So today, 

13 roughly, you can say no handguns in the city because of 

14 the risk of crime.

 Things change. But we give in both 

16 instances, then and now, leeway to the city and States 

17 to work out what's reasonable in light of their

19  MR. GURA: The legislature has a great deal 

of leeway in regulating firearms. There is no dispute 

21 about that. However, I wouldn't draw a complete analogy

1 "firearm" was not understood to include pistols. 

2 General Gage's inventory of weapons seized from the 

3 Americans in Boston included some 1800 or so firearms 

4 and then 634 pistols. Nowhere in the Boston code do we 

see a prohibition on keeping loaded pistols in the home. 

6 And certainly the idea that -- that self-defense is a 

7 harm is one that is --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Not self-defense being the 

9 harm. And I agree with you that this, the firearm 

analogy, floats up there, but it isn't going to decide 

11 this case, the Massachusetts statute. I agree with you 

12 about that. 

13  What you've suddenly given me the idea of 

14 doing, which I'm testing, is to focus not just on what 

the kind of weapon is -- don't just look to see whether 

16 it's a cannon or a machine gun, but look to see what the 

17 purpose of this regulation is, and does it make sense in 

18 terms of having the possibility of people trained in 

19 firearms?

 Let's look at those military briefs. Let's 

21 say that the generals have it right, there is some kind 

22 of right to keep trained in the use of firearms subject 

23 to regulation. We have regulation worried about crime,

4 regulation or under any standard of review to prohibit 

people from having functional firearms in their own home 

6 for purposes of self-defense. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't even agree that 

8 Massachusetts was subject to the Second Amendment. 

9  MR. GURA: Well, originally it was not. But 

what we've seen with the Fourteenth Amendment, and we've 

11 seen --

17 fact that you include self-defense, but only two States, 

18 Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a 

19 permissible justification and all of the others referred 

to common defense or defense of the State, and in the 

21 Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself 

22 there is no reference to self-defense?

4 Amendment.

 MR. GURA: Well, at the time we haven't seen 

6 State court decisions from exactly that era. 

7  JUSTICE STEVENS: Just the text of the State 

8 constitutional provisions, two of them refer to 

9 self-defense. The rest refer only to common defense; is 

that not correct? 

11  MR. GURA: On their literal text, yes. But 

12 judges did not interpret them that way, for example in 

13 North Carolina --

14  JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that judicial 

interpretation sometimes is controlling and sometimes is 

16 not. But the text itself does draw a distinction, just 

17 as the Second Amendment does. It doesn't mention 

18 self-defense. 

19  MR. GURA: While it might not mention 

self-defense, it was clear that the demands that the 

21 States made at the ratifying conventions were for an 

22 individual right, and Madison was interested in --

23  JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if you look at the 

24 individual rights I suppose you start back in 1689, the 

Declaration of Rights in England. And the seventh

1 provision that they talked about said that: "The 

2 subjects which are protestants may have arms for their 

3 defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by 

4 law." Now do you think the term "suitable to their 

conditions" limited the number of people who had access 

6 to arms for self-defense? 

7  MR. GURA: It was in England, but that was 

8 criticized by the framers. St. George Tucker's edition 

9 of Blackstone --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you think that the 

11 Second Amendment is a departure from the provision in 

12 the Declaration of Rights in England?

14 upon it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that's not really 

16 your -- you would not confine the right the way the

that's where the -- where we -- where we look to, to 

21 interpret --

government, which enabled the revolt against the 

6 British. 

7  MR. GURA: That's correct, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any -- is there 

9 any record evidence that the anti-Federalist objections 

to the Constitution that ultimately resulted in the 

11 Second Amendment were premised on any failure to 

12 recognize an individual right of self-defense or hunting 

13 or whatnot, as distinct from being premised on concern 

14 about the power of the national government and the 

militia clauses in Article 1? 

16  MR. GURA: Yes, Justice Souter. If we look 

17 to, for example, the -- the demands of the Pennsylvania 

18 minority, the anti-Federalists there were extremely 

19 influential. They couched their demands in unmistakably 

self-defense terms. In fact, they added a provision --

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but they didn't -- they 

22 didn't limit it to self-defense. I mean, what provoked 

23 it, as I understand it, was concern about the militia 

24 clauses, and here I mean you're certainly correct. I 

agree with you. Pennsylvania went beyond that. It

1 was -- it was one of three States, as I understand, that 

2 did go beyond it. But the provocation for getting into 

3 the subject, as I understand it, was, in each instance 

4 including Pennsylvania, concern over the national 

government's power over militias under Article 1. 

6  MR. GURA: Justice Souter, we wouldn't see 

7 the history that way. Certainly there is agreement that 

8 the militia clauses in the Constitution were 

9 controversial. And there were separate amendments that 

were proposed and always rejected that would have 

11 addressed that explicitly. In fact, if we look at 

12 Virginia's proposals, it's agreed by the Petitioners 

13 that Virginia was the model for the Bill of Rights and 

14 specifically, of course, for the Second Amendment.

 We saw one set of proposed amendments from 

16 Virginia entitled Bill of Rights, and the Second 

17 Amendment language comes from paragraph 17 of that Bill 

18 of Rights. And then we see a list of other amendments, 

19 and then we have the 11th proposed amendment, which 

speaks exactly to the -- reverting control over the 

21 militia back to the -- back to the States. 

22  Now, there is no reason to suppose that 

23 Virginia would have made the same demand twice, that 

24 they would have, like all the other demands, it had 

separate "keep and bear arms" provisions and separate

1 militia provisions, that people were being duplicative 

2 for no reason. The fact is that the militia concerns 

3 were heard and they were voted down, and the Second 

4 Amendment concerns were the ones that the Federalists 

were easily agreeable to because the right to keep and 

6 bear arms by individuals was not controversial, it would 

7 not have altered the structure of our Constitution, and 

8 so those were agreed to quite readily. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't the 

trigger-lock provisions that are at issue here, why 

11 aren't they similar to the various provisions that 

12 Justice Breyer mentioned like the gunpowder restriction? 

13 In other words, for reasons of domestic safety, they 

14 said you can't store the gunpowder anywhere but on the 

top floor. Why isn't the modern trigger-lock provision 

16 similar to those? 

17  MR. GURA: Well, it's not similar because 

18 the modern trigger-lock provisions are aimed squarely at 

19 self-defense in the home. There is no risk today that 

the kind of powder we use --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is 

22 always a risk that the children will get up and grab the 

23 firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the 

24 Second Amendment was designed to protect.

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. But, I 

mean, you don't necessarily expect a young child to be 

6 able to reassemble the pistol. 

7  MR. GURA: That's true, Your Honor. 

8 However, better safe storage approach is the one used by 

9 the majority of jurisdictions, I believe, that do have 

such laws, which is to require safe storage, for 

11 example, in a safe. And that is a reasonable 

12 limitation. It's a strict scrutiny limitation. 

13 Whatever standard of view we may wish to apply, I think, 

14 would encompass a safe storage provision.

 But this is not a safe storage provision 

16 because we have specific exceptions that allow you to 

17 actually use the firearm in recreational shooting and 

18 also in a place of business. And we have litigation 

19 history from Washington, D.C., that tells us that we are 

not supposed to have an operable firearm for purposes of 

21 self-defense because they simply do not trust people to 

22 defend themselves in our home. And -- and self-defense 

23 is the heart of the Second Amendment right. That is 

24 what Blackstone was getting at when he spoke of the 

fifth auxiliary right to arms, because it protected the

that and were not accepted by the authors of the Second

7  MR. GURA: Which provisions were those, 

8 Justice Stevens? 

9  JUSTICE STEVENS: Pennsylvania.

 MR. GURA: Well, Pennsylvania's provision 

11 was certainly influential. Remember, Madison was trying 

12 to mollify the anti-Federalists' concerns. The Second 

13 Amendment is clearly addressed to Pennsylvania and New 

14 Hampshire and New York and all these other States that 

were demanding a right to keep and bear arms, and there 

16 was always understood to be an individual right because 

17 that is the way in which the right that was violated by 

18 the British in the war of revolution that occurred not 

19 too long ago. And --

I'm finished.

22 with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in

1 to be deciding that kind of question rather than the

4 issue here and a problem with respect to having courts 

make the kinds of decisions about who is right or not in 

6 that trigger-lock argument? 

7  MR. GURA: When a fundamental right is at 

8 stake, there is a role for judicial review, Your Honor. 

9 We are not going to see a thousand judges review such 

laws because Washington, D.C.'s is the only example of 

11 it. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's a fundamental 

13 right, what about licensing? One piece -- we've talked 

14 about trigger locks, we've talked about the ban on 

handguns, but there is also a requirement that there be 

16 a license for possession of a handgun. Assuming you're 

17 right on the first question, that you couldn't flatly 

18 ban handguns, what about a requirement that you obtain a 

19 license to carry -- to have a handgun?

 MR. GURA: Justice Ginsburg, that would 

21 depend on the licensing law itself. We don't have a 

22 problem with the concept of licensing so long as it's 

23 done --

4  MR. GURA: So long as the licensing law is 

not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner, so 

6 long as there are some hopefully objective standards and 

7 hopefully some process for --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It just says -- it says 

9 you have to get a license if you want to possess a gun. 

What kind of standard? It just says you have to have a 

11 license. 

12  MR. GURA: Well, the government could set 

13 reasonable standards for that, Your Honor. The 

14 government could require, for example, knowledge of the 

State's use of force laws. They can require some sort 

16 of vision test. They could require, perhaps, 

17 demonstrated competency. And those are the types of 

18 things that we sometimes see; background checks, of 

19 course. Those are going to be reasonable licensing 

requirements. 

21  However, if the license requirement is we 

22 only wanted to give licenses to people who look a 

23 certain way or depends on how we feel or if the 

24 licensing office is only open Thursdays at 3:00 in the

extent, except the word "unreasonable" is the one that 

6 troubles us because we don't know what this unreasonable 

7 standard looks like. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't put it that 

9 way. You would just say it is not being infringed if 

reasonable limitations are placed upon it. 

11  MR. GURA: That's another way to look at it, 

12 Your Honor. Certainly --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you would define 

14 "reasonable" in light of the restrictions that existed 

at the time the amendment was adopted. 

16  MR. GURA: Those restrictions --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, you can't 

18 take it into the marketplace was one restriction. So 

19 that would be -- we are talking about lineal descendents 

of the arms but presumably there are lineal descendents 

21 of the restrictions as well. 

22  MR. GURA: Framing our practices would 

23 inform the kind of restrictions that would be accepted. 

24 But even beyond that, they also inform the contours of 

the right. In the Fifth Circuit, for example, we have

1 the Emerson decision now for seven years, and the way 

2 that that court has examined the Second Amendment when 

3 they get these felon and possession bans and drug addict 

4 and possession challenges, what they say is, these 

people simply are outside the right, as historically 

6 understood in our country. And that's a very important 

7 aspect to remember, that the Second Amendment is part of 

8 our common law tradition, and we look to framing our 

9 practices in traditional understandings of that right to 

see both the reasonableness of the restrictions that are 

11 available as well as the contours. 

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: Can we also look to current 

13 conditions like current crime statistics? 

14  MR. GURA: To some extent, Your Honor, but 

we have certainly --

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can they consider the 

17 extent of the murder rate in Washington, D.C., using 

18 handguns? 

19  MR. GURA: If we were to consider the extent 

of the murder rate with handguns, the law would not 

21 survive any type of review, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: All the more reason to 

23 allow a homeowner to have a handgun.

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: The question is whether 

3 they may consider those statistics, and I take it your 

4 answer is yes?

 MR. GURA: Well, those statistics might be 

6 considered in some way, the fact is that at some point 

7 there is a role for judicial review. And you can't just 

8 grab at statistics -- and some of the statistics that 

9 were used here are very weak, and studies that have been 

rejected by the National Academy of Sciences repeatedly. 

11 I mean, we don't really have -- it's hard to say that 

12 those laws --

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: But I think -- I don't want 

14 you to misunderstand my question. My question is that 

by looking to the statistics, I'm not suggesting that 

16 there is only sort of one reasonable response to them. 

17 I want to know whether -- whether the policymakers may 

18 look to them; and I take it your answer is yes? 

19  MR. GURA: To some degree, yes, policymakers 

have to be informed by what's going on in order to make 

21 policy. However, there are constitutional limitations 

22 enforced by courts that are going to limit those 

23 policies. And when you have a ban which bans 40 percent 

24 of all weapons that are the type of weapons used by 

civilians, 80 percent of all self-defense occurs with

1 handguns; when you have that kind of ban, functional 

2 firearms ban, these are extreme measures --

3  JUSTICE SOUTER: They may be. I just want 

4 to make sure you're not making the argument that because 

there was not a comparable homicide rate, or for that 

6 matter, a comparable need for self-defense from handgun 

7 use in 1792, that there -- 1790 -- that therefore, the 

8 statistics of today may not be considered? You're not 

9 making that argument?

 MR. GURA: No, Your Honor, the fact is that 

11 we can always debate these things, but the object of the 

12 Bill of Rights is to remove certain judgments from the 

13 legislature, because we can make policy arguments, 

14 normative arguments about many provisions of the 

Constitution. But to make those arguments and say, 

16 well, we've decided as a matter of policy that the right 

17 to keep and bear arms is no longer a good idea and, 

18 therefore, we are going to have restrictions that 

19 violate that stricture in the Bill of Rights, that 

shouldn't pass judicial review. At some point you have 

21 to go to Article 5 if you think that the Constitution is 

22 impractical.

3  MR. GURA: Yes, Your Honor. 

4  JUSTICE STEVENS: And how about a State 

university wants to ban students having arms in the 

6 dormitory? 

7  MR. GURA: Certainly that creates some sort 

8 of an evidentiary record. Conceivably that --

That's what -- a State regulation prohibits students 

11 from having arms on campus.

17 from what we have here. We have here a ban on all guns, 

18 for all people, in all homes, at all times in the

too sweeping under any level of review.

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, I want to 

2 address first why this law is reasonable and should be 

3 sustained, and why the judgement below has to be 

4 reversed, however, whatever position you take on the 

theories of the amendment. And in defending the eminent 

6 reasonableness and careful balance of this law, I need 

7 to start with the trigger law, about which Justice Alito 

8 asked. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you 

start with it, how many minutes does it take to remove a 

11 trigger lock and load a gun? Because both the gun has 

12 to be unloaded; it has to have a trigger lock under the 

13 District laws. 

14  MR. DELLINGER: Those are alternatives, Mr. 

Chief Justice. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, disassembled --

17  MR. DELLINGER: Just a trigger lock. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In either case it 

19 has to be unloaded, correct?

 MR. DELLINGER: There are some versions of 

21 the trigger lock that allow you to put the trigger lock 

22 on and then load the gun. But the piece that goes in 

23 the trigger mechanism, even someone as clumsy as I could 

24 remove it and effect it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the law, as I

1 understand it, says that the gun has to be unloaded. So 

2 under your hypothetical, I assume that would violate the 

3 District's law if the gun is still loaded. 

4  MR. DELLINGER: You know, it's a question of 

where you put the parenthesis. I read that as 

6 disassembled and unloaded or under a trigger lock, and 

7 that's the, that's the way the District --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how long does it 

9 take? If your interpretation is correct, how long does 

it take to remove the trigger lock and make the gun 

11 operable. 

12  MR. DELLINGER: You -- you place a trigger 

13 lock on and it has -- the version I have, a few -- you 

14 can buy them at 17th Street Hardware -- has a code, like 

a three-digit code. You turn to the code and you pull 

16 it apart. That's all it takes. Even -- it took me 3 

17 seconds. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: You turn on, you turn on 

19 the lamp next to your bed so you can -- you can turn the 

knob at 3-22-95, and so somebody --

21  MR. DELLINGER: Well --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it like that? Is 

23 it a numerical code? 

24  MR. DELLINGER: Yes, you can have one with a 

numerical code.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then you turn on 

2 the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses --

3  (Laughter.) 

4  MR. DELLINGER: Let me tell you. That's 

right. Let me tell you why at the end of the day this 

6 doesn't -- this doesn't matter, for two reasons. The 

7 lesson --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may not matter, 

9 but I'd like some idea about how long it takes.

 MR. DELLINGER: It took me 3 seconds. I'm 

11 not kidding. It's -- it's not that difficult to do it. 

12 That was in daylight. 

13  The other version is just a loop that goes 

14 through the chamber with a simple key. You have the key 

and put it together. Now, of course if you're going --

16 if you want to have your weapon loaded and assembled, 

17 that's a different matter. 

18  But here's where I want to address the 

19 trigger lock. Here's why it doesn't matter for the 

handgun law. The District believes that what is 

21 important here is the ban on handguns. And it also 

22 believes that you're entitled to have a functional, 

23 usable weapon for self-defense in the home, and that's 

24 why this is a very proportionate law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if 

84
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 proportionate, in other words you're saying your 

2 interest is allowing self-defense in the home --

3  MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it really make 

sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as 

6 opposed to a pistol? 

7  MR. DELLINGER: It is -- there has been no 

8 showing here that a rifle or a shotgun is inadequate for 

9 the purposes of self-defense in this facial challenge.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to show 

11 that the District Council ever considered the issue of 

12 self-defense? That -- because they banned handguns and 

13 they had this provision on the trigger lock which -- and 

14 the issue -- my question with the trigger lock doesn't 

have to do with whether trigger locks are generally a 

16 good idea. It's whether you're ever allowed to take it 

17 off for purposes of defense. There's no -- is there 

18 anything to show that the -- that the council actually 

19 considered what sort of weapon is appropriate for 

self-defense? 

21  MR. DELLINGER: There are decisions in the 

22 District of Columbia about the right of self-defense 

23 that apply to this. But here's the most important 

24 point. It cannot affect the validity of the handgun 

law. If you disagree with us that my statements are not 

85
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 sufficient to say that we believe that the law should be 

2 read, given the self-defense compulsion, to allow 

3 whatever use makes it functional, if you don't agree 

4 with that and if you think there's a controversy on this 

point, because we believe you should have a functional 

6 firearm available in the home of law-abiding citizens 

7 who wish one, if we are wrong about that and the trigger 

8 lock is invalid, that has no effect on the handgun ban. 

9  That is to say, the trigger lock applies to 

all weapons. If it's valid and it means what they say 

11 it does, none of the weapons would work. We don't need 

12 a handgun; it's unusable. If it's invalid or if it has 

13 the construction we believe, it cannot possibly affect 

14 the handgun law. If you strike down the trigger lock 

law, you're throwing us in the briar patch where we 

16 think it's where we're happy to be if all we have to do 

17 is to make clear in the trigger lock law what we have 

18 said here today, that it's, it's available for 

19 self-defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a related 

21 point. Do you understand the ban -- the carry ban to 

22 apply if you carry the firearm from one room in the 

23 house to another? 

24  MR. DELLINGER: That only applies if it's --

if it's unregistered. Now, you can't register a

1 handgun, you can't carry a handgun, but that's because 

2 its both -- its possession is prohibited. That is to 

3 say you can't carry marijuana or heroin from one room to 

4 the other either, because you can't use it at all, I 

think. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is the -- why is 

7 the D.C. law phrased in those terms? In other words, if 

8 you can't have a handgun at all, why do you have a 

9 separate provision saying that you can't carry it 

anywhere? 

11  MR. DELLINGER: Well, it's -- it's -- the 

12 carry provision, you cannot carry unregistered firearms. 

13 That's just a general requirement, that firearms be 

14 registered. You're not allowed to register handguns is 

the mechanism by which they are prohibited. 

16  Now, here is -- to address your question 

17 about why a ban is unreasonable, the one thing we know 

18 the Second Amendment is not about is it's not about the 

19 interest of collectors. Some people collect guns the 

way they do stamps, and if that were what the amendment 

21 were about then prohibiting someone from having a 

22 particular type of gun would prevent them from 

23 completing the set. But the notion --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that 

covered by the provision that you have the right to keep 

87

1 arms? 

2  MR. DELLINGER: Well, the word "keep" would 

3 encompass -- "keep" can encompass every use of an arm, 

4 and that's why it provides no limit at all, unless you 

read it in combination with "keep and bear" and that in 

6 combination with "well-regulated militia." 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean you can't have any 

8 more arms than you would need to take with you to the 

9 militia? You can't have a -- you can't have a -- you 

know, a turkey gun and a duck gun and a 30.06 and a 270 

11 and -- you know, different -- different hunting guns for 

12 different --

13  MR. DELLINGER: Well --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't do that? I mean 

a State could say you don't --

16  MR. DELLINGER: Of course you could do that. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: You can have to have a 12 

18 gauge and that's it. 

19  MR. DELLINGER: And like the District that 

allows that, as every State does. There are --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- at least to me the 

22 question is, what would be the constitutional basis for 

23 insisting on Justice Scalia's suggestion that you need a 

24 number of guns? You have argued, it seems to me, that 

the District or a government could prohibit just what he

1 said, unless you needed one to take to the militia. 

2  MR. DELLINGER: I do not know why that would 

3 pass the reasonableness scrutiny, but this law would 

4 because a powerful, overwhelming case could be made that 

you're eliminating the one type of weapon -- this law is 

6 -- is designed only for the weapon that is concealable 

7 and movable, that can be taken into schools and onto the 

8 Metro, can be easily stolen and transmitted among --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking about the 

constitutional standard you apply to a hypothetical 

11 statute which would prohibit the guns Justice Scalia 

12 described. What is your position as to the validity of 

13 such a hypothetical law? 

14  MR. DELLINGER: You would apply this 

standard. You would ask whether the ban is one that's 

16 carefully balanced considerations of gun ownership and 

17 public safety. I don't see how, once we are in the land 

18 where you -- where there is a right, there is a far 

19 weaker case if there is any need for public safety to --

to limit the number of guns one has. Here there is an 

21 overwhelming case and we are talking about local 

22 legislation. 

23  I know, Justice Kennedy, that you would be 

24 concerned about a national government which sets a 

single standard for rural and urban areas, for East and

1 West, North and South. Here you have legislation that 

2 is adopted by a group of citizens in the District, 

3 operating under the authority of Congress, but it is 

4 local legislation. And if it's still good law, that 

States and local governments across the country can 

6 strike these balances, as they have, it would be deeply 

7 ironic to preclude the District of Columbia as being the 

8 only place that could enact legislation free of the 

9 strictures of the Second Amendment.

 And when you ask about the statistics, what 

11 is critical here is not to apply the kind of categorical 

12 standard the court below did or a kind of strict 

13 scrutiny that would strike this law down. This is an 

14 area, unlike areas where government regulation is 

presumptively illegitimate, this text contemplates 

16 regulation of inherently dangerous weapons. And where 

17 the battle -- the great battle over methodology, to 

18 which Justice Breyer replied, in these briefs --

19 indicates that this is the kind of right -- where you 

have disputes among experts, it's a kind of right where 

21 even if you recognize it, deference needs to be given to 

22 the legislative resolution rather than have courts try 

23 to decide how best to resolve the statistical and 

24 methodological debates.
