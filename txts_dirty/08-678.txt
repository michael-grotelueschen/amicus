 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-678, Mohawk Industries v. 

Carpenter.

 Mr. Allen.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For well over a century this Court has 

recognized the importance of the attorney-client 

privilege. In Hunt v. Blackburn in 1888, the Court 

clearly states that the seal of secrecy upon 

communications between client and attorney is founded 

upon the necessity, in the interest of justice, that the 

aid and advice of persons having knowledge and skill in 

the practice of law provide that advice in a manner that 

is safely and readily available and, importantly, free 

from the consequences or apprehension of disclosure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Allen, except for the 

fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think 

that the -- that confidentiality right is any more 

important to the proper functioning of society than, 

let's say, the protection of trade secrets? So that in

a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I 

produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and 

it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, 

turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to 

interlocutory appeal in that case? And if not there, 

then why here?

 MR. ALLEN: Justice Scalia, there are --

there are several answers to the question. Let me 

start, first, with the -- the issue of the importance of 

-- of the attorney-client privilege as a key and central 

element of the administration of justice that this Court 

has recognized, not just with Hunt, but in a number of 

cases since.

 But the question I think also goes more to 

prong three of Cohen, which is the reviewability 

standard. In the context of attorney-client privileged 

information, once that information is disclosed to your 

adversary, it is disclosed to the last person on earth 

you might want to see it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing with a trade 

secret. It is a suit between another company who is a 

competitor of yours --

MR. ALLEN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Judge says, turn 

over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and

you say no. No interlocutory appeal, right?

 MR. ALLEN: I think with trade secrets --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or do you say there should 

be an interlocutory appeal there?

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, we do not argue 

that -- here, that there should be an interlocutory 

appeal for trade secrets. I think the practical 

resolution to the trade secret question is present in 

most cases of commercial litigation, where the court 

would provide a protective order limiting access to the 

trade secret; in other words, limiting access to 

counsel.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what if the court 

doesn't, as Justice Scalia has posited? The court here 

could do the same thing, depending on the secret being 

disclosed. It could set up any number of protective 

mechanisms.

 The issue is broader than that, which is: 

Why is the public policy of anti-disclosure any more 

important in the attorney-client privilege than in the 

trade secret context?

 MR. ALLEN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. But, 

with regard to the attorney-client privilege, first on 

the issue of the protective order, the protective order 

cannot limit the adversary's counsel from seeing the

information.

 As I said earlier, I think that's the last 

person in the world you would want to see. You could 

limit access to trade secrets to counsel, who could make 

no use of the Coca-Cola formula or -- or Colonel 

Sanders' chicken recipe, but -- but the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ah. Are you sure?

 MR. ALLEN: But -- but the answer to the --

the importance question, I think, has to return to the 

central and important role that the privilege plays in 

the administration of justice.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't the role --

the central role -- role, is to encourage the frank and 

open communication between client and attorney? That's 

the purpose of the rule, isn't it?

 MR. ALLEN: It -- it is the purpose of the 

rule, at least in part, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that is 

the purpose, the very existence of exceptions infringes 

that purpose. The minute you create an exception, you 

are placing some sort of limitation to the frank and 

open discussion that you are permitting, so the damage 

is already done.

 The further disclosure doesn't really serve 

the purpose -- or help the purpose in any meaningful

way. The fact that an erroneous decision on 

attorney-client disclosure is not going to stop people 

from talking to lawyers if they really need to and they 

are staying within the rules.

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I -- don't think we 

are here to suggest that it would stop people from 

talking to their lawyers. I think the point is that the 

incremental erosion of the rule is going to lessen the 

value of the privilege. At this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- but that's what 

I'm trying to figure out, because you are positing that 

erroneous decisions on disclosures are being made 

routinely by the lower courts.

 Assuming, as I do, that there are some 

erroneous disclosures, but that that's not necessarily 

the majority, why is there an incremental erosion 

significant enough to overcome our interests in the 

finality rule?

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't think we 

suggest that -- that erroneous orders on privilege are 

occurring routinely. Certainly, we have suggested they 

occurred in this case and that they happened in other 

cases.

 But I think the more direct answer to your 

question goes to the Court's holding in Upjohn. One of

the things that Upjohn points out is that what is 

necessary -- and I think the Court makes a similar 

observation in Swidler & Berlin, that one of the things 

that's necessary for the privilege to have effect is 

predictability.

 If -- if there is no predictability, then 

you fall back to the apprehension or the worry of 

disclosure that is observed in Hunt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Let's talk about 

predictability. Once you make an exception for waiver, 

there is already that limitation. It's not absolute. 

Maybe it can be waived.

 Secondly, you have to worry about a district 

court finding it to have been waived, even though it 

really wasn't. That's another point of doubt.

 And, thirdly, you have to worry about the 

Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly 

found it to have been waived because we give, you know, 

weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district 

court.

 Once you -- once you factor in all of those 

uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, 

about a fail-safe privilege at all. There are those 

doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased 

enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a

mistake without -- without your being able to go up to 

the court of appeals on that mistake.

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, I don't disagree 

that -- that the rule we search for will not still have 

problems with the protection of the attorney-client 

privilege, but I do disagree that it will not 

significantly improve the quality of the rules that 

counsel are -- are designed -- or counsel are -- are 

instructed to follow.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, you used a 

term before, and I think you were right in using it --

you said, "interlocutory review," but 

Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the 

theory is, it is a final judgment. It's not 

interlocutory.

 And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b). 

They can certify a question, if they think it's 

sufficiently important and they need an answer, without 

pretending that it's a final judgment in the case.

 So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be 

particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to 

include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully 

denied?

 MR. ALLEN: No, Justice Ginsburg. I don't 

believe that you do. I used the term "interlocutory"

only to refer to the fact that the appeal would take 

place while the case-in-chief proceeds.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what 1292(b) 

was meant to deal with.

 MR. ALLEN: I don't think 1292 would --

would obtain, in this instance, and I think the -- the 

judge in the district court made this observation 

himself, although he did not expound on his reasoning.

 It would appear that the reasoning would be 

that this -- that a decision in this case is not likely 

to materially advance the ultimate determination of the 

litigation, so, therefore, I think 1292(b) would not be 

applicable in the ordinary case to a -- to a ruling 

finding waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you think that 

your -- that this privilege -- or is it -- more 

important than any other privilege? I mean, Justice 

Scalia's question and your answer convinced me that you 

can protect this the same as you can any other trade 

secret -- any trade secret.

 Of course, you do disclose it to the 

opposing party, but that is also true of any breach of 

any privilege, so husband-wife, priest-penitent, 

psychiatrist and patient. I take all of those are 

privileged. Do we allow collateral appeals there?

MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, you have not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we don't allow 

collateral appeals with the husband and wife, with the 

priest and -- and someone in -- you know, confession or 

something, I don't -- with a priest, or with a 

psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient, why would we 

allow collateral appeal here?

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, first of all, I 

don't think the issue of those other privileges has, to 

the best of my knowledge, come before this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But then if we grant your 

collateral appeal, don't we have to, perhaps, equally 

grant it in every situation, where a judge arguably 

makes an erroneous ruling on a question of privilege?

 MR. ALLEN: I don't believe you do, Your 

Honor, and let me say, first of all, the -- the instance 

that Your Honor points to, where the information would 

be disclosed to the other party, it's not the other 

party in this instance, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's the lawyer.

 MR. ALLEN: -- that you are worried about in 

first instance. It is, in fact, the counsel. And --

and, second of all, I think the importance criteria 

as -- as previously defined in this Court's cases, is a 

measure of the importance of the interest that will be

lost if appeal is not available now.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's -- in your opinion, 

it's more important to protect the lawyers, who talk to 

clients, from erroneous rulings, than protect the priest 

or protect the wife or husband or protect the 

psychiatrist who is dealing with a patient?

 Now, that's hard for me to see why. I mean, 

I think lawyers are very important, but it's a little 

hard to see why they are more important than these other 

people.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the use --

I'm -- I'm sorry if I cut you off.

 But what is the use by the adversary lawyer 

that you are worried about? That the lawyer is going to 

used information against your client, correct?

 MR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is a remedy. 

After final judgment, if the information was disclosed 

erroneously, the court sets aside the judgment, sends it 

back, and says, you can't use it in the future and so 

make your case without it.

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, that -- I apologize.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that an 

effective remedy for the harm that you are claiming 

exists in the disclosure?

MR. ALLEN: That is the analysis that the 

Eleventh Circuit applied, and I think it was incorrect 

for the following reasons: First of all, it treats the 

attorney-client privilege as if it is a use privilege, 

as you describe it in your questioning. It is not a use 

privilege. It's a right to be free from compelled 

disclosure. So returning to -- to trial is not going to 

undisclose the information that's already --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have to a right to 

choose your lawyer and not to be -- and not to be 

represented by a -- by a different lawyer, and yet we 

don't permit that to be interlocutorily appealed.

 MR. ALLEN: That's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is this any greater 

in terms of the harm that your client suffers?

 MR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor, but 

in the attorney-client privilege cases, this Court did 

not find that collateral order jurisdiction did not 

obtain because of the fact that the attorney-client 

privilege or the attorney-client -- excuse me --

disqualification cases were not important. The Court's 

ruling was premised upon the fact that that order was 

sufficiently reviewable under prong three of Cohen. So 

it's not -- the decisions were not based on Cohen --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand what the

court below did. I'm just following up on your point 

about the importance of this privilege and why it's 

critical that it be subject to interlocutory appeal as 

opposed to the final judgment ruling.

 MR. ALLEN: Justice Sotomayor, the -- the 

importance in this instance is -- is measured against 

the societal importance or the societal need for 

non-piecemeal application of the final judgment rule. 

So when you measure the attorney-client privilege and 

the role that it plays in the administration of justice 

in ensuring observance with laws against a rule of 

efficiency, in this instance in our view, the 

attorney-client privilege weighs heavier in that 

consideration.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not -- it's not a 

rule of efficiency. It's a firm final judgment rule 

that we have in the Federal system. And we are talking 

about a narrow exception. The exception was first 

declared in Cohen v. Beneficial. The question there was 

security for costs, yes or no? Does that -- that is a 

pure question of law. It doesn't depend on the variety 

of factual circumstances. Attorney-client is quite 

different because it can often be fact-bound. It 

depends upon this particular case.

 Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind

of question that doesn't get you into the facts. 

Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound 

question, you are really eroding the final judgment 

rule.

 MR. ALLEN: I understand your question, 

Justice Ginsburg. I think in this instance, the facts 

that the Court would need to consider are sufficiently 

narrow that it should not trouble the final judgment 

rule and sufficiently collateral --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are carving out 

an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the 

kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with. 

Here's a rule that a State has. You have to put up 

security for costs before you go ahead with a class 

action. The answer to that is either yes or no, that it 

either requires it or it doesn't require it. No facts 

at all. You just have a class action, you need security 

for costs.

 Maybe this particular case doesn't involve 

many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges 

cases, waiver cases that surely do. So we can't take 

that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it 

to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.

 MR. ALLEN: I agree, Justice Ginsburg that 

that was the kind of narrow issue that was at issue

in -- in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial. But this Court 

has considered much more factually intensive cases in 

the context of qualified immunity or maybe as a better 

example, the context of the double jeopardy claim such 

as in Abney.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because those are cases 

that say your right is not to be tried, your right is 

not to be exposed to trial at all.

 MR. ALLEN: That is correct, Your Honor. My 

only point is that the appellate courts are perfectly 

capable and able to consider the facts that are at issue 

in those cases, and it does not unduly burden the 

appellate process in the context of those type of cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two yes or no 

questions? One, did you, in fact, ask for a 1292(b) 

right to appeal, make an interlocutory appeal?

 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, we did not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the second question 

is, would your rule apply if the decision had gone the 

other way? If they had denied access to the documents, 

would the other -- would the person seeking discovery 

have the same right to appeal that you asked for here?

 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor, the -- the party 

losing the claim would not have the same right to 

appeal.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?

 MR. ALLEN: I think access to information in 

the course of discovery does not trigger the same 

important interest that orders compelling discovery of 

attorney-client would trigger? So I don't think that 

they would in any way satisfy that test. And I think, 

in fact, the question presented as designed even by 

Respondent does not capture orders that deny the 

disclosure of attorney-client privilege information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some time ago 

Justice Breyer asked the question of why is this 

different than the other privileges, and I would like 

your answer to that.

 MR. ALLEN: Justice Breyer, I think that the 

answer to that question has to focus on the role that 

the privilege plays in the administration of justice, 

and it's why I went, in response to Justice Sotomayor's 

question, why I went to the balancing between the 

interest of the attorney-client privilege versus the 

interest of a more rigorous application of the final 

judgment rule.

 So -- so, while I think it is instructive to 

compare the privilege to other privileges that the Court 

may in the future confront, I think the proper analysis 

is to balance that, that rigorous application of the

final judgment rule, to the attorney-client privilege. 

And I think in that instance it resolves more quickly.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen, one of the 

purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of 

Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not 

going to come up very often, but attorney-client 

privilege, once you say that that's open to --

everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to 

get that. And if you -- and if we hold the way you want 

us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she 

thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or 

that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to 

take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal 

of right.

 MR. ALLEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

believe that the attorney would be obligated to take the 

appeal. And I believe that the -- that the facts that 

we've laid out in our brief with regard to what has 

actually occurred -- we wonder how many appeals might 

take place. We know how many appeals might take place, 

because we have the experience in the Third and the 

Ninth and the D.C. Circuits that tell us that in the

up on appeal. So, we have some experience to tell us 

what will actually happen.

 But I don't believe it requires that the 

attorney as a matter of obligation take that appeal. 

The Court, I believe, dealt with this same issue in the 

Behrens v. Pelletier case, which is a qualified immunity 

case, where the Court wondered whether or not there were 

going to be an increase, a significant increase in 

the -- the appeals that arose out of -- out of the 

Court's holding. And the Court observed that the only 

conclusion that could be reached -- and I believe the 

Court quoted in that opinion the opinion of Judge 

Easterbrook in the Able case in the Seventh Circuit --

that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that 

there was forebearance by the lawyers in taking appeals 

that they otherwise had the opportunity to take. I 

think there is no reason to conclude that there would be 

a difference in the analysis in -- in the case here.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- just so I'm 

clear about your position, are you arguing that all 

issues related to attorney-client, whether they are 

waiver, crime or fraud, scope of the privilege, 

et cetera, that all issues are immediately appealable 

because the public interest is the same in all cases 

related to the attorney-client privilege, or are you

wanting us to limit this rule only to the waiver cases?

 MR. ALLEN: Correct, Your Honor. We have 

asked that the Court address, in this instance, the 

question presented having to do with only waiver cases.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- but your position 

logically would apply to everything, wouldn't it?

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Otherwise, how do we 

distinguish or make a difference in your analysis?

 MR. ALLEN: I think it's certainly -- it 

certainly should be assumed that if this Court rules in 

our favor, it must conclude that the attorney-client 

privilege is important. If it concludes that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No one is doubting its 

importance. The issue is whether or that importance 

outweighs the finality rule. That's a very different 

thing for you.

 MR. ALLEN: I -- I agree. But -- but in 

order to get to -- to the position we advocate, the 

Court must pass that threshold and establish importance. 

If the Court reaches that conclusion it is certainly 

likely that the importance test in other existence-of-

privilege cases, for example, would obtain.

 I -- I don't think that compels the 

conclusion that any case addressing privilege must

therefore be permitted collateral order jurisdiction. 

For example, I believe you recited the crime fraud 

exception in your question. Certainly crime fraud 

exception might present a difficulty with prong two of 

the Cohen analysis, which has to do with the 

separability of the issue on appeal for merit. So it 

may well be that in crime fraud cases there is not 

sufficient separability of the issue from the merits and 

therefore collateral order jurisdiction would not 

obtain.

 As I mentioned earlier, I think we are in 

agreement that orders that deny the disclosure of 

information would not be immediately appealable. So 

there are -- there are a number of instances that this 

Court might find in what I'll call general privilege 

cases that might not obtain, and it's the course that 

the Court has taken in other sort of general areas of 

law. For example, in the attorney disqualification 

cases, the Court started off in Firestone finding that 

orders denying disqualification did not satisfy 

collateral order jurisdiction and it limited its 

holdings to -- to that instance.

 In Flanagan it took up the question of 

whether or not collateral order jurisdiction obtained in 

disqualification cases and criminal cases, and in

Richardson-Merrell in civil cases. So the Court has 

traditionally taken, if you will, the facts of the case 

presented to them and limited its rulings to the facts 

of those cases. We suggest that approach in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any sensible 

line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and 

a holding that the privilege has been waived?  I know in 

your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a 

distinction between waiver of the privilege and the 

existence of the privilege. I didn't follow it.

 MR. ALLEN: Other than the examples that I 

--- that I just gave, Your Honor, I don't think there is 

a principled difference between the finding of 

importance, and that is -- that is clearly a threshold 

issue. As Court said in Will, it's the -- the -- what 

the issues ultimately boil down to.

 So with regard to that issue I -- I agree, 

but with regard to crime fraud exception or instances 

when no disclosure is ordered, another example that I 

think the Respondent points to in their brief is 

instances of inadvertent disclosure. Instances of 

inadvertent disclosure would not trigger the -- the 

prejudice element necessary because the -- if you will, 

the cat is in fact already out of the bag at that point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is another. You

are stressing the importance of the attorney-client 

relationship, the work of the attorney. Do you extend 

your position to work product? It's not privileged.

 MR. ALLEN: No, Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's certainly --

it's certainly protected against disclosure.

 MR. ALLEN: We do not extend the -- the rule 

that we advocate to work product in the -- in the broad 

sense. Certainly there are exceptions within Rule 26 to 

when work product can in fact under the right 

circumstances be disclosed. So we are not embracing the 

-- the work product as a general rule. Certainly the 

mental impressions of client -- of counsel, which is the 

important exclusion of the work product doctrine in Rule 

26, we would embrace as a -- as an appropriate 

limitation on the rule that we are advocating.

 Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further 

questions, may I reserve the remainder of my time?

appeal as of right for privilege or waiver, and most of 

the circuits continue that approach. That is the right 

approach because attorney-client privilege cases do not 

fit the parameters of the Cohen appealability and there 

are alternative responses that are available on the 

remedial side. In terms of the Cohen factors, the 

factor of importance which has just been discussed here, 

this Court has over the 60 years of some 30 opinions 

refined the importance test and moved it away from the 

questions of place, shape of litigation, dynamics of 

litigation, to a very narrow set of cases in which a 

government is typically a party or a government 

official, and there is a very significant either 

constitutional or statutory question principally of 

immunity from suit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will get to that, 

I think, when the government lawyer gets up. But does 

that distinction make sense to you?

 MS. RESNIK: I think the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government lawyers 

get the privilege, private lawyers don't?

 MS. RESNIK: As I understand the 

government's position here, it's that ordinary lawyers 

don't get the privilege in ordinary litigation. The 

government is here to speak to the question of State

secrets and particular kinds of particular official 

privileges, but not to the regular case. And I think 

it's important that we understand from the presence of 

them that this is a rule that is appropriate for lawyers 

on all sides of the fence, because the immediate 

availability of appeal as a right stops in the tracks. 

The case was decided at the district court in October of 

2007 and, holding aside these proceedings, it was August 

of 2008 when the Eleventh Circuit rejected the mandamus 

and the appeal.

 So the wisdom of the final judgment rule is 

precisely because the cost and delay, particularly in 

the area of discovery and evidentiary privileges, is so 

significant given that there are so many of these. And 

one of the important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we are talking 

about the central privilege to the maintenance of the 

adversary system which we've determined to be central to 

maintaining the rule of law. This is not like the other 

privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary 

privileges, because it is the privilege that allows 

lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases. 

And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single 

ruling by a district court judge to undermine the 

privilege is going to affect people.

What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer 

could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you 

are saying the district court can require the disclosure 

of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the 

court of appeals to check it out.

 MS. RESNIK: Well, there are remedies --

there are two directions for an answer. One is that in 

all the courts of appeal of the three circuits that have 

this rule, work product as well as attorney-client 

privilege is available on appeal in the Third Circuit. 

Trade secrets is available, although the Third Circuit 

has raised questions given Will v. Hallock and 

Cunningham about whether or not this remains a viable 

position, but trade secrets is available. 

Psychotherapists is appealable, spouse is appealable, 

and nontestifying experts as well. Which is the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is in the Third 

Circuit.

 MS. RESNIK: Well, the Third, the Ninth and 

the D.C. together are the three that have opened up the 

door, and they have found -- the experience of those 

appellate judges has not found that it is easy to make 

the distinction among these, and as a consequence there 

is appeal as of right to this entire cluster of cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Allen has told us

that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I 

don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.

 MS. RESNIK: Well, I take to be -- the 

cheerful news is that by and large everyone is getting 

it right at the trial level. But we are looking at the 

question -- first of all, one question would be how to 

count the cases of whether there's these other appeals 

as well.

 But more importantly, both the law professor 

and judge amici in our brief asked to look at the 

pipeline, and there are two levels of the pipeline, or 

three. One is that in the district courts we try to 

look at the numbers of instances when trial judges write 

opinions, magistrate and district judges, which is only 

the tip of that iceberg.

 As best we can tell, somewhere between 10 

and 30 times a month in Westlaw reports one can find a 

conclusion either upholding or denying disclosure. 

Moreover it's sequential --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it matters 

which they do, right? If they are denying disclosure 

the statistics don't mean much.

 MS. RESNIK: We found about half the cases, 

and the law professors amici and judges amici found 

about 104, in which in which disclosure was required, in

the six-month period. So there is a significant number 

at the trial level that exists in terms of the pipeline. 

If we go just to the case that is before you, the 

Federal district judge reserved question on a second 

attorney-client privilege question because issuing a 

protective order on the deposition, there is a related 

case here and he precluded the lawyers from 

participating in it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I was on the Third Circuit 

for eight years under this regime. And it didn't seem 

to me that the sky was falling. In fact I can't 

remember any cases, any appeals involving this issue, 

and we had lots of cases of a variety of kinds. So 

maybe there's -- I don't want to be a witness in this, 

but you know, convince me that the sky really will fall 

if we were to adopt this.

 MS. RESNIK: I am not going to convince you 

that the sky is going to fall, but I am going to suggest 

that the Cohen rule does not apply to these cases not 

only because the sky isn't going to fall. The empirical 

question is there will be more cases for sure and there 

will be more people with comparable privileges knocking 

at the appellate doors, and they'll be sorting, so that 

goes to the county. Do we count the cases that knocked 

and you said no to as well as the cases you said yes to.

The other case is that the Cohen rule 

requires a particular kind of importance and a 

particular kind of severability. In this case, the 

trial judge said, in fairness, there has been a waiver 

because you've injected new issues in the case. In 

order to get to the in fairness waiver injection, you 

have to know the facts of the case and weigh the waiver 

against the other facts in the case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So the Eleventh Circuit was 

wrong on that issue? Didn't they hold that this was --

this was separate from the merits?

 MS. RESNIK: In our view, every one of 

the -- this case fails the test on all four -- three to 

four of the Cohen prongs, which is separability and 

conclusiveness or -- or distinct ideas, potentially, 

importance, and remediability. And therefore, the 

embeddedness here is typical of cases, CrimeStar was an 

example already mentioned, in which the factual 

predicates are here. In terms of coming back to the 

piecemeals, in this case the trial judge reserved the 

question. The lawyers below have asked for a 

pre-ruling. The questions to be asked at the deposition 

will not waive attorney-client privilege. The trial 

judge said, I don't know the answer to that, it hasn't 

been fully breached and we don't know what you are going

to ask. Therefore, in this very case, if the rule were 

that you could appeal as a right, you could be back in 

this case twice to the Eleventh Circuit during the 

pendency of the case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Resnick, can you go 

back and articulate what you see as the rule that we 

have on what is important enough? Because that is what 

really is at question. So how would you articulate a 

rule that would apply both to the cases in which we have 

granted interlocutory appeal and to those that you are 

advocating we don't. Because it's not just freedom from 

suits like qualified immunity or double jeopardy. We 

have granted interlocutory appeal in other cases, 

including in the Cohen case.

 MS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen involved the major 

question of the application of the Erie principle in 

1949 involving a state -- the right of security for 

expenses. And I would take Cohen and the Vale case and 

the drugging case of Sell as instances in which, is the 

litigant, during the pendency of the case, going to be 

economically secure or free, or drugged or not drugged, 

as distinct qualities which are all framed in either 

State law or Constitutional premises. If we look over 

the course of the 60 years, the category is not neat. 

But the turning point is in 1978 with the Coopers

opinion which says death knell, which says strategic 

interactions, the shape of class actions, is not 

available for appeal as a right.

 In 1994, one might have thought of the 

digital case that a contract not to continue by -- just 

settle would have been within the set, but the Court 

said, no, that kind of private contractual interest is 

not sufficient.

 And in 2006, in the Will case, the court 

narrowed it again by saying the res judicata sequence is 

insufficient. So in the last decade the Cohen cases 

have come down to basically qualified immunity or 

Constitutionally-freighted -- structural or almost 

abstract, not interpersonal dynamics of the litigation, 

including contractual relationships or evidentiary 

privileges.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you suggesting 

that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way 

today if the question of security for costs, whether 

State or Federal, hadn't been settled?

 MS. RESNIK: Well, Cohen predates this --

the Congress's creation of 1292(b), which you mentioned 

earlier, Justice Ginsburg. And so what it is looking at 

is, when Cohen was initially decided it opened a window, 

but in the relationship between Court and Congress, the

judicial conference went to the Congress and said, We 

need a broader window, and Congress adopted verbatim in 

1958 the 1292(b) criteria which, clearly, Cohen would 

have been eligible for or potentially eligible for, and 

there are attorney-client privilege cases that do go off 

under 1292(b).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is a bit of a 

hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the 

materially advanced -- the litigation and those other 

criteria?

 MS. RESNIK: There are a few selective 

waiver cases. There are a few of these that come up, 

but you are completely right that it is a hurdle but we 

have alternatives here as well. As the example of the 

-- once the Federal Court Study Committee suggested we 

needed more appeal rights after the Coopers case, 

Congress responded by authorizing the Court through its 

rulemaking to provide interlocutory orders as final, and 

23(f) is the next example, which also provides the 

mechanism.

 The basic point is that there are other 

routes. The remedial prong of Cohen is amply responded 

to here, because first, internal to the case, there 

could be protective orders and limited disclosure. 

Second, you can take the issue and stipulate it against

you. Third, you could actually, if you ever did go to 

trial, not testify. That's the Jackie B. Redman 

scenario. Fourth, you have the after-a-fact appeal. 

Fifth, mandamus is available, and there are circuit 

courts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is only in 

egregious cases.

 MS. RESNIK: In the extraordinary case there 

is mandamus. There is also certification, and all of 

these are routes that are filtered. Cohen opens the 

door completely.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you -- are you arguing 

that the collateral order door is closed now? That --

that nobody else is going to get through that door?

 MS. RESNIK: I can't forecast future cases, 

except to say that this Court has repeatedly in the last 

decade narrowed the door substantially. And I take it 

it has come in relationship to the door opening through 

the other mechanisms, Congressional carve-ups like the 

Classified Informations Procedure Act, the Congressional 

carve-up in Catha, and each of those isn't a wide-open 

door, but either discretionary or timeframed or limited. 

And of course, that goes to the problem that an 

interlocutory appeal really is interlocutory and stops 

everything, whereas the 23(f) rule says after the court

order, there's nothing stayed at the district court 

level.

 JUSTICE ALITO: An interlocutory appeal 

doesn't have to stop everything, does it?

 MS. RESNIK: The -- as a rule of filing a 

notice of appeal with a court of appeal at the -- a 

statutory rule provision puts the -- stays the district 

court activity. That's why 23(f) moderates that rule, 

as I understand it.

 Further, I wanted to come back to the 

question here in terms of importance. Rule 501 and 502 

of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Number 502 has just 

been reworked. 501 remains that in some of these the 

existence of the privilege will arise -- will be a 

question of state law. I know of no one of the Erie 

cases in which the interlocutory appellate question 

turns on the question of state law as a predicate, and 

the D.C. Circuit rule is that it's when there's an 

adverse privilege ruling that you get appeal as a right. 

It's -- that's the D.C. circuit's rule for -- and 

indeed, it had several of these, not very many, but a 

few of these cases.

 So then 502 has just come with the workings 

of the judicial conference and the Congress together, 

and the lawyers, to shape a rule that is very protective

of inadvertent waiver, protective about its sequential 

impacts as well, and articulating and Federalizing that 

area of law, as well as providing under 502(a) for -- if 

you waive in the course of a Federal proceeding, 502 

organizes the way a district court should think about 

it.

 If there were appeal as a right of waiver 

right now, after this case, then all those 502 cases 

could come directly, whereas instead a few might get 

here or not by 1292(b). And again, if it looked like 

there needed to be a wholesale reworking because of the 

vulnerability of the system, then the Court and 

committee working with the lawyers can draft together 

some revision. But the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The usual way that 

the district court, after denying the recognition of the 

privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the 

lawyer to go to jail. They say, You've got contempt, 

you can appeal contempt. The district judges, as you've 

mentioned, they want these things to move on and they 

tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and 

the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely 

difficult choice, of violating what they think is their 

ethical obligation or going to jail.

provision that is available. And it is a route. But 

we've found --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how is it --

unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal 

contempt. It wouldn't be civil contempt. The judge 

says, I'm not going to hold you, and --

MS. RESNIK: What -- we have found that many 

courts of appeals have responded, precisely because of 

either the draconian nature of criminal contempt or the 

possibility that it won't issue, by looking at some of 

these cases, in the extraordinary instance, through 

mandamus and there are at least a dozen mandamus --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But mandamus is supposed 

-- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment 

rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available, 

then mandamus would not lie, right?

 MS. RESNIK: That is directly -- that is 

exactly correct, yes. It is that the appeal of these 

unappealing groups is because the final judgment rule 

says even if there is an error and even if it's a very 

important error, absent this very narrow category of 

cases that are final through our gloss on Cohen, the 

basic plan is you wait till the end.

In this instance, this district judge, in 

the related case, certified under 1292(b), the RICO 

question that came back -- came up to this Court, it 

also had a 23(f) appeal in this case.

 So this is actually a textbook case, if you 

will, of watching both the pros and cons of 

interlocutory appellate review, and, in this instance, 

what we see is that the district court, here, said this 

is too run-of-the-mill for 1292(b).

 However, if you want, cooperating with the 

lawyers, I will -- I will put everything in abeyance, if 

you want to seek mandamus. And so the district judge 

was attentive to the lawyers' concerns, moreover because 

the district judge has put a protective order on related 

materials.

 We have an example of a district judge, who 

is very aware of the parameters of the litigation, and 

that goes to remedies. We dont' know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a protective 

order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't 

going to work at all. You're not going to -- I mean, 

the lawyers on the other side get the privileged 

material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the 

viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't 

matter if the clients get it.

MS. RESNIK: In -- the -- underlying the 

privilege is the workings of the system for both private 

ordering and for the justice system. The rare instances 

in which a trial judge affirmatively makes a finding of 

waiver through conduct, in this instance or in some 

other way, are going to not undermine the privilege in 

its initial formation, and the final judgment rule has 

said, repeatedly, We could get it wrong on class action 

certification. We could get it wrong on attorney 

disqualification.

 Nevertheless, the costs of the final 

judgment rule are so substantial --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the -- you 

know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the 

exact opposite. It will say that the opening up of the 

privilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is, 

will, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the 

privilege.

 MS. RESNIK: I appreciate -- and before you 

on amici, on both sides, are people deeply committed to 

the administration of justice.

people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief

lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will 

happen to it.

 MS. RESNIK: And I believe that the judges 

and lawyers and law professors, who have written to you 

on the other side, are committed to understanding that 

the privilege is important instrumentally. The trial --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but the law --

the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this 

question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about 

going to jail, if they want to protect their client's --

what they view as their ethical obligations.

 MS. RESNIK: There are many provisions short 

of going to jail, and, furthermore, I want to come back 

to the -- to the rule, the limited --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's only going to 

jail that gives you criminal intent.

 MS. RESNIK: Yes. It is.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's immediately 

appealable.

 MS. RESNIK: And the -- the underlying 

insight of Cohen, is that there are many instances when 

dramatic events occur in the dynamics of trial, but the 

Congress has concluded that the final judgment rule 

requires waiting till you get to the end.

 And in the instances -- contempt, as

standing here as an alternative around that rule, as is 

mandamus, as is 1292(b), are small windows, not for the 

regular course of events.

 The empiric suggests that, by and large, 

people are getting it right, but there will a lot of 

requests for review and the strategic dimension, which 

is what the attorney-client privilege and the class 

action holdings in Cohen are about, will invite more of 

the strategic play, so that, in the plea from the judges 

who also participated in the amicus --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the attorney-client 

claim sometimes raised, along with a host of other 

discovery issues, as a bargaining chip?

 MS. RESNIK: These are packages that -- yes, 

the attorney-client privilege -- and this is granular 

work by district and magistrate judges of -- of hundreds 

of thousands of pieces of paper.

 It could go, piecemeal, to the court of 

appeals more than one time and it can also come up, even 

at trial, interrupting a trial. So we could watch the 

sequence of a frequent, repetitious return back and 

forth to the court of appeals on this kind of privilege 

and, potentially, on other kinds of privileges.

 Thank you very much.

Mr. Kneedler?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court. In the last 15 years, this Court, in 

applying the principles of Cohen, has repeatedly 

stressed that a necessary requirement is that the order 

involved and the issues implicated be important and, 

particularly, that the issues be so important as to 

outweigh the values served by the important and usual 

rule of a final judgment requirement.

 In our view, the denial of an assertion of 

attorney-client privilege in an individual case does not 

rise to that level and to the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except when 

the government is the one raising it.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. We do not -- we -- to be 

clear, we are not asserting that an -- that an assertion 

of attorney-client privilege by the government is -- is 

immediately --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but, in the 

government context, what would be in the private 

context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a

different type of governmental privilege.

 When you give advice to a government agency, 

you don't call that the attorney-client privilege. You 

call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative 

privilege, all these other things.

 In the private sector, when you are an 

attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say, 

This has got something. It's the attorney-client 

privilege.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Let me also stress, we are 

not arguing that a denial of the assertion of the 

deliberative process privilege is immediately 

appealable.

 Our -- the -- the submission that we make in 

the latter part of our brief, and that we urge the Court 

not to foreclose here, is the Presidential 

communications privilege, which applies to 

communications involving the President or his top 

advisors.

 And we also say that the State secrets 

privilege raises similar concerns. Both of those serve 

functions of constitutional significance. We do not 

make the same claim about -- about the general 

government privilege for deliberative process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying

that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an 

interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other 

than Presidential communications and State secrets?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't want to rule out the 

possibility that there could be a statutory privilege of 

some -- of some particular sort --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you could -- you 

could seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b).

 MR. KNEEDLER: That -- that would be -- that 

would be available in an appropriate case. There are 

the -- there are the limitations. We trust that a court 

would -- would grant that, but these -- these are 

interests of the highest order.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There 

are problems with 1292(b). Are you telling me, when 

your office writes a letter to the Department of 

Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal --

we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a 

really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you 

assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the 

attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge 

says, that's not covered, for one reason or another, 

you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. Not -- we don't get an 

interlocutory appeal under -- under 1291. No. We are

not arguing for that -- for that position. And, for the 

two particular privileges that -- that we have 

identified in our -- in our brief, it is possible that 

1292(b) certification would be granted by the -- by the 

Court, but it is also possible that it would not.

 And I -- I would like to -- I would like to 

identify -- and I think Justice Sotomayor asked about --

about a test for importance, and the Court, in its 

recent decision in Will, tried to summarize what -- what 

it has been driving at over the last 15 years on this 

importance prong and whether the importance outweighs 

the -- the final judgment values.

 And what the Court said there is that there 

has -- that the denial of an immediate appeal has to 

undermine -- let me -- let me quote -- "has to undermine 

some particular value of high order."

 And then the Court identified the things 

that have fallen into that category. It mentioned 

separation of powers. The Court mentioned disruption of 

government operations through the denial of qualified 

immunity, and I would add the denial of statutory 

immunity under the Westfall Act to that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think that 

the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who 

gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was

an issue in Cohen?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- I think the -- I do 

not. And I think the problem is that the denial of 

attorney-client privilege is tied up with discovery of 

the sort that happens every day in Federal Court. It's 

bound up with -- with discovery plans, that --

objections on relevance, materiality, various -- various 

privileges.

 One of the important values served by the 

final judgment rule is that the conduct of -- of 

district court proceedings like that is committed to the 

judgment and discretion of the district court, and if a 

disappointed litigant could automatically run to the 

court of appeals that undermines the ability of the 

district court judge to manage the day-to-day --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are not talking 

about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to 

is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like 

every other evidentiary privilege that you have just 

listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of 

things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is 

different, even more important than who has to post 

security for costs, because it is central to the rule of 

law, because it is central to how the adversary system 

functions.

MR. KNEEDLER: I think the more precise 

question, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the -- the 

question is whether the denial of an attorney-client 

privilege threatens to -- so substantially undermine the 

values of the privilege to warrant an immediate appeal, 

and I think, as has been pointed out by several of the 

Justices here, there are -- there are exceptions to the 

privilege, which -- which will -- might undermine the 

confidence people might have in it. There are 

uncertainties at trial. These are often fact-based 

determinations that would be subject to clearly 

erroneous review on appeal. The very sorts of reasons 

why issues like this are committed to the district 

court's discretion and reviewed on final judgment when 

you can find out whether the error actually made a 

difference on a particular case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the review -- I 

follow your answer but the review on final judgment is 

meaningless. I mean, the cat is out of the bag.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it's not entirely 

meaningless. It can -- if the evidence was used in the 

trial and had -- had a substantial impact you can have a 

reversal of the judgment, and -- and the -- the injury 

can be mitigated by saying that the -- that the evidence 

cannot be -- cannot be used in the retrial. That is

not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The injury to the 

party, but not the injury to the attorney-client 

privilege.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, the -- the 

question is -- the attorney/client privilege is not for 

competence in its own right but to encourage frank 

communications in order to promote litigation in the 

function of lawyers. And the question is whether the 

denial of a privilege in a particular case will so 

undermine that privilege as a general matter to warrant 

an immediate appeal. And we think the answer is clearly 

no. And also the loss of the privilege to the 

individual litigant we think is not a sufficient basis, 

because the other cases that I mentioned, and that the 

Court identified in Will are situations where the injury 

transcends the particular case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, I think I 

have this right, but correct me if I am wrong. I 

thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a 

question that we would like to get this legal question 

settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security 

for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up 

up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit. It 

would be the practical end of the lawsuit. Unlike in an

attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on.

 So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that 

this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it 

is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put 

up security costs would be out of --

MR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's a very 

important -- that's a very important point. And I think 

that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Kneedler, is true 

that true, that the case goes on? Isn't it true that of 

the civil cases that get through discovery, only a tiny 

percentage ever come to an appealable final judgment? 

The vast, vast majority of these things are settled, are 

they not?

 MR. KNEEDLER: They are. And I -- I -- I 

think that supports the point for not having immediate 

appealable --

JUSTICE ALITO: Right, because there never 

could be an appeal.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but the --

JUSTICE ALITO: It means that the 

erroneous -- if there was an erroneous ruling, it's 

built into the -- it's irretrievably built into -- well 

not irretrievably, but powerfully built into the 

bargaining --

MR. KNEEDLER: But that's the nature of 

trial proceedings and discovery. Judges may make 

erroneous rulings. And this Court, again, acknowledged 

in Will that the purpose of the final judgment rule is 

no to protect -- prevent particular injustices that 

might happen in a particular case. Again, to go back to 

what the Court has stressed, there has to be a -- a -- a 

value, and the Court said constitutional or statutory or 

something with a large public pedigree where the --

where the injury will -- will not be -- where the 

weighing of the costs and benefits comes out quite 

differently.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the privilege were in a 

statute, that would make a difference?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think so if there was 

a statute that just codified the -- the privileges like 

this. What I -- what I -- what I was suggesting is 

there might be a statute that would identify a 

particular governmental interest as in the D.C. 

Circuit's decision in the -- in the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside the 

question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a 

good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that 

litigants on one side frequently request and demand in 

discovery material that they know is covered by the

attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's 

where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them 

leverage, because they know that the other side is going 

to have to go through this impossible process and can't 

get an immediate appeal.

 Why isn't that a concern that we should 

have?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think and that's a --

district judges are -- are -- who manage these cases 

every day can see through that, and -- and -- and can be 

trusted to, by and large, make correct results. It may 

be that there will be an occasional erroneous 

determination. But, again, as for privileges generally, 

that's -- that's so.

 I did want to make one final point about --

about irreparable injury. For the sorts of privileges 

that we have identified in -- in our brief, the -- the 

presidential communications privilege and whatnot, 

that -- that harm is immediate and broad on behalf of 

the nation as a whole. That is a different question 

from the harm to a particular litigant when a privilege 

is denied in a particular case and it doesn't undermine 

the broader purposes of the privilege.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL L. ALLEN

 ON BEHALF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ALLEN: I would like to address the 

question that Justice Alito raised with regard to 

whether or not an appeal of a collateral issue dealing 

with waiver or privilege would stay the litigation. The 

answer is it does not. The case remains with the 

district court, the district court is empowered to 

manage the case. Only the question addressing the issue 

would go up with collateral order jurisdiction. Indeed, 

in this case, the court did not stay the litigation 

below. So, the court maintains that ability to manage 

its own docket. To be sure --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It certainly doesn't go 

ahead with the trial, does it?

 MR. ALLEN: He has not gone ahead with the 

trial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It never would, would it?

 MR. ALLEN: He is certainly empowered to do 

so.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, just go ahead with 

trial while a material issue is still pending, I can't 

imagine that.

 MR. ALLEN: Your Honor, the scenario that

you raise would put the attorney or the client, 

depending on who is in the box, if you will, to some 

hard choices. But there are two ways that the case 

stays: Either the district court has to order that the 

case stays or on appeal the court of appeals has to 

order that the case stays. The parties and their 

counsel cannot stay the case.

 So, I agree with you that it could be a 

difficult situation for the parties.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I can't imagine a judge 

going to trial in a case when an important issue like 

this is pending on appeal. Has that ever happened?

 MR. ALLEN: I am unaware that it has -- it 

has ever happened, Your Honor, and I hope it doesn't. 

But the -- but point is that the district court 

maintains that power and authority to run -- to run its 

courtroom.

 The United States cites Will for the 

proposition that -- that the collateral order doctrine 

is designed to impact some particular value of high 

order, and it recites from Will a number of those 

particular values of high order, including qualified 

immunity. As this Court recognized in -- in Harlow, 

a -- a doctrine of common law origin, much like the 

attorney-client privilege, the -- the doctrine in

Harlow, qualified immunity is designed to impact and 

affect the efficient operation of government.

 The design of the attorney-client privilege 

is intended to have the same impact on the efficient and 

effective operation of the administration of justice.

 If I could go back, Justice Breyer, to the 

question that you raised with regard to other privilege. 

I would suggest that a holding in this case in our favor 

would have no impact on the Court's later determination 

of privileges of husband, wife, spousal privileges, or 

of priest and penitent type privileges. I would suggest 

that the better course would be to examine a case that 

develops the importance or the impact of those 

privileges, but certainly with regard, for example, to 

spousal immunity or spousal privilege, the way that the 

States recognize them -- I believe that all 50 States 

recognize spousal privilege -- is varied.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so, I think any 

system of -- that denies you the interlocutory appeal, 

will, in fact, work some injustice. I have no doubt 

about that. Any system that allows too many 

interlocutory appeals wrecks the judicial system through 

delay.

 Now, I think on that kind of question which 

is here, maybe there is some information that you come
