 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-108, Flores-Figueroa versus 

United States.

 Mr. Russell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In common usage to say that somebody 

knowingly transfers, possesses or uses something is to 

say that that person knows what it is that he is 

transferring, possessing or using. If I say that John 

knowingly used a pair of scissors of his mother, I am 

saying not simply that John knew he was using something 

that turned out to be his mother's scissors or even that 

John knew he was using scissors which turned out to be 

his mother's, I am saying that John knew that the 

scissors he was using belonged out to be his mother.

 The same principle follows under the Federal 

aggravated identity theft statute, which calls for a 

two-year mandatory sentence for anyone who during and in 

relations certain predicate --

JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that depend on the

context? You can think of examples where you have 

exactly the same usage and the person wouldn't 

necessarily know about the ownership of the thing in 

question?

 MR. RUSSELL: I haven't been able to think 

of one. And the government hasn't been able to come up 

with one.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How about so and so 

stole a car that belonged to Mr. Jones. I suppose you 

could say that the person knew it was Mr. Jones' car, 

but more likely somebody stole the car that turned out 

to be Mr. Jones's.

 MR. RUSSELL: I think that that formulation 

gives rise to a little bit more ambiguity in that 

context. I think if you said stole the car of Mr. 

Jones, it is not particularly ambiguous. But at the 

very least, this is a formulation that claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think he knowingly 

stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones, would that be 

the parallel?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes, I'm sorry if I left that 

part out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You left out the 

"knowingly." Once you put in "knowingly" --

MR. RUSSELL: I think if the statement is,

you know, John knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones, 

that strongly implies that John knew that the car 

belonged to Mr. Jones.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I repeat, doesn't that 

depend on the context that you say somebody says to you, 

you know, a car was stolen from our street last night. 

Oh, what car was stolen? Oh, it was the car of Mr. 

Jones. He knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones. It 

doesn't necessarily mean that the person who stole the 

car knew that it was Mr. Jones's car.

 MR. RUSSELL: I do think that the 

formulation that John knowingly stole the car of Mr. 

Jones most naturally is understood to imply that John 

knew whose car it was he was stealing.

 We don't claim that the government has an 

interpretation that's grammatically impossible. We are 

just simply saying that by far the most common usage of 

this kind of formulation, particularly in a criminal 

statute, is that the knowledge element applies to the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Who did the mugger mug? He 

mugged the man from Denver. You think that he knowingly 

mugged the man from Denver. Do you think that means 

that the mugger knew that the man was from Denver?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think that is a more 

ambiguous statement.

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it more ambiguous?

 MR. RUSSELL: Because I think the "from" 

preposition --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't it less 

unambiguous. I thought your argument was that this was 

unambiguous.

 MR. RUSSELL: I think the possessive form 

makes it, through common usage, unambiguous. We don't 

claim that it is grammatically impossible. But we do 

think that in ordinary usage people would understand --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what if it isn't? I 

mean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it 

is a crime to mug a man from Denver. That's a Denver 

ordinance, by the way, because no one else would pass 

it. I mean, but if those were the elements of the 

crime, I guess, we do normally apply knowingly to each 

of them.

 MR. RUSSELL: That is correct in the 

criminal --

JUSTICE BREYER: Whether -- even if it isn't 

ordinary usage.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. We have more 

than one argument. We think that as a matter of 

ordinary usage --

JUSTICE BREYER: I was thoughtfully trying

to push you on to the next argument.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, we do think that in a 

criminal statute you ordinarily assume, this Court has 

said that a conventional Mens Rea element extends to all 

of the elements of the offense.

 And Congress knows how to deviate from that 

when it wants to. It did so, for example, in the 

statute that the Court construed in the X-Citement Video 

case, where it referred to a person knowingly 

transporting a visual depiction, comma, if that visual 

depiction has certain characteristics. And this Court 

recognized that that kind of formulation most naturally 

is read to end the knowledge requirement as the comma, 

if.

 Congress didn't do that here. In fact, 

there is no textual indication that would lead one to 

believe that it didn't intend anything other than a 

completely conventional Mens Rea requirement in this 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, am I correct 

in understanding that the government goes with you 

almost all the way, and its only the last three words 

"of another person," that they agree knowingly applies 

to "without lawful authority," and that it applies to a 

means of identification? You have to know that it

was -- you were using the means of identification.

 MR. RUSSELL: As I understand that is not 

their position. That's the back-up to their back-up 

position. The first position is that it only applies to 

the verbs. Then they say, well, if you don't accept 

that then, maybe it goes through "without lawful 

authority." And if you don't accept that, then maybe it 

goes halfway through the phrase "means of identification 

of another person.

 So, they do raise all three alternatives. 

That last argument, I think, fails both for text common 

usage reasons and in light of this tradition element 

that we have been discussing. Textually, there is 

something no textual cue that the knowledge requirement 

stops halfway through the direct object phrase, "means 

of identification of another person."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the first -- this 

alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify 

for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time 

around he used an assumed name, not his own name.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He used a false date of 

birth. He got a Social Security card that happened to 

belong -- to be the number of no live person --

MR. RUSSELL: Correct.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and -- and that would 

not have violated. Even in the government's reading 

that would not have violated --

MR. RUSSELL: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- this statute.

 But the second time around, your case, he 

did use his own name. And the question was -- and it 

turned out that both the Social Security card and the 

alien registration, they were two different people but 

they were both live.

 MR. RUSSELL: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that does make it a 

crime. But when the number turned out to be that 

belonged to anybody that does not, you don't get the 

two-year add-on.

 MR. RUSSELL: Just to be clear, the only 

reason the government alleges that there is a crime here 

is because it turned out that those numbers had been 

assigned to somebody else. Under our view, that's not 

enough. That's enough to show that he committed the 

predicate offenses, and received very substantial 

punishment for that, but it's not enough to show that he 

was qualified for an additional two years mandatory 

sentence as an aggravated identity thief.

happen if the -- the defendant doesn't -- doesn't act 

knowingly as to the question whether the identifying 

information belongs to a real person but is simply 

reckless as to whether the identifying information 

belongs to a real person? Suppose that someone buys an 

identification card and looks at it, and it looks like 

it might be a real identification card on which that 

persons picture has been inserted in place of the real 

picture, but the person can't be sure and it might 

really be an entirely fake card. Would that be a 

violation?

 MR. RUSSELL: Ordinarily recklessness does 

not satisfy a knowledge requirement. Willful blindness 

ordinarily does. But recklessness in itself ordinarily 

does not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be enough to go 

to the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think so. I think the 

government is free to present circumstantial evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You agree that you could 

go to the jury whenever there is an identity card that 

does reflect the identity of a real person but there is 

no other knowledge that the government's case is 

introduced that shows -- that there is no other evidence 

that the government has introduced showing knowledge?

MR. RUSSELL: If there is -- I think that 

could be a component of circumstantial evidence case. I 

don't think it would be enough. Particularly in a case 

like this where --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose he has five 

different cards with five different real people, would 

that be enough to go?

 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think so in itself. 

Particularly in a case like this where the person gets 

up and testifies that they didn't know. The fact that 

there is these numbers here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. No. The fact that 

he testified, that doesn't have anything to do with 

whether or not the case goes to the jury. Does the 

government make its case sufficient to resist the 

motion -- the directed motion for acquittal if it just 

puts in the fact that you have five identity cards and 

there are five different people and they are all real 

people?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think so. And in 

fact, the fact that they are five different people 

probably tends to undermine the evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are making it very hard 

for me to vote with you, I must say. I thought you had 

a pretty good -- a pretty good case. But if you are

going to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces 

of individuals, presumably they are real individuals --

MR. RUSSELL: I'm sorry, maybe I am 

misunderstanding the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was the 

hypothetical. Five different -- the person has five 

identity cards of real people, and -- and you don't know 

that he knows that its the identity cards of a real 

person, but he used it.

 MR. RUSSELL: Okay. If there -- if these 

are identity cards that have the picture of somebody 

other than him on them --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes.

 MR. RUSSELL: -- which is an unusual 

thing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course.

 MR. RUSSELL: But if that's the case, then, 

yes, I think that -- you know, that there would be --

that that picture belongs to the person whose number is 

there, and that they could do that. The ordinary --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. You have to have 

the further inference that he knows that.

 MR. RUSSELL: I think a jury could 

reasonably infer that the person wouldn't -- would not, 

that if you have an ID card with somebody else's name,

somebody else's number, somebody else's picture, that 

that belongs to somebody else.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not -- that's not 

this case. In this case he had his own name. And I 

don't know whether there was a picture on the alien 

registration card. I don't know -- he used his own 

name. Did he use his own photograph?

 MR. RUSSELL: I don't know the answer to 

that question. I mean, Social Security cards don't have 

pictures.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was going to be my 

next question. The next question is suppose it was the 

Petitioner's own name but somebody else's number.

 MR. RUSSELL: I would tend to think that 

that's not sufficient. Of course --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, that would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even if he had five 

different cards, all with his name, but all with the 

identification numbers of other real people?

 MR. RUSSELL: Again, I would -- I would 

think not. I can understand that people could disagree 

with that. And of course, the government is free to 

raise those kinds of arguments in other cases where this 

comes up.

 All of this goes the question of what does

it take to show that somebody knows something. The 

question before the Court right now, and the only 

question, is whether the government has to show that 

knowledge at all. And in this case, you know, the 

government's principal argument, I think their strongest 

argument is that reducing the mens rea requirements in 

that way serves the purpose of facilitating prosecutions 

and therefore protection of the victim, and we don't 

deny that it had that effect. And we don't deny that 

this statute is directed at protecting victims, but that 

could be said of an awful lot of criminal statutes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the defendant 

chooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own 

name? I guess has a identification card made up with 

that, and doesn't know for sure that the name that's 

chosen actually belongs to another person, but because 

it's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that 

it's virtually certain that that name belongs to some 

other person who is unknown to him? Is that a 

violation?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think -- again, you have 

this issue of recklessness versus knowledge. If he knew 

that in fact it belonged to it, if he used John Doe, it 

turns out there are several hundred John Doe's in this 

country, and it does raise a difficult question about

how this statute ought to apply when you are using 

something that is so commonly identifying somebody, but 

it's hard to say that its identifying anybody in 

particular.

 The definition of the means of 

identification in this statute says that it has to be a 

name or number that is capable of identifying a 

particular person, so I think you get into questions 

when you're talking about common names, about how the 

statute -- whether the statute would be satisfied.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if it's not an 

extremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon 

name? And what if it's -- what if the defendant chooses 

Kevin K. Russell? Would that be a violation?

 MR. RUSSELL: You would have to show that he 

knew that that was a name belonging to a specific 

person.

 JUSTICE ALITO: He would have to know that 

there is such a person.

 MR. RUSSELL: He would have to know that 

there is such -- he wouldn't have to know me, but he 

would have to know that there is such a person. But 

again --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have to know that? 

Suppose he uses John Smith. Does it suffice that -- do

we have to show that he knows there is a John Smith in 

the phone book, someplace in the United States?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think so. I think he would 

have to know who that John Smith was, but he would have 

to know there is a John Smith. And that -- I mean, that 

kind of scenario does raise difficult questions about.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I want an answer to 

the question.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think the answer is 

the one that I gave you, which I think is disputable, 

but it's -- the answer is that he has to know that there 

is a specific person named John Smith.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it can't be submitted 

to the jury on the basis that anybody knows that there 

is a John Smith?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can it go to the 

jury without any other evidence other than the fact that 

-- his possession of the card?

 MR. RUSSELL: If it's a sufficiently common 

name that he ought to know that there is somebody 

bearing that name, then yes, I would agree it would go 

to the jury on that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the name said Anthony 

Kennedy, would that go to the jury?

(Laughter.)

 MR. RUSSELL: I -- again -- it's hard to 

draw lines here, but I think the ultimate question is, 

you know, could a reasonable jury think that somebody 

using that name has to know there is a specific person 

with that name, a specific person with that name? And 

quite possibly they could.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me an 

example?

 MR. RUSSELL: It go to the jury. An awful 

lot of name examples would.

 I think simply in this case, though, when 

you are talking about a number, I don't think -- it's a 

much harder case to say that simply having a number on 

the card should -- should lead you to know that that 

name very likely belongs to somebody else. In fact, 

there are nine -- there are -- there a billion possible 

combinations for security -- Social Security numbers, 

and only about 400 million have been issued. But to get 

back -- I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you say this goes 

to the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your 

knowledge argument.

defense counsel can get up, say the government hasn't 

shown that he knew this, and then the government says 

that of course he knows it -- I don't think you have 

accomplished very much.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, it does. I think the 

jury still has to make the finding that he knew it. And 

in a case like this where my client testified that he 

didn't know it, where the government didn't contest 

that, didn't argue that there were substantial evidence 

showing that he did know it, it's going to be 

outcome-determinative. In that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do these operations 

work? He went to Chicago to buy false identification 

papers. Did, the first time he go to the same outfit as 

the time he used a false name?

 MR. RUSSELL: The record doesn't disclose 

that, and I don't know.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: These are outfits that 

specialize in making false identifications?

 MR. RUSSELL: Again, the record doesn't 

disclose how sophisticated the operation was. In this 

case it could just be a guy who does this; it could be a 

very sophisticated operation. I think it's kind of all 

over the place out there, in the real world.

out like it was in the first instance in this case; it 

is just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong 

to anybody?

 MR. RUSSELL: I'm afraid I don't have a good 

sense of that. But just to be clear, in addition to 

being able to just say on the face of the fact about the 

identification that the government can present 

circumstantial evidence to the jury, in a great number 

of cases, particularly the kinds that Congress was most 

concerned about, the way that they -- the defendant 

obtained the identification and the way that they used 

it provides powerful circumstantial evidence of 

knowledge.

 Somebody who breaks into a computer system 

or unauthorizedly uses access to a computer system or 

goes dumpster diving looking for IDs obviously knows 

that they are going to end up with an ID that belongs to 

another person, and if they use the ID to get into a 

real person's bank account, then it is awfully good 

information that they were aware that that was an ID 

that belonged to another person, because there's no 

sense in trying to break into the bank account of a

non-existent person. And so we don't think that this is 

a case in which the government faces some kind of 

insurmountable burden in proving knowledge in a way that 

is particularly different than -- than other kinds of 

situations in which the law commonly requires the 

government to prove what a defendant knew or did not.

 To get back to the victim-focused nature of 

this, you know, Congress could -- we don't dispute that 

Congress could make a policy judgment that it would be 

good to hold defendants strictly liable when they used 

an identification that turns out to belong to somebody 

else. Sometimes the law does. Most commonly with 

respect to sentencing enhancement provisions of the sort 

that the government points to with respect to the 

quantity of selling drugs in a school zone. But when 

Congress makes that choice, Congress makes that clear in 

the decks of the statute, so if you look at the drug 

quantity of the school zone provisions that are in 

appendix E and D of the yellow brief appendix, in 

appendix D you see Congress establishes in subsection A 

of that provision the "unlawful act," and it says it's 

unlawful for any person knowingly to manufacture, 

distribute, et cetera, a controlled substance.

 It includes in that provision a knowledge 

requirement, which, by the way, nobody thinks means only

that the government has to show that they knowingly 

manufactured something which turned out to be a 

controlled substance. Everybody agrees that the 

knowledge requirement in that position extends to the 

direct object phrase "controlled substance."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't 

help you much because it can't be knowingly manufacture 

something is the crime. I mean, you do have to go on to 

have that make any sense. You don't have to go on to 

make your provision make any sense, that he knowingly, 

you know, uses a means of identification.

 MR. RUSSELL: I disagree as matter of common 

usage. But I think when Congress intends to have a 

statute read that way, versus a statute that looks like 

this one, which in subsection (b) lays out the facts 

that are aggravating, that they are going to find 

separately, the drug quantity in subsection (b) of 21 

USC 48-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I guess --I 

guess basically this is what I was trying to say earlier 

as well. You have in your statute in between there, the 

modifier "without lawful authority."

 MR. RUSSELL: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that means that 

it can stop at a lot more number of earlier places then

can the statute you were just citing in appendix D.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, to answer that question 

-- and then I'd like to return to the school zone 

example -- the fact that Congress put in "without lawful 

authority" and enclosed it with commas I think simply 

reflects that Congress understood that, by inserting 

that phrase between transitive verbs and the direct 

object, it was interrupting the natural flow of the 

sentence. And I don't think it means -- so the first 

comma may tell the reader to pause, but the second comma 

I think just as clearly indicates to the reader that the 

flow of the sentence continues.

 And so that I don't think you would say a 

sentence that says, John knowingly used without 

permission a pair of scissors of his mother's. You 

would still read that to mean that John knew that the 

scissors he was using belonged to his mother. That the 

insertion of the parenthetical I think indicates that 

Congress knew it could put it at the end and not change 

the meaning or put it here.

 But when Congress intends to write a statute 

that -- that holds people strictly liable for 

aggravating circumstances or writes something like the 

quantity provisions where, in subsection (b), Congress 

sets out the punishment that is deserving because of

that aggravating factor, and it does not include a mens 

rea requirement in subsection (b). And in the school 

zone provision, Congress likewise has no mens rea 

requirement with respect to the knowledge of the person 

being in a school zone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

government's argument in this case that Congress was 

really going after people who have false identification 

because of its concern to protect the victim, that is 

the person whose number is misused? So the government 

is urging that we take a victim-centered approach to the 

statute.

 MR. RUSSELL: I do think it's a fair point, 

that this was a statute that was concerned with victims. 

Lots of criminal statutes are. But we don't ordinarily 

read it -- Congress doesn't ordinarily enact even 

victim-focused statutes without mens rea requirements, 

and courts don't ordinarily narrowly construe them, even 

though it's true that omitting mens rea requirements or 

narrowly construing them furthers the purpose of 

protecting of the victim. In fact, by far more -- far 

more commonly, as the LaFave treatise that we cite to 

you explains, we don't hold defendants criminally 

strictly liable for all of the consequences of their 

crimes. It gives the example of somebody who breaks

into a house intending to rob it and accidentally sets 

it on fire -- you know, they're engaged in unlawful 

conduct to start with -- and so they're not fully to 

blame there, but nonetheless we don't hold them 

criminally liable for arson because they didn't intend 

it.

 Now, Congress could make a choice. Congress 

could choose to hold that arsonist strictly liable -- or 

the robbery suspect strictly liable for the arson, just 

as Congress could hold defendants like Petitioner 

strictly liable for the fact that he ends up using an 

identification that belongs to somebody else.

 But our point is simply there are reasons 

why Congress might not do that, including the nominalist 

kind of penalties that end up being meted out here, 

where you have people -- two people with identical 

culpability ending up with substantially different 

punishments, or people with substantially different 

culpability ending up with identical punishments.

 You have the classic aggravated identity 

thief who breaks into a bank account using a means of 

identification he knows belongs to somebody else. It's 

exactly the same sentence, under the government's view, 

as somebody like Petitioner who just unknowingly used a 

number in order to get a job.

Now, it's not impossible that Congress could 

make that policy choice, but when it does it tends to 

write statutes that look very different than this. It 

writes ones that look like -- that are quantity statutes 

that I just read or the school zone statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not a clear -- what 

-- what if the accused knowingly uses a card --

identity belonging to a dead person? Is that a real 

person?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think that's an open 

question in the circuits. Some circuits have said that 

it has to be a means of identification belonging to a 

living person, but that's -- that's not settled.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your view?

 MR. RUSSELL: My view -- I mean, the statute 

says "of another person." I think you would ordinarily 

presume that to mean a live person. But ultimately, I 

guess, it really doesn't matter to the outcome of my 

case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does, though, in 

a way, because I understand your theory is there are two 

basic kinds of crimes. You just use the document for 

your own source if you want to get the job or you want 

entry into the country or something like that. That's a 

minor crime. But if you are -- it's identity theft

where you are pretending to be somebody else so you can 

get advantage of his credit and his assets and his 

access to computers. That's a much more serious crime.

 Now, if it's a dead person, it seems to me 

to be in the former category, rather than in the latter.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true. Certainly, using 

the identification of a dead person doesn't impose the 

kind of harms on real victims that Congress seemed to be 

most focused on in this case. And certainly, our 

interpretation of the statute we don't think unduly 

interferes with that protective function, precisely 

because the government ought to, in a great many cases, 

very easily show that the way that the person used the 

means of identification shows that they knew that it 

belonged to somebody else.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: His conduct would amount 

to identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of 

identity fraud?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, that's what we have been 

using to refer to the underlying predicate offense here, 

which is the misuse of the immigration documents. But 

that's -- that applies whenever somebody uses an 

immigration document -- and there is another statute for 

Social Security cards -- that doesn't belong to them. 

And the government only has to prove that they knew that

it didn't belong them. And that in itself is a 

substantial protection for people who might be unknowing 

victims or victims of somebody like my client. He is 

substantially deterred from risking their credit by the 

mere fact that he is going to face a substantial penalty 

for using the false document in and of itself. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be equally false 

if the Social Security number were fictitious -- it 

didn't belong to --

MR. RUSSELL: Didn't belong to anybody. 

That's correct.

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It is common ground that there are at least 

three preconditions to liability under 18 U.S.C. section 

1028A(a)(1): First and foremost, the defendant must 

commit one of the separate predicate felonies that are 

specifically enumerated in subsection (c). Second, 

during the commission of that felony, the defendant must

use something that is in fact a means of identification 

of another person. And, third, that use of the means of 

identification of another person must itself be without 

lawful authority and must have the effect of 

facilitating the defendant's commission of the 

underlying predicate felony.

 The question in this case is whether the 

government must also show that the defendant was 

specifically aware that the means of identification that 

he uses to facilitate his underlying crime was that of 

another person. And the answer to that question is no.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, did the 

prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in 

the district court when Judge Friedman asked: Where I 

take two people and one of them gets false Social 

Security cards and it happens that the number belongs to 

no live person, and another person goes to the same 

outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live 

person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the 

prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it 

turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on, 

but if it turns out to be a real number, two years' 

mandatory addition? The prosecutor says, yes, that's 

the difference. Was that the right answer?

 MR. HEYTENS: Yes, it was. If I could

explain, the first -- the reason that the first 

defendant is not guilty, is that it is an absolute 

precondition for liability under this statute that the 

means of identification in question be that of another 

person.

 So there are no victimless violations of 

1028(a)(1), because if we are having this conversation 

at all, there was a real victim involved in the case. 

The reason the second individual is --

JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just interrupt 

you, why does "of another individual" -- why can't that 

be read to mean "of a person other than the person who 

is using the identification," whether this other person 

is real or not?

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Alito, I think the 

answer to that relates to the definition of "means of 

identification," which is reproduced in the appendix to 

our brief. I believe it's 4a. That's 18 U.S.C. 

1028(d)(7). The definition of "means of identification" 

means "any name or number that may be used, alone or in 

conjunction, to identify a specific individual." And we 

understand that, especially in conjunction with the 

words "of another person," to require, at least under 

1028A(a)(1), that we have to be talking about a real 

individual.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Heytens, this raises 

the question I was talking to your opponent about. Do 

you think that Congress intended there to be a more 

severe punishment for somebody who really steals another 

person's -- knowingly steals somebody else's identity so 

he can cash in on his credit and so forth? It seems to 

me, arguably, that's the important difference.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I agree that 

a person who deliberately sets out to misappropriate the 

identity of a known individual is almost certainly more 

culpable than someone who does not do it but 

inadvertently does so.

 But I don't think that is controlling in 

this case for a very important reason, and the very 

important reason -- again, to go back to what I said at 

the outset -- is we are not having this conversation 

unless the defendant has already committed the predicate 

felony, and he is subject to punishment for that 

predicate felony. For example, in this case, the 

predicate felony subjected Mr. Flores-Figueroa to a term 

of up to 10 years of imprisonment, above and beyond the 

two years.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but I think -- I 

thought that argument cut against you, because what you 

are saying is everybody is on the hook. There's a basic

problem here, which iis -- I will call it identity 

fraud -- and yet you get an extra two years if it just 

so happens that the number you picked out of the air 

belonged to somebody else.

 MR. HEYTENS: I understand how from the 

defendant's perspective -- to use the Justice -- the 

example that Justice Ginsburg used as well, but it may 

seem from the defendant's perspective that he just so 

happened to take a real person's number. But I think 

the critical fact here is that it not really seemed that 

way from the perspective of the real individual whose 

number he ended up using. And I think that's the 

critically important fact.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think that's what 

we normally bring into sentencing. I mean, normally, 

and that we don't impose mandatory. We impose mandatory 

sentences when the person does something, you know, 

that's wrong and he knows it is wrong.

 When harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known 

or intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge. 

You increase the sentence. That's the problem.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, my answer to 

your question and probably only of interest to those 

members of the court who find legislative history 

probative, but I think for those who do, the very

significant answer to that is that the one thing the 

legislative history makes very clear is that at least 

some members of Congress believed that judicially 

discretionary sentences before this statute were enacted 

were failing to adequately take into account the harm 

suffered by real victims.

 There is very clear legislative briefs to 

that effect. The statement of just leaving up to the 

judge to take into account the impact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- history, do you know 

what people who are stealing identities of people who 

have been bilked or -- I think that --

MR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree, Justice 

Stevens, that there is a portion of the House report 

that lists nine specific cases in which Congress -- of 

which some members of Congress -- people obviously 

report -- made the judgment that people who would engage 

in the sort of conduct that Congress wants to reach had 

received short sentences under the previous regime. 

There are nine specific examples given in the House 

report.

 I acknowledge freely that eight of those 

nine examples very clearly by the description involve 

individuals who must have known that they were using --

"means of identification," then? I mean, it's odd to 

write a statute that has elements and you put the word 

"knowingly," and the knowingly is supposed to modify 

some elements but not others. I can't think of other 

statutes that do that. There may be some.

 It's pretty peculiar. You could have left 

off the last element. I mean, if you are drafting a 

criminal statute, anyone would know that.

 MR. HEYTENS: There are two responses to 

that, Justice Breyer. First of all, Congress has 

written in some statutes that clearly increase the --

that know -- it doesn't go all the way through, because 

they repeat the knowingly requirement in those statutes.

 For example -- and it's the appendix to the 

reply, Appendix G, at page 23A, the appendix to the 

reply brief, that reproduces 18 U.S.C. 922(q)(2)(A), 

which is a statute that repeats another one of the 

requirements in the text of the statute, which under 

Petitioner's argument doesn't make any sense at all. He 

would just --

JUSTICE BREYER: Give me one where what they 

have done is they have used "knowingly" at the 

beginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and 

-- I'm not saying there are none, but I would like to 

know what they are where "knowingly" doesn't modify

something there is strict liability for.

 MR. HEYTENS: Sure. I mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's going to be 

jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like --

there could be -- there could be some. But I don't 

see -- you tell me.

 MR. HEYTENS: I will give you two. There's 

the statute that is at issue before this Court in 

Morissette v. United States, and it's the statute that 

was construed by the D.C. Circuit in an opinion by 

Justice Ginsburg in United States v. Chin.

 The statute in Morissette says, "knowingly 

converts his use anything of value of the United 

States." In Morissette, this Court held the defendant 

had to have knowledge of the facts sufficient to make 

his conduct a conversion. He has to know that the 

property has an owner, that it is not abandoned, and he 

has to known that the owner is not him.

 But the lower courts have uniformly held 

that under that statute the defendant does not need to 

know that the property in question belonged to the 

United States.

 Or take the Chin statute. The Chin statute 

says "knowingly and intentionally uses, hires or employs 

a person under the age of 18 to avoid detection of drug

trafficking crime."

 In Chin the D.C. Circuit said in every other 

court of appeals who have considered the question has 

said the defendant does not need to be specifically 

aware that the individual in question is less than 18 

years old.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is 

that it is an equally culpable act where you steal 

something off of a field than Morissette. I agree the 

Morissette case supports you, even though they relied on 

it, which is interesting to me. But that's a -- you are 

distinguishing between two equally culpable acts. It 

doesn't even make any difference whether he knew the 

owner was some private farmer or the United States.

 In this case, you have got two really big 

categories of different kinds, and instead they are 

treated alike is the thing that troubles me here.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I get a 

Morissette -- the hypothetical defendant standpoint of 

Mr. Morissette. It doesn't really depend on whether he 

knows the property belongs to the Federal Government or 

he thinks he is stealing from his neighbor. He is a bad 

person either way.

 I don't think that is true of the Chin 

statute, though I tend make a very strong argument that

someone who deliberately employs someone that he has --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You can do it in this 

statute. That is the point.

 MR. HEYTENS: Sure. Under this statute I 

think the significance is, first and foremost, we are 

not having this discussion unless he has already 

committed an underlying -- felony.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even that isn't -- I mean, 

here you are treating it as if it is a separate thing. 

That is fair enough. And what are the words "of another 

person" doing there if really they are not supposed to 

make any difference in terms of mental state?

 MR. HEYTENS: What they are doing there 

is -- this goes back to my point this is the victim, 

but, in fact, what they are doing there is to say this 

statute does not apply unless the names or numbers in 

question is actually that of a specific individual.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I could understand your 

argument if you are saying you cannot tell from the tell 

simply from the text what the answer is. You can only 

tell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if 

you say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are 

going to worry about victims, we are not going to 

worry -- we are going to take a narrow rather than a 

broad view of "knowingly."

If that's your position, you agree that if 

you simply look at the text of this statute without 

considering confessional policy, you don't win?

 MR. HEYTENS: We don't concede that the text 

of the statute alone unambiguously resolves the issue --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does it -- does it even 

come close to supporting it? I mean, let's start out 

with your analogous position. Your analogous position 

is that the "knowingly" simply refers to the -- the --

the three acts which are specified by which the 

identification can be -- can be -- the misidentification 

can be perpetrated.

 Transfers, possesses or uses. Could 

Congress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that 

he was acting to transfer or to possess or to use. That 

is not the serious possibility. So, "knowingly" has to 

refer to something more than the three possible acts.

 And once you get beyond the three possible 

acts, and you say, well, we are going to draw the line 

between "without authority" and "another person," that 

seems like an arbitrary line. And the arbitrariness of 

the line seems even more obvious when the "without a 

lawful authority" is set off as a parenthetical. And 

the real logic of the statute -- the real -- the 

operative description is "a means of identification of

another person."

 That's why, it seems to me, if you look at 

the text, you could say, well, of course, the 

"knowingly" has got to refer to the everything that 

follows, both lawful authority and another person.

 And that's why, it seems to me, if you are 

going to win, you have got to win on the grounds that 

Congress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural, 

because Congress wanted to help victims not defendants.

 Where am I going wrong there, if I'm going 

wrong?

 MR. HEYTENS: I think, as I said before, we 

do not contend that this statutory text standing along 

ambiguously supports our position enough to terminate 

the inquiry. And I certainly agree that the purpose is 

an important part of our argument.

 I think there are two important things to --

briefly, two of the things you said there. Once you 

extend "knowingly" to about -- I think the significance 

is with the effect of once you extend "knowingly," first 

to "lawful authority" and then to the "use of 

identification."

 Once you extend it to "without lawful 

authority," any conceivable argument that the other side 

can have about criminalizing innocent or inadvertent

conduct disappears, because then at that point the 

defendant knows specifically that he is acting in manner 

that is contrary to law.

 And then second, if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it worth two years?

 MR. HEYTENS: I think -- I think it is.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing that we know 

for sure that is that Congress said it is not worth two 

years extra unless that of another person was involved. 

And if that is so significant or necessarily significant 

in getting a two-year add-on, then it seems reasonable, 

I suppose, that Congress -- the state of mind -- that.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I think, first of all, 

at that point the defendant already has two different 

culpable states of mind. He has the culpable state of 

mind to commit the underlying felony and he has the 

culpable state of mind with regard to -- now, I agree 

with you, Justice Souter, there's argument you can make 

both ways as a matter of policy. I think so -- some of 

the policy with my colleague on the other side 

illustrates why Congress would have made the decision it 

did.

 And it's all of those pieces what the 

defendant is reckless, where the defendant is willfully 

ignorant or the defendant simply doesn't know because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All Congress has got to do 

is to say "recklessly."

 MR. HEYTENS: It is certainly true that 

Congress has --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an -- it's an accepted 

term. Every -- well, almost everybody knows what -- is 

a model Penal Code standard, and so on.  All they have 

to do is put the word "recklessly" in there. It would 

cover every "knowingly" case. It wouldn't omit anything 

that is covered by this, and it would solve precisely 

that problem. And they didn't do it.

 MR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree there are 

other ways that Congress could have written the statute 

to make it clear. But I think it -- they could have 

written the statute in a way that would be more clear, 

both that would resolve the case in favor of the 

Petitioner, and it would resolve the case in favor of 

us. So I don't know how that cuts either way.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I tell you what cuts 

one way or another. I -- I find it -- I find it, well, 

not surprising because I have heard -- I have heard the 

government do it before. You acknowledge that this is 

an ambiguous statute. That -- that on its face it -- it 

could mean the one thing or the other.

apply the Rule of Lenity. Since it could go either way, 

let's assume that the defendant gets the -- the tie goes 

to the defendant. What -- why shouldn't I resolve it 

that way?

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, under the Rule of 

Lenity, Justice Scalia, the tie does go to the 

defendant. But, as the Court has made clear again and 

again including in its opinion in Hayes, the fact that 

the statutory text has a certain amount of ambiguity 

doesn't automatically trigger the Rule of Lenity. The 

Rule of Lenity --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Shouldn't it --

shouldn't it -- is it time to revisit the Court's 

decision in Hayes?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HEYTENS: The Court -- what the Court 

said yesterday in Hayes is precisely what it said before 

in Liparota. The Rule of Lenity comes into play at the 

end of the proper statutory interpretation after you 

consider text, purpose, legislative history, and all 

other --

JUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, and that 

is actually where I was going. It -- it seems to me 

where the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us 

doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with

this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft.

 And where the argument lies is between did 

Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to 

engage in identity theft or people who, while not 

intending to do so, have that effect. That's the issue.

 MR. HEYTENS: I think that is --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I don't thing I can 

resolve that one way or the other from anything you have 

said. It is rather hard to say. So, therefore, suppose 

I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying 

out. I am not buying it.

 In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, 

there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of 

Lenity with bite. And that is because mandatory 

minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw 

some people into the box who shouldn't be there. And if 

this person should be there and we put him outside, the 

judge could give him the same sentence anyway.

 So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person 

outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the 

government is small. The harm to the individual by 

wrongly throwing him into the box is great. The Rule of 

Lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of 

cases where it has particular force, but this is one of 

them.

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I -- I guess 

what I would say first and foremost is I -- I would -- I 

think that would be a fairly significant 

reconceptualization of the purpose of the Rule of 

Lenity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I raised it.

 MR. HEYTENS: Right. The Court -- if I can 

just explain why I think that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to rename it the 

rule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something.

 MR. HEYTENS: The rule -- the Court has said 

over and over again that the two purposes of the Rule of 

Lenity are providing fair warning to people before their 

conduct subjects them to criminal punishment and to 

demonstrate the proper respect for the lawmaking powers 

of Congress. I don't think the fact that a statute 

imposes a mandatory minimum triggers either one of those 

concerns in and of itself.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what about the --

the even division -- I think it is an even division, 3/3 

-- is it a 3/3 split? And if you wanted one indication 

that this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, it is 

that -- that good minds have reached opposite 

conclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides. 

So it seems to me that this is a very strong argument

that this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so.

 And I factor into that the answer that was 

given to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me 

the first time I read it: That the prosecutor would 

say, Your Honor, I am saying no different degree of 

culpability. One happened to get a fictitious number; 

the other happened to get a real number; two years for 

the second one. There is no difference at all in the 

state of mind of -- of the two defendants. That's --

that's why I think the -- the ambiguity argument is 

strong. Why in the world would Congress want to draw 

such a line?

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, again, if I could --

there are several things there. If I could start with 

the last one, why would Congress want to draw such a 

line, I think the reason Congress would want to draw 

such a line is for several reasons.

 First and foremost is the fundamentally 

fix-and-focus nature of this statute. And I -- I agree 

that at least on first blush that Judge Friedman's 

policy does strike a number of people as implausible.

 But I think if you step back, things like 

that are not uncommon throughout the criminal law. The 

-- the precise same objection could be made to the 

existence of the felony-murder rule. Two people go out

to engage in precisely the same unlawful course of 

conduct. Neither one of them wants to kill anybody, and 

neither one of them wants anyone to get hurt. In one of 

them the gun goes off, and in one of them the gun 

doesn't go off. And one of them is now guilty of felony 

murder, and the other one is guilty of -- of robbery, 

which is admittedly a serious crime but not as serious 

of a crime as murder. There are other examples of that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but in this 

particular case, when you talk about identity theft, it 

is inconceivable the defendant would not know about fact 

that there is another person involved. And so the --

the mens rea issue is easy in this case. The only time 

it's -- it's difficult is when he didn't -- when he did 

not use it for an identity-theft purpose.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I think I -- if I 

understand the question correctly, I think there are 

certainly many cases in which the manner in which the 

defendant uses the means of identification will, itself, 

provide powerful circumstantial evidence that he knows 

there is, in fact, another person. Because otherwise 

the action won't make any sense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And those are the category 

of cases in which Congress wanted to have a more severe 

penalty.

MR. HEYTENS: I certainly agree that those 

are actually some of the categories of cases. I -- I --

what I guess I disagree about is that those are the only 

category of cases. And I -- I can try another tack on 

that.

 When you -- when you review the -- the House 

report, the legislative history that talks about the 

reason, the background, the need for the legislation, 

Congress repeatedly trots out a great many statistics 

about the number of people who are victimized by 

identity theft, the amount of dollar harm that is caused 

to people and businesses by identity theft, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In any of those cases did 

they talk about unknowing identity theft?

 MR. HEYTENS: What I guess I am saying, 

Justice Stevens, is in none of those cases did Congress 

-- when it was trotting out those statistics did 

Congress distinguish between situations in which the 

victim was able to determine whether the defendant knew 

that he existed. I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this in the statute?

 MR. HEYTENS: It is not in the context of 

the statute, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's not say 

Congress, then. Does -- does the Committee?

MR. HEYTENS: The Committee report, I

JUSTICE STEVENS: You might not convince 

Justice Scalia of this, but you might convince me.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. HEYTENS: What I am saying is when the 

courts were talking about the harm suffered by -- the 

amount of harm, in the course of talking about the 

number of people who report that they were victims, 

there is no distinction made whatsoever based on the 

distinction that the Petitioner would like to draw. And 

I think there is a very good, practical reason for that.

 A person who discovers that there is a 

problem with their Social Security number having been 

misused, for example, by someone, that person is almost 

certainly not going to be able to figure out whether the 

person who used their Social Security number knows that 

they exist or not. All they know is that problems are 

now showing up on their credit reports. All they know 

is they are getting questions from the Social Security 

Administration. About this earned income that they 

haven't paid taxes on, for example. The person who is 

in the position of the victim is not well positioned to 

determine how the perpetrator got hold of their 

identifying information.

If I could go back --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in that 

case you tell them, look, the person's got 10 years. 

Right? If they find the guy, he is going to face up to 

10 years for identity fraud.

 MR. HEYTENS: He is going to face up to 

10 years, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that's the 

important thing. I think Congress rationally could have 

been concerned that the guy is not actually going to get 

10 years because there was evidence before them that the 

person was not getting 10 years, that the person was 

being, at least in the judgment of some people, not 

receiving sufficient punishment to reflect that, that 

there was a real person who was harmed by the conduct --

that was harmed by the conduct that eventually had an 

adverse impact on him.

 I think that fundamentally was the 

motivating force behind the statute, the need to have a 

statute that takes adequate and discreet account for the 

presence of real victims. Now the Petitioner, for 

example, refers to the statement of having a 

method-statute excuse, as having a mandatory minimum. 

It's not correct to say the statute has a mandatory 

minimum. This statute has a mandatory, discreet, 

prescribed punishment. It is not two years up to

something else. It is two years, and exactly two years.

 And I think that's highly significant. 

Because I think what it says is that Congress thought 

there was a discreet measure of punishment that was 

appropriate to reflect the presence of a real victim. 

The fact that there is a real victim gets you two years. 

You get whatever else you get on your underlying felony, 

which can take into account all sorts of other 

considerations about your crime, but the fact that there 

was a discreet victim is an independent harm to that 

person that should be taken into account in imposing 

criminal punishment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You could also say you get 

two years for knowing that there is a discreet victim. 

I mean -- I -- you can describe it either way.

 MR. HEYTENS: You certainly can.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it makes sense either 

way.

 MR. HEYTENS: You certainly can describe it 

either way, but I think in light of the concern that the 

harms to real victims are not being adequately taken 

into account, it doesn't seem to us to make sense to 

make the presence of that additional punishment turn on 

whether the defendant is specifically aware that the 

victim existed, and I think at the end of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you gave earlier 

the felony murder example of the one who, the gun goes 

off, he didn't mean to kill anybody. But I thought 

homicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this 

statute was entirely victim-centered, because a person 

is just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver 

as a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly 

distinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that 

the harm was identical.

 MR. HEYTENS: We certainly do, Justice 

Ginsburg, and we don't make the extravagant claim that 

law doesn't look to relative moral culpability in 

assigning criminal punishment. I'm responding to the 

argument on the other side that that's all the law ever 

looks to. The law frequently looks to two different 

things; it looks to relative culpability levels, but it 

also looks at the existence of harm. If you want to 

continue with the homicide example, if you look at moral 

culpability, two people who both intentionally attempt 

to cause the death of another human being without any 

legal excuse for doing so, from a culpability standpoint 

they engaged in precisely the same level of moral wrong; 

but law treats attempted murder and completed murder 

extremely differently from one another. And that's 

because in one case, as Justice Ginsburg points out, you

have a real victim, a person dies; there is a discreet 

level of harm to the victim that is not -- that does not 

occur when fortunately the person who tries to kill 

someone else fails.

 And I think at the end of the day that is 

the most important issue in this case. You see this 

argument again and again and again, especially in the 

circuits -- let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's point 

about the three circuits that have gone either way.

 First, as a -- as just a threshold matter, 

this Court has said repeatedly that the fact that courts 

have disagreed about the proper interpretation of a 

statute doesn't suffice to trigger the rule of lenity, 

because this Court almost never takes a case where there 

is not a circuit split. And to say the existence of a 

circuit split makes the statute ambiguous would mean 

that the criminal defendant wins every time; and the 

Court has not said that.

 But -- but also I think where those courts 

have fundamentally gone wrong is they have essentially 

said this is a crime about theft; theft requires you to 

know that there is a real owner; if you don't know there 

is a real owner, that is not theft. And I think where 

they went wrong was at the very beginning.

is asking the question of whether it is natural to refer 

to someone like Petitioner as a thief. We think the 

more appropriate question as the district court said in 

Godin is whether it would be at all unusual to refer to 

the two innocent people whose Social Security number and 

alien registration number Petitioner used to facilitate 

his two underlying felonies were the victims of identity 

theft.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the problem 

with that is the statute says identity theft; it doesn't 

say anything about victims.

 MR. HEYTENS: It certainty does, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but it says identity theft; it says -- not 

"theft," and I think the question is whether you refer 

to those people as having -- identity theft occurred in 

this case. And I think if you look at from the victim's 

perspective, which we think the perspective that 

Congress was looking at it from, the answer to that 

question is yes. And for that reason we ask that the 

judgment of the Eighth Circuit be affirmed. Thank you.

I would like to address just a couple of 

quick questions about the text, and then -- other issues 

as appropriate.

 Justice Breyer, you asked if there were 

examples of other statutes in which knowledge 

requirements didn't extend to all the elements, but the 

government gave two examples. The first, Morissette, is 

clearly an example with a jurisdictional element. All 

of the circuit courts that say that the knowledge 

requirement doesn't extend to, of the United States, do 

so on the grounds that because there is a jurisdictional 

elements and jurisdictional elements don't extend --

don't require mens rea.

 With respect to the Chin example, I do 

acknowledge that there -- there is a decision that this 

Court hasn't reviewed in which the D.C. Circuit says it 

doesn't extend to the age of the victim. That falls 

within a category of special cases where courts have 

treated the victimization of children differently, in 

part because it's so difficult and nearly impossible to 

group the defendant's knowledge of the age of the 

victim.

 That kind of practical barrier simply 

doesn't exist here for all the reasons we've discussed 

earlier about the government's ability to rely on

15-year olds who look like they're over 21?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. With respect to 

the victim-focused nature of this, again, it's true that 

-- that criminal law takes into account both defendant 

culpability and harm to victims; but the ordinary 

resolution is to reserve punishment in the criminal 

system for those who intend the harms that they inflict. 

There are, of course, exceptions like felony murder. As 

the history of this points out, that kind of treatment 

tends to be reserved for serious bodily injury or death 

kinds of harm, and there is no reason to think that 

Congress thought, although identity theft is serious, 

that this fell within that kind of category of 

exceptions. There are of course these other exceptions 

where Congress relies on facts not known to the 

defendant for sentencing enhancement, but as I've 

mentioned earlier, it tends to write those statutes in a 

way that makes clear that those enhancement factors are 

separate and apart from the underlying events, and they 

don't include an expressed mens rea requirement then.

The government has to say that any case, any statute 

that looks like this, that has been treated as a 

sentencing enhancement provision.

 Finally, with respect to the rule of lenity, 

the government I think has acknowledged that the 

statutory text is at least ambiguous with respect to 

whether or not it compels their conclusion. They 

acknowledge that you can make policy arguments both ways 

about what would be a good idea about how to treat this 

kind of conduct, and I think regardless of your view of 

what the trigger of the rule of lenity is, this is a 

classic case for it.

 If Congress intended the government's 

interpretation, the government is free to go back to 

Congress, and there is every reason to believe that 

Congress will be receptive. The problem with 

overconstruing a mandatory sentence or a mandatory 

minimum, as Justice Breyer was alluding to, is that it 

does have this particularly harsh effect, and one that 

is as a practical matter hard to undo in the legislative 

process, which as the Court has recognized, is another 

function served by the rule of lenity.

 If the Court has no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
