 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in James versus United States. 

Mr. Crawford?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD, ESQ.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CRAWFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's 

troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the 

Armed Career Criminal Act. Under the text and structure 

of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this 

Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida 

attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as 

they -- these types of convictions do not involve 

explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious 

potential risk of physical injury to another.

 The Respondent in their brief has enunciated 

a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify, 

and that test that they enunciate is basically a 

district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their 

common sense and experience to determine whether an 

offense should qualify. That type of test is not the 

kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and

Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at 

determining whether convictions should qualify.

 The categorical approach that this Court 

enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of 

prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements 

of those crimes.

 As such, the Government's argument would 

open up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to 

bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to 

be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act. For 

instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree 

felony in Florida. It's a five-year statutory maximum. 

Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated, 

it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory 

maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs. Yet, 

if the Government's approach to the interpretation of 

the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple 

possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using 

their common sense and everyday experience determines it 

presents a serious potential risk of physical 

injury to another. Obviously --

JUSTICE ALITO: If we were looking at 

attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that 

involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk 

of physical injury to another?

MR. CRAWFORD: Your Honor, in Taylor, this 

Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or 

generic burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that 

serious potential risk when the person actually enters 

the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an 

attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most 

other States, that act has not occurred. You haven't 

entered, the defendant has not entered the property.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the would-be burglar is 

climbing through the window or on a ladder with the 

intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that 

involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?

 MR. CRAWFORD: If the conduct -- again, 

we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry. 

Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far. 

Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that 

actually occurs. But if you were to say that the 

attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to 

get into the place and the person actually didn't get 

in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the 

person enters. The risk is much less outside the 

dwelling than inside the dwelling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Florida, that 

would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the 

curtilage around the house?

MR. CRAWFORD: The curtilage is a unique 

concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the 

enclosed space around the house that has some kind of 

enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes. So if 

the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to 

the residence, that would actually be a burglary within 

the State of Florida. In other States, it may not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And we don't 

even have to ask whether that presents a serious 

potential risk under the statute, right? Because, if 

burglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without 

the need to resort to the definition?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, it would be a burglary 

in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated 

in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very 

specific. It is the entering a dwelling or structure. 

And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary 

without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a 

curtilage burglary.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you could do it in a 

noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the 

ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of 

the ladder. I mean, you would have -- you would have taken 

a substantial step. You would have made an attempt. Now 

why would that not qualify under the words of the

statute that referred to a potential risk? Haven't you 

created the potential for the risk of harm that the 

statute is getting at when you take the substantial 

step?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, trying to use the 

Court's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about my question 

first?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, haven't you in the 

words of the statute, created the potential for the risk 

when you take that substantial step by starting up the 

ladder?

 MR. CRAWFORD: If you started up the ladder 

and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction 

came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that 

would be a potential risk. Whether it's a serious 

potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you wouldn't analyze it 

on the basis of whether this defendant started up the 

ladder. As I understand, you would -- you have to 

analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted 

burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk; 

isn't that the way it has to be done?

 MR. CRAWFORD: That's the way that we submit

it has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those 

facts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your 

argument was that that analysis would not lead to the 

result unfavorable to your client because the nature of 

starting up the ladder did not create or could not 

reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.

 In other words, I thought you were saying --

maybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason 

the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a 

substantial step -- which is what the indictment would 

charge -- could not be seen as creating the potential 

risk that the statute talks about.

 Now if I'm not understanding your argument 

correctly, you know, straighten me out here.

 MR. CRAWFORD: I think I understand. That 

substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder, 

Mr. James would submit based on the language of the 

statute, would not qualify and would not create that 

serious potential risk of physical injury.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why simply 

charging attempted burglary will never satisfy the 

statute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.

 MR. CRAWFORD: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But even if it would,

that's only one manner of attempt. And it seems to me, 

if you're going to do it generically, you have to look 

over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does 

the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, 

a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the 

specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or 

extortion? Indeed, I guess you have to use the least 

dangerous. Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of 

those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or 

the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct. 

Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes 

already mentioned, and I would say that means that the 

unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a 

risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes 

mentioned, which I would take to be extortion.

 Wouldn't you say?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Of those four, extortion does 

seem to potentially have the least risk of all those 

crimes enumerated. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's a potential 

risk, by the way?

 MR. CRAWFORD: A potential risk --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A potential potential? I 

mean, every risk is potential, isn't it?

Respondent's brief, they talked about how risk and 

potential and serious, some of those worlds potentially 

knock each other out, and I apologize for using that 

very word, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think potential risk is 

just risk really?

 MR. CRAWFORD: I think it is a risk.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't one way of 

looking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I 

thought it's just redundant. But it may very well be 

that the word potential is in there in order to 

accommodate attempts.

 MR. CRAWFORD: If that were true, I mean, 

Congress when they wrote the statute, and in 

924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically 

enumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that 

violence. So it has an element, use of or attempted use 

of, or threatened use of physical force. But under 

prong two, they specifically deleted that word 

"attempt".

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Specifically deleted 

or didn't --

MR. CRAWFORD: They did not include it, and 

under --

different than specifically deleting it. In other 

words, it was never there in the proposal.

 MR. CRAWFORD: In 1984 actually, there was a 

proposal where burglary would qualify and attempted 

burglary would qualify. That was passed by the Senate, 

never passed by the House, never enacted.

 So later on when burglary was actually 

defined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary 

that Taylor came close to defining the same way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, do I understand 

your submission to be that putting a ladder against the 

side of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the 

ladder, that that generically does not pose a potential 

risk of physical injury?

 MR. CRAWFORD: If that were the only way to 

prove an attempted burglary within a State, if that 

would be -- that would be the requirement, the legal 

requirement that you have to put the ladder against the 

house and that's an element of the offense, that to me 

would be a much closer call; but still, under the 

analysis that we have provided the Court with the 

Russello presumption, it should not qualify. But it is 

a closer case.

 Whereas categorically when you look at 

attempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the

side of the house is an element of the offense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We understand from 

your friend on the other side that an overt act toward 

fulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law. 

In other words, it's not just enough to have burglary 

tools in your house.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to take 

an affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.

 MR. CRAWFORD: It is an overt act that is 

beyond mere thinking about it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why doesn't anybody -- you 

know, count. It sounds to me if you're wondering about 

whether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could 

find out. Look at the conviction that in Florida for 

attempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary, 

and see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which 

people are harmed is roughly similar. We have all these 

law professors who like statistics. Now they like law in 

economics and everything. So why don't they go out 

there and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of 

sitting here and trying to figure out something I know 

nothing about. I've never been involved in a lot of 

burglaries. I don't know how the burglaries operate. I 

suspect some people are hurt, but rather than my

suspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're not going to be 

able to do that in time to decide this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But wouldn't it be, as a 

method of approaching --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It would also keep the 

professors from other mischief.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do we know about 

the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime? For 

example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess 

burglary tools. Does it mean or does it exclude casing 

the house, walking up and down the street, around the 

block?

 When is a step substantial enough to 

constitute an attempt under Florida law?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, it's not really a step 

analysis, a substantial step analysis. It is an overt 

act. It's some overt act manifesting your intent to 

actually --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is that concretely? 

It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the 

place. What qualifies as an overt act that would make 

one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?

person's house and you had burglary tools in your car 

and you had maybe even called to make sure the business 

was closed and you were driving there and as you're 

driving there you're telling the person sitting beside 

you: I'm going to break into that, you know, business 

at 254 Main Street. That would be enough under Florida 

law to convict someone for attempted burglary of a 

structure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we have to decide 

how many attempts involve that kind of initial action, 

which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how 

many of them involve putting a ladder up against the 

side of the house.

 How do we possibly figure that out, to 

decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from 

attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of 

risk from extortion?

 MR. CRAWFORD: That may be -- that may be a 

very difficult question to answer, and maybe the 

Respondent had that obligation in the district court, 

because they have the obligation to prove that this 

enhancement has that substantial or that serious 

potential risk of physical injury to another and of 

course they didn't do that. But if you look back in 

this Court's decision in 1985 in Tennessee versus

Garner, this Court was talking about completed 

burglaries and it talked about physical violence to a 

person would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the 

percentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time.

 But that's in a completed burglary. That's 

not even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the 

risk --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question: It seems to me there are two ways to read the 

burglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are 

clear examples of crimes that would involve harm to 

individuals, physical injury to another; or they are put 

in the statute to say, even though they don't involve 

serious risk, these specific crimes will be covered, 

because your statistic of 3 percent suggests that 

burglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime 

that presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the 

statute nevertheless defines it.

 So do you read those terms as giving 

examples of crimes that would not involve that risk of 

injury or as examples of crimes that would?

 MR. CRAWFORD: I think it can be read either 

way, although I think even the Government's brief in 

-- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about 

extortion and burglary being crimes that can be

committed with no risk of physical injury to another 

person and yet Congress still specifically 

enumerated those --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, if you had 

that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word 

"otherwise". You would have simply said is burglary, 

arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or 

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk. 

The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in 

some other manner, some other manner -- other from what? 

Other from the preceding ones.

 I don't think there is any sensible way to 

read it except, you know, in some other manner than 

these previously named crimes involves a physical risk; 

and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the 

least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and 

any crime you want to get into this residual category 

has to be at least as dangerous as that. As I've said, 

I think that's extortion.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Using that analysis, it's 

hard to figure out, but again the Government had this 

obligation or we submit the Government had this 

obligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary 

to be any more dangerous.

is conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a 

serious potential risk as burglary does?

 MR. CRAWFORD: In Florida, or in the 

Eleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracy 

to commit enumerated offenses do present that serious 

potential risk.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, go ahead.

 MR. CRAWFORD: So in the Eleventh Circuit 

they have determined that. But again, we submit under 

that Russello presumption or even the statute itself, 

Congress enumerated those four property crimes, 

primarily property crimes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that seem 

like a fine line? I mean, if you're sitting around with 

your coconspirator planning it you can be covered under 

this provision, planning a burglary. But if you 

actually get out there with the burglary tools, you put 

the ladder against the door and you start up the ladder, 

that somehow involves less of a potential risk of 

physical injury?

 MR. CRAWFORD: They both present very little 

potential risk. They don't even really -- under a 

serious potential risk, they don't present that. A 

conspiracy shouldn't either. A conspiracy and attempt 

are not different things because a conspiracy doesn't

Eleventh Circuit is wrong?

 MR. CRAWFORD: I believe the Eleventh 

Circuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If we don't know and if I 

can't get too far with the language and I frankly could 

sit in my office looking at the computer screen I think 

for hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether 

there is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies 

attempted burglary, but that is something that is 

possible to know. All we have to do, as I said before, 

is count and there are a lot of people who can do that. 

In fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to 

do it and that is the sentencing commission. So they 

have the tools. They have the ability. And so in the 

absence on a question like this of my being able to get 

anywhere by cogitating about the language and in a 

borderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as 

a Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of 

what the sentencing commission did in the absence of 

better information from some other place?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, the sentencing 

commission when they were interpreting the career 

offender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a

guideline that is worded different than the --

JUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to find out 

the same answer to the same kind of question: How many 

of these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how 

many other crimes are accompanied by an individual being 

hurt? And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that 

question in a borderline case without trying to find the 

numbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I 

don't have them, why don't I look to the best, second 

best alternative, which is at least they could get them, 

and I hope they did get them before coming to the 

conclusion they did.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, they came to that 

conclusion dealing with whether a career offender 

provision should include attempted burglary not under 

the armed career criminal statute and they specifically 

recognized that.

 Moreover, when they dealt with whether they 

wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing 

with career offender, which has, although it increases 

the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it 

certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero 

to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.

 So for those reasons, even if the sentencing 

commission feels that the career offender statute or

guideline should include attempted burglary, that 

doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed 

career criminal statute.

 Moreover, the career offender statute says 

it's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed 

career criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if 

it's a dwelling or a structure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, we've held 

that the named crimes have to be considered generically 

according to their elements, right? Burglary, arson. 

Have we ever held that the residual category or 

"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious 

potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be 

decided generically? I mean, if we could apply that 

residual category, not generically but according to the 

crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant 

has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against 

the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to 

me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't 

it? We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious 

risk of physical injury.

 Is there any obstacle to doing that?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Well, Taylor and Shepard both 

talk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) should 

be looked at in a -- using a categorical approach, and

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it's not too late to 

save ourselves from sending out legions of law 

professors to do studies.

 MR. CRAWFORD: If the Court were to step 

back and say that the "otherwise" clause should be 

interpreted in a noncategorical manner and we're going 

to -- the Court decides it's a factual-based approach, 

in Mr. James' case there are no facts, so it may not 

make any difference for him because there's no facts to 

indicate what kind of burglary really occurred here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean no facts in the 

indictment or charging documents?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is in the 

presentence report?

 MR. CRAWFORD: That is correct. There were 

facts that were presented in the presentence report that

doubt that, at least with respect to two of the other 

named crimes, attempts would present a serious potential 

risk? In other words, attempted arson or attempted use 

of explosives? You concede those would be covered, 

don't you?

 MR. CRAWFORD: Actually, no. Those crimes, 

attempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's 

something about an attempted arson statute that has as 

an element or something that presents a serious 

potential risk of physical injury to another, which at 

least in Florida that's not the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think attempted 

use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion? 

I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is 

concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is 

much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Getting back to your 

question, maybe this answers part of it: Although the 

Court -- you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question 

about why can't we make this basically maybe a 

fact-based inquiry. And if you were to do so, the whole 

categorical approach that we're dealing with in all the 

other sections would almost become irrelevant because if 

something doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to 

a fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole

purpose of the categorical approach.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Crawford, does the 

record show that the facts in the PSR came from police 

reports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the 

court records?

 MR. CRAWFORD: The plea colloquy was not 

ever presented or produced, and it does show that they 

came from police reports.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Where is that in the record?

 MR. CRAWFORD: I believe that is stated in 

the PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under the 

attempted burglary, which again were objected to. 

Specifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to, 

but the use of the attempted burglary was objected to, 

and both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit 

took that as being an objection to using anything 

regarding the attempted burglary.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a 

question about the relationship between generic burglary 

and what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt? 

And what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was 

alluded to in the Jones case.

 Do you understand Florida law on attempted 

burglary to be as follows: that there must be an overt 

act taken toward entering either a dwelling or a

structure, as distinct from an overt act taken to get

 MR. CRAWFORD: The evidence -- I see my time 

is up. Little me briefly answer this question. Or -- I 

want to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal. 

Very quickly, the overt act has to refer to the 

attempting to enter the dwelling. And so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So there's no such thing as 

attempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense 

under burglary under Florida law.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Under Florida law attempting 

to enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is 

the same thing. Dwelling is defined as the building or 

the curtilage.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so when you say 

dwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include 

curtilage.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Correct.

 Petitioner's conviction for attempted 

burglary of a dwelling under Florida law is a violent 

felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because like 

the crime of burglary Petitioner's crime categorically 

involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk 

of physical injury to another.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, do you agree 

with your brother's answer to my last question that 

there would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under 

Florida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an 

overt act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from 

entering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes, while I would disagree 

with that, but while there are -- with your 

characterization. But there are no -- the number of 

reported cases involving an attempted burglary that 

involved an attempt to get on to the curtilage, if -- I 

think -- based on --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know basically 

what Florida law is? I mean, is that the best answer?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. I don't, I don't think 

you could conclude, they have -- there is no decision 

telling you whether that would suffice. But we're not

attempted entry into the curtilage.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So that literally, I take 

it then if someone did have a fence around the house, 

and I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn 

toward the fence, with the intent of getting over the 

fence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as 

an attempted burglary under Florida law?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes -- it could. It could --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Would that be true if I 

simply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get 

on the other side of the fence but not into the 

dwelling? For example, you know, I wanted to steal the 

apples on the tree?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Would that qualify as 

attempted burglary?

 MR. MARCUS: I think it could. I think --

but I think you --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that give you a 

pretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a 

sufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that 

qualifies under the act?

discussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage 

narrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage 

narrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that 

immediately surrounds the dwelling. And the case 

discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts 

of appeals where the courts construed the concept of 

curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana 

that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling 

house, in another case a whiskey still that was a 

distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house, 

that those were too far out to be considered part of the 

curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds 

the dwelling that's associated with the intimate 

activities of the dwelling. So Florida -- and Florida 

-- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme 

Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly 

construe that concept, and when it said it's not going 

to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable 

results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of 

burglary is.

 So I think the -- so the first step, I 

think, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way 

Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress 

had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it 

presents a categorically different set of risks such that it

would even fall outside the otherwise clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: There are a number of 

Florida cases that involve open carports. How would you 

apply it there? Somebody, if you had a carport that's 

not fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the 

street, somebody walks into the carport and steals a 

garden rake?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think under the 

current, I think under the current statute, it has been 

amended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is 

relevant, the statute is relevant to this case. I think 

now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself, 

the structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under 

the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not 

enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other 

structure it would not be considered part of the 

curtilage. And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case, 

it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that 

had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and 

noted that the court in that case hadn't determined 

whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.

 So it does -- the statute does -- the 

concept does require an enclosure and the area 

immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is 

very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in

that way, in that limited way, that someone who's 

intending to get on to a residence into the area either 

in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not 

sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that 

Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of 

the paradigmatic offenses in the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So in an ordinary city street 

in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of 

houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in 

front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or 

there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes 

up to the house and starts to monkey around with the 

window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted 

burglary, not burglary, in Florida?

 MR. MARCUS: That -- yes. That is my 

understanding. If it was not enclosed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then I doubt 

-- then again I'm left at sea. I don't know how often 

that happens or is dangerous. So if I think that this 

is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it 

is -- and the Government is in the best position, they 

have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over 

there. So what about a presumption against the Government? 

In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a 

statistical question, and the Government doesn't have

courts would have statistics available to --

JUSTICE BREYER: How are you supposed to 

decide it if there's a question as there is this instance 

I think?  I just don't know how dangerous attempted 

burglaries are. I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit 

there are a lot of things I don't know but there are. 

And this is one of them.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, there are several things 

you can do. First you can look at the text of the 

statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I read the text several 

times.

 MR. MARCUS: Congress provided some guidance 

by setting out four examples of crimes that do present 

the type of risk they had in mind.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. And here I think 

it might be less than burglary. And extortion, though 

one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or 

something and revealing a secret from the past -- many 

such crimes are threats of violence. I mean, and that 

just read through the statutes, and that's what they are 

aiming at. So I would say extortion is something that

quite often could involve violence.

 But again that's cogitating. So I get 

to attempted burglary. I don't know. Now what do I do?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think -- I think you 

have to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enacting 

the statute, Congress directed your attention to the 

serious potential risk that an offense presents. I 

think that just -- and criminal law requires courts and 

juries all the time to take into account and to use 

their common sense and experience to judge the risks 

that are presented by a particular crime. I mean, the 

very concept of recklessness itself refers to a 

substantial disregard of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Marcus, it is a lot 

easier to do that with respect to the facts and 

circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it 

generically -- you know -- picking out attempted 

burglary. It is very hard to do that. Why shouldn't we 

read this, this residual category to refer to the facts 

and circumstances of the particular crime of which the 

defendant has been convicted? The language enables you 

to do that. The term violent felony means any crime 

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year 

that involves conduct that presents a serious potential 

risk of injury, physical injury to another.

Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean

this defendant stands convicted?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, all that -- this law has 

been interpreted for many years. No courts of appeals 

have, have construed that it way. They have construed 

it to require a categorical approach. And then if you 

look at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly 

with respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort 

of a categorical approach that, while these courts had, 

sort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post 

basis, it might not present any risk, the idea that 

these crimes categorically present a potential -- a 

serious potential risk of physical injury.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And would you agree, 

Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard 

excludes that interpretation? If you look at the 

particular crime?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think the Court 

referred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- to 

Congress's approach. And under the statute, that sort 

of that it wants you to take a categorical approach to 

crimes that are inherently presented --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't we -- didn't we also 

go further and say one reason to construe it that way is

we don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having

establish -- you know -- the facts of old trials. There 

was an administrability analysis involved. I think 

there was. Yeah, I wrote Shepard. And I think that's 

what --

MR. MARCUS: There was that as well. And I 

don't think it is beyond the ability of courts to 

take a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure 

out what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements 

and then use common sense and experience to make a 

judgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by 

that conduct. Looking at the situation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus, isn't there 

this -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway? 

Because this language if it said -- that sometimes 

presents a serious risk, then the answer would be 

obvious. If otherwise it said that characteristically 

presents a serious risk, then it might be closer. And 

which do you think is the more normal reading of it?

 I think either is -- certainly fits the 

language.

 MR. MARCUS: And either --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Either means sometimes 

presents a potential risk of physical injury, then

obviously they're all covered. Or if it says 

characteristically presents the risk, potential risk, 

then do you have to decide whether that, it is a 

characteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it 

does present this risk or that just once in a while it 

does.

 MR. MARCUS: No. I think it's not -- no I 

think it has to, characteristically taken at a general 

level, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of 

getting --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If that were true, and if 

as your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's 

only three percent of them actually involve risk to --

of physical injury to another, then attempted burglary 

must necessarily be somewhat less than three percent. I 

would think that. Would that satisfy the characteristic 

requirement?

 MR. MARCUS: I think it would. First of 

all, Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it two or three 

percent?

 MR. MARCUS: The statistics he is referring 

to came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986 

and expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as 

one of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically

presented a serious potential risk of injury.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think that's 

perfectly clear. The "otherwise" language does suggest 

that you are right. But if the statute instead of 

saying "otherwise" had said, "or involves other conduct 

that presents a serious risk," which I think is a 

permissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but 

if it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as 

a given the fact that the others satisfy the violent 

requirement but rather that they are eligible, whether 

or not they do.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, this Court interpreted 

the statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on 

page -- on page 597 of Taylor. I mean this Court said 

that Congress's choice of language indicates that 

Congress thought ordinary burglaries as well as 

burglaries involving some aspect making them especially 

dangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential 

risk to count toward enhancement. I mean, that's right 

in the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be 

the correct reading of the statute. Because why did 

Congress identify -- they created two categories of 

violent felonies. The first is with respect to an 

element of the offense that goes to targeting a person 

for physical harm. The second category are those crimes

that don't necessarily target a person for physical harm 

but necessarily present, inherently present a risk of 

physical injury to a person.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if 

burglary were the only thing that Congress said there, 

but it also said extortion. And I think it absolutely 

fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically --

characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm. 

I just don't think it does.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, Congress identified it as 

a violent felony presumably because it believed it had 

-- it had the criteria.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but is the criterion 

"characteristically," or is the criterion whatever 

minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, that it carries the 

potential risk, because when any -- when someone 

commits extortion there might be a tendency to -- if 

there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the level of potential 

risk the level that exists in extortion? Right? That's 

what the otherwise refers you to.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. To the level of risk 

that's presented by any of the preceding examples. 

That's correct.

 MR. MARCUS: I don't agree, Your Honor. The 

statute directs you to consider the serious potential 

risk.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: One way to do that is to 

say the potential risk is the potential for the risk of 

the harm that comes from the commission of the crime 

itself.

 I mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo 

it, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the 

step on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the 

act itself of putting the ladder up against the building 

and taking the step. It's only because that creates the 

potential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is 

measurable. I mean, we know there are cases in which 

victims get shot when they appear in the course of 

burglaries, but the risk associated with the mere 

attempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.

 MR. MARCUS: When you're assessing the risk 

presented by particular conduct, I think you have to

take into account the intent that goes along with that 

conduct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I agree with you. But 

the act that involved -- the act that constitutes the --

that qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. I'm 

trying to help you here. I mean --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't believe it for 

a minute.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you look at 

the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of 

lesser included offense? I mean, attempts themselves 

have their own independent risk of physical injury. 

Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of 

my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's 

a risk of injury there, even though there's no --

regardless of whether the person gets into the house or 

not.

 And I think perhaps there's even a greater 

risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury 

with respect to attempts because they don't succeed. 

Why don't they succeed? Because something interrupts 

them. And what interrupts them, it may well be the home 

owner. So I don't know that you have to look to sort of 

attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.

MR. MARCUS: Well, Congress doesn't look to 

attempt as a lesser offense. We pointed out in our 

brief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S. 

Criminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the 

completed offense. And if you think about the purpose 

of the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results 

of the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is 

focused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has, 

has demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior 

violent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage 

in behavior that is dangerous, that presents 

dangers to public safety. So if you think about the 

attempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone 

who has committed attempt by definition has intended to 

commit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice, 

has only failed by reason of an unforeseen event. 

Why would Congress in this statute want to differentiate 

between the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't 

succeeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the 

successful burglar? I think the serious potential risk 

language allows you to sort of look at the attempt as 

you said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the 

equivalent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose the 

unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical

injury than the successful burglar.

 MR. MARCUS: Arguably. I mean, if you look 

at the case law, the vast majority of cases, the 

furthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find, 

the most extreme case that he's found involves someone 

who's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or 

casing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme 

example. So even with attempts, you find in all the 

case law, you do find the physical proximity to the 

premises.

 And one of the main reasons it wouldn't 

succeed is because somebody, there's the presence of 

someone who frustrates the entry. So that even on that 

level, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any 

lower risk presented by the attempt.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you say about 

your brother's argument that the statistics show there's 

a 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of 

violence in the course of committing the burglary? I 

take it there isn't any statistic available, if we want 

to take Justice Breyer's approach, about the 

potential -- the actual proven potential for violence at 

the near attempt stage.

 MR. MARCUS: But again, I think -- I don't 

think you need to have those statistics.

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't think you do 

either, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got 

to rest really on the potential for harm in the 

commission of the offense.

 MR. MARCUS: That's the very reason that 

attempts are prohibited, because they present the 

serious potential to produce the harms that the 

completed offense presents.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand, 

we don't need the statistics, I guess they're not 

available, but in your view if we did have statistics 

and they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the 

category of crimes across the nation, there was this 

risk, that would be enough?

 MR. MARCUS: For attempts?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Well, for attempts 

or complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what 

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if 

1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the 

category, did present such a risk, that would be 

sufficient under your view.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes, I think Congress wanted to 

treat a frustrated burglar the same --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. They've shown the same

propensity to engage in the conduct that Congress was 

concerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So then it's a really easy 

case, because really there is some risk in every case. 

There's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump 

into somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.

 MR. MARCUS: But that's not what we're 

asking the Court here. We're asking the Court to look 

at the elements of the offense, and to look at the 

elements of the offense to see whether that creates a 

situation in which violence is likely to arise. Here 

you're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a 

dwelling where you have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but none of the 

elements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical 

injury in the burglary case. You can have unarmed 

burglars.

 MR. MARCUS: But in considering the conduct 

involved in the offense, the attempting to get, the 

attempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home, 

someone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in 

which violence could occur --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. And as I 

understand your view --

MR. MARCUS: That doesn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If in 1/10 of 1 percent of 

the cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation, 

that's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. But again, first of all, 

I don't think the statistics would show that.  I don't 

think logically they would show that in light of the 

numbers that are shown for completed burglary. But 

again, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that 

are covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't 

see why you would distinguish between the person who 

tried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen 

event. They have created the same set of risks, they've 

triggered the same set of risks that the successful 

burglar has.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So in other words, you're 

saying that in measuring the risk, you should consider 

not just what this particular defendant succeeded in 

accomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to 

accomplish?

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct. I think the 

statute permits you to do that with its plain language 

of focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, the 

serious potential risk. And that -- and also in looking 

at the rationale for attempts and why we punish 

attempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished

for attempts because you sufficiently manifested your 

dangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed 

the offense. Again, the State codes, the vast majority 

of State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt 

behavior. They predicate felony murder convictions on 

attempted burglary as well as burglary. And as I said 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about attempted 

assault? I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an 

attempted assault.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think, my understanding 

would be that would be covered under the first subsection 

for the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of 

force.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But it wouldn't 

fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens 

when you try to get away from numbers. Maybe there are 

a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or 

embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during 

an embezzlement and start hitting each other.

 I can't get away from the numbers.

 MR. MARCUS: But there in those type 

offenses, if you look at the elements of the offense, 

there's no nexus between those elements and the -- a 

reaction that someone might have just to being

JUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test? The 

test is either a high statistical number of injuries or 

if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high 

statistical number of injuries? I like the word nexus 

because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea 

what it means.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MARCUS: Well, in this statute you're 

talking about career criminals, people who have 

committed a number of crimes and have recently just been 

convicted of being an armed felon. And I think 

that's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting 

point, and take -- so this case doesn't present 

questions about other cases that might present --

arguably present, or present a serious risk of physical 

injury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the 

crimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress 

had in mind. I think that's another case. This case 

falls at the core of the statute; we're talking about 

someone who intends to commit the core crime Congress 

was talking about.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, assuming we 

accept your view about the way the statute should be 

read, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage

possibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that 

burglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?

 MR. MARCUS: We haven't argued that it is 

generic burglary. That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess my -- so that leads 

me to this question, because -- I mean, I, my 

understanding is it's not a generic burglary.

 Therefore, even on your reading of the 

statute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't 

necessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in 

under the residuary clause, of course. And because 

there is a possibility that the only burglary charged 

was a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't 

we have to send the thing back to find out either from 

court records whether something more than a mere 

penetration of curtilage was involved here? And if so, 

whether -- whether that penetration carried with it the 

potential for harm?

 MR. MARCUS: I mean, no. That's why you 

have the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just as 

this Court said in Taylor, that they weren't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the only thing we 

know under the otherwise clause, is that this was an 

attempt at burglary. If the burglary were a generic 

burglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the

end of the case.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But this is not a generic 

burglary. Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt 

in this case could have been nothing more than stepping 

across the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over 

to take the apple. And therefore, don't we have to go 

to court records? In other words, don't we have to take 

advantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor 

before this case can finally be decided?

 MR. MARCUS: No. I mean, you've identified 

an additional step that the Court has to consider in 

deciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't 

necessarily require you to go to court records. I mean, 

it's our position that even including the curtilage, the 

area, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling 

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could you tell us 

what your position is if we choose to use the 

noncategorical or the modified categorical approach? 

Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence 

report and some other charging documents, or is it just 

in the presentencing report?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. The charging documents 

are not part of the record in this case. The record

think the facts in the presentence report are admitted

 MR. MARCUS: He didn't object to the facts 

in the presentence report. He also did not object --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, can we consider 

them?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So therefore, then the 

question is whether throwing the hammer through the 

window is sufficient; is that right?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, that would resolve 

Justice Souter's question about whether it would involve 

the curtilage at all, which would show that there was an 

attempted physical entry into the residence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you think that the 

hammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do 

look at the individual case?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, we don't -- yes, 

certainly we think that any attempted burglary of a

dwelling presents a serious potential risk 

categorically. But if you didn't agree with that, then, 

and you thought that only a subset of attempted 

burglaries of dwellings would present serious potential 

risk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly 

satisfy any conception of that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because the hammer is 

thrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be 

sure I understand your view of the importance of the 

hammer.

 MR. MARCUS: Because there was an attempted 

physical entry into the residence. The person was right 

on the threshold of the dwelling.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still a little unclear 

as to how much significance we pay to that hammer.

 MR. MARCUS: Again, we don't think you have 

to attribute any particular significance to that. I 

mean, it's our position that categorically this crime is 

covered. And again, the case law shows that there's --

that with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical 

proximity to the dwelling, but even if there was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though there's some 

cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't 

involve any risk to anybody. Say the enterprising but 

careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see

when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses 

to make his entry.

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct. You can always 

posit, under the categorical risk, you could always 

posit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that 

equally applies to burglary as it does to attempted 

burglary. And so while you could posit a hypothetical 

where someone trying to get onto the curtilage might 

seem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think 

categorically about people who are trying to surmount, 

get over fences and walls to commit offenses in the 

dwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're 

presenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the 

Court can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise 

clause, the burglary under Florida law is not so 

different from the kind of burglary that Congress had in 

mind that it would just drop out of the picture 

entirely. Armed felons who have the propensity to go 

into the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in 

the house or right around the house, present the very 

kind of risk that Congress was concerned about.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this 

presentence report cannot be consulted under the 

reasoning of Shepard, we need more?

defendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police 

reports. My understanding is he also submitted an 

affidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of 

anything in the police report. So I think this case is 

distinguishable in that there was no objection to the 

facts in the PSR and there was no objection 

specifically to using the police report as the source 

for those facts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't think the PSR 

has some kind of significance that the police report did 

not?

 MR. MARCUS: It wouldn't, no. I don't think 

it would. But -- no.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is the following sort of 

summary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary 

State, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy 

the burglary prong in subsection 2? But on your 

argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary 

State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the 

"otherwise" prong; is that correct?

 MR. MARCUS: Argument --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a fair statement of 

your argument?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes. If the completed offense 

is a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CRAWFORD: It seems to me that 

Respondent's position is taking the "otherwise" clause 

to trump the entire rest of the statute. Any crime, any 

felony, has a potential of violence. In fact, in 

footnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion 

from the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion 

the court found that serious potential risk for someone 

who failed to report to a jail because they speculate, 

you know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest 

them and there could be violence in that situation. 

Well, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law 

enforcement to arrest somebody. There's always a 

potential for violence.

 So the Government's position --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's different when 

you're dealing with an escapee or someone who has

visitation right and then doesn't report back and 

qualifies as a escaped felon from prison. That's quite 

a bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.

 MR. CRAWFORD: But there's still the same 

potential for violence in either one of those.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's a 

greater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit. There's 

a greater degree of potential when you're dealing with 

someone who's escaped from prison than with someone 

else who's being arrested. Of course there's always the 

potential, but the judgment was that there's a greater 

degree of potential when you're trying to apprehend 

someone who's escaped.

 MR. CRAWFORD: For someone who's escaped. 

Golden wasn't dealing with that. Golden was dealing 

with someone who failed to report to a facility after 

being sentenced to do so. The same could be said for 

someone failing to report to a court for a hearing. A 

bench warrant is issued. The same type of risk would be 

inherent in that type of -- for that person as for 

someone who fails to report to a jail upon being 

sentenced.

 All of those potential crimes, basically 

that would leave open any potential felony to qualify 

under the "otherwise" prong. Congress obviously

couldn't have intended that.

 Moreover, there's still an issue that was 

brought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance. 

How do we actually make these determinations and are 

these necessarily determinations that were found by the 

Florida court or by the Florida system for a Florida 

attempted burglary conviction? We submit it's not.

 And you're going beyond the mere fact of the 

prior conviction. You're looking at many other 

components, the risk of the conviction, which is not the 

same thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction.

 If there are no further questions --
