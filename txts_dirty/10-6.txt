 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 10-6, Global-Tech Appliances 

v. SEB S.A.

 Mr. Dunnegan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The standard for the state of mind element 

for a claim for inducing patent infringement should be: 

Did the accused inducer have a purpose to induce a third 

party to engage in acts that the accused inducer knew 

infringed the patent? That's what I'll call the 

purposeful, culpable test.

 The Federal Circuit applied a standard of 

whether Pentalpha was deliberately indifferent to a 

known risk that a patent may exist. The Federal 

Circuit's deliberate indifference test was not a willful 

blindness test. Willful blindness would have required 

both an awareness of a high probability that a patent 

would exist and a deliberate effort to avoid learning 

the truth.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's okay, as far as

you're concerned? You would consider that comes within 

your first test?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, deliberate 

indifference would not fall -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would not, but willful 

blindness would?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. Willful 

blindness would not fall within our purposeful, culpable 

test.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even willful blindness 

wouldn't be enough?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Willful blindness in not a 

purpose, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that the 

particular patent -- the defendant would have to know 

that the device infringed the particular patent. I 

think that would be a standard that would be impossible 

to meet. We have to know if it was patent number, 

whatever it was, '312.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Well, you wouldn't have to 

know the patent number, Your Honor, but what you would 

have to know is that your -- the product which you are 

inducing a third party to make, use, or sell would be 

within the scope of a -- of the claims of a particular 

patent. If you don't know that, then you're

literally -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can keep yourself 

ignorant of it. I mean, for example, you pointed out 

that the -- that the device that was copied was 

purchased in Hong Kong, so it didn't have any marking, 

but the same Pentalpha could have bought the device in 

Montgomery Ward, looked to see if it had a patent 

marking; didn't do that.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: It didn't do that, Your 

Honor. What it did was better. It hired a United 

States patent attorney to conduct a search to see if 

there was any patent which was infringed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't tell that 

patent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a 

particular product. If the attorney had been told this 

device copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths 

percent sure that the attorney then would have found 

this patent?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: We don't know, Your Honor. 

We don't know why the patent search failed. It could 

have failed for a number of reasons.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I didn't ask you 

about this patent search. I said if they had told the 

patent attorney we have copied a particular fryer, it's 

SEB's fryer, now find out if it infringed any patent -­

do you think an attorney would not have found the SEB 

patent?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: It's possible that he 

wouldn't have. Maybe it's more probable that he would 

have. There's just no evidence on that in the record, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why wouldn't 

you tell him? If you're -- if you're honestly 

interested in finding out whether there is a patent that 

you're infringing, why wouldn't you tell me the reason 

we're concerned is that we have reverse-engineered this 

from somebody else's product? Just check to see if SEB 

has a patent on any of this stuff that we've 

reverse-engineered. That's what I would have done.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, maybe that's what 

you would have done. Maybe that's what I would have 

done, but there's no -- but the standard of that 

business -- what they had done in the past was to give 

their design drawings to the patent attorney and say 

objectively check these design drawings. Their practice 

was not to notify the attorney.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was their practice to 

reverse-engineer from other people's products?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes -­

when you have a new product of your own; of course, you 

just give it to an attorney. But when you have 

reverse-engineered, not to tell them that it was 

reversed-engineered seems to me really trying to keep 

yourself in the dark. What you want to get from the 

attorney is a piece of paper that he can show to 

Montgomery Ward that, yes, this product is not -- as it 

turns out, Montgomery Ward did accept it and got hit 

with liability for infringing a patent. I -- I find 

that really incredible that, in an honest attempt to 

find whether there was any patent infringement going on, 

you wouldn't even tell the patent attorney that you've 

reverse-engineered somebody else's product.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, looking back at 

this in hindsight, there's -- there's no question that 

if they had to do it again, they would have taken the 

additional step.

 But -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, they wouldn't.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No -- well, from an objective 

perspective, Your Honor, if you're giving the design to 

the -- to the attorney and you're saying do a complete 

search, it seems to me that that's the antithesis of 

being willful blind, because you're hiring a specialist 

to go out and look for the answer for you. Now, the

gold standard was not met, but the gold standard would 

rarely be met in any of these cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But your position is that 

even willful blindness is not enough. You have to have 

actual knowledge that -- that the item is patented, 

right?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if the attorney had 

called up your client and said, I have an answer for 

you, and the client said, well, you know what, on second 

thought, I really don't want to know, because if I -- if 

I have actual knowledge, that may put me in a box; so 

forget about it. Then there's no liability.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Well, I would disagree in 

that situation, because most probably the knowledge of 

the attorney in that situation, because he has been 

hired by the client, would be imputed to the client. So 

I could see a different result in the hypothetical that 

you posited.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would we -- wouldn't 

the rule that you're setting forth, willful blindness 

not being a part of it, mean that nobody would ever get 

a patent search, because what would be the inducement to 

do that?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Well, Your Honor, right now,

under -- under the Seagate case in the Federal Circuit, 

there is no inducement to go get a patent search. Under 

the Seagate decision, if a party -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you're not 

presumed to copy other people's items, which is the 

difference.

 Is there -- let me just ask you something. 

Assuming we were to find the willful blindness test to 

actual knowledge, the facts of your case, the fact that 

they did not give the name of the product that they 

copied to their patent attorney, is that just, as a 

matter of law, willful blindness?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

that is willful blindness as a matter of law. Willful 

blindness under the -- under the Santos standard has two 

distinct elements. One would be that there's a high 

probability that there would have been a patent on that 

particular product.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do patents -- are 

patents -- can you do a patent search on the basis of 

the name of the holder?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, you can, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the product that 

they copied, did it have the name of the holder of the 

patent?

MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, it did, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the 

likelihood that if they had actually given the attorney 

the name of the product, that he would not have found 

the patent?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: We don't know for sure, but 

the probability would be greater than 50 percent, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think it would be 

probably 90 percent, assuming -- because there's always 

errors in searches. So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But didn't we take this 

case to determine whether or not deliberate indifference 

is the standard? I mean, willful blindness -- I don't 

think an opinion for this Court has ever sustained. 

Santos was a judgment -- was not a majority opinion. 

That's just a subset of knowledge.

 If we leave that out from it, isn't the 

dichotomy that you present to us the difference between 

deliberate indifference and knowledge or -­

MR. DUNNEGAN: Purpose.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or purposeful, culpable 

expression, the -- the Grokster standard?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes. The -- well, I think to

really need to determine what the standard is. Now, I 

think we can also decide that it should not be -- or we 

can agree that it should not be a deliberate 

indifference to a known risk that a patent exists, 

because that would be met in virtually every situation 

where there was not actual knowledge of a patent.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When I look at the language 

of the statute, I see no scienter requirement 

whatsoever. Whoever actively induces infringement of 

the patent -- infringement is strict liability. So if 

you actively induce somebody to engage in conduct 

constituting infringement, you're -- you're liable as an 

inducer.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Let me explain to you why 

your -- why the language of the statute should not 

support the interpretation which Your Honor just gave.

 Let's begin with the word "induces." 

"Induces" connotes some degree of intent, arguably. 

Mr. Cruz agrees with that at page 20 of his brief. If 

you put the word "actively" in front of the word 

"induces," then you have a heightened intent standard -­

JUSTICE ALITO: You have intent, but intent 

to do what?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Exactly, Your Honor. That 

brings you to the word "infringement" in the statute.

Now, I think it's critical that (b) uses the word 

"infringement." It does not go back to (a) and say 

anyone who actively induces the making, using, selling 

of a patent device is an infringer.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What difference does that 

make? Because making, using, and selling equals 

infringement.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Because those are the acts, 

Your Honor. If Congress's intent had been to say we 

only want to induce acts, it would seem to me the 

clearest way they could say that is to say "making, 

using, or selling." If they wanted to create a standard 

which was inducing the actual infringement of a patent, 

as opposed to the acts which constitute the 

infringement, then they use the word "infringement."

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't see that. And 

not only that, I don't understand why the scienter 

requirement for inducing should be higher than the 

scienter requirement for a direct infringement. Isn't 

the standard rule for aiding and abetting that the aider 

and abetter -- if (b) is an aiding and abetting 

provision, as one of the congressional reports said, the 

-- the scienter for aiding and abetting is the scienter 

of the underlying offense? So if the underlying offense 

is a strict liability offense, then the inducement

should be strict liability as well.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: That's not necessarily clear, 

Your Honor. When you look at 18 U.S.C. section 2, 

there's very little case law dealing with strict 

liability offense and inducements of those. We have 

been able to identify one Sixth Circuit case from 1989 

which deals with the issue, and in that case, it holds 

that there's actually a purpose to -- a purpose to cause 

the underlying crime or violation, not necessarily 

strict liability, not strict liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your -­

MR. DUNNEGAN: I -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No, please, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your position 

when you're -- when you're talking about willful 

blindness or purpose, whatever, is that with respect to 

a particular patent, or is it with respect to 

infringement of a patent?

 I don't think it's true with deep fryers, 

but in some areas, you almost always know you're going 

to hit something, that given the nature of the industry, 

you're going to infringe something. Is that enough?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: If there is an area -- for 

example, semiconductors, where some amici have stated

that there's -- there's 420,000 patents dealing with 

semiconductors. And you know that, and you know that if 

you do virtually anything, and especially if you copy, 

you're going to hit a semiconductor patent owned by 

somebody, I think that, in that rare situation, 

knowledge that you're infringing someone's intellectual 

property rights should probably be enough of a -- of a 

directed intent. If you -- that would be the basis for 

inferring a purpose.

 But here, we have to -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- I 

mean, I understand you're in the deep fryer industry, 

but that standard would bring the semiconductor industry 

to a halt.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No. No, Your Honor. If you 

copied a semiconductor and you knew that there were 

420,000 patents that were unexpired out there, that 

would make it -- if you didn't do your -- your 

diligence, perhaps -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think the -- the 

problem is, even if you do do your diligence, given the 

way patents are these days, if there are 420,000, you're 

never going to know with any degree of comfort that 

you're not going to infringe something.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we're not going to 

adopt a special rule for the deep-fryer industry.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Agreed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Especially -­

MR. DUNNEGAN: Completely agreed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we might decide 

that it's more important to consider what's going to 

happen to the semiconductor industry in articulating our 

standard than what's going to happen to the deep-fryer 

industry.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: That's exactly correct, Your 

Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DUNNEGAN: That's exactly correct. And 

on balance -- I think there's one point that I should 

make sooner rather than later, and it's is the standard 

that I'm -- the standard that we are proposing is not 

unique to us. It's the -- it's the standard that 

Grokster developed. And with respect to willful 

blindness, we believe that the standard -- the balance 

was already struck, and it was struck in favor of

eliminating a willful blindness standard.

 I'd like to -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dunnegan, suppose I 

disagree with you on that, and suppose I think that 

actual knowledge of a patent or willful blindness as to 

whether a patent exists is the right standard. Could a 

reasonable jury have found that in this case?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: We don't think that a 

reasonable jury could have found willful blindness 

because, first of all, there wasn't a high probability 

that a patent would be found. Second, we do not think 

that there was active -­

have looked at the facts that Justice Ginsburg 

suggested -- you know, you do not tell the lawyer that 

you, in fact, have copied the product and say that's -­

a reasonable jury -- that's willful blindness.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

because what we have done in that situation was, first, 

we have done more than the law required. We went out to 

get a patent. We gave the lawyer our actual patent 

drawings and tell him to do his work.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you really wanted 

to know, wouldn't you have gone into Montgomery Ward and 

bought one of the fryers and turned it around to see if

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, we have so many 

products that you couldn't practically expect the 

company to do that, I don't think.

you got the opinion from the lawyer was -- was not to 

make sure that there were no patents. It was to show 

that opinion to Montgomery Ward.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: But your -- your -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, you 

needed an opinion from a lawyer, because otherwise, 

Montgomery Ward was not going to sell this stuff.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Your Honor, I take issue with 

you for the following reason: I don't think there was 

any intention on the part of our client to -- to 

infringe a patent at all, because if it knew about the 

patent, it could have designed around it if it knew what 

it was doing. There's no benefit to our client of 

getting Montgomery Ward or Sunbeam or Fingerhut in 

trouble for patenting infringement. We really want to 

know what patents are out there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't -- isn't it 

true that Sunbeam was the party that asked for the 

patent search?

record, Your Honor. I believe the record shows that 

Sunbeam was given a copy of the patent search, but 

Mr. Sham testified -- and I believe this is about at 

page 50 of the joint appendix -- that the purpose of the 

search was to find out whether or not there was an 

infringement of any patent through this deep fryer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there's nothing in 

the record that says who -- who asked Pentalpha -­

MR. DUNNEGAN: Not that I'm aware of, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to get -- to get a 

letter?

 JUSTICE ALITO: If this is not willful 

blindness, I don't know what willful blindness is. Now, 

maybe you can explain what more would have been required 

to permit a reasonable jury to find willful blindness.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Okay. I think you'd need two 

things, Your Honor. The first that you would need is 

evidence that they were going to bump into a patent if 

they -- if they proceeded. Is there the high 

probability of finding a patent?

 Now, if you -- if you just consciously avoid 

knowledge in the absence of a high probability, that's 

not willful blindness. That's not even culpable.

arguing this point, but your client thought that making 

a deep fryer that wouldn't burn people's hands if they 

touched it would be profitable, because there wasn't a 

lot of competition in that market. This was a useful 

product and apparently one that was different from other 

deep fryers. Isn't that in itself -- doesn't that in

JUSTICE ALITO: One company is making this

are making; maybe it might be patented.

that there were six or so deep fryers which were the 

cool-touch deep fryers which they -- which they used as 

references. SEB was not the only cool-touch deep fryer 

that was available.

improved it. There's functional features that went 

beyond and were better than what were in the SEB 

product. For example, they used better metal to make 

the cast iron pan. They put the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a finding 

that it was an infringement, that the Pentalpha fryer 

infringed the SEB.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: The jury did find that, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Dunnegan, could I take 

you to the standard? Because in Aro II we said that the 

appropriate standard in subsection (c) was actual 

knowledge. Why shouldn't we just say it's the same? 

Whether it is (b) or (c), these are just two means of -­

of doing a contributory infringement, and the 

knowledge/willful blindness standard, once we've said it 

applies to (c), it applies to (b) as well?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: The reason that you shouldn't 

take the standard from (c) is because (c) deals with 

nonstaples and (b) deals with staples. Someone can be 

liable under (b) if they -- if they sell a staple

article of commerce, when they can't be libel under (c), 

even if they meet -- even if they meet the higher -­

even they meet the state of mind element under (c), 

which is knowing the patent and knowing that the 

combination would be an infringement. Therefore, to 

make sure that (b) does not swallow (c), it's very 

important that (b) have a higher state of mind.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: No, (b) and (c) have 

different standards as to -- not the knowledge of the 

patent but -- but what the person is -- the acts that 

constitute infringement. But that's a different thing 

from whether they should have different standards as to 

the knowledge of the patent.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Well, when you say there's 

different standards, the sale of an -- of a staple 

article under (b) in itself with a proper state of mind 

can be an inducement. The sale of a nonstaple article 

with certain additional conditions can be a violation of 

(c). The action element for (b) and (c) is -- is 

essentially the same for the sale of components, and it 

wouldn't make any sense to raise it for (b) because all 

you would be doing in that situation is -- is 

encompassing sellers that were helping their customers 

do business more effectively, and you wouldn't be 

getting any more bad guys.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Purposeful, culpable conduct 

-- yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why is that -­

how is that different from knowing? I -- I -- my 

impression was the same as Justice Kennedy's. I thought 

you wanted the knowing standard.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Knowing, well -- the way I 

understand knowing, Your Honor, is that in Sony, for 

example, there was no liability even though Sony knew 

that some people were going to use the VCR to infringe 

copyrighted works. That was collateral damage even 

though they knew it; it wasn't the basis for liability.

 In Grokster, the basis for liability was 

even though the defendant knew that there were going to 

be some infringements, it couldn't be liable for 

contributory copyright infringement, the equivalent of 

271(c), because there was substantial noninfringing uses 

for the Grokster software. Grokster was -- was allowed 

to be found liable because the defendants had a -- a 

culpable objective -- they had a culpable purpose, or at 

least a jury could so find, that they wanted to 

encourage infringements.

infringing. Let's take the situation where there's 

going to be advertising which references the patents, as 

there was in Grokster and says go infringe it. Let's

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Whatever test that this Court adopts for 

inducing infringement, the central objective of that 

test will be to separate culpable bad actors from 

innocent corporate behavior actors. And by any measure, 

Pentalpha in this case was a culpable bad actor. In 

fact, we've got really extraordinary testimony in this 

case -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: So would you have any 

objection to an actual knowledge willful blindness 

standard? Would that be all right with you?

 MR. CRUZ: I think that is one of multiple 

standards this Court could adopt if this Court were to 

adopt actual knowledge. I do not think actual knowledge 

is in the statute, but if this Court were to adopt 

actual knowledge and conclude also that willful 

blindness is a long-recognized means of demonstrating 

actual knowledge, that would support the judgment.

JUSTICE KAGAN: I take it that we would do 

that on the basis of Aro II? We would just say that's 

the standard for (c) and that should be the statement 

for (b)?

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I 

don't think that would be an interpretation that is 

faithful to the text of 271. There is an enormous 

difference between 271(c) and 271(b). 271(c) includes 

the word knowing. 271(b) does not include the word 

knowing and your question assumes essentially -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, 271(c) includes the 

word knowing, you have to know that an item has no 

noninfringing uses. That is a different kind of 

knowledge than the knowledge that we are talking about 

here.

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, in Aro II what the 

Court did and it was, as you know, a splintered majority 

in Aro II where the dissenters flipped back and forth, 

but with the particular paragraph that addressed the 

holding on what had to be demonstrated, the Court 

concluded that that word knowing effectively modified 

both the knowledge that the nonstaple article had no 

noninfringing use and, and that it would cause the 

infringement. That is how the Court read knowing, as 

modifying everything that follows it in 271(c).

infringement, but not necessarily that there was a 

patent, not necessarily the legal effect as opposed to 

the act.

 MR. CRUZ: Well, that is necessarily part of 

what the Court held in 271(c). And I would agree, this 

would be a very, very different case if 271(b) had the 

word knowing. I mean Aro in many ways was a much easier 

case, but the question is do you have to demonstrate 

that something is knowing and the statute says it must 

be knowing, then that is -­

JUSTICE BREYER: How do you say, I am not 

certain that willful blindness would support the 

conclusion below. The standard, the district court or 

the trial court said really, negligence, as I read it. 

The circuit said deliberate disregard of a known risk. 

Well, how much of a risk? I mean, the business world 

there is always a risk and we are talking about a 

complicated world, probably quite a lot of risk. And so 

I think that standard would create a great deal of 

uncertainty. Willful blindness has a tradition. So are 

you okay with willful blindness and we say we are afraid 

they did not do it, i.e., we are afraid, we do not know 

what they really meant here and so send it back and do 

it again. I am sure you wouldn't be overjoyed. But do

be a reasonable result.

say known risk, sure he says he looked at five. And he 

says anybody can figure this thing out, all you do is 

put the little gizmos between the two sides, you know, 

and you have an inside and outside and you just suspend 

the inside with little bars of some kind. I do not know 

what, chewing gum or something, and he says anybody 

could figure that out, it couldn't possibly be bad. And 

so that is their view, but how much of a risk, they will 

say little risk, big risk. So you see why I think we 

should send it back. Now you tell me why that is not -­

risk or do I say the more traditional accompaniment to

obscurity, at least has a history.

willful blindness weren't used, the argument that was

instructed?

 MR. CRUZ: What the jury was instructed was 

several things and the jury instructions are at RA 26 

and 27. The jury instruction that was used, by the way, 

was the model jury instruction that has been used since 

1998, has been unchanged and has included largely this 

language since 1998 over and over again. That is the 

jury instruction we are dealing with.

Number one, the jury was instructed that plaintiff had 

to prove by preponderance of the evidence that defendant 

actively and knowingly aided and abetting the direct 

infringement. That is part of the instruction. That

they actively and knowingly.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading 

from, Mr. Cruz?

 MR. CRUZ: RA 26 and 27. It is the end of 

the red brief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't think that is the 

part they are complaining about.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It is in the red brief, 

the Respondent's brief, page 26, toward the bottom it 

says if you find, I have a problem that I do not know 

that they preserved this objection, but let's talk about 

what the standard ought to be. At the bottom it says, 

if you find that the someone has directly infringed a 

patent and that the defendants knew or should have known 

that its actions would induce direct infringement. So 

this means to me that in order to be liable for an 

inducement you can be liable if you knew or should have 

known. Now, if we can just discuss this for a moment. 

It seems to me that this is the important point in the 

case because if you say should have known, then you have 

a standard that is less than intentional for inducers. 

And that means that every supplier, every business 

person that takes a product from a manufacturer has the 

duty to inquire and to find out if there is a patent. 

And it is a standard that is less than intentional and

that is a very substantial change or a very substantial 

burden to impose on those who are selling and 

distributing products.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, I don't believe 

that is correct. Number one, we are certainly not 

advocating a general burden on all producers to do a 

patent search. That is not remotely the position we are 

presenting.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say should 

have known, that is the necessary consequence of the 

holding.

 MR. CRUZ: What I would suggest the import 

of that language is, is to allow constructive knowledge. 

Is to allow essentially willful blindness, which was the 

entire way it was argued to the jury.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as you say, willful 

blindness was never used really until this Court and 

this Court has never in a full opinion for the Court 

adopted it even in the criminal context. So can we talk 

about knowing as opposed to should have known.

 MR. CRUZ: The argument that was presented

is the trial transcript, page 929 through 31, which is 

not in one of the appendixes in front of you. I

that Mr. Sham, the CEO, never told his patent lawyer, 

look, what we are doing is copying this SEB product. 

What he did, I suggest to you, is he set Mr. Levy up to 

fail. He set him up to fail by not telling him he had 

copied the product. That was the theory that was argued 

as to why they should have known, because this was in 

effect a sham, that not telling the lawyer about the 

product, it wasn't an accident.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're presenting to 

us the proposition, I take it, correct me if I am wrong, 

that we should write an opinion that is saying that know 

or should have known is the standard for an inducer. 

And I question whether that is a wise interpretation and 

a necessary interpretation of (b), especially as we are 

informed through (c) as to what (b) might mean.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, we are not 

proposing that, and I would say two things. Number one, 

there is an entire instruction on inducement and there 

is also the language I read before that is part of the 

jury charge on inducement. And I don't think the jury 

can be presumed to have only listened to one snippet of 

the instruction without the entire instruction.

whether or not you can protect your judgement based upon 

all that's in the record, I think you may have a strong

point. But I am interested in what the standard ought 

to be. I'd like you to know what a properly instructed 

jury should be told with reference to knowledge or 

something less than knowledge.

 MR. CRUZ: I would suggest with respect to 

the language knew or should have known, that if there is 

not an actual knowledge requirement, which in my 

judgment is nowhere in the statute, then you have to 

have something like should have known because I do not 

know what you alternative instruct. If it is not actual 

knowledge then there is a situation where someone is 

allowed to have constructive knowledge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying that (b) 

should have a lesser standard of culpability than (c)?

 MR. CRUZ: Absolutely. I don't think the 

statute makes any sense unless (b) is understood to have 

a lesser standard. Otherwise, the inclusion of the word 

"knowing" is given no effect.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The difference, they say, 

between (b) and (c) is that (c) applies to a person who 

makes some really special thing that looks like a 

Japanese kabuki theater costume, and it's actually made 

out of metal and it's really -- has a very bizarre

But (b) could apply to somebody who makes 

plastic shields. (B) can apply that -- (b) could apply 

to anybody who makes anything; is that right?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under that 

argument, the statute would be interpreted identically 

if the word "knowing" were added to (b). And given that 

they added it to (c) and not to (b) -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the argument is that 

the words "actively induced" are meant to be something 

greater than knowing, not something less than knowing. 

Because otherwise, you're going to hold Aluminum Company 

of America, if that still exists, liable when it makes 

these aluminum sheets, because somebody uses an aluminum 

sheet apparently, et cetera. You see the problem.

 It is quite different when you make this 

weird kabuki-looking thing that only has one use, 

and they -- and that's why it should be -- it should be 

harder to hold that person to contributory infringement, 

not easier.

 Now, that's their argument. What do you 

say.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, that -- that may 

be a reasonable policy argument. However, that is also 

a reasonable policy argument for modifying A, because 

right now, the aluminum company is liable under strict

liability for direct infringement today.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to get, really, an 

answer from you on Justice Kennedy's question, because 

at the moment I am not worried about your case. You, of 

course, are. I understand that.

 But the -- I am worried about Alcoa or the 

little backyard maker of clay pots, or -- I mean, 

millions and millions of people make things that are 

used in millions and millions of ways. And I am worried 

about what kind of burden we are supposed to impose on 

them.

 I see three candidates. One is, you're 

liable if you should have known. Two is, you're liable 

if you consciously disregarded a -- a risk, a known 

risk; that is sort of like a -- you know, the Model 

Penal Code, sort of. And third is willful blindness.

 Is there a fourth? And if there is not, 

what do you choose among those three? No, not what you 

choose. What should we choose?

 MR. CRUZ: We have suggested three possible 

standards to be the rule in this case. The first, the 

Court could choose to adopt the standard that was 

adopted in Grokster, and we have argued at considerable 

length that under the standard this Court adopted in 

Grokster, the plaintiffs -- the defendants, rather,

would be liable and it would uphold the judgment below. 

That is the broadest standard the Court could adopt.

 A more narrow standard the Court could adopt 

is that at a minimum, willful blindness of the patented 

issue suffices to allow inducement liability. That is a 

more narrow standard. It would cover a much narrower 

universe of conduct. It would exclude much of the 

conduct both Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy are 

suggesting. That is the second way this judgment could 

be affirmed and a more narrow rule.

 The most narrow rule we have suggested this 

Court could adopt is in the limited circumstances when a 

defendant deliberately copies another commercial 

product, at a minimum, that defendant has an obligation 

to ascertain if that specific product has protected U.S. 

intellectual property, that it is a very minor 

obligation that is triggered only when you take a 

commercial product on the marketplace, reverse-engineer 

it, and copy it, because it is a situation that is 

highly likely to be indicative of bad conduct, to be 

risking a very substantial infringement of someone 

else's IP, and in terms of a low-cost avoider, one of 

the things at footnote 20 of our brief -­

you get an opinion from a lawyer, as they did here, 

saying you're not violating any copyright or any -- any 

patent?

 MR. CRUZ: If they had said three words 

differently, this would be a very, very different case. 

If they had simply, in talking to their lawyer, said: 

We copied SEB.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. You have to tell the 

searcher that you copied.

 MR. CRUZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is part of your test, 

right?

 MR. CRUZ: If you specifically copy a 

product, you have to look to see if that particular 

product is protected by IP.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is that -- is that 

another standard? Maybe that is an example of what it 

is to be willfully blind. If, in fact, you go out and 

you copy something, it could well be patented, and you 

do not tell your lawyer, go look up this one, that is 

willfully blind.

craft the rule at least narrowly tailored to the facts 

here, which is copying. And look, copying is not a 

unique problem. It is a serious problem 

internationally, with U.S. intellectual property being 

stolen, copied, and marketed. And if Pentalpha were to 

prevail, if this Court were to conclude unless you had 

actual knowledge, you know to a hundred percent 

certainty, this violates patent '312, you're immune from 

liability, that decision of this Court would serve as a 

roadmap.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're not immune from 

liability for direct infringement. You're immune from 

liability, under the hypothetical, for actively 

inducing. And that is where there is a very substantial 

policy difference.

 MS. BLATT: But, Justice Kennedy, the reason 

in this case why we brought a cause of action for both 

direct infringement and active inducing is because the 

argument of Pentalpha was their conduct was all 

overseas, and so they weren't covered by 271(a). The 

entire reason for the inducing strategy is they may well 

prevail in another case on saying, we stole your 

property overseas so you can't get us for direct 

infringement. And in that instance, inducing is the 

only way to get the actual mastermind. I mean, that was

one of the phrases Giles Rich used in defense of 271.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying that the 

standard of knowledge would be the same for direct 

infringement as for active inducement?

 MR. CRUZ: I think there is a reasonable 

statutory argument to be made that it is the same, 

namely, that it is strict liability. We are not 

pressing that as the only way to prevail, but I think 

there is certainly a reasonable statutory argument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am a little 

confused about the relationship between knowledge and 

the Grokster standard. You think knowledge is a more 

favorable standard for Petitioner than Grokster. You're 

willing to accept Grokster, but not willing to accept 

actual knowledge.

 MR. CRUZ: I do, and I will tell you why. 

Because -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you 

tell me why, do you understand -- it's unfair to ask 

you, I guess, but I understood Petitioner to take the 

opposite position: That Grokster was a more favorable 

standard for him than actual knowledge.

Petitioner said here. My understanding of Petitioner's 

position was the same as yours, Mr. Chief Justice and

Justice Kennedy, that they are effectively requiring 

actual knowledge, that that's what their urging is.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why aren't you both wrong, 

that Grokster didn't deal with the question that we are 

dealing with, which was knowledge of a patent or 

knowledge of a copyright, that Grokster dealt with 

whether there was specific intent or whether there 

needed to be specific intent to encourage infringing 

acts. That is what Grokster was about, an entirely 

separate question.

 MR. CRUZ: Let me answer both your question, 

Justice Kagan, and the Chief Justice's question 

together.

 Grokster used language about purposeful 

culpable conduct, but it went further. It specified how 

you ascertain whether that standard is met, and it said 

as shown by other affirmative acts to encourage 

inducement. Now, in Grokster, part of the argument 

Grokster made was, we do not know what copyrights are 

going to be violated. We do not know what is going to 

be -- they made the same argument Pentalpha is making: 

We have no idea of any specific copyright that will ever 

be infringed. They argued, we do not have actual 

knowledge of the specific copyrights. And this Court 

said: That doesn't matter.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, one of the -- one of 

the briefs -- one of the amicus briefs in this case 

points out that that argument is a lot less plausible in 

copyright than it is in -- in patents. It is very easy 

to find out whether you're infringing a copyright. It 

is very difficult to find out whether you're infringing 

a patent, especially in the modern age of warehouse 

patents. I am not sure that we -- that we want to use 

the same test for copyrights that we use for -- for 

patents.

 MR. CRUZ: That policy differential -- there 

may well be differences between patent law and copyright 

law that are implicated in other cases. Here, what 

occurred is an entire commercial product was copied. It 

is much more akin to copyright infringement, where the 

entire product was copied and they just changed the 

cosmetic features.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine. I am 

just -- I am just expressing reservations about your 

suggestion that we simply take Grokster wholesale and 

apply it to this situation.

 MR. CRUZ: Let me be -- let me be clear, 

Justice Scalia. I am not advocating this Court do so. 

What I am saying is if this Court were to apply the 

Grokster test, we believe we prevail under it, and in

fact any comparison of Grokster to Pentalpha, Pentalpha 

is clearly the more culpable actor. In Grokster, the 

individuals violating the copyrights were the ones who 

made the choice to directly and deliberately violate the 

copyrights and Grokster simply provided the tool to do 

so. Here the only bad actor was Pentalpha. Sunbeam, 

Montgomery Ward, they had no idea of the infringement. 

Pentalpha was the mastermind behind the entire patent 

violation, and in fact because of its actions procuring 

a right to use opinion, by keeping the relevant 

information from its patent lawyer, it lured, it induced 

Sunbeam and Montgomery Ward and Fingerhut into 

committing the bad act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say, even though 

you -- I think you disagree with this in this case, 

would you say that there is a reasonable argument in our 

precedent for saying that the standard of knowledge 

under (b) should be greater than reckless disregard?

 MR. CRUZ: I do not believe there is in the 

precedent. For one thing, reckless disregard is the 

standard now. Willfulness and recklessness are the 

standard right now for enhanced damages and attorney's 

fees; and if it were the case that every violation of 

271(b) required willfulness or recklessness, it would 

also mean that every violation would qualify for

enhanced damages or attorney's fees. I don't think 

that's consistent with the statutory standard. That's 

not the language Congress adopted.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Would you say 

that there is substantial authority for the proposition 

that it should -- the state of mind should be greater 

than "should have known"?

 MR. CRUZ: You know, I do not believe there 

is. Particularly how "should have known" was used in 

this case, A, the jury was -- the way the jury was 

instructed, I would suggest it was effectively a 

constructive knowledge instruction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're dealing -­

MR. CRUZ: If you look at -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They're dealing with a 

Federal Circuit decision, they're reviewing that 

decision, the Federal Circuit had a formula. It said 

standard is deliberate disregard of a known risk. One 

thing you must surely do is to say whether that standard 

is right or wrong.

 So the Federal Circuit, whatever the jury 

found, Federal Circuit said the law is that you are 

liable under 271(b) if you are deliberately -- if you 

deliberately disregard a known risk. Is that standard 

the right one?

MR. CRUZ: I agree the Federal Circuit had 

that language. I would not suggest that standard was 

the wrong standard, but what I would say, what the 

Federal Circuit in fact did is it applied willful 

blindness. If you look at the cases it cited, if you 

look at how it in fact interpreted it, although it used 

the deliberate indifference language, which I will 

concede was somewhat confusing in its reasoning. If you 

look at it, it framed it as whether Pentalpha had 

constructive knowledge of the patent, and it then cited 

willful blindness cases from other circuits that focused 

it on actively disregarding a known risk and deliberate 

avoidance and consciously avoided knowledge. All of 

that is willful blindness knowledge.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cruz, while we are 

certainly interested in what the standard should be. 

But in terms of the deposition of this case, maybe you 

could help me with this. The -- the instruction to 

which there was an objection on, 124A to -- well, 

wherever it is in the joint appendix -- was the newer 

should have known, right?

 MR. CRUZ: Correct.

that was preserved is the question whether actual 

knowledge was required? Because that was the only -­

then the judgment should be affirmed.

 MR. CRUZ: I agree with that entirely, and 

indeed we have suggested the central issue, the question 

before this Court is, is there a requirement of actual 

knowledge of the specific patent? And in my judgment 

there is no reasonable argument from the statutory 

language that in order to be liable under 271(b) you 

must specifically know to 100 percent certainty this is 

violating patent number 312. That is the issue they 

objected. That is the issue that has been brought 

before this Court. Is -­

law for us to simply say you -- it is not so much 

knowledge that you have to know the specific patent by

 MR. CRUZ: I am going to suggest it is a 

binary choice. It is either actual specific knowledge 

of the patent, or it is some form of "should have known" 

that allows constructive knowledge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That is where I am. At the 

moment, the should have known or willful blindness, the

problem, is know what, exactly? Well, know there is a 

risk. Well, at that point half the country in the

helpful, and -- and it is a knowledge or a known -- or 

consciously disregarding a known risk where the risk 

consists of a high probability that that item that you 

are inducing to be produced will infringe a patent.

 MR. CRUZ: I agree that would suffice.

 With respect to why this Court should not 

remand, if I may very briefly make three points. Number 

one, this case has been going on for 12 years. To 

remand for a new trial would drag it on to more endless 

litigation for no purpose. The district court observed 

below this case was not a close case. It took the jury 

109 minutes to resolve against Pentalpha on every single 

ground that was presented to it.

 Number two, the jury charge that was sent to 

the jury was more than sufficient under any of these 

standards. But number three, the alternative argument 

we made, there was a finding of direct infringement. 

That finding of direct infringement is also supported by 

the damage award and that is an alternative ground to 

remand it. Now, in the reply brief Pentalpha says, 

focuses on the same differential that the Federal 

Circuit did between the language of the jury charge and 

the language of the verdict form, but the only evidence 

the jury had of the number of units sold by anybody was 

the stipulation. In their reply brief they say, well,

there could have been some sold in Canada. That was

agreed, was the stipulation and if that is true that 

supports the damage award.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNNEGAN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Five points in rebuttal, I 

believe, Your Honor. The first is what should the 

standard be with respect to willful blindness. And I do 

want to call the court's attention to one sentence in 

Grokster appearing at page 941 of the opinion. And it 

provides, this is worth reading, I believe. If 

liability for inducing infringement is ultimately found, 

it will not be on the basis of presuming or imputing 

liability, excuse me, fault, but from inferring a 

patently illegal objective from statements and actions 

showing what that objective was.

 Now, in the context of an amicus brief from 

the solicitor general in that case suggesting a willful 

blindness standard, it seems to me that that language is 

a rejection of imputing a willful blindness standard.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So you want actual knowledge

of the patent? That is your test?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: The test that we are looking 

for is the Grokster test. Is there purposeful, culpable 

conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you want actual knowledge 

of the patent?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And that is the issue you 

preserved with your objection?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Not precisely. We preserved 

other issues beyond that. We preserved both the jury 

charge by objecting at 135A of the joint appendix and we 

objected to the judgment as a matter of law motion by 

making it and saying specifically there is no evidence 

here that there was actual knowledge of the patent 

before April 9th of 1998. Now -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And after that date you 

admit you -- because you continued to sell the product 

to the retailers?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So after Sunbeam sued, 

then you are actively inducing infringement?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. At that 

point we have actual knowledge of the patent and the 

analysis has to go to what was our purpose. For the

bulk of that period of time, we had a legal opinion from 

a very competent New York City lawyer stating that we 

did not infringe. And the jury, I guess the second 

point I was trying to make is the jury never evaluated 

any standard higher than new or -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that opinion 

was after the first finding of infringement, that you 

redesigned the product and that, the evidence you got 

dealt with the redesigned products.

correct, Your Honor. The -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But after just 

originally, Sunbeam is suing for infringement. Sunbeam 

notifies Pentalpha. At that point, Pentalpha is 

continuing to make sales. Is it infringing? Is it 

actively inducing infringement.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: That is a question of fact, 

Your Honor. The jury resolved it against us, but the 

point I was trying to make is that for some period of 

time after that we had a legal opinion saying we did not 

infringe and we believe that legal opinion from the New 

York City attorney would prevent or should prevent, as a 

matter of fact, a finding of purposeful, culpable 

conduct. Now, the second standard I wanted to address

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You admitted there was 

purposeful, culpable conduct when you did not, when you 

had the original design and that was, and you were sued 

for actively inducing infringement of that design, by 

that design.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: No, Your Honor. We would 

never concede that we were purposefully -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you think a jury 

could have found that from the facts?

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes. We are not seeking 

judgment as a matter of law for any claims that arose 

after April of 1998 when we had actual knowledge of the 

patent, only before we had actual knowledge of the 

patent are we seeking judgement as a matter of law. 

Now, going to the issue of whether willful blindness 

could be found by the failure of someone to tell the 

patent attorney that there was a copying -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am sorry. Why are you 

doing that? I thought that you came in arguing that you 

have to have actual knowledge of the patent.

 MR. DUNNEGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By number, and that was 

the conversation we had earlier, and that the patent 

covered the scope of your invention.

primary argument, but if the court were to adopt willful 

blindness as being enough, then I would question whether 

or not simply not telling the patent attorney what 

references were used or even which ones were copied 

would be enough. Because in that situation, the company 

has taken an effort to find out what the truth is and it 

simply failed to meet the gold standard in meeting that 

obligation.
