3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 


4 argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118, 


Gunn v. Minton. 


6  Ms. Webre? 


7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 


8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 


9  MS. WEBRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


please the Court: 

11  In Grable, this Court explained that 

12 "arising under" jurisdiction demands, not only a 

13 contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded 

14 in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a 

serious Federal interest in exercising Federal 

16 jurisdiction over the State claim. 

17  This Court should reverse the judgment below 

18 because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a 

19 substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal 

jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims 

21 like his, State legal malpractice claims would --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is whether 

23 the experimental use -- whether that was a viable 

24 theory. Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you 

mean by, "substantial"?

Official 

1  MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, defining 

2 substantiality is a difficult point. I -- I would 

3 answer in two layers. First, Mr. Minton's claim did not 

4 involve a legal question of does the -- how does the 

experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what 

6 are its parameters? 

7  The question was did his fact-bound and 

8 situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence 

9 of the application here in this particular case. And it 

is not a substantial question because, first, from a --

11 a unique case perspective, it involved merely a 

12 hypothetical determination. 

13  There were no actual patent rights that 

14 would be at issue. Those were already fully, finally, 

irrevocably determined in the underlying patent 

16 litigation in Federal court. 

17  And, second, from a jurisprudence 

18 standpoint, the -- the question of uniformity of patent 

19 law, any decision by a State court, in Mr. Minton's 

legal malpractice claim, would not be binding in any 

21 way, on either the PTO in a patent application, or on 

22 any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent 

23 case. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you mean substantial 

beyond the -- the -- this particular case?

Official 

1  MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. And I -- I 

2 think that that's where the Federal circuit's 

3 jurisdictional -- the Federal circuit's "arising under" 

4 jurisdiction standard, which the Supreme Court of Texas 

applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that 

6 the court improperly conflates the -- the question of 

7 necessity of a Federal issue with the question of 

8 whether that issue is substantial. 

9  And, in the Grable case, this Court 

emphasized that those are two separate issues. There 

11 are four prongs to the Grable test. The Federal issue 

12 embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the 

13 State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then 

14 there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal 

jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the 

16 proper balance between State and Federal authority. 

17  The Grable court announced that, and then 

18 just a year later, in the Empire HealthChoice case, Your 

19 Honor -- Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for 

the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of 

21 "and here's how limited the Grable rule really is." 

22  The Empire HealthChoice opinion 

23 distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely 

24 pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire 

HealthChoice which were fact-bound and 

5

1 situation-specific. It distinguished the -- the 

2 question of whether a State court is competent to apply 

3 Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and 

4 found that, yes, it was. 

And the -- the Court emphasized that, 

6 certainly, the State courts are going to be deciding the 

7 occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not 

8 make a Federal case out of each and every State tort 

9 claim that might have an embedded Federal issue. 

Now, in the earlier argument, there was some 

11 discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of 

12 different things in a lot of different contexts. But, 

13 here, this Court has, on more than one occasion, 

14 determined that jurisdiction -- "arising under" 

jurisdiction means the same thing in 1331, the general 

16 Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a), 

17 the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable 

18 specifically to patents. 

19  Now, that has been amended slightly. It --

it, now, includes compulsory counterclaims where they 

21 didn't used to be a part, but the jurisdictional grant 

22 that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a) 

23 uses the same exact phrase, the "arising under," "any 

24 civil action arising under Federal law." 

And, Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion

Official 

1 for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained 

2 that the linguistic consistency between those two means 

3 that they mean the same thing. 

4  There is nothing unique about this subject 

matter -- the patent subject matter, that changes the 

6 scope of the jurisdictional grant. To be sure, the --

7 the grant of original jurisdiction to the district 

8 courts is exclusive, and that is different from the 

9 general Federal question. 

And to be --

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't that 

12 significant? Doesn't that manifest Congress's view 

13 that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a 

14 complicated specialty area? And so there would be, 

arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases 

16 that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather 

17 than State court? 

18  MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. But the --

19 Congress did that in a couple of different ways. First 

of all, I think it begs the question -- it begs the --

21 the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact 

22 that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the 

23 substantiality because, in order to get to exclusivity 

24 of the jurisdiction, you have to get to jurisdiction 

first.

Official 

1  You have to -- it has to be "arising under" 

2 an act of Congress relating to patents before it can 

3 then be exclusive. So -- so we still have the first 

4 step. But, also, Congress did not cast the net broader 

than the general "arising under" standard. 

6  Even under the -- the statutory framework 

7 after the America Invents Act amendment -- under the 

8 statutory structure, there are still a number of patent 

9 issues -- legal issues that are going to be decided in 

the State courts that do not come within the exclusive 

11 jurisdiction of the Federal courts. For example, 

12 compulsory counterclaims, now, come within the exclusive 

13 jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't. 

14  Permissive counterclaims can certainly 

present just as substantive a question of patent law, 

16 and, yet, those are excluded under the statutory scheme 

17 of 1338(a). Patent issues raised as a defensive matter 

18 are not sufficient to support "arising under" 

19 jurisdiction under 1338(a). 

So, certainly, Congress contemplated a 

21 situation where some patent issues are just not going to 

22 come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal 

23 courts. 

24  And I think it's interesting to -- to back 

up a little bit and look at the Federal circuit's

1 evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction. 

2 In the early years of the Federal circuit, in 1984, the 

3 first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the 

4 court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is 

cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the 

6 American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the 

7 Federal circuit wrote, "Congress was not concerned that 

8 an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit 

9 court or of a State court would defeat its goal of 

increased uniformity in the national law of patents." 

11  And that was the view of the Federal 

12 circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984. But, in the time 

13 evolved, the Federal circuit has changed its perception 

14 of its own jurisdiction, and that's why we are here 

today, is, in 2007, the Federal circuit went awry and --

16 and changed the standard that no longer follows what 

17 this Court articulated in Grable. 

18  They -- they have improperly conflated the 

19 necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an 

appropriate Grable analysis. And they totally disregard 

21 a proper balance of the State and Federal interests. 

22 The Federal circuit announced that there's an interest 

23 in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and 

24 then that was that. That was the end of the inquiry. 

There is no balance if you don't look at the State

1 interest on the other side. 

2  And, in legal malpractice cases, in general 

3 and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are 

4 substantial State interests. There is the general 

interest, the right of a State to develop its own State 

6 claims, its own State law, and its own State courts. 

7  But there is also a State interest in 

8 governing the relationship between attorney and client 

9 that happens through the legal malpractice process. 

But, specifically, with regard to Mr. Minton's claim, 

11 one of his primary theories in -- in this case -- in the 

12 legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error, 

13 with regard to bringing up the Experimental Use 

14 Doctrine, deprived him of the opportunity to make a 

lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying 

16 patent litigation. 

17  Well, the question of exactly how you prove 

18 whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a 

19 settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a 

matter of tremendous dispute right now. That is an 

21 evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice 

22 jurisprudence of the State of Texas. 

23  In fact, in the month of December 2012, the 

24 Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called 

Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue.

1 How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him 

2 $100 million, if only these lawyers had raised this 

3 issue earlier? 

4  And, yet, if this -- if Mr. Minton's claims 

are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound 

6 and situation-specific application of the Experimental 

7 Law Doctrine, the Federal courts would be Erie guessers 

8 as to that important issue that the State courts really 

9 need to resolve. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Webre, is there any 

11 binding effect of a Federal determination here on State 

12 law? And is there any binding effect of any State 

13 determination here on Federal law? 

14  MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it was left to the 

16 State, would what the States say about -- about patent 

17 law be binding in any Federal cases? And, vice-versa, 

18 if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything 

19 that the Federal court says about -- about State tort 

law be binding on State courts? 

21  MS. WEBRE: In neither direction would any 

22 decision be binding. The -- the State -- any decision 

23 in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding 

24 issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on 

the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the 

11

1 patent applications -- prosecution of patents. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that being 

3 so, your -- your last argument about the Federal 

4 government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an 

area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in 

6 the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that 

7 doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this 

8 single case. 

9  I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas 

law in that regard. They may get this case wrong, 

11 but --

12  MS. WEBRE: You -- you are right that --

13 that it will not, substantially, adversely impact Texas 

14 State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial 

State interest. 

16  And, in a way, it's akin to the issue in 

17 Grable because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that 

18 justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State 

19 law claim and bringing it up into Federal courts wasn't 

just that the issue was disputed, the -- the 

21 construction of that statute was unresolved. But that 

22 it needed resolving. It needed resolving by a court 

23 whose decision could be precedential, so then it's 

24 resolved from then on. 

And so the -- the question of how do you 

12

1 prove a settlement is an issue that needs resolving by a 

2 court who's going to advance the jurisprudence. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the Federal 

4 issue? Doesn't that need resolving? 

MS. WEBRE: There are no Federal issues that 

6 need resolving here because it's solely a question of 

7 the application of these specific facts in this 

8 affidavit to the doctrine. There's -- there's no 

9 overarching question of -- of patent law that needs 

resolving. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- me ask this 

12 question: Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical, 

13 case A, case B, both involve the Experimental Use 

14 Doctrine in Federal patent law. In case A, it's a very 

weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to 

16 apply. Case B, very strong argument, Experimental Use 

17 Doctrine applies. 

18  Any difference in the removability in those 

19 two cases? 

MS. WEBRE: I don't believe so, Your Honor, 

21 because the question isn't the -- the significance to 

22 the particular claim. The question is the Federal 

23 issue. Is there a --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if you say --

since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a

Official 

1 "substantial" Federal issue, then it's substantial in 

2 hypothetical B, but not in hypothetical A? 

3  MS. WEBRE: Well, it's -- it's, perhaps, 

4 more necessary. But -- and maybe what I need to do is 

back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the 

6 factors for a court to look at, when deciding whether or 

7 not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one. 

8  And looking at this -- this Court's 

9 articulation in the Grable case and the Empire 

HealthChoice case, the -- the issues that the Court 

11 looked at -- one was the nature of the Federal -- of the 

12 Federal question itself -- the Federal issue, is it a 

13 constitutional issue? 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So does that mean that, 

if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO 

16 acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts --

17 how does that change your analysis? 

18  MS. WEBRE: That -- that would be a more 

19 substantial Federal question than the one presented 

here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to 

21 warrant "arising under" jurisdiction here because it 

22 is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of 

23 patent rights. No judgment that can happen in a State 

24 legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent 

rights.

Official 

1  Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a 

2 State legal malpractice court saying, it was the 

3 negligence, that you would have won the experimental use 

4 exception, your patent would have been declared valid. 

And so he has a judgment from a State court saying, 

6 the -- the loss of your patent was the result of the 

7 negligence and not because it was actually invalid. 

8  That doesn't give him a valid patent. He 

9 cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say, 

look, look, I've got a patent. And it's --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So go back to -- you 

12 were going through a list of questions, and I posited 

13 let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a 

14 constitutional question. 

MS. WEBRE: Yes. So --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then what other 

17 factors --

18  MS. WEBRE: Well, the -- the -- in the 

19 continuum constitutional issues would be more 

substantial; statutory issues would be a little less 

21 substantial. In fact, this Court grappled with that in 

22 the Grable case and said, we're not going to draw a hard 

23 and fast line on statutory issues. 

24  But then, in the Empire HealthChoice 

opinion, the Court noted that this is a -- the issue -­

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

20

25

Official 

1 the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so, 

2 therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it. So, 

3 in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at. 

4  Another factor to look at would be, is the 

Federal issue -- the legal issue undisputed or 

6 uncertain? Not necessarily the application of these 

7 particular facts to the legal issue because there really 

8 isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is 

9 construed or not. 

But, in -- in the resolution of the legal 

11 issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or 

12 uncertain? And the corollary to that is does it need 

13 resolving? Because that was the situation in the Grable 

14 case. But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso 

facto make it a -- a substantial issue. 

16  This Court, in the Merrell Dow case, 

17 discussed that, that --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why do all -- why do 

19 all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases 

involving malpractice? I mean, you're urging, not just 

21 that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a 

22 general rule that malpractice suits involving patent 

23 rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising" 

24 under jurisdiction. 

Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to

1 say? 

2  MS. WEBRE: Yes, Your Honor. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: So the burden would be on 

4 you to show that every one of these factors, in all of 

those cases, is always going to cut in your favor. 

6 That -- what, that they will never involve a 

7 constitutional issue? That they will never, ever 

8 determine future patent decisions? 

9  MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, I -- I urge 

that because I think that's the only appropriate 

11 application of the Grable test to legal malpractice 

12 cases. And it's not that --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I like -- I like 

14 bright-line rules. In fact -- you know, I thought 

Holmes had it right. It doesn't arise under, unless the 

16 cause of action is a Federal cause of action. But once 

17 we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't --

18 you're -- you're proving a negative. 

19  The burden is on you to prove a negative, 

that there is no situation that can arise in -- in 

21 malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal 

22 issue would justify arising under jurisdiction. That's 

23 a hard road to hoe. 

24  MS. WEBRE: I think there are two reasons --

there are two reasons why that's the only appropriate 

17

20

25

Official 

1 way to apply the Grable test to legal malpractice cases, 

2 and both of them involve the lack of precedent from the 

3 case. 

4  One is it can never involve actual patent 

rights. The consequence of a judge's --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about fraud on -- a 

7 claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on 

8 the PTO? Lawyer loses that. It's been litigated. 

9 Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent --

or might it not affect the patent in a patent action? 

11  MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor, it would not. 

12 It would not affect the patent office, either, as a 

13 matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue 

14 preclusion -- non-mutual issue preclusion or as a matter 

of jurisprudential precedent, for a couple of reasons. 

16  One is that, as a starting point, the -- the 

17 question of attorney misconduct can affect the issuance 

18 of a patent before the patent office, but that would 

19 happen not in the context of a legal malpractice claim, 

but in the context of the actual prosecution of the 

21 patent before the PTO itself. 

22  So the PTO would have made a -- its own 

23 determination and granted or not granted limited 

24 sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in --

before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 be deciding that. 


2  So a legal malpractice case would only be 


3 subsequent to that. So, in -- in the first instance, 


4 the PTO gets to decide that. 


From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's 

6 patent review manual -- the Manual of Examination of 

7 Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given 

8 to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or 

9 Interferences, the United States District Court for the 

District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit. No State 

11 courts make that list. 

12  So, from a res judicata standpoint, only 

13 going right up the chain is going to bind the PTO. And, 

14 from an issue preclusion standpoint, the PTO would never 

be a party -- could never be a party to a -- a legal 

16 malpractice claim and, therefore, would not be bound by 

17 any State court decision. 

18  And what's kind of a funny --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I find that somewhat 

hard to follow. 

21  Let's assume, in adjudicating a medical -- a 

22 malpractice claim, the State court finds that the 

23 attorney suppressed information. It's a finding of 

24 fact. He had this information in his or her file, and 

they didn't disclose it. I'm not quite sure how the PTO 

19

1 ignores that litigation. 

2  MS. WEBRE: The PTO may not ignore it. The 

3 PTO --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or the district court 

doesn’t, if it gets to review that in a later action. 

6  MS. WEBRE: Well, but --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm only raising this 

8 question to address Justice Scalia's point. You're 

9 asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation 

where I think it's not so clear that a State court 

11 finding might not have an effect. 

12  So do we have to go to your absolute rule? 

13  MS. WEBRE: No, Your Honor. You do not have 

14 to go to my absolute rule. I think that the absolute 

rule is the -- the most sensible and appropriate 

16 application of the Grable test to State law legal 

17 malpractice claims, and it has the added benefit of 

18 certainty. It -- it doesn't roll us back to the Justice 

19 Holmes' rule. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you might argue 

21 that, even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of 

22 isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule because 

23 the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't 

24 have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the 

fact that one or two might -- might not come out that

2  MS. WEBRE: Well --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because we're making it up 

4 anyway, right? 

(Laughter.) 

6  MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, I -- I would 

7 take it a step further than that because I think that 

8 any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice 

9 Sotomayor, is so ephemeral. The idea that -- that the 

PTO will look at a fact-finding in a legal malpractice 

11 case, and, oh, goodness, I didn't realize there was this 

12 suppression of evidence, I'm now going to dig further. 

13  Well, that's such a speculative and 

14 ephemeral possibility, it doesn't disrupt the fabric of 

patent jurisprudence -- patent law, in any way, and it 

16 doesn't tie the hands of the PTO in any way. It doesn't 

17 bind the PTO in any future consideration of a 

18 continuation patent or any other related 

19 continuation-in-part patent. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you 

21 this: The Brighton Miller treatise is rather 

22 complimentary of Grable, it says it brought 

23 considerable certainty to the area. I was pleased to 

24 hear that because I'm not sure that it's true.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can you just tell me, as an -- as an 
2 empirical matter, does "arising under" 
3  for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous 
4  amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts? 
5  It's just --
6  MS. WEBRE: Well, it -- it does a couple of 
7  things. First is it consumes a lot of time of the 
8  courts and the litigants in removing and then getting 
9  remanded again. And it -- as is discussed in the --

10  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What I -- yes. What I 
11  mean is the argument over "arising under" over 
12  jurisdiction. 
13  MS. WEBRE: There are, on this issue of the 
14  legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal 
15  circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and 
16  Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of 
17  courts -- State and Federal courts have been grappling 
18  with this precise jurisdictional issue. 
19  I think this case is about the fifth or 
20  sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this 
21  jurisdictional question. I think there are three or 
22  four behind us in queue, and there -- there continues to 
23  be uncertainty in the lower courts on this precise 
24  issue.

2  lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated? 

3  Now, it's true that the -- the entire body 

4  of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of 

patent representation is not going to overwhelm the 

6  Federal court. It's not going to -- to --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So my question was even 

8  broader. Let's say we resolve legal malpractice. 

9  Then -- then we will have products liability with a 

particular product, and then we will have some food and 

11  agriculture cases. It goes on and on. 

12  MS. WEBRE: Well, I think that is a -- that 

13  is a -- that's a substantial issue. But, like 

14  Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, the -- this Court 

departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago. 

16  But I think that there is the opportunity in this case 

17  to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide 

18  absolute certainty vis-à-vis legal malpractice cases 

19  because of their unique hypothetical aspect. The 

consequence of the judgment affects no rights. 

21  But, second, in reaffirming --

22  rearticulating the Grable test, emphasizing the 

23  importance and the separateness of the substantiality 

24  inquiry, emphasizing the importance of the federalism 

aspect, this Court has a great opportunity to resolve a

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. MICHEL 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

9  MR. MICHEL: It is, Your Honor. Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

11  Court: 

12  This case is about whether a State court has 

13  subject matter jurisdiction over a State law patent 

14  malpractice claim that rests entirely on an issue of 

patent law that is only heard in Federal court, and when 

16  that issue is dispositive, central to the case, has 

17  issues of first impression in them, has no State 

18  analogue in any other area of the law, and whether in 

19  the deciding issues of questions of law and will not 

disturb the balance between State and Federal judicial 

21  responsibility. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about other areas of 

23  exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you 

24  are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal 

court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a

2  Is -- is what you're saying about patents, 

3  does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction 

4  is exclusively in the Federal court? 

MR. MICHEL: No, Your Honor. It does not. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what's the 

7  difference between, say, antitrust and patent? 

8  MR. MICHEL: There -- there are many 

9  differences, Your Honor. First, antitrust has -- has a 

State analogue. The Texas Supreme Court in 

11  Coca-Cola v. Harmer, 218 Southwest --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then take immigration 

13  law. 

14  MR. MICHEL: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't get in the weeds. 

16  Take immigration law. 

17  MR. MICHEL: Yes. Now, once again, the 

18  issues -- immigration law may be a -- a differing area 

19  where there is exclusive Federal court jurisdiction in 

that area, possibly. But, once again, the analysis and 

21  the application in immigration law, from a malpractice 

22  case, may give rise in that area. 

23  However --

4  MR. MICHEL: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that the 

6  rule? 

7  MR. MICHEL: I believe, in part. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, any -- any Federal 

9  statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts 

and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are 

11  the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not 

12  come within this "arising under" rule? 

13  MR. MICHEL: Does -- does not come within 

14  this Court's doctrinal holdings in Grable and Empire 

because we have a Federal balancing and State balancing 

16  issue. And, as we've articulated, when Congress has 

17  articulated --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a case for 

19  that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State 

court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal 

21  question as to which this Court would be the -- you 

22  know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come 

23  within "arising under" jurisdiction? 

24  Have you got a case for that. 

MR. MICHEL: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have a case which 

3  says that, when a Federal question is presented in a 

4  case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but 

also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless 

6  to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the 

7  issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising 

8  under" jurisdiction? 

9  MR. MICHEL: No, I don't think anything that 

expressly. But the A&T and the --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I would find it 

12  extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule. 

13  MR. MICHEL: Well, you can't isolate it. 

14  That rule is more complicated because it is the 

application of the Grable standard that's the analysis. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But getting back --

17  Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, 

18  that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that 

19  there is exclusive jurisdiction. And her question to me 

pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because 

21  it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other 

22  areas of exclusive jurisdiction. If that is going to be 

23  your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest. 

24  That's all that question meant to me. 

Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases

1  where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which 

2  we'd have the same problem. 

3  MR. MICHEL: I think -- I think the factors 

4  that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that 

has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for 

6  Merrell Dow is the number of cases that would come into 

7  Federal court, and it is a doctrinal decision. It is a 

8  doctrinal rule. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So patent law cases of 

malpractice are smaller in number than copyright 

11  cases --

12  MR. MICHEL: Patent law cases --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- immigration, other 

14  exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to -- to remove, 

but those others aren't? 

16  MR. MICHEL: Those --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that make a whole 

18  lot of sense? 

19  MR. MICHEL: That is the articulation in 

Grable, Your Honor.

22  different one, the one that's being proposed by your

1  "substantial" as to how it affects Federal law, which I 

2  think was the bottom line -- or the development of 

3  Federal law, the bottom line of Grable. 

4  And she says -- you dispute this in your 

brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent, 

6  that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice 

7  is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute 

8  because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts. 

9  So how does a ruling affect patent law? 

MR. MICHEL: Sure. Many -- many ways, Your 

11  Honor. 

12  First, the test is uniformity, under Grable, 

13  the uniformity of patent law -- Federal law, not whether 

14  the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is -- who's going to 

16  follow it? 

17  MR. MICHEL: In many situations. For 

18  example, she -- she conflates -- Petitioners conflate, 

19  res judicata with issue preclusion. That goes back to 

your earlier question, Justice Sotomayor, and that issue 

21  preclusion will have an effect. And as, in fact --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Issue preclusion applies 

23  only to someone who was a party. 

24  MR. MICHEL: Correct. That would only apply 

to the inventor; it would not apply to the PTO. It can

1  only be used against, in this, case Mr. Minton. And, in 

2  fact, patent counsel in this case, under the rules of 

3  the Federal circuit, under patent law and the Patent 

4  Manual, disclosed the State court's rulings in this case 

to the Patent Office during its continuing patent. The 

6  State district court judge made a scope and claim 

7  decision. 

8  So, Justice Sotomayor, back to your 

9  question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that, certainly, is 

11  not binding. The -- whatever the State -- whatever the 

12  State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no 

13  binding effect on that question coming into Federal 

14  court. 

MR. MICHEL: It does. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How? 

17  MR. MICHEL: Under this Court's decision 

18  Marrese v. The Academy of Orthopedic Assertions --

19  Surgeons, a State court's decision is entitled to issue 

preclusion, even in Federal forum. And so that is 

21  why -- also the patent -- the continuation patent 

22  would -- could be declared invalid for failing to 

23  disclose that information. 

24  We are not saying it's binding on the PTO, 

but it is an issue of issue preclusion as against Minton

1  that would be in front of the PTO and is in front of the

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that -- my 

4  goodness, but you are going to have a purely 

hypothetical State decision here. The State will have 

6  held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the 

7  result would have been something else. And you think 

8  that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in 

9  real life? 

And you say, since the State court made that 

11  hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing 

12  it in -- in real life. 

13  MR. MICHEL: Yes. It is a factor --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases like 

that? It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird 

16  situation. I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's 

17  strange. 

18  MR. MICHEL: Well, it is a matter of issue 

19  preclusion. This Court -- that is the danger of 

allowing these patent law issues to proceed in State 

21  court. 

22  This Court -- the State district court in 

23  this case entered in a brand-new issue of Federal – 

24  Petitioners and Respondents totally disagree as to 

whether this is a fact-specific case or whether this case

1  involves issues of law. And, in fact, we contend it

3  In this case, the State district court made 

4  holdings about issues of whether the question of -- the 

experimental use exception is a question of law or a 

6  question of fact. 

7  It made the requirement that experimental 

8  use had to go to a required claim element, as opposed to 

9  a claimed element. It made the determination -- and the 

Court of Appeals made the legal determination that 

11  knowledge of the buyer is conclusive, rather than as a 

12  factor. 

13  Those are all issues of not only disputed 

14  substantial issues of Federal patent law that both 

parties submitted briefings in the trial court and the

3  profound effect on the patent law practitioners who are

with the Patent Law Office. 

6  It is the patent lawyers who draft the 

7  patents, it is the patent lawyers who present them to 

8  the Patent Office, they are the ones who engage when 

9  they need to be amended or refined or narrowed or 

broadened. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: They knew -- they knew 

12  these were controverted issues. You say that they --

13  they are controverted issues. So they would have been 

14  alerted to a problem anyway. And they certainly would 

not accept a State court determination as authoritative 

16  resolution of that problem. 

17  MR. MICHEL: The patent --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: The patent attorneys. I 

19  mean, you --

MR. MICHEL: No, the Patent Office will have 

21  to take that as guidance because their new taskmaster 

22  will not be -- be following Federal patent law because, 

23  in this case, the Court injected a brand-new requirement 

24  that was never held by a patent lawyer, that you had to 

have an expert witness testify to establish your

4  be looking to for guidance? The exclusive Federal 

courts? The Patent Office? Guidance from the Federal 

6  circuits? 

7  No, they are going to have their backs 

8  watched by the State courts, saying, uh-huh, you know 

9  what? I'm going to impose a new legal obligation on 

you, and you are going to be held for malpractice. And 

11  that's not -- that's not --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- what 

13  would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation 

14  in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately, 

decided the question, that the State court was entirely 

16  wrong about this; you don't need a witness. 

17  Well, that's the end of it, right? Once the 

18  Federal court decides the question, then whatever the --

19  the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is 

gone. 

21  MR. MICHEL: No, that's exactly the problem. 

22  The State courts aren't bound by the Federal circuit's 

23  holding. There will be no Federal review of substantial

says the law is? 

6  MR. MICHEL: No, not contrary -- that was 

7  the point I was going to make -- not contrary to the 

8  holdings of the United States Supreme Court, contrary to 

9  the Federal circuit's holding. And, in fact, the Fort 

Worth Court of Appeals did not follow the Federal 

11  circuit's holding in this area. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, are you saying, 

13  Mr. Michel, that what -- what the State courts are going 

14  to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal 

circuit has ruled on a matter and notwithstanding that 

16  the lawyer has complied with the rule as articulated by 

17  the Federal circuit, that, nonetheless, they will be 

18  held to have committed malpractice because they didn't 

19  comply with the State's rule? 

Is -- is that what you think the State 

21  judges are really going to do? 

22  MR. MICHEL: I think the State judges are

requires, and while we're happy -- or not happy -- but 

6  it's interesting that the Federal circuit thinks 

7  something else, but that doesn't bind us. 

8  MR. MICHEL: Correct. Correct. And it's 

9  not just hypothetical. The hypothetical doesn't mean 

insubstantial. The hypothetical doesn't mean --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that worse than the 

12  fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the 

13  lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are

holding as to State issues of malpractice? 

16  I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or 

17  Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are 

18  going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the 

19  basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive 

on those issues.

7  the malpractice lawsuit -- the State malpractice lawsuit,

9  MR. MICHEL: Correct. But the application 

and the rules governing it are going to be by Federal 

11  law. The rules in this case -- in particular, the 

12  substantial issue of the experimental use exception, the 

13  only issue we’ve saved was the -- the experimental use 

14  exception. We disagree that just because the State 

court makes an opinion and a holding, it doesn't have 

16  real-world effects. It really does. It's not an 

17  advisory opinion.

16  MR. MICHEL: For example, not every 

17  malpractice case -- it will be the case within the case 

18  doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court. 

19  For example, failure to communicate a 

settlement offer does not have a case within the case. 

21  In a business transaction, it doesn't have the case 

22  within the case analysis. 

23  So those malpractices arising from them will 

24  not go to Federal court. Breaches of fiduciary duty for 

divestiture of fees don't have the causation element.

1  So we are --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are talking about a 

3  case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract 

4  case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a 

patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court? 

6  MR. MICHEL: We do not. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then I repeat Justice 

8  Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do 

9  and which of those don't? 

MR. MICHEL: I think this is a case in 

11  point. This case is on all fours with Grable. There is 

12  no exception. The only distinguishing factor is this 

13  hypothetical argument of the case within the case 

14  analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't you stay 

16  within the lines that you give us? You have said not 

17  every patent question that comes up in a State court gets 

18  dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal court, 

19  what patent questions -- now, let's not talk about breach 

of fiduciary duty general questions -- what patent 

21  questions are properly adjudicated in the State court 

22  as part of a lawsuit that --

23  MR. MICHEL: Well, the -- the distinction 

24  is, for example, in a licensing case, in a patent case, 

where you -- those cases are brought in Federal – I

 mean -- I'm sorry -- brought in State court -- our --
our request here is following Grable, that what will go 
to Federal court are legal malpractice cases arising 
from substantial issues of Federal patent law that have 
that case within the case analysis. 

And it's that narrow -- extremely narrow 
window of cases. This is not, "Katie, bar the door."

 We – we’ve set forth the empirical numbers. They are 
going to be microscopic. But what they do have is 
Grable's test. Every element that Grable articulated, 
this case meets. 

12  It does involve substantial issues of first

 impression. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what was the 

substantial Federal matter in Grable? 

16  MR. MICHEL: The issue of the IRS, whether 
17
18
19

 personal service had to be given under an IRS --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And that was going 

to control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS. 
MR. MICHEL: Correct. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you have no 
counterpart for that here? 

MR. MICHEL: We do have rules that will 

24  govern the law on experimental use exception. 
GINSBURG: You have -- you have --

Official 

1  MR. MICHEL: And that would govern the 

2  application in Federal court. That's why it should be 

3  in Federal court, to govern how the agency -- and 

4  whether a patent -- and this suit goes directly -- it 

affects patents. This is going to patent validity. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the 

7  Federal court -- you said before that whatever the 

8  Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow 

9  it the next time there's a case in State court, but the 

Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the 

11  State judge says on experimental use. 

12  MR. MICHEL: It does. I will tell you --

13  the reason why it does, it's in the doctrine of 

14  collateral estoppel. It affects the inventor. It's 

affecting the inventor in this case. This holding of 

16  the State district court and the State court of appeals 

17  are now before the Patent Office --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. How does 

19  it -- the patent's invalid. 

MR. MICHEL: I'm sorry? 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The patent's invalid. 

22  Nothing the Court does here is going to change that 

23  invalidity. That -- that's what I don't understand. 

24  MR. MICHEL: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's not going to get 

42

1  his patent back from this action. 

2  MR. MICHEL: That's correct. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He's going to get money 

4  for losing it, maybe. 

MR. MICHEL: Correct. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how does it affect 

7  the patent? 

8  MR. MICHEL: There is a pending continuation 

9  patent. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're back to that 

11  issue. Okay. 

12  MR. MICHEL: Yes, but that is a collateral 

13  estoppel issue. Here, let me -- let me give up another 

14  scenario because, in a different role, when the patent 

is not declared invalid and, instead, there is a finding 

16  of non-infringement, and that's what gives rise to the 

17  legal malpractice case. 

18  Then you go to State court, and, in that 

19  situation, the determination of -- of infringement will 

be raised as a basis for legal malpractice against the 

21  lawyer in the malpractice action. Then the lawyers 

22  raise, as within the case within the case exception, is 

23  that, oh, the patent was invalid. 

24  So, then, in that situation, a State 

district court will be rendering an opinion on a live

Official 

1  patent, and then that will be binding on the inventor 

2  and will affect real live actual patents, and it does 

3  affect patents before the Patent Office. 

4  Petitioner said we -- it's not an issue of 

res judicata. They cite a rule. That's not our 

6  argument. It's an issue of issue preclusion. It's also 

7  the duty and the obligation of the lawyer to disclose 

8  that judicial discussion -- discussion to the Patent 

9  Office. 

Otherwise his, continuation patent could be 

11  declared invalid for inequitable conduct -- for not 

12  disclosing material information. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And your -- your 

14  distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction 

where the Federal law controls and patent is what? 

16  What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --

17  MR. MICHEL: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- copyright law. Why 

19  don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same 

way in those fields? 

21  MR. MICHEL: I think there are -- there are 

22  distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other 

23  area of the law namely because, as we get to the 

24  State -- and this -- this goes to the analysis of the 

State/Federal balance. That's why the exclusive Federal 

44

1  court jurisdiction. 

2  That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction 

3  in patent law in the Federal circuit is different than 

4  any other area of the law. It is that balancing test 

that we are required to engage in. 

6  That's why it's unique from antitrust, 

7  trademark, civil rights, securities, employment. Those 

8  have concurrent jurisdiction. They may not have an 

9  agency involved. 

For example, bankruptcy initially sounds 

11  like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but, when 

12  you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core 

13  proceedings, and there's non-core. Non-core are 

14  concurrent. Those can be heard in State court. 

Secondly, those underlying issues in 

16  bankruptcy, typically, involve State property right 

17  issues anyway. So they are really applying whether 

18  somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether 

19  somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that 

nature. 

21  So rather than in any other area of law, 

22  these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal 

23  court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are 

24  basically based on who the party is. 

And they are still applying underlying

1  State issues. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your case turns on 

3  the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate 

4  jurisdiction? 

MR. MICHEL: That is one of the most 

6  defining factors on the State/Federal balance of 

7  judicial responsibility. Our understanding of that 

8  analysis of the federalism and, also, the articulation 

9  of -- just as we have showed up -- Petitioners said a 

whole ton of cases were going to come in. 

11  We supported statistics that the numbers 

12  will be very small. But the distinguishing factor 

13  because of the balancing test that we are required to --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, if there's a large 

Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that 

16  there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal 

17  balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side. 

18  If there is that large Federal interest, is 

19  it surprising that the government hasn't come into this 

case, if there's such a Federal interest to be 

21  protected? 

22  MR. MICHEL: No, I think the Federal 

23  government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for 

24  that, Justice Ginsburg. There could be just many 

reasons why they didn't come in on this case, just like

1  they don't come in on many other cases. 

2  But the Federal interest here, in the 

3  national uniformity, I think, has been well stated, both 

4  by this Court and the Federal circuit. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a difference 

6  between you and your colleague on what "substantial" 

7  means. 

8  MR. MICHEL: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And she says it doesn't 

just mean necessary -- essential in this particular 

11  litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas 

12  City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many 

13  other cases, not just this case and whether there's 

14  going to be issue preclusion as to this particular 

inventor. 

16  Those -- I don't see an issue in this case 

17  comparable to those. 

18  MR. MICHEL: I think there are -- there are 

19  a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just 

this case. The question is the ongoing conflict in 

21  Federal patent law on whether the experimental use 

22  exception is a question of law or a question of fact. 

23  The Federal circuit has gone both ways on 

24  that, whether the issue of buyer knowledge is a 

conclusive factor or whether it is just one of 13 

47

1  factors. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whether they -- those 

3  questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll 

4  decide it, and then they'll be settled. 

MR. MICHEL: Well, we would hope they would 

6  be settled, but, then, we're going to have this whole 

7  other body of law out there in State courts that aren't 

8  bound by the Federal court to answer those questions. 

9  And those will govern the practice of patent -- patent 

lawyers. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is that, in 

12  practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that 

13  the State judges will go their own way? 

14  MR. MICHEL: I think it's a very real 

possibility. We've had --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, my -- my experience 

17  is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, 

18  are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of 

19  patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision 

of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast 

21  as they can. 

22  MR. MICHEL: You -- you would -- you would 

23  think so. It doesn't appear to be the case because, in 

24  this case, we had holdings that -- that experimental 

testing had to be on a required claim element. There is 

48

25

Official 

1  also an issue in this case of whether you had to have an 
2  expert witness testify to prove up the experimental use 
3  exception, nowhere held in Federal law. 
4  The problem is these judges often will have 

never handled a patent law in their career. This will 

6  go to some judges who have been in family law, got 
7  elected at the district court, and will never have 
8  decided or looked at a patent law case. 
9  We're requesting --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that be the same 

11  thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright? 
12  MR. MICHEL: But the articulation isn't the 
13  same. There are other -- in antitrust, there are State 
14  analogs. The -- the judges are familiar with applying 

it. In fact, the State of Texas, in Coca-Cola v. 

16  Harmar, stated that there's a high interest in its own 
17  State interest -- I mean, antitrust laws. The same with 
18  trademark, trademark is concurrent jurisdiction. 
19  The limited area that applies these factors, 

going back to the balancing test, is extremely narrow. 

21  Patent law is unique in that area of almost any other 
22  area of law. We think the Texas Supreme Court got this 
23  decision right, and we request that the Court follow 
24  Grable and apply Grable to the case at hand. Thank you.

1  Ms. Webre, you have four minutes remaining. 

2  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Webre, can I ask you 

about the question presented? 

6  The way you presented it to us, it -- it was 

7  as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal 

8  circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the 

9  names of those opinions are. But. In fact, that's not 

the situation at all. 

11  The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable, 

12  and I think just the way you would want it applied. So 

13  your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it 

14  correctly; isn't that right? 

MS. WEBRE: I disagree, Your Honor. The 

16  Texas Supreme Court didn't properly apply Grable. What 

17  they applied was the Federal circuit's improper 

18  departure from Grable, in two ways. 

19  One is they conflated necessity with 

substantiality, and that comes -- in the Federal 

21  circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite 

22  from the earlier Christiansen case, where the -- the 

23  line goes something like, "There is a substantial 

24  Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties' 

claim." 

50

1  And so it conflates necessity with 

2  substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court 

3  followed the Federal circuit's construct. They said, 

4  we're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality, 

but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did. 

6  And ditto with -- with the Federalism 

7  balance. They pointed to the needs of the Federal 

8  interest in the uniformity of patent law, and that was 

9  the end of the inquiry. 

And I think that that is a measure of the 

11  deference that the Supreme Court of Texas -- as other 

12  State courts would do, the deference they grant to the 

13  Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate 

14  scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative 

importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law. 

16  And so we arrive to you from the Supreme 

17  Court of Texas, but truly presenting the -- the 

18  appropriateness of the Federal circuit's redone 

19  application of the Grable test. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer the one 

21  point your adversary raised that -- that gives me 

22  pause -- a lot of pause. 

23  He says a ruling on patent law of how you 

24  should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim 

will affect all of the lawyers who practice in – in 

51

1  your State because each of them will have to do or not 

2  do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's 

3  what the State is going to -- State courts will follow 

4  in the future. 

So it will change those lawyers' behaviors 

6  in Federal court. 

7  MS. WEBRE: Your Honor, I think that that is 

8  such a speculative road to go down. What is it the 

9  lawyers are going to do different? A lawyer --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are going to 

11  present an expert all of the time when they don't need 

12  to. 

13  MS. WEBRE: They are -- they are going to do 

14  some extra work and make an extra belt along with the 

suspenders that they are required to do. 

16  And where is the harm in that? And where is 

17  the undermining of -- of the uniformity of patent law if 

18  a lawyer in a-- in a real patent case in Federal 

19  court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you can think of an 

21  example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case, 

22  but where a State court's ruling could, in fact, 

23  establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts 

24  and suspenders, that's something else. 

MS. WEBRE: Your Honor, I think that – that 

52

1  spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly 

2  speculative. It's hard to imagine a situation where it 

3  would be contrary or intentioned with what -- what the 

4  Federal courts would hold, particularly since it's -- I 

agree with Justice Scalia's construct, that the State 

6  courts are going to try to apply appropriate Federal 

7  law --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about just 

9  the -- just the flip side of this case? Let's suppose 

they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert. So 

11  it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor 

12  suspenders. 

13  That's going to affect the conduct of the 

14  lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive 

of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law. 

16  MS. WEBRE: If an expert is required under 

17  Federal jurisprudence, then an expert is required in a 

18  real patent case. And if the State court makes the 

19  mistake in -- in an occasional case here or there, then 

a lawyer practicing in a real patent case -- in a real 

21  case in Federal court, needs to make sure that they are 

22  complying with the requirements. 

23  And -- and if you're going to – 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, the 

requirements of the Federal law. The question is 

53

4  MS. WEBRE: Well, Your Honor, if there is a 

conflict, then what you're supposed to follow is the 

6  jurisprudence of the courts who -- before whom you are 

7  practicing. If -- if the Federal circuit or Federal 

8  district court has something about patent law, then 

9  that's what the lawyers should follow in prosecuting a 

patent case. 

11  And a lawyer who decides, I'm going to 

12  disregard the Federal circuit standards on fact 

13  question, expert required, whatever it is, and, instead, 

14  follow the Fort Worth court of appeals on this issue, I 

submit that -- that the lawyer does so at his peril, and 

16  that doesn't undermine the appropriate uniformity of 

17  patent law.
