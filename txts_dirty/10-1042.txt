3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-1042, Freeman v. Quicken 

Loans. 

6  Mr. Russell. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  For decades, the agency Congress charged 

12 with administering the Real Estate Settlement Procedures 

13 Act has construed that statute as prohibiting a lender 

14 from accepting a charge for a real estate settlement 

service it didn't provide, whether it accepts that 

16 charge directly from a consumer or indirectly through 

17 another service provider, and whether it shares that fee 

18 with another provider or keeps it all for itself. 

19  That interpretation is eminently reasonable 

and is entitled to deference. And in fact --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, when you say 

22 the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD 

23 and its successor -- they don't have any 

24 suit-commencement authority? 

MR. RUSSELL: HUD does have authority to

1 bring suits for injunctive relief for violations of 

2 2607(b), and -- if that answers your question. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: For injunctive relief? 

4  MR. RUSSELL: For injunctive relief. That's 

correct. And that agency has long construed the 

6 language of this provision as reaching all unearned fees 

7 whether divided or not, and that interpretation of the 

8 language we think is eminently reasonable. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Reaching all? I didn't 

understand you. You said it too fast. As reaching 

11 all -- something fees, whether permitted --

12  MR. RUSSELL: All unearned fees, whether 

13 split --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Unearned fees 

whether provided or not. 

16  MR. RUSSELL: Whether split or not. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: How does this – just -- may 

18 be a side issue, but I don't see how this is a fee for 

19 service. I mean, I thought points is simply a way of 

paying more money up front and getting a lower interest 

21 rate later. It isn't supposed to be for any service; 

22 it's simply a question of -- of a loan term, how much 

23 you borrow and what the interest rate is. 

24  MR. RUSSELL: Well, you're right. I do 

think it's a side issue because the courts below didn't 

4

1 decide that, and Quicken didn't --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: So, what are we supposed to 

3 do -- decide theoretically, in the context of a case 

4 that does not involve paying a fee for a service that 

doesn't exist, whether you can pay for a service that 

6 doesn't exist? 

7  MR. RUSSELL: I think you can take it on the 

8 same assumption that the court of appeals did, that the 

9 fee was unearned, and decide the question presented. 

But to answer your question, Congress 

11 amended the statute specifically to overrule the Sixth 

12 Circuit's decision in Graham, which held that loan 

13 discount fees were not covered by the statute, in that 

14 case involving a kickback. I know Quicken argues that 

that case involved origination fees. We don't think 

16 that's correct. But this is -- this is an issue you 

17 could have an entire case about. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: How? 

19  MR. RUSSELL: And -- but --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's the 

21 argument on the other side? A point is a way of paying 

22 more money, i.e., borrowing less. Since you pay more, 

23 that means you borrow less. And so, your interest rate 

24 is lower because you’ve borrowed less. Now, what's the 

argument on the other side?

1  MR. RUSSELL: The argument is Congress 


2 specifically defined the term "real estate settlement 


3 service" to include the origination of the loan, which 


4 includes but is not limited to the funding of the loan. 


And it did that in order to encompass kickbacks, at the 


6 very least, involving loan discount points, which was 


7 what is at issue in Graham. 


8  Now, you can have debates -- and we will 


9 have in this case eventually debates about what does it 


mean for a loan discount fee to be unearned. But for 

11 present purposes, the circuit split arose here in the much 

12 more common circumstance, when there are unearned fees 

13 for appraisals and courier fees, and -- and that's what 

14 the lower court decided on the basis of. And it did 

so --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose if -- if 

17 the lower court could have been wrong for either one of 

18 two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two 

19 we -- we're precluded from considering, right? 

MR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think you're 

21 precluded from considering -- I --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it’s -- it would be 

23 just as well to say that the question presented here 

24 decides the case as it would be to say that the question 

raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right?

Official 

1  MR. RUSSELL: Right. I --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: And is there any reason to 

3 put the one before the other? 

4  MR. RUSSELL: There are several reasons. 

One is the lower courts did not address this question. 

6 Quicken hasn't briefed it to any extent. Quicken 

7 doesn't ask you to decide it on the base of that 

8 question. We haven't briefed it. It's a complicated 

9 question that involves interpretation of another 

provision of the statute that Congress amended to deal 

11 specifically with this problem. And it wouldn't 

12 solve -- it wouldn't resolve the circuit conflict that 

13 the Court granted cert to decide. 

14  And so, if I could turn to that, if you look 

at the language of the statute, which is reproduced on 

16 page 6a of the -- the blue brief, in the words of the 

17 statute, a lender who charges an unearned fee, accepts, 

18 within the meaning of the statute, a portion, split, or 

19 percentage, i.e., 100 percent, of a charge that was made 

for the rendering of a covered real estate settlement 

21 service other than for services actually performed. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- your argument 

23 that "percentage" can include 100 percent is certainly 

24 true as a matter of logic. But in the phrase "portion, 

split, or percentage," I think the more natural reading 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 of "percentage" is something less than 100 percent. In 

2 other words, you're apportioning or you're splitting the 

3 fee with somebody else. 

4  MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could have --

6 "portion" I suppose could still mean a full portion; 

7 "split" probably not. But, I mean, the more natural 

8 reading is surely a division. 

9  MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think "portion" is the 

word that best fits this situation. And Congress has 

11 used the phrase "portion" in other state -- in other 

12 statutes to prohibit, for example, a public official 

13 from converting to personal use any portion of the funds 

14 entrusted to him --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It could mean that, but it 

16 need not mean that. It could mean either that or just 

17 -- just part and not whole; and which of the two it 

18 means is often decided by the other words with which 

19 it's associated. I mean, if you have a phrase that 

says, you know, "tacks, nails, and" -- what? "Tacks, 

21 nails, and wooden pegs," it's clear that "nails" doesn't 

22 mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener. 

23  And so, also here, when it says "portion, 

24 split, or percentage," it seems to me the natural 

reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it 

8

Official 

1 could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion. 

2  MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would -- I would say 

3 two things about that. One is that when you have a 

4 statute that forbids somebody from taking any portion of 

something, I think the ordinary understanding is that 

6 prohibits them from taking the whole of the thing. The 

7 embezzlement statutes are an example of that. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not what we have. 

9 We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not 

take any portion or split. 

11  MR. RUSSELL: Right. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? 

13  MR. RUSSELL: And so, the canon, though, I 

14 don't think, is a canon that says when you have related 

words, you give them all the same meaning. They 

16 certainly have something in common. They're all the 

17 measure of something, but the canon doesn't say that you 

18 read them to all mean the same measure of something, 

19 which would run headlong, I think, into the canon 

against construing statutes to have surplusage. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the -- one 

22 reason -- one objection to your idea that, well, this 

23 covers partial, so it must cover 100 percent, is that 

24 it's a very different issue if you're talking about 

partial and 100 percent. If you're talking about 

9

Official 

1 partial, you have a classic case of a -- a kickback. 

2 But if you suddenly say 100 percent of an unearned fee, 

3 that's a much more difficult question to decide. 

4  In this case, for example, you get a whole 

bunch of things from Quicken Loans, including the loan 

6 and all this other stuff, and it's kind of hard to 

7 single out, well, this part is unearned but this part is 

8 earned; it's kind of a whole package. When you have a 

9 portion or split, it's an entirely different issue. 

MR. RUSSELL: Well, you still have to 

11 decide, when you're talking about a kickback, whether 

12 the person who received the kickback has done anything 

13 to earn their portion of it. And so, I don't think you 

14 avoid the question of what does it mean for a fee to be 

unearned entirely. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but there --

17 it's a more -- it's a narrower issue when you're talking 

18 about a portion. Let's say the kickback goes to the 

19 appraiser. Maybe you can decide in that case whether 

the loan company really had anything to do with the 

21 appraisal at all. 

22  When the alleged unearned fee goes to the 

23 whole loan company, it's a little harder to say which 

24 part was unearned and which parts might have been 

earned.

1  MR. RUSSELL: But --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's just -- it's 

3 the way these loans work, right? I mean, it's the same 

4 thing whether you pay 10 percent and no points or 9 

percent and 3 points. You know, which one of those is 

6 earned or unearned, it's kind of hard to sort it out. 

7  MR. RUSSELL: It's certainly harder to sort 

8 out with respect to loan discount fees. But the run of 

9 the mine cases here involve things like appraisals, 

courier services, flood certifications --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. How does that work? 

12 The bank says to Mr. Smith we are going to charge you 

13 $100 for a courier service. And then they don't. So, 

14 there it is on the bill. And Mr. Smith, really knowing 

he didn't get the courier service, pays the $100. All 

16 right? Why isn't Mr. Smith guilty, on your 

17 interpretation? 

18  I mean, on your interpretation, every 

19 innocent consumer is guilty of a crime. 

MR. RUSSELL: No. That -- that is not the 

21 case --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 

23  MR. RUSSELL: -- and what protect consumers 

24 is the last words of the -- of this provision, which 

creates a safe harbor for people who give or accept

1 charges for services actually performed. And the 

2 critical word here is "for." What a consumer is paying 

3 "for" is what she has been charged "for." 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. RUSSELL: If she has been charged for an 

6 appraisal, what she is giving the charge for is for the 

7 appraisal. If the appraisal wasn't performed, that 

8 shows she didn't get what she paid for, but it doesn't 

9 change what she was paying "for." Now --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, you -- I don't 

11 understand that. It's my fault. But wouldn't -- it 

12 says that if she doesn't get the appraisal, but she has 

13 to pay for it, then why isn't she -- why hasn't -- why 

14 doesn't she fall within the statute? 

MR. RUSSELL: I think that there are two 

16 ways you can construe what it means to pay a charge for. 

17 One is what it is you actually got --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: What you got was nothing. 

19  MR. RUSSELL: -- which was nothing. The 

other is what you are actually charged for, which was 

21 the appraisal. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

23  MR. RUSSELL: And I think that latter 

24 interpretation --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

1  MR. RUSSELL: -- is the proper one. It's --

2 I think it's the most natural -- 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Why hasn't the consumer 

4 violated? 

MR. RUSSELL: Because she didn't pay for 

6 services other than -- she didn't pay for services other 

7 than services actually performed. What she paid for --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Then why is the bank 

9 liable? 

MR. RUSSELL: Because I think it's 

11 different, depending on whether you're looking from the 

12 perspective of accepting or receiving, what the charge 

13 is for. So, for example, if you were to go to your 

14 mechanic and you were charged for an oil change but you 

didn't get one, it would be perfectly natural for you to 

16 say I was charged for and I paid for an oil change. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. So, this -- you're 

18 saying when the bank writes down, "pay $100 for the 

19 courier service," the bank is charging for the courier 

service. 

21  MR. RUSSELL: Right. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: When the consumer pays for 

23 the courier service which he sees there, the consumer is 

24 not paying for the courier service. He is paying for 

the nothing.

3  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then why 


4 doesn't he fall within the -- within the statute? 


MR. RUSSELL: Because it's not a violation 

6 of the statute --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Why? 

8  MR. RUSSELL: -- to pay for a service 

9 actually performed. And that's what she is paying for; 

she's paying for an appraisal. She's not paying for 

11 nothing. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they're -- but the 

13 purchaser is the giver, and the statute reads, "No 

14 person shall give and no person shall accept." The 

acceptor is the loan company. The person who is giving 

16 would be the consumer, the customer. 

17  MR. RUSSELL: Correct. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- so, the person who 

19 gives is -- is not answerable under your reading of this 

(b)? 

21  MR. RUSSELL: Correct, because what she is 

22 giving the charge for is what she has been charged for. 

23 She was charged for an appraisal. She's giving the 

24 charge for an appraisal, and that doesn't violate the 

statute.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me an example of where 

2 the language "give" would have an effect. 

3  MR. RUSSELL: I think in --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Have you deprived it of all 

effect? 

6  MR. RUSSELL: No. In a traditional kickback 

7 situation, where Quicken, for example, kicked back some 

8 of the fee to a real estate agent for nothing, for the 

9 referral of the business, which isn't for a service 

actually performed within the meaning of the statute, 

11 that would violate the provision. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then we have Quicken 

13 as the giver and the person who receives the referral or 

14 kickback as the receiver. 

MR. RUSSELL: That's correct. This 

16 provision does double duty. It is designed and written 

17 broadly to encompass both traditional kickback 

18 situations and unearned fee provisions. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, there's one 

puzzling aspect of -- of your interpretation. It would 

21 be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going 

22 to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is --

23 counts; and yet, in the -- in the purposes of the Act on 

24 page 1 of the appendix, it says nothing about 

overcharges, nothing about payment for a service not

1 received in the -- in the four -- "it is the purpose of 

2 the Act to," and then there are four things listed, and 

3 none of those say to stop charges for services that 

4 weren't performed. 

MR. RUSSELL: That's true. First, just to 

6 clarify, we don't -- we're not arguing that it covers 

7 overcharges in the sense of excessive charges. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is -- that is 

9 HUD's interpretation? 

MR. RUSSELL: That is one of HUD's 

11 interpretations, although it's an interpretation about 

12 what it means for something to be unearned, not having 

13 anything to do with whether split fees are covered or 

14 not. 

But to answer your more specific question, 

16 we know that that enumeration is not comprehensive. 

17 There are other things in the statute that are not 

18 included. And the general purpose of the statute --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: But nothing as big as this, 

if you accept HUD's interpretation of this, which is 

21 essentially the issuance of a -- of a price schedule by 

22 HUD, and anything above these prices is an overcharge 

23 and hence falls under -- under this provision. That's 

24 immense. 

MR. RUSSELL: It would be immense, but this

apply. 

6  MR. RUSSELL: But as --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: We can't at one time -- at 

8 one and the same time, give deference to HUD and yet 

9 disagree with what HUD says. 

MR. RUSSELL: Certainly you can, and, in 

11 fact, Your Honor did in Smith v. City of Jackson, where 

12 you held that a provision of a regulation recognizing 

13 disparate impact was entitled to deference, but a 

14 provision saying what you had to prove to show a 

disparate impact violation wasn't. And here 

16 similarly -- I mean, particularly the overcharge part of 

17 the interpretation is not even in the regulations. It's 

18 in the policy statement. It's a subsequent --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: But do you think this is 

just a labeling statute? Quicken could charge whatever 

21 it wanted, bottom line, but if it breaks it down into 

22 categories and it doesn't do something that's actually 

23 attributable to one of those categories, then there's a 

24 violation? 

MR. RUSSELL: I think Congress -- yes. I

1 mean, it is -- labels are important, because Congress 

2 didn't say you simply have to disclose the bottom line;

4 requiring that those identified line items actually 

represent services that were actually rendered is a 

6 completely reasonable supplement to the disclosure 

7 requirement.

14  AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

16 please the Court: 

17  The plain terms of section 2607(b) prohibit 

18 two separate actions, giving an unearned fee and 

19 accepting one. Sometimes the statute will be violated 

when an unearned fee is collected from the consumer and 

21 then shared between two service providers. But the 

22 statute is also violated when a service provider 

23 collects an unearned fee directly from the consumer and 

24 retains the entire fee for itself.

7  MS. O'CONNELL: I don’t--

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Where in the briefs does it 

9 explain to me why in your situation the bank would be 

violating it, but the consumer wouldn't, since it says 

11 "no person shall give" as well as "no person shall 

12 receive"? 

13  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I don't 

14 think this is in the briefs. It's --

18  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, it is --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, we have a statute 

that looks like a kickback statute, and the reason it 

21 looks like a kickback statute is it refers both to the

3  MS. O'CONNELL: I think --


4  JUSTICE BREYER: -- on your reading of it. 


MS. O'CONNELL: The explanation is 


6 encompassed in HUD's policy statement. Footnote 6 of 


7 the policy statement, which is in the appendix to the 


8 Petitioners' brief at 33a, says that HUD would be 


9 unlikely to bring an enforcement action against 


consumers for the payment of unearned fees. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you mean it's all 

12 prosecutorial discretion? In other words, if you happen 

13 to be a consumer you just have to rely on the goodwill 

14 of the prosecutor; is that the idea? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I think it's 

16 more than just prosecutorial discretion. What HUD is 

17 explaining --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: What more? 

19  MS. O'CONNELL: What HUD is explaining is 

that the reason why it would not prosecute a consumer is 

21 because the consumer does not make the payment for --

22 does not pay a fee for the payment of unearned fees. A 

23 consumer --

our cases, oh, don't worry, this is within the

1 discretion of the prosecutor, close enough for 

2 government work? 

3  MS. O'CONNELL: No, no. Justice Kennedy, I 

4 don't -- I don't think that this is just prosecutorial 

discretion. This is HUD's interpretation of the statute 

6 laid out in a policy statement saying it doesn't think 

7 consumers violate the statute because they're --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does HUD have expertise in 

9 interpreting criminal statutes? 

MS. O'CONNELL: HUD is -- has an expertise 

11 in -- in determining what is earned and unearned and 

12 what the practices are in the real estate industry for 

13 charging consumers fees that haven't been earned by the 

14 service providers. What HUD is saying in the policy --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but I assume that 

16 HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours 

17 must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt so that 

18 if there's any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard 

19 rule. If there's a genuine ambiguity, you -- you find 

for the interpretation that favors the defendant. And 

21 this here -- I think this is at the very least 

22 ambiguous. And you are telling me -- well, I guess 

23 you're right. I guess HUD is favoring what would be the 

24 defendant in this case. 

MS. O'CONNELL: If -- yes, it -- it's saying

Official 

1 that it doesn't think that a consumer violates the 

2 statute because the consumer doesn't pay the fee other 

3 than for services actually performed. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: But can you -- I don't want 

to take all your time on this because to me the more 

6 important problem was the problem of the difference 

7 between a kickback statute, which we could understand as 

8 well within HUD's expertise and normal and of course 

9 very good reason for doing it. But a price control 

statute, where we have the Federal agency deciding 

11 whether the prices are accurate for each service that is 

12 rendered or whether some percentage or all of it 

13 represents service for nothing -- that's a rather big 

14 novelty in American life. That is, we have it, but 

they are usually Federal agencies that have a system 

16 set up for determining proper prices and so forth. 

17  So, it's hard for me to believe that sort of 

18 inadvertently Congress brought in the second under the 

19 guise of the first without a big fuss being raised and a 

big debate and so forth. 

21  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, I think the 

22 important -- important point here is that this is not an 

23 overcharge case; this is an unearned fee case. 

24 Overcharges are included in the 2001 policy statement, 

but there is a basis in the statute to differentiate 

22

1 between overcharges and unearned fees, and HUD has long 

2 taken the position that undivided unearned fees, a fee 

3 for which no service is performed, violates section 

4 2607(b). 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure. It 

6 seems to me that even under the Respondent's view of the 

7 statute, you have to inquire into reasonableness to see 

8 if the fee was earned. 

9  MS. O'CONNELL: At some point, under 

anybody's interpretation, there does have to be a 

11 determination of whether something was earned. But 

12 there is a statutory basis to distinguish between an 

13 unearned fee and an overcharge in that the service has 

14 to be -- the fee has to be other than for services 

actually performed. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. If -- you 

17 know, if -- if I charge you an exorbitant amount for 

18 cutting down a tree, you know, 2,000, $20,000, and then 

19 I present my bill, you would say that I have not earned 

it simply because it's exorbitant?

1 interpretation, I don't think have you to evaluate the 


2 reasonableness of the fee in order to decide whether it 


3 was earned or not. 


4  MS. O'CONNELL: Under the statute, if it's 


for -- if the fee is for -- other than for services 

6 actually performed, which -- we think the loan discount 

7 fee in this case was a charge other than for a service 

8 actually performed. There was no corresponding 

9 reduction in the interest rate. That is an unearned fee 

under -- under anybody's interpretation. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: It looks to me as though you 

12 have an additional statutory problem. You have two sets 

13 of verbs in this statute. One is the "give and accept" 

14 set of verbs, and then the other is the "charge made or 

received." So, it seems to me that what the statute is 

16 -- is thinking about is that first, that there is a charge 

17 made or received, and that charge is, of course, the 

18 charge that the consumer pays to the provider. And then 

19 there's another transaction. And that transaction is 

the "give or accept" transaction, and that transaction 

21 occurs between two service providers. So, one set of 

22 verbs refers to the consumer-provider relationship; the 

23 other set of verbs refers to the provider-provider 

24 relationship. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Kagan, we agree that

Official 

1 that -- that is one scenario covered by 2607(b). We 

2 don't think it's the only scenario covered by the 

3 statute. Under our interpretation and Petitioners' 

4 interpretation, there doesn't have to be both a culpable 

giver and acceptor. So, once the charge is received 

6 from the consumer and accepted by the service provider, 

7 that is also a violation of the statute. 

8  It also does cover fees that are split 

9 between two service providers, as you say, the giving 

and accepting, but it doesn't have to involve two 

11 service providers under the plain language of the 

12 statute. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are now 

14 splitting HUD's position. HUD's position says 

overcharges are reached by the statute. You say not 

16 overcharges, but only a fee when no service is 

17 performed. So, why couldn't the customers have said 

18 there is a fee for the service performed, that's the 

19 reasonable fee; and the rest of it is a charge for a 

service not performed? 

21  I mean, can you really maintain that 

22 distinction between an overcharge and a fee for services 

23 that are not performed? 

24  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, in this 

case, we don't think that the Court has to -- has to say 

25

1 anything about overcharges and whether those are covered 

2 by the statute. The fee in this case was a loan 

3 discount fee, which is generally paid to procure a 

4 reduction in the interest rate of the loan, and it 
procured nothing for the Petitioners. It was a 

6 completely unearned fee. It was other than for services 

7 actually performed. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does that mean? 

9 In other words, the rate that was offered -- they said 
you pay two points and you will get a rate of 8 percent. And 

11 you're saying that even if they didn't pay the two 

12 points, they would still get a rate of 8 percent? 

13  MS. O'CONNELL: Right. Our understanding is 

14 that when -- the Petitioners in this case got a quote 
for their mortgage loan from Quicken over the phone at a 

16 particular interest rate with no mention of points. 

17 When it came time to pay the settlement charges, they 

18 were charged a loan discount fee, charged points to 

19 procure that particular interest rate. That -- that's 
something that would have to be figured out on remand, 

21 whether there actually should have been a -- a charge or 

22 whether those points were included in the --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know anybody who --

24 any knowledgeable person who applies for a loan, who 
doesn't ask whether there are any points? I mean, it's

1 standard mortgage practice. And somebody who says I'm going 

2 to get 8 percent? Yes. Eight percent with or without 

3 points? 

4  I mean, that -- I don't think that the mere 

fact that the interest rate was 8 percent means that you 


6 can't charge points and that any charging of points is 


7 -- is a charge for a service not performed. The service 


8 performed is giving you an 8 percent rate. 


9  MR. O'CONNELL: Justice Scalia --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if she didn't want the 

11 points, she should have -- when it came to the closing, 

12 say what are these points for? The 8 percent is what 

13 you agreed to. And they would have said, well, that 

14 8 percent is the -- is the rate we give when we charge 2 

points. 

16  MS. O'CONNELL: What -- what RESPA is 

17 intended to do is to protect consumers, who often are 

18 not sophisticated on what they're doing in securing a 

19 residential mortgage loan and to make sure that they 

understand what the charges are, and also to ensure that 

21 they receive the charges -- the services for which they 

22 pay at closing. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that's the 

24 problem. The problem is, look, you are saying this is a 

payment for a service that wasn't given. I think I

3  Somebody might say you didn't get the 

4 courier service at all. Others might say you got 

service but not the gold-plated service, and the gold 

6 plate was nothing. You see, that's what happens when 

7 you get into a price control statute rather than a 

8 kickback statute. And that is our concern here, I think 

9 at least mine. 

MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Breyer, this case 

11 comes here under the assumption that this was an 

12 unearned fee. If that's something the Court is 

13 concerned about, it's something -- it could still decide 

14 the question presented, and then the -- the lower courts 

could figure that out on remand, whether this was earned 

16 or not.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. HEFFERON 

21  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

22  MR. HEFFERON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

23 please the Court: 

24  In passing RESPA in 1974, Congress was 

stepping into the middle of a primarily local market 

28
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 controlled by State law. The statute shows that, in 

2 doing so, Congress tread carefully. It did primarily 

3 two things in the area of settlement charges. 

4  First, its major reform was to standardize 

and increase disclosure of charges, including requiring 

6 a written estimate of charges to be given to people 

7 weeks before the closing. That, in fact, was done here. 

8  Second, as RESPA's finding and purposes 

9 section tells us, Congress found that some consumers 

needed particular protection from a particular market 

11 failure. And I'm quoting from section 2601 in the first 

12 page of the blue brief. Quote: "unnecessarily high 

13 settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices 

14 that have developed in some areas of the country." 

Congress identified those as kickbacks and 

16 referral fees. But in 1974, Congress went no farther. 

17 It rejected proposals for direct price regulation which 

18 had been proposed in both House and Senate. Congress 

19 did recognize more legislation might be necessary and 

that price controls might be advisable. And so, it sent 

21 HUD out to do a study and report back. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hefferon, if you are 

23 right about subsection (b) and its meaning, what does it 

24 do that subsection (a) does not do? 

MR. HEFFERON: It -- it does two things. 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 First of all, with respect to the transactions that 


2 relate to charges actually paid at the closing, it 


3 eliminates the need to prove an agreement. All it --


4 all it says is that there will be a violation if you 


follow the money and the money ends up in the hands --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if that's the case, I 

7 mean, why would Congress have done something that says 

8 (a) pursuant to an agreement, (b) not pursuant to an 

9 agreement? Why wouldn't it just have one provision that 

didn't make any reference to an agreement? 

11  MR. HEFFERON: Because (a) covers an entire 

12 universe of things which appear, in many instances, away 

13 from the closing table. For example, an agreement 

14 between an attorney and a developer that the attorney 

says I will do all the title work on the raw land for 

16 this development if you later on send me the closings 

17 when you build on the land and sell the particular 

18 parcels. 

19  If there was no agreement requirement, 

agreement for referral, if that did not appear in (a), 

21 then any relationship between two people in the 

22 settlement service business would be presumptively a 

23 kickback. And so, you had to have that. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, (a) -- the 

so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not

1 actually performed. The referral -- the referral is 

2 certainly a service performed to the lender. There's --

3 there's nothing -- what should I say -- unethical about 

4 getting a fee for a referral. It's -- it's called a 

finder's fee. 

6  So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is --

7 is made unlawful, right? 

8  MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. Congress has 

9 decided that that is not something that should be 

compensable as part of real estate business. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: And under (b), something 

12 quite different, and that is giving money to somebody 

13 who performs no service at all is made unlawful. And 

14 for that, you don't need an agreement, right? 

MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. You don't 

16 need to prove one. I think all parties here --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, under your 

18 reading, as I understand it, the words "portion, split, 

19 or percentage" means an amount less than the whole? 

MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what happens if a 

22 service provider gives 100 percent to the other side, as 

23 opposed to a -- an amount less than the whole? 

24  MR. HEFFERON: We don't believe that it is 

covered by section 8(b). In most -- in section 2607(b). 

31

Official 

1 In most instances, it would probably be provable as a 


2 kickback under 2607(a) since, in normal circumstance, 


3 one doesn't give all of one's fee away unless there's 


4 something else going on, typically in this instance a 


referral. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that -- does that 

7 make much sense that if you give one meaning -- if you 

8 stay consistent with your meaning, what you're saying is 

9 a situation where the service provider gives away 

everything, 100 percent, they're just not liable under 

11 (b)? 

12  MR. HEFFERON: That --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If they give away 1 

14 percent, they -- if they keep 1 percent, they're liable. 

MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. Again, 

16 Congress was trying to take a measured step here because 

17 it was for the first time stepping into this local 

18 market. Congress left State law remedies alone. And in 

19 fact, the preemption provision --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- Judge 

21 Higginbotham, in his dissent, said there is a big 

22 difference between unearned fees and overcharge fees. 

23 He said unearned fees, in their simplest form, is no 

24 service whatsoever. Overcharges are some service but an 

excessive value.

1  What's wrong with that definition? Why is 

2 that definition unworkable in terms of limiting and 

3 defining this statute? 

4  MR. HEFFERON: If the Court would find that 

"portion, split, or percentage" covers 100 percent, then 

6 we would agree with Judge Higginbotham that it would --

7 that a -- liability would not go any further than a 

8 situation where the person performed no services 

9 whatsoever for a fee. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this 100 percent 

11 thing -- is this a real problem that Congress was 

12 addressing? Do you know of any 100 percent kickbacks or 

13 100 percent payments to somebody else for services not 

14 performed as opposed to just keeping part and giving the 

rest? 

16  MR. HEFFERON: In fact --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that enough reason 

18 for its not being addressed, that it's not a real 

19 problem? 

MR. HEFFERON: And, Justice Scalia, there's 

21 no indication that we are aware of in the legislative 

22 history that such a thing was happening. What 

23 Congress --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think not? How 

about with subsidiaries? Wasn't it common practice --

1 isn't it common practice that subsidiaries are often 

2 receiving parts of the payments because then they

4 parent? 

MR. HEFFERON: It's -- it is a -- it is a 

6 common arrangement if those subsidiaries are rendering 

7 services in connection with the real estate settlement 

8 service. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't it a 

potential common practice that they're getting 

11 100 percent of something they didn't do? 

12  MR. HEFFERON: Again, there's no 

13 indication --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If they're rendering --

if they're already rendering services? 

16  MR. HEFFERON: There's no indication in the 

17 legislative history that that type of conduct was going 

18 on, and Congress was specifically identifying kickbacks 

19 and referral fees, which it referred to, for example, as 

rebates and commissions, unearned commissions. And the 

21 type of conduct which Congress meant to address was set 

22 forth in this statute and in the legislative history. 

23 And it, of course, deputized HUD to do a study to see if 

24 more needed to be done. It recognized that full 

payments may implicate the issue of rate setting and

1 that perhaps that's something that should be done, but 

2 it wasn't going to be done at this point. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why is the statute 

4 labeled, titled, "Prohibition Against Kickbacks" --

that's one thing -- "and Unearned Fees"? What -- how do 

6 you -- what does "unearned fees" refer to in the title 

7 of 2607? 

8  MR. HEFFERON: Well, Congress made the 

9 decision at the time, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 

that -- that a fee for a referral is -- is not properly 

11 earned. And the -- the definition for the entire 

12 section, the title, is "Kickbacks and Unearned Fees." 

13 That refers to the entire section, (a) and (b). All 

14 agree that 2607(b) frequently is -- is implicated if 

there is a kickback. So, it can't be that the first 

16 word applies only to (a) and the second word only to 

17 (b). 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you think there 

19 could be an earned kickback. 

MR. HEFFERON: There could be -- there could 

21 be an earned kickback if Congress was willing to accept 

22 the principle that it's okay to earn money for a 

23 referral. That -- Congress rejected it, rejected the 

24 principle that it's okay to get a -- to pay a kickback. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's okay to get

1 money for a referral, what type of kickback is not okay? 

2  MR. HEFFERON: Well, it's -- let me be 

3 clear. Congress made the policy decision it is not okay 

4 to pay a kickback or any money in order to get a pure 

referral and, therefore, said that in section (a) and 

6 section (b) it is not proper to do that. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: It made the decision that a 

8 finder's fee in this area, although in all other areas 

9 is perfectly okay, but a finder's fee in this area is a 

kickback. 

11  MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if your reading 

13 of the language is not plain, if there is two ways to 

14 read this statute, give me your best reason for why the 

policy statement should not be given deference. 

16  I know you said because it didn't go through 

17 notice and -- through notice; but outside of that, why 

18 isn't this a HUD interpretation that the statute tells 

19 us HUD can do, an interpretation of the statute? We can 

argue about whether it's an interpretation of regulation 

21 X or not, but why wouldn't it be entitled to deference? 

22  MR. HEFFERON: It certainly is an 

23 interpretation of the statute. We agree with that. And 

24 HUD is given the authority -- now the bureau, previously 

HUD, is given authority to interpret the statute.

1  In this instance, there's not a -- the 

2 policy statement should not be due special deference for 

3 several reasons. First of all, it's incomplete. It 

4 purports to be an interpretation of this statute, and it 

only touches very briefly and very generally on the 

6 language. All the words that we have all spent a lot of 

7 time working on in this case -- HUD says very little 

8 about that. And it is -- also it doesn't --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the Seventh 

Circuit had said a lot different, and HUD came back --

11 and invited HUD to do something, and HUD came back and 

12 said you read it that way; we think this is a better 

13 reading. 

14  What more do we need from an agency? 

MR. HEFFERON: Because it -- it did not 

16 treat the subject with the kind of depth that you would 

17 expect or that this Court would want in terms of --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hefferon, I don't 

19 think that that's true, that -- we defer to agencies, 

not because we think that agencies do statutory 

21 interpretation in exactly the way courts do. We 

22 actually defer to agencies because we think they provide 

23 something different, not because they're the best parser 

24 of statutory language, but because when they see 

ambiguity, they're able to import policy judgments into

1 that ambiguity. And that seems to me exactly what the 

2 agency did here. 

3  MR. HEFFERON: What the agency did on that 

4 point is it simply said that if one construes it the way 

they would like to construe it, it would address the 


6 concern that Congress had for unnecessarily high 


7 settlement charges. It provided no empirical or 


8 experiential explanation for why that was the case. 


9 Didn't say that this type of practice was going on; 


didn't say that the interpretation was going to address 

11 it. Furthermore, it didn't deal with the fact that its 

12 interpretation also was going to sweep in price control 

13 and what effect that would be. 

14  In other words, the agency did not -- did 

not do the types of things that would cause this Court 

16 to defer to it. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In essence --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: When an agency is

1 particularly difficult, it seems -- it seems to us, to 


2 give the policy statement deference because in order to 


3 get to the policy statement, you have to assume the 


4 statute's ambiguous and then assume the regulation's 


ambiguous, and then you get to the -- the policy 


6 statement. It would be appropriate for this Court to 


7 impress upon the agency to be quite clear and to be 


8 quite solicitous of defendants' rights to make sure that 


9 it doesn't interpret this statute broader than what --


JUSTICE BREYER: Well, in 1992, they promulgated 

11 the regulation, which is the strongest argument I think 

12 on the other side. It's a strong argument. Have you --

13 has anybody looked at that notice-and-comment 

14 proceeding? Have you looked at it? 

MR. HEFFERON: We absolutely have, Your 

16 Honor. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If you have, do 

18 they go into this point, a point about -- the point 

19 being this is a kickback statute? It isn't an 

overcharge price regulation statute. Therefore, 

21 promulgating a regulation that makes it a crime, a 

22 Federal crime, to overcharge, which is what the 

23 regulation says, is outside the scope of the statute. 

24  Now, did someone make that argument? If so,

2  MR. HEFFERON: Justice Breyer, the 


3 regulatory history around this section, which is in 


4 regulation X, is actually quite interesting and quite 


favorable to -- to the reading the Fifth Circuit gave to 

6 the statute. The regulation does appear in 15a and 16a 

7 of the blue brief. 

8  When it was proposed, there was no 

9 discussion whatsoever that suggested that HUD was going 

to actually legislate or regulate about the statute. It 

11 merely -- at the time it was proposed, the regulation 

12 was going to be to recite section 2607(b), and that's 

13 it. It referred to the section as being a fee-splitting 

14 section. 

When the final rule was issued, there were 

16 three additional sentences added in this part of the 

17 regulation. There was no explanation for those three 

18 sentences, with the exception of HUD's general 

19 comment that it made other changes in this part of this 

regulation in order to address what services --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So, you would say -- is 

22 it --

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- correct you on that? 

2 Didn't HUD in that preamble say explicitly, "The 

3 Secretary, charged by statute with interpreting RESPA, 

4 interprets 18(b) to mean that two persons are not 

required"? It says that explicitly. 


6  MR. HEFFERON: It says that in the policy 


7 statement. That's correct. 


8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not in the policy 


9 statement; in the preamble to regulation X. 


MR. HEFFERON: In the --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- in 1996. I 

12 thought that was the final rulemaking you were talking 

13 about, because it didn't do rulemaking with respect to 

14 the policy statement. 

MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. The 1992 

16 regulation is entitled "No split of charges other than 

17 for actual services." And so, we read the regulation 

18 and believe HUD at the time read the regulation as, 

19 again, merely repeating the idea that this was -- this 

section was a limited section consistent with 

21 Congress's --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Is this a fair statement in 

23 your view -- and we'll hear theirs on rebuttal -- that in 

24 respect to the 1992 regulation, there is a sentence 

which says, "A charge by a person for which ... nominal

1 services are performed ... is an unearned fee and 

2 violates this section"? All right? I've ellipsed part. 

3  All right. Now, it says that. And that 

4 later on is taken as being: This statute is a -- to 

that extent, a price regulation statute. 


6  Is it fair to say that notice of such a 


7 regulation was not given? 


8  MR. HEFFERON: Absolutely correct, 


9 Justice Breyer. Notice was not given that that was 


going to be put into the regulation. And as this Court 

11 noted in Long Island Care at Home --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Was comment received in 

13 respect to that? 

14  MR. HEFFERON: I don't know whether -- I 

don't know comment was received or not. There was no 

16 indication in the final rule when it discussed comments 

17 that that issue was commented upon. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- you were you 

19 about to tell us what we said in Long Island Home. 

MR. HEFFERON: In Long Island Care at Home, 

21 the Court merely repeated in particular statements made 

22 in Chevron and Mead that, among other things, a 

23 regulation cannot get deference unless it -- if it is 

24 procedurally defective. And in this instance -- and it 

talked about the fact that a circumstance sometimes

1 arises when a notice of proposed rule doesn't give the 

2 public a notice that there's going to be something 

3 happening; so, there's no -- there's no comments given 

4 on a particular subject. 

And, in this instance, that's precisely what 

6 occurred, which is one reason why regulation X should 

7 not get special deference from this Court. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm not sure. 

9 Congress didn't say that HUD could only give 

interpretations through rules. It said it could give 

11 rules, pass rules and regulations, and give 

12 interpretations. So, what's the procedural defect in it 

13 just giving an interpretation? 

14  MR. HEFFERON: Well, there's not a 

procedural defect. The issue is really a question of 

16 how much deference to give the agency when it 

17 gives the interpretation. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We go back to whether 

19 the -- whether the policy -- whether the statute is 

ambiguous or not. 

21  MR. HEFFERON: Correct, as well as if it is, 

22 whether one gives Chevron deference. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what I'm trying to 

24 figure out is what's the deficiency in the policy 

statement that's independent of the ambiguity you rely

1 upon. 

2  MR. HEFFERON: What it is, is it is 

3 incomplete; it doesn't give a -- an effective statutory 

4 analysis. It doesn't really give any effective policy 

analysis. It is also inaccurate in that it attempts to 

6 recount that this is a -- a reading which is of long 

7 standing, when we believe -- and we cite in the -- in 

8 the red brief, we believe it's not. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it says it's 

longstanding for it. 

11  MR. HEFFERON: It attempts to explain why it 

12 is a finding -- a ruling of long standing, and we point 

13 out examples in the red brief where it isn't a finding of 

14 -- an interpretation of long standing. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- putting 

16 aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at 

17 least ambiguous, which of our cases stands for the 

18 proposition that whether or not we give Chevron 

19 deference depends on the thoroughness with which the 

agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an 

21 announcement of its interpretation? 

22  MR. HEFFERON: I believe that that was -- I 

23 believe that that was a factor that the Court looked at 

24 in Long Island Care at Home. But the -- the question 

for the Court in this instance is, should it give this

1 policy statement deference? If it doesn't qualify for 

2 Chevron deference, then the question is, does it have 

3 the power to persuade? Part of the power to persuade is 

4 its thoroughness; as Skidmore itself says, the detail in 

which it addresses things, how it addresses arguments on 

6 the other side, and what it says about those arguments. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you concede that if we 

8 give it Chevron deference, you lose? 

9  MR. HEFFERON: On the policy statement? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, on -- the case. If we 

11 give either the policy statement or the rule Chevron 

12 deference, you lose. Is that right? 

13  MR. HEFFERON: If the Court also then finds 

14 that it's deserving of Chevron deference, that's 

correct. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. You want to talk to 

17 that? 

18  MR. HEFFERON: Oh, sure.

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't give deference to 

21 interpretations that are beyond the limits of what the 

22 language will bear, do we? 

23  MR. HEFFERON: That -- that's absolutely

1 some kind of price control direct rate regulation regime 

2 when that was specifically rejected by Congress in 1974. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm a little 

4 confused. Under your interpretation or theirs, the 

court gets involved in determining whether fees, 

6 services were rendered. I mean, it's not as if your 

7 interpretation is going to keep the court out of that 

8 business. To be able to find a kickback, the court has 

9 to determine whether services were rendered or not. So, 

what's the difference in that inquiry when it involves a 

11 kickback and when it involves a -- a single provider? 

12  In a kickback situation, the court has to 

13 decide whether there was actually a service rendered 

14 that entitled the person to a percentage or not, 

correct? 

16  MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what's the 

18 difference between deciding that question and deciding 

19 that the -- the one individual provided a service? 

MR. HEFFERON: We agree that in each 

21 instance, the court would have to make a factual 

22 determination. But it comes back to what Congress 

23 intended in 1974. It specifically identified that it 

24 was attempting to address certain abusive practices that 

had arisen in some areas.

2 Justice Ginsburg said, unearned fees. Why would it 

3 matter to Congress? Give me a reason that it would 

4 matter to Congress whether the unearned fee was by one 

person in a dual relationship or a single person alone? 

6 The issue was unearned fees, rendering -- charging for a 

7 service you didn't render. That's what the whole 

8 kickback idea was about, correct? 

9  MR. HEFFERON: That's with respect to 

settlement service providers. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you complete your 

12 earlier answer? I was just waiting for your point, and 

13 it never came. 

14  MR. HEFFERON: On the question of whether or 

not to provide Chevron -- actually provide deference, if 

16 Chevron was applicable? If Chevron's applicable to the 

17 policy statement, the policy statement does not deserve 

18 Chevron deference because it is an irrational reading of 

19 the statute. The statute does not cover the kinds of 

direct regulation that the policy statement suggests 

21 that it covers. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hefferon, you might be 

23 right that we never get to Chevron deference here 

24 because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no 

ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything

1 about. But let's just assume that there is ambiguity on 

2 the statute, and the question is whether to provide this 

3 interpretation with Chevron deference. 

4  So, then, what's your argument for why there 

should be no Chevron deference to this interpretation, 

6 given that the statute under which this interpretation 

7 was promulgated refers identically to regulations and 

8 interpretations as something that HUD gets to do? 

9  MR. HEFFERON: Well, the statute does give 

HUD interpretive authority, but in this instance, what 

11 it is doing -- in fact, it's not quite clear what words 

12 it is interpreting in a way, trying -- trying to 

13 interpret the words and any vague aspects of the 

14 words -- is not a gap-filling situation that we're 

talking about. 

16  Congress reasonably in this statute, as well 

17 as in the Truth in Lending Act, provided that the agency 

18 would have interpretive authority. A lot of what this 

19 agency was going to be doing with respect to this 

statute is filling a lot of gaps. It's going to create 

21 the special information booklet. It's going to create 

22 these forms that I've referred to. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't any agency have

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have to be 

7 specifically conferred? 

8  MR. HEFFERON: I don't believe it has to be 

9 specifically conferred. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it at all increased when 

11 it's specifically conferred? 

12  MR. HEFFERON: I don't believe the Court's 

13 precedents suggest that it's increased if Congress has 

14 gone the next step to actually say you have the 

authority to interpret the statute. The question is, 

16 for purposes of -- of deference, is what is the 

17 question? The question that HUD sometimes -- if HUD is 

18 deciding what form should go on the form, then that's 

19 interstitial lawmaking, and that's certainly something 

that might get more deference than if the question is 

21 interpreting the legal effect of these words that appear 

22 in 2607(b). It is not -- it's not a definition; they're 

23 not purporting to apply a definition; they're not 

24 filling a gap. 

And so, this is -- this is not where you

1 would look towards a Chevron deference. But Congress is 


2 not expecting that -- that HUD would -- after it has 


3 decided not to allow direct regulation of charges, that 


4 HUD would nonetheless try to do it through the back door 


through the interpretative --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Now that's just a way of saying 

8 that there's no ambiguity here. But I was suggesting 

9 that if there is ambiguity here, I -- at least I have 

not found a reason not to give HUD deference in this 

11 situation. I mean, you say they didn't do a very good 

12 job. But we don't usually grade agencies like that, and 

13 say, well, you didn't do a very good job; so, you're not 

14 entitled to Chevron deference. 

MR. HEFFERON: The nature of the question 

16 that HUD's addressing is interpreting the legal --

17 basically giving a legal interpretation of the statute. 

18 It doesn't really purport to give a policy 

19 interpretation of the statute because it simply refers 

to – it is a passing reference. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: We give deference to legal 

22 interpretations all the time. 

23  MR. HEFFERON: But it is a -- it is -- the 

24 question of what the Congress intended, whether --

whether they intended HUD to be giving the

1 interpretation or filling a gap, or whether it was 

2 simply giving guidance. It --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I have no idea. What --

4 I'm supposed to psychoanalyze Congress in every Chevron 

case? 

6  MR. HEFFERON: HUD issued the policy 

7 statement as a guidance document. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- no, no. That's a 

9 good question, and your problem is different people feel 

differently about the answer. So, the -- which is why 

11 from my perspective --- and perhaps you're only 

12 answering a question for me and no one else has it --

13 but I would be pretty interested to know whether when 

14 you looked at the legislative history of this, what you 

discovered was a lot of complaints about consumers 

16 paying for things they didn't get, period. Which favors 

17 HUD's interpretation. 

18  Or whether you see a whole long list of 

19 complaints about consumers having to pay referral fees, 

where that's just one person taking advantage of another 

21 person's business. I would -- I think it would be 

22 relevant. And then if you've looked at all this, which 

23 you could tell me you haven't -- I will try to -- but 

24 what do you find? 

MR. HEFFERON: Your Honor, you actually 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 don't find either. What you find is complaints about 

2 providers doing things between each other and a 

3 recognition that, ultimately, the consumers perhaps 

4 unknowingly are being harmed by that. The Senate Report 

and House Report both described that in great detail. 

6 We're talking about rebates, commissions, unearned 

7 commissions, and kickbacks and referral fees. 

8  That's what Congress identified in 2601 as 

9 the "certain abusive practices" that had arisen in some 

areas of the country. This was not meant to be a 

11 panacea. State law remedies stayed in place. And, in 

12 fact, if you look at most of the court of appeals cases 

13 that give rise to these -- this circuit split, they all 

14 also bring a claim under State law, whether it's fraud 

or contract or unjust enrichment. 

16  That only drives the point home that it's 

17 not irrational for Congress to have decided, when it was 

18 taking a step into this area for the first time, to 

19 actually legislate an important area, but not go all the 

way, and instead leave other remedies in place. And 

21 that's what the proper reading of this statute should 

22 be. That's the reading the Fifth Circuit gave it as 

23 well. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you give a complete 

answer to the question what does (b) cover that (a) does 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 not? So, one suggestion that's made is, well, you 


2 didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do with is 


3 kickbacks, then all you need is (a), and there's no 


4 necessity for (b). You said one thing is contract, 


proving a contract, and not -- is there anything else? 

6  MR. HEFFERON: Thank you, Justice Ginsburg. 

7 Actually, I didn't give a complete answer now that I 

8 recall. It does cover -- the best example is the 

9 classic reason why the -- this section was put in, in 

the first place, why it was proposed; and that would be 

11 an unearned commission. Title insurance companies at 

12 the time would enter into commission agreements with 

13 agents where the agent would get 10 percent of the title 

14 premium; in exchange, the agent would do the title work. 

In a situation -- if the title agent in fact 

16 didn't do the title work, it would be receiving an 

17 unearned fee, that is, part of the title insurance 

18 commission, for no work. And that, however, would not 

19 normally be covered under (a) because the agreement, the 

underlying agreement to give the commission was not to 

21 refer business; it was actually to do some of the title 

22 work. 

23  So, that situation would be covered, but 

24 most situations, as I think all parties agree, this 

statute is -- is typically a kickback. It just simply 

53

1 removes the agreement requirement. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: And under -- under (b), 

3 there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay -- under 

4 (b) there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay the 

title company for no work. It's just if it's a -- if 

6 it's a refinancing and the title company did the same 

7 title search, you know, 2 years ago, it says, heck, I'm 

8 not going to do it again, but it still gets the 10 

9 percent, right? 

MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though there's no 

12 agreement to pay it for no work. 

13  MR. HEFFERON: That's correct. 

14  So, in sum, the elements of the Fifth 

Circuit's interpretation are all supportive of our view, 

16 that is, that the language, the structure, the context, 

17 and the history of this statute all show that it is 

18 important, but it's limited; and it does not address 

19 direct charges made by lenders. And the Fifth Circuit 

had it right. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Could you go 

22 back to Justice Scalia's question? If a -- if a bank 

23 has an appraisal fee from the past and decides I don't 

24 need a new one, but still charges you for an appraisal 

fee, would that violate the statute?

1  MR. HEFFERON: If the -- I think the 

2 question was in the context of the title agent doing the 

3 title work. If an appraiser was charging -- was 

4 charging the consumer directly and not doing the work, 

it would not violate the statute, again, because the 

6 statute requires two providers. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or if the bank charged 

8 you for a title search that it did? 

9  MR. HEFFERON: If -- if the bank arranged --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it had one already? 

11  MR. HEFFERON: If the bank arranged for a 

12 title searcher to do title work, and then the bank 

13 charged the consumer, and then it split the charge with 

14 the title searcher --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. So, going back 

16 to Justice Scalia's question, if the provider decides 

17 I'm going to use what I had before, I'm not going to 

18 redo the work, but still charges you a second time, 

19 they're not liable under your reading of the statute? 

MR. HEFFERON: Not under 2607(b) and perhaps 

21 under --

13  Justice Breyer, you had asked why Congress 

14 would engage in a statute that gets at overcharges and 

has a rate regulation kind of thing, which is very 

16 unusual, and I agree it's unusual. That's a reason to 

17 read this statute not to do that, to only get at truly 

18 unearned fees, which are the equivalent of fraudulent 

19 fees, which the law does forbid pervasively. In this 

case, Congress --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Once you say that, you're 

22 -- you're outside the reg. I mean, when you read the 

23 reg and the policy statement, it's pretty clear what 

24 they are thinking of. 

MR. RUSSELL: No, to be --

4  MR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think that's 

correct. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No? 

7  MR. RUSSELL: I think that there was a 

8 two-step analysis. The first step is they decided that 

9 split fees are not the only thing that the statute gets 

at. And then -- but this -- an unsplit fee still has to 

11 be unearned, and they had a separate interpretation of 

12 what it means for a fee to be unearned. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where do you get --

14  MR. RUSSELL: At any rate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that in the

17 and --

19 they enumerate the different kinds of unearned fees. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's right here. It's on 

21 -- it's on 53,057. And what they're explaining is that, 

22 and they're talking about a third situation, and they 

23 say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a 

24 consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the 

reasonable value of the services performed by that

1 provider. 

2  MR. RUSSELL: That's correct. They are --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: And so, if it exceeds the 

4 reasonable value of the services performed by that 

provider, you have to say what is the reasonable value 

6 of the services performed by that provider. And that 

7 involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair 

8 or just price for this particular service. 

9  MR. RUSSELL: I'm not -- I'm not disagreeing 

with you about that. They list four different -- or 

11 three or four different kinds of charges that could be 

12 unearned. You don't have to agree with them with 

13 respect to each of those things, about --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but what I'm doing 

there, you see, is now I'm trying to make sense out of 

16 an agency interpretation which is other than what it 

17 says, where what they're trying to do is to change the 

18 nature of the statute from a kickback statute into a 

19 statute that protects consumers across the board from 

paying for things they don't get. 

21  MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's where I'm sort 

23 of interested in what the legislative history said, et 

24 cetera, et cetera. It's much more complicated than I 

thought coming in. I have to look at a lot of things.

1  MR. RUSSELL: Sure. What Congress said its 

2 purpose was, was to get at abusive practices that 

3 unnecessarily increase the costs of settlement. What --

4 the legislative history was focused on kickbacks, but 

there were examples in the HUD/VA report, at page 16 of 

6 that report, and in the Washington Post articles about 

7 markups that are a form of undivided, unearned fee. 

8  Congress knew -- subsequent to the passage 

9 of this statute, HUD has frequently found and reported 

to Congress incidents of unearned fees, including those 

11 involving loan discount fees. And the States -- 21 

12 States have filed a brief in this case telling you that 

13 there is a pervasive problem with settlement closings 

14 included padded charges for things that were never 

performed. 

16  With respect to the agency's interpretation, 

17 I would point you particularly to this 1996 rulemaking, 

18 where the agency withdrew an exemption for certain 

19 payments between consumers and providers for the use of 

a particular kind of computer service. That exemption 

21 would have been unnecessary had HUD thought, as Quicken 

22 does, that the statute only regulates transactions 

23 between providers. 

24  And in withdrawing that exemption, HUD 

explained in quite a lot of detail that it rejected

1 specifically that -- the split fee requirement. And so, 

2 I don't think there's any question that they've grappled 

3 with this question and that they've explained why they 

4 think that split fees aren't covered. 

The question ultimately is whether that's a 

6 reasonable conclusion in light of the language of this 

7 statute --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: And then part of that is --

9 you might want to say something about the other part. I 

mean, the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is 

11 to prevent agencies, seeing the supreme importance of 

12 their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and 

13 in particular transforming into a criminal law something 

14 that really wasn't much there. 

Now, procedure is important in that. And 

16 that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether 

17 they gave notice to the public: Dear public, we are 

18 thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute. 

19  MR. RUSSELL: They gave --

JUSTICE BREYER: We would like to hear what 

21 you think about that. 

22  MR. RUSSELL: They gave the public more 

23 notice than the Court found sufficient in Long Island 

24 Care at Home, which is they -- they told the public this 

provision is at issue; we're going to issue an

1 interpretation about it. And they ultimately did. In 

2 Long Island Care, they did the opposite of what they had 

3 proposed to do, and this Court said that was enough. In 

4 this case, and even in 1996, they received comments with 

respect to the case law that said that only splits are 

6 required, and they said we disagree.
