Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, and Case 

6 11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS. 

7  Mr. Clement. 

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  If the individual mandate is 

13 unconstitutional, then the rest of the Act cannot stand. 

14 As Congress found and the Federal Government concedes, 

the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions of 

16 the Act cannot stand without the individual mandate. 

17 Congress found that the individual mandate was essential 

18 to their operation. 

19  And not only can guaranteed issue and 

community rating not stand, not operate in the manner 

21 that Congress intended, they would actually counteract 

22 Congress's basic goal of providing patient protection 

23 but also affordable care. 

24  You can -- if you do not have the individual 

mandate to force people into the market, then community

1 rating and guaranteed issue will cause the cost of
 

2 premiums to skyrocket. We can debate the order of
 

3 magnitude of that, but we can't debate that the
 

4 direction will be upward. We also can't debate --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that may well 

6 be true. The economists are going back and forth on 

7 that issue, and the figures vary from up 10 percent to 

8 up 30. We're not in the habit of doing the legislative 

9 findings.

 What we do know is that for those States 

11 that found prices increasing, that they found various 

12 solutions to that. In one instance -- and we might or 

13 may not say that it's unconstitutional -- Massachusetts 

14 passed the mandatory coverage provision. But others 

adjusted some of the other provisions. 

16  Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in 

17 fact the economists prove -- some of the economists 

18 prove right that prices will spiral? What's wrong with 

19 leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should 

be fixing this, not us? 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of questions --

22 a couple of responses, Justice Sotomayor. First of all, 

23 I think that it's very relevant here that Congress had 

24 before it as examples some of the States that had tried 

to impose guaranteed issue and community rating, and did 

5

Official 

1 not impose an individual mandate. And Congress rejected 

2 that model. So, your question is quite right in saying 

3 that it's not impossible to have guaranteed issue and 

4 community rating without an individual mandate. But 

it's a model that Congress looked at and specifically 

6 rejected. 

7  And then, of course, there's Congress's own 

8 finding, and their finding, of course -- this is finding 

9 (i), which is 43a of the Government's brief, in the 

appendix. Congress specifically found that having the 

11 individual mandate is essential to the operation of 

12 guaranteed issue and community rating. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's all it said it 

14 was essential to. I mean, I'm looking at it. The 

exchanges. The State exchanges are information-

16 gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various 

17 policies actually mean. And that has proven to be a 

18 cost saver in many of the States who have tried it. So, 

19 why should we be striking down a cost saver --

MR. CLEMENT: Well --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when, if what your 

22 argument is -- was that Congress was concerned about 

23 costs rising? 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should we assume

1 they wouldn't have passed an information --

2  MR. CLEMENT: I think a couple of things. 

3 One, you get -- I mean, I would think you'd sort of have 

4 to take the bitter with the sweet. And if Congress --

if we're going to look at Congress's goal of providing 

6 patient protection but also affordable care, we can't --

7 I don't think it works to just take the things that save 

8 money and cut out the things that are going to make 

9 premiums more expensive. But at a minimum --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think on the bottom 

11 line, is why don't we let Congress fix it? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Well, let me answer the bottom 

13 line question, which is, no matter what you do in this 

14 case, at some point there's going to be -- if you strike 

down the mandate, there's going to be something for 

16 Congress to do. The question is really what task do you 

17 want to give Congress? Do you want to give Congress the 

18 task of fixing the statute after something has been 

19 taken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do 

you want to give Congress the task of fixing health 

21 care? And I think it would be better in this 

22 situation --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're not taking -- if 

24 we strike down one provision, we're not taking that 

power away from Congress. Congress could look at it 

7

1 without the mandatory coverage provision and say this 

2 model doesn't work; let's start from the beginning. Or 

3 it could choose to fix what it has. We're not declaring 

4 -- one portion doesn't force Congress into any path.

 MR. CLEMENT: And, of course, that's right, 

6 Justice Sotomayor, and no matter what you do here, 

7 Congress will have the options available. So, if you --

8 if you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress 

9 could say the next day, well, that's the last thing we 

ever wanted to do so we are going to strike down the 

11 rest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the 

12 problem. So, whatever you do, Congress is going to have 

13 options. The question is --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: There's such a thing as 

legislative inertia, isn't there? 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Well, that's exactly --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --

18  MR. CLEMENT: -- what I was going to say, 

19 Justice Scalia, which is I think the question for this 

Court is -- we all recognize there's legislative 

21 inertia. And then the question is what's the best 

22 result in light of that reality? 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not suggesting 

24 that we should take on more power to the Court?

 MR. CLEMENT: No, I --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because Congress would 

2 choose to take one path rather than another. That's 

3 sort of taking onto the Court more power than one, I 

4 think, would want.

 MR. CLEMENT: And I agree. We're simply 

6 asking this Court to take on, straight on, the idea of 

7 the basic remedial inquiry into severability which looks 

8 to the intent of the Congress --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I wanted to ask you 

about that. Why do we look to the -- are you sure we 

11 look to the intent of the Congress? I thought that, you 

12 know, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will 

13 -- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and 

14 we ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the 

remaining provisions just won't work. Now, how can you 

16 square that reality with the proposition that what we're 

17 looking for here is what would this Congress have 

18 wanted? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Well, two responses, 

Justice Scalia: We can look at this Court's cases on 

21 severability, and they all formulate the test a little 

22 bit differently. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, they sure do. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: But every one of them talks 

about congressional intent. But here's the -- there's

Official 

1 the other answer --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, but is it 

3 right? 

4  MR. CLEMENT: It is right. And here's how I 

would answer your question, which is, when Congress 

6 includes a severability clause, it's addressing the 

7 issue in the abstract. It doesn't say, no matter which 

8 provisions you strike down, we absolutely, positively 

9 want what's left.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. The consequence 

11 of your proposition, would Congress have enacted it 

12 without this provision, okay, that's the consequence. 

13 That would mean that if we struck down nothing in this 

14 legislation but the -- what is it called -- the "Corn 

Husker kickback," okay, we find that to violate the 

16 constitutional proscription of venality, okay? 

17  (Laughter.) 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: When we strike that down, 

19 it's clear that Congress would not have passed it 

without that. It was -- it was the means of getting the 

21 last necessary vote in the Senate. And you're telling 

22 us that the whole statute would fall because the 

23 Cornhusker kickback is bad. That can't be right. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

it can be, which is to say that the basic proposition, 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that it's congressional intent that governs. Now, 

2 everybody on this Court has a slightly different way of 

3 divining legislative intent. And I would suggest the 

4 one common ground among every member of this Court, as I 

understand it, is you start with the text. Everybody 

6 can agree with that. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Clement, let's start 

8 with the text. And you suggest, and I think that there 

9 is -- this is right, that there is a textual basis for 

saying that the guarantee-issue and the community-rating 

11 provisions are tied to the mandate. And you -- you 

12 pointed to where that was in the findings. 

13  Is there a textual basis for anything else? 

14 Because I've been unable to find one. It seems to me 

that if you look at the text, the sharp dividing line is 

16 between guarantee issue, community ratings, on the one 

17 hand; everything else, on the other. 

18  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I'd be 

19 delighted to take you through my view of the text and 

why there are other things that have to fall. 

21  The first place I'd ask you to look is 

22 Finding (J), which is on the same page, 43a. And as I 

23 read that, that's a finding that the individual mandate 

24 is essential to the operation of the exchanges.

 But there are other links between guaranteed 

11

5

Official 

1 issue and community rating and the exchanges. And 

2 there, I think, it's just the way that the exchanges are 

3 supposed to work, and the text makes this clear, is 

4 they're supposed to provide a market where people can 

compare community-rated insurance. That's what makes 

6 the exchanges function. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Although the exchanges 

8 function perfectly well in Utah, where there is no 

9 mandate. They function differently, but they function. 

And the question is always, does Congress want half a 

11 loaf? Is half a loaf better than no loaf? And on 

12 something like the exchanges, it seems to me a perfect 

13 example where half a loaf is better than no loaf. The 

14 exchanges will do something. They won't do everything 

that Congress envisioned. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

17 there are situations where half a loaf is actually 

18 worse, and I want to address that. But before I -- more 

19 broadly -- but before I do that, if I can stick with 

just the exchanges. 

21  I do think the question that this Court is 

22 supposed to ask is not just whether they can limp along 

23 and they can operate independently, but whether they 

24 operate in the manner that Congress intended. And 

that's where I think the exchanges really fall down, 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 because the vision of the exchanges was that if you got 

2 out of this current situation where health insurance is 

3 basically individualized priced based on individualized 

4 underwriting and you provide community rating, then it's 

going to be very easy for people to see, okay, well, 

6 this is a silver policy, and this is a bronze policy, 

7 and this is a gold policy. And we can -- you know, I 

8 can just pick which insurer provides what I think is 

9 going to be the best service based on those comparable 

provisions. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, you just said 

12 something which you say a lot in your brief. You say 

13 the question is the manner in which it would have 

14 operated. And I think that that's not consistent with 

our cases. And I guess the best example would be 

16 Booker, where we decided not to sever provisions, 

17 notwithstanding that the sentencing guidelines clearly 

18 operate in a different manner now than they did when 

19 Congress passed them. They operate as advisory rather 

than mandatory. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I 

22 actually think Booker supports our point as well, 

23 because there are two aspects of the remedial holding of 

24 Booker. And the first part of it, which I think 

actually very much supports our point is where the 

13

20

25

Official 

1 majority rejects the approach of the dissent, which 

2 actually would have required nothing in the statute to 

3 have been struck, not a single word. 

4  But, nonetheless, this Court said, boy, if 

you do that, then all of the sentencing is basically 

6 going to be done by a combination of the juries and the 

7 prosecutors, and the judges are going to be cut out. 

8 And the Court said the one thing we know is that's not 

9 the manner in which Congress thought that this should 

operate. 

11  Now, later they make a different judgment 

12 about the -- which particular provisions to cut out. 

13 But I do think Booker is consistent with this way of 

14 looking at it. It's certainly consistent with Brock, 

the opinion that we rely on, because there the Court 

16 only reached that part of the opinion after they had 

17 already found that the must-hire provision operated 

18 functionally independent from the legislative veto. 

19 So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, there are so 

21 many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay. I 

22 think you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it 

23 -- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to 

24 the Black Lung benefits. Why make Congress redo those? 

I mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 did is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes, 

2 there are many things in here that have nothing to do, 

3 frankly, with the affordable health care, and there are 

4 some that we think it's better to let Congress to decide 

whether it wants them in or out. 

6  So, why should we say it's a choice between 

7 a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting, 

8 or a salvage job? And the more conservative approach 

9 would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, two 

11 kinds of responses to that: One, I do think there are 

12 some provisions that I would identify as being at the 

13 periphery of this statute, and I'll admit that the case 

14 for severing those is perhaps the strongest.

 But I do think it's fundamentally different, 

16 because if we were in here arguing that some provision 

17 on the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars 

18 Act or some of the provisions that you've mentioned, was 

19 unconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you 

wouldn't even think hard about severability. 

21  What makes this different is that the 

22 provisions that have constitutional difficulties or are 

23 tied at the hip to those provisions that have the 

24 constitutional difficulty are the very heart of this 

Act. And then if you look at how they are textually 

15

Official 

1 interconnected with the exchanges, which are then 

2 connected to the tax credits, which are also connected 

3 to the employer mandates, which is also connected to 

4 some of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to 

Medicaid, if you follow that through what you end up 

6 with at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow 

7 shell. And at that point, I think there is a strong 

8 argument for not -- I mean, we can't possibly think that 

9 Congress would have passed that hollow shell without the 

heart of the Act. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it would 

12 have -- it would have passed parts of the hollow shell. 

13 I mean, a lot of this is reauthorization of 

14 appropriations that have been reauthorized for the 

previous 5 or 10 years, and it was just more convenient 

16 for Congress to throw it in, in the middle of the 

17 2700 pages than to do it separately. I mean, can you 

18 really suggest -- I mean, they cite the Black Lung 

19 Benefits Act, and those have nothing to do with any of 

the things we're talking about. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

22 know, they tried to make them germane. But I'm not here 

23 to tell you that, you know -- some of their -- surely, 

24 there are provisions that are just looking for the next 

legislative vehicle that's going to make it across the

Official 

1 finish line, and somebody's going to attach it to 

2 anything that's moving. I mean, I'll admit that. 

3  But the question is -- when everything else 

4 from the center of the Act is interconnected and has to 

go, if you follow me that far, then the question is 

6 would you keep this hollowed-out shell? 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but it's not --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm still not sure, 

9 what is the test -- and this was a colloquy you had with 

Justice Scalia with the Cornhusker hypothetical. I need 

11 to know what standard you're asking me to apply. Is it 

12 whether as a rational matter the separate parts could 

13 still function, or does it focus on the intent of the 

14 Congress?

 If you -- suppose you had party A wants 

16 proposal number 1; party B wants proposal number 2. 

17 Completely unrelated. One is airline rates; the other 

18 is milk regulation. And we -- and they decide them 

19 together. The procedural rules are these have to be 

voted on as one. They are both passed. Then one is 

21 declared unconstitutional. The other can operate 

22 completely independently. Now, we know that Congress 

23 would not have intended to pass one without the other. 

24 Is that the end of it, or is there some different test? 

Because we don't want to go into legislative history,

1 that's intrusive, so we ask whether or not an objective 

2 -- as an objective rational matter, one could function 

3 without -- I still don't know what the test is that 

4 we're supposed to apply. And this is the same question 

as Justice Scalia asked. Could you give me some help on 

6 that? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. Justice Kennedy, the 

8 reality is I think this Court's opinions have at various 

9 times applied both strains of the analysis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And which one -- and what 

11 test do you suggest that we follow if we want to clarify 

12 our jurisprudence? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: I'm -- I'm a big believer in 

14 objective tests, Justice Kennedy. I'd be perfectly 

happy with you to apply a more textually based objective 

16 approach. I think there are certain Justices that are 

17 more inclined to take more of a peek at legislative 

18 history, and I think if you look at the legislative 

19 history of this, it would only fortify the conclusion 

that you would reach from a very objective textual 

21 inquiry. But I am happy to focus the Court on the 

22 objective textual inquiry --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't 

24 understand --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that objective test is

1 what? 

2  MR. CLEMENT: It is whether the statute can 

3 operate in the manner that Congress -- that Congress 

4 intended. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No statute can do that, 

6 because once we chop off a piece of it, by definition, 

7 it's not the statute Congress passed. So, it has to be 

8 something more than that. 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, every one 

of your cases, if you have a formulation for 

11 severability, if you interpret it woodenly, it becomes 

12 tautological. And Justice Blackmun addressed this in 

13 footnote 7 of the Brock opinion that we rely on, where 

14 he says: Of course, it's not just -- you know, it 

doesn't operate exactly in the manner because it doesn't 

16 have all the pieces, but you still make an inquiry as to 

17 whether -- I mean, when Congress links two provisions 

18 together and one really won't work without the other --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what is wrong with 

the presumption that our law says, which is we presume 

21 that Congress would want to sever? Wouldn't that be the 

22 simplest, most objective test? Going past what 

23 Justice Scalia says we have done, okay, get rid of 

24 legislative intent altogether, which some of our 

colleagues in other contexts have promoted, and just

4  You still haven't asked -- answered me why 

in a democracy structured like ours, where each branch 

6 does different things, why we should involve the Court 

7 in making the legislative judgment? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, let me try 

9 to answer the specific question and then answer the big 

picture question. The specific question is -- I mean, 

11 you could do that. You could adopt a new rule now that 

12 basically says, look, we've sever --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not a new rule. We 

14 presume. We've rebutted the presumption in some 

cases --

16  MR. CLEMENT: Right. But --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but some would call 

18 that judicial action. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: I think in fairness, though, 

Justice Sotomayor, to get to the point you're wanting to 

21 get to, you'd have to ratchet up that presumption a 

22 couple of ticks on the scale, but -- and because the one 

23 thing --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what's wrong with 

that?

1  MR. CLEMENT: Well, one thing that's wrong 

2 with that, which is still at a smaller level, is that's 

3 inconsistent with virtually every statement in every one 

4 of your severability opinions, which all talk about 

congressional intent. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it's not inconsistent 

7 with our practice, right, Mr. Clement? I mean, you have 

8 to go back decades and decades and decades, and I'm not 

9 sure even then you could find a piece of legislation 

that we refused to sever for this reason. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: I don't think that's right, 

12 Justice Kagan. I mean, I think there are more recent 

13 examples. A great example I think, which sort of proves 

14 and maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a 

case that involves a State statute, not a Federal 

16 statute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is 

17 Randall v. Sorrell, where this Court struck down various 

18 provisions of the Vermont campaign finance law. But 

19 there were other contribution provisions that were not 

touched by the theory that the Court used to strike down 

21 the contribution limits. But this Court at the end of 

22 the opinion said, you know, there's no way to think that 

23 the Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful 

24 of provisions there on the contribution side. So, we'll 

strike down the whole thing.

1  And if I could make the broader point, I 

2 mean, I think the reason it makes sense in a democracy 

3 with separation of powers to in some cases sever the 

4 whole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse. 

And a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley. In 

6 Buckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in 

7 a coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and 

8 closely related expenditures. 

9  This Court struck down the ban on 

expenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and 

11 for four decades Congress has tried to fix what's left 

12 of the statute, largely unsuccessfully; whereas it would 

13 have I think worked much better from a democratic and 

14 separation of powers standpoint if the Court would have 

said: Look, expenditures are -- you can't limit 

16 expenditures under the Constitution. The contribution 

17 provision is joined at the hip. Give Congress a chance 

18 to actually fix the problem, not just --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you one question, 

21 which is a practical question? I take as a given your 

22 answer to Justice Kennedy. You're saying let's look at 

23 it objectively and say would Congress have intended 

24 this, okay? This is the mandate in the community --

this is Titles I and II, the mandate, the community,

1 pre-existing condition, okay? Here's the rest of it, 

2 you know, and when I look through the rest of it, I have 

3 all kinds of stuff in there. And I haven't read every 

4 word of that, I promise. All right. 

I mean, as you pointed out, there's biosimilarity, 

6 there's breast feeding, there's promoting nurses and 

7 doctors to serve underserved areas, there's the CLASS 

8 Act, et cetera. 

9  What do you suggest we do? I mean, should 

we appoint a special master with an instruction? Should 

11 we go back to the district court? You haven't argued 

12 most of these. As I hear you now, you're pretty close 

13 to the SG. I mean, you'd like it all struck down, but 

14 if we are supposed to apply the objective test, I don't 

know if you differ very much. 

16  So, what do you propose that we do other 

17 than spend a year reading all this and have you argue 

18 all of it? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Right. What I would propose 

is the following, Justice Breyer, is you follow the 

21 argument this far and then you ask yourself whether what 

22 you have left is a hollowed-out shell or whether you 

23 have --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I would say the Breast 

Feeding Act, the -- getting doctors to serve underserved

1 areas, the biosimilar thing and drug regulation, the 

2 CLASS Act -- those have nothing to do with the stuff 

3 that we've been talking about yesterday and the day 

4 before, okay?

 So, if you tell me at that level, I'd say, 

6 sure, they have nothing to do with it; they could stand 

7 on their own. The Indian thing, about helping the 

8 underserved Native Americans -- all that stuff has 

9 nothing to do with it. Black lung disease, nothing to 

do with it. Okay? 

11  So, that's -- you know what you have there? 

12 A total off-the-cuff impression. So, that's why I'm 

13 asking you what should I do? 

14  MR. CLEMENT: What you should do is let me 

say the following, which is follow me this far, which is 

16 the mandatory, individual mandate is tied, as the 

17 Government suggests, to guaranteed issue and community 

18 rating, but the individual mandate, guaranteed issue, 

19 and community rating together are the heart of this Act. 

They -- they're what make the exchanges work. 

21  The exchanges in turn are critical to the 

22 tax credits, because the amount of the tax credit is key 

23 to the amount of the policy price on the exchange. The 

24 exchanges are also key to the employer mandate, because 

the employer mandate becomes imposed on an employer if

1 one of the employees gets insurance on the exchanges. 

2  But it doesn't stop there. Look at the 

3 Medicare provision for DSH hospitals, okay? These are 

4 hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of the 

needy. This isn't in Title I. It's in the other part 

6 that you had in your other hand. But it doesn't work 

7 without the mandate, community rating, and guaranteed 

8 issue. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, can I ask you this, 

Mr. Clement? 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Sure. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: If -- what would your 

13 fallback position be if we don't accept the proposition 

14 that if the mandate is declared unconstitutional, the 

rest of the Act, every single provision, has to fall? 

16 Other proposed -- other dispositions have been proposed. 

17 There's the Solicitor General's disposition, the 

18 recommended disposition to strike down the 

19 guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions. One 

of the -- one amicus says strike down all of Title I; 

21 another says strike down all of Title I and Title II. 

22  What -- what would you suggest? 

23  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think what I 

24 would suggest, Justice Alito -- I don't want to be 

unresponsive -- is that you sort of follow the argument

2 falls. And then I guess my fallback would be if what's 

3 left is a hollowed-out shell, you could just leave that 

4 standing.

 If you want a sort of practical answer, I 

6 mean, I do think you could just -- you know, you could 

7 use Justice Breyer's off-the-cuff as a starting point 

8 and basically say, you know, Title I and a handful of 

9 related provisions that are very closely related to that 

are really the heart of the Act. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

12 doesn't --

other, but at a certain point -- I'm sorry,

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your certain 

18 point. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: At a certain point, I just 

think that, you know, the better answer might be to say 

21 we've struck the heart of this Act; let's just give 

22 Congress a clean slate. If it's so easy to have that 

23 other big volume get re-enacted, they can do it in a 

24 couple of days. It won't be a big deal. If it's not,

4 suspect that it won't be easy. Because I rather suspect 

that if you actually dug into that, there'd be something 

6 that was quite controversial in there and couldn't be 

7 passed quickly --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reality --

9  MR. CLEMENT: -- and that's our whole point.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reality of the 

11 passage -- I mean, this was a piece of legislation 

12 which, there was -- had to be a concerted effort to 

13 gather enough votes so that it could be passed. And I 

14 suspect with a lot of these miscellaneous provisions 

that Justice Breyer was talking about, that was the 

16 price of a vote: Put in the Indian health care 

17 provision and I will vote for the other 2700 pages. Put 

18 in the black lung provision, and I'll go along with it. 

19  That's why all -- many of these provisions, 

I think, were put in, not because they were 

21 unobjectionable. So, presumably, what Congress would 

22 have done is they wouldn't have been able to put 

23 together, cobble together the votes to get it through.

3 would make, as an exercise of your own judgment, the 

4 judgment that once you've gotten rid of the core 

provisions of this Act, that you would then decide to 

6 let the periphery fall with it. 

7  But if you want to keep the periphery, 

8 that's fine. What I think is important, though, as to 

9 the core provisions of the Act, which aren't just the 

mandate, community rating, and guaranteed issue, but 

11 include the exchanges, the tax credit, Medicare, and 

12 Medicaid -- as to all of that, I think you do want to 

13 strike it all down to avoid a redux of Buckley.

18  ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

19  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

21 and may it please the Court: 

22  There should be no occasion for the Court in 

23 this case to consider issues of severability, because, 

24 as we argue, the -- the minimum coverage provision is 

fully consistent with Article I of the Constitution.

1 But if the Court were to conclude otherwise, it should 

2 reject Petitioners' sweeping proposition that the entire 

3 Act must fall if this one provision is held 

4 unconstitutional.

 As an initial matter, we believe the Court 

6 should not even consider that question. The vast 

7 majority of the provisions of this Act do not even apply 

8 to the Petitioners, but instead apply to millions of 

9 citizens and businesses who are not before the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does your 

11 proposal actually work? Your idea is that, well, they 

12 can take care of it themselves later. I mean, do you 

13 contemplate them bringing litigation and saying -- I 

14 guess the insurers would be the most obvious ones --

without -- without the mandate, the whole thing falls 

16 apart, and we're going to bear a greater cost, and so 

17 the rest of the law should be struck down. 

18  And that's a whole other line of litigation? 

19  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think the 

continuing validity of any particular provision would 

21 arise in litigation that would otherwise arise under 

22 that provision by parties who are actually --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what cause of 

24 action is it? I've never heard of a severability cause 

of action.

25

Official 

1  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in the first place, I 

2 don't -- the point isn't that there has to be an 

3 affirmative cause of action to decide this. You 

4 could -- for example, to use the Medicare reimbursement 

issues, one of the things this Act does is change
 

6 Medicare reimbursement rates. Well, the place where
 

7 someone adjudicates the validity of Medicare
 

8 reimbursement rates is through the special statutory
 

9 review procedure for that.


 And the same thing is true of the 

11 Anti-Injunction Act --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, there are 

13 some provisions which nobody would have standing to 

14 challenge. If the provision is simply an expenditure of 

Federal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the 

16 taxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing. That 

17 -- that just continues. Even though it is -- it should 

18 -- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down 

19 that it ought to go as well. But, nonetheless, that has 

to continue because there's nobody in the world that can 

21 challenge it. 

22  Can that possibly be the law? 

23  MR. KNEEDLER: I think that proves our 

24 point, Justice Scalia. This Court has repeatedly said 

that just because there's -- no one may have standing to 

30

1 challenge -- and particularly like tax credits or taxes 

2 which are challenged only after going through the 

3 Anti-Injunction Act, just because no one has standing 

4 doesn't mean someone must.

 But beyond that --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But those are provisions
 

7 that have been legitimately enacted. The whole issue
 

8 here is whether these related provisions have been
 

9 legitimately enacted or whether they are so closely
 

allied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional 

11 that they also have not been legitimately enacted. 

12  You can't compare that to -- to cases 

13 dealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is 

14 constitutional.

 MR. KNEEDLER: This case is directly 

16 parallel to the Printz case, in our view. In that case, 

17 the Court struck down several provisions of the Brady 

18 Act but went on to say it had no business addressing the 

19 severability of other provisions that did not apply to 

the people before the Court. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: But what he's thinking --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is that a matter 

23 of --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: What he's thinking of is 

this: I think Justice Scalia is thinking, I suspect, of

1 -- imagine a tax which says this tax, amount Y, goes to 

2 purpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X. The 

3 other half will come from the exchanges somehow. That 

4 second half is unconstitutional. Purpose X can't 

possibly be carried out now with only half the money. 

6  Does the government just sit there 

7 collecting half the money forever because nobody can 

8 ever challenge it? You see, there -- if it were 

9 inextricably connected, is it enough to say, well, we 

won't consider that because maybe somebody else could 

11 bring that case and then there is no one else? 

12  I mean, is that --

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, we think that is the 

14 proper way to proceed. Severability --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, it's not a 

16 choice between someone else bringing the case and a law 

17 staying in place. And what we're really talking about, 

18 as Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is 

19 the proper party to take out what isn't infected by the 

Court's holding? With all these provisions where there 

21 may be no standing, one institution clearly does have 

22 standing, and that's Congress. 

23  And if Congress doesn't want the provisions 

24 that are not infected to stand, Congress can take care 

of it.

2 Court say we're going to wreck the whole thing, or 

3 should the Court leave it to Congress? 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: We think the Court should 

leave it to Congress for two reasons. One is the point 

6 I'm making now about justiciability, or whether the 

7 Court can properly consider it at all. And the second 

8 is we think only a few provisions are inseverable from 

9 the minimum coverage provision.

 I just would like to --

13 question.

 I think you were interrupted --

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- before you had a 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, we believe that in that 

19 case, the tax -- the tax provision should not be struck 

down. In the first place, the Anti-Injunction Act would 

21 bar a direct suit to challenge it. And it would be very 

22 strange to allow a tax to be struck down on the basis of 

23 a severability analysis. Severability arises in a case 

24 only where it's necessary to consider what relief a 

party before the Court should get. The only party --

have to bring a separate lawsuit challenging every
 

6 single other provision in the Act and say, well, one
 

7 fell and the Congress said it's all -- it's -- it's a
 

8 package, it can't be separated.
 

9  That's your position?


 MR. KNEEDLER: The fact that -- that such a

12 Article III jurisdictional problems apply to easy 

13 questions as well as hard questions. If I could just --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there's no Article III 

jurisdictional problem in Justice Alito's hypothetical, 

16 that this is a remedial exercise of the Court's power to 

17 explain the consequences of its judgment in this case. 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: But this Court had said that 

19 one has to have standing for every degree of relief that 

is sought. That was in Davis. That was Los 

21 Angeles v. Lyons. That's --

1 you're sending it back to Congress for Congress to

3 this provision or should we not have provision? That's 

4 not what it's going to be. It's going to be these 

provisions are in effect, even though you -- a lot of 

6 you never wanted them to be in effect and you only voted 

7 for them because you wanted to get the heart of the --

8 of the Act, which has now been cut out. But, 

9 nonetheless, these provisions are the law, and you have 

to get the votes to overturn them. 

11  That's an enormously different question from 

12 whether you get the votes initially to put them into the 

13 law. 

14  What -- there is no way that this Court's 

decision is not going to distort the congressional 

16 process. Whether we strike it all down or leave some of

18 same. One way or another, Congress is going to have to 

19 reconsider this. And why isn't it better to have them 

reconsider it -- what should I say -- in toto, rather 

21 than having some things already in the law which you

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Kneedler, would you

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: When you say "judicial 

11 restraint," you are echoing the earlier premise that it 

12 increases the judicial power if the judiciary strikes 

13 down other provisions of the Act. I suggest to you it 

14 might be quite the opposite. We would be exercising the 

judicial power, if one Act was -- one provision was 

16 stricken and the others remained, to impose a risk on 

17 insurance companies that Congress had never intended. 

18 By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that 

19 Congress did not provide for, did not consider. That, 

it seems to me, can be argued at least to be a more 

21 extreme exercise of judicial power than to strike --

22 than striking the whole.

not.

had to do with what's wise for the Court to do, not 

16 whether it has power to do it or not.

8 severability is a matter of statutory interpretation. 

9 It should be resolved by looking at the structure and 

the text of the Act, and the Court may look at

interpretation. The Court's task, we submit, is not to 

11 look at the legislative process to see whether the bill 

12 would have been -- would have passed or not based on the 

13 political situation at the time, which would basically 

14 convert the Court into a function such as a whip count. 

That is not the Court's function. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Kneedler, that 

17 would be a revolution --

18  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- in our severability law, 

wouldn't it? 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: It would. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, we have never 

23 suggested that we are going to say, look, this 

24 legislation was a brokered compromise, and we're going 

to try to figure out exactly what would have happened in

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it's 

easy for my clerks. I care whether it's easy for me.

12  MR. KNEEDLER: I think that -- I think 

13 that's exactly right. As I said, it is a question of 

14 statutory interpretation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how is that --

16 what's exactly right? It's a question of statutory 

17 interpretation. That means you have to go through every 

18 line of the statute. I haven't heard your answer to 

19 Justice Scalia's question yet.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think in this case 

21 there is an easy answer, and that is -- Justice Kagan 

22 pointed out that that the Act itself creates a sharp 

23 dividing line between the minimum coverage provision --

24 the package of -- of reforms: The minimum coverage 

provision along with the guaranteed issue and community

2 essential. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know 

4 that? Where is this line? I looked through the whole 

Act. I didn't read -- well --

6  MR. KNEEDLER: It is -- it is in 

7 Congress's --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is the sharp 

9 line?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It is in Congress's findings 

11 that the -- that the minimum coverage provision --

12 without it, the Court -- the Congress said, in Finding 

13 (I), without that provision, people would wait to get 

14 insurance, and therefore -- and cause all the adverse 

selection problems --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. That --

17  MR. KNEEDLER: -- that gave rise to it. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That makes your case 

19 that the one provision should fall if the other does. 

It doesn't tell us anything about all the other 

21 provisions. 

22  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I think -- I think 

23 it does, because Congress said it was essential to those 

24 provisions, but it conspicuously did not say that it was 

essential to other provisions.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you about the 

3 argument that's made in the economists' amicus brief? 

4 They say that the insurance reforms impose 10-year costs 

of roughly $700 billion on the insurance industry and 

6 that these costs are supposed to be offset by about 350 

7 billion in new revenue from the individual mandate and 

8 350 billion from the Medicaid expansion. 

9  Now, if the 350 billion -- maybe you'll 

disagree with the numbers, that they're fundamentally 

11 wrong. But assuming that they're in the ballpark, if 

12 the 350 million from the individual mandate were to be 

13 lost, what would happen to the insurance industry, which 

14 would now be in the -- in the hole for $350 billion over 

10 years? 

16  MR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I mean, first of 

17 all, for the Court to go beyond text and legislative 

18 history to try to figure out how the finances of a bill 

19 operated, it's like being the budget committee. But --

but we think the economists had added up the figures 

21 wrong. If there's Medicaid expansion, the insurance --

22 and the insurance companies are involved in that, 

23 they're going to be reimbursed for the --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if there 

isn't Medicaid expansion? We've talked about the

1 individual mandate, but does the Government have a 

2 position on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion 

3 is struck down? 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: We don't -- we don't think 

that that would have any effect. And that could be 

6 addressed in the next argument. But we don't think that 

7 would have any effect on the -- on the rest of the -- on 

8 the rest of the Act. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it -- the 

Government's position is that if Medicaid expansion is 

11 struck down, the rest of the Act can operate --

12  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- without it. 

14  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. It's -- in the past, 

Congress has expanded Medicaid coverage without there 

16 being -- it's done it many times without there being a 

17 minimum coverage provision. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still don't 

19 understand where you are with the answer to 

Justice Alito's question. 

21  Assume that there is a -- a substantial 

22 probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals 

23 7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate 

24 is stricken. Assume there is a significant possibility 

of that. Is it within the proper exercise of this

the Court's place to look at the -- at the budgetary 

6 implications, and we also --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that -- isn't 

8 that the point, then, why we should just assume that it 

9 is not severable?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we -- if we lack the 

12 competence to even assess whether there is a risk, then 

13 isn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: To say we're doing 

16 something and we're not telling you what the 

17 consequences might be?

19 when you -- when you're talking about monetary 

consequences, you're looking through the Act, you're 

21 looking behind the Act, rather than -- the Court's 

22 function is to look at the text and structure of the Act

1 can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this 

2 one in which we are asked to strike down what the other 

3 side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in --

4 as you request, leave in effect the rest of it? Have we 

ever -- most of our severability cases, you know, 

6 involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question 

7 is whether the rest. When have we ever really struck 

8 down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the 

9 rest in effect? Do you have a case for that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think Booker is the best 

11 example of that. In Booker, the mandatory sentencing 

12 provisions were central to the Act, but the -- but the 

13 Court said Congress would have preferred a statute 

14 without the mandatory provision in the Act, and the 

Court struck that, but the rest of the sentencing 

16 guidelines remained. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the reason -- the 

18 reason the majority said that was that they didn't think 

19 that what was essential to the Act was what had been 

stricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the 

21 judge to say on his own what -- what the punishment 

22 would be. I don't think that's a case where we 

23 struck -- where we excised the heart of the statute. 

24  You have another one?

9 where we have been confronted with this -- with this 

decision. 

11  Can you take out the heart of the Act and 

12 leave everything else in place? 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I would like to go to 

14 "the heart of the Act" point in a moment. But what I 

would like to say is this is a huge act with many 

16 provisions that are completely unrelated to market 

17 reforms and operate in different ways. And we think it 

18 would be extraordinary in this extraordinary act to 

19 strike all of that down because there are many 

provisions and it would be too hard to do it. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I think it's not 

22 uncommon that Congress passes an act, and then there are 

23 many different titles, and some of the titles have 

24 nothing to do with the other titles. That's a common 

thing. And you're saying you've never found an instance

1 where they're all struck out when they have nothing to 

2 do with each other. 

3  My question is -- because I hear Mr. Clement 

4 saying something not too different from what you say. 

He talks about things at the periphery. We can't reject 

6 or accept an argument on severability because it's a lot 

7 of work for us. That's beside the point. But do you 

8 think that it's possible for you and Mr. Clement -- I'm 

9 exploring this -- to get together and agree on --

(Laughter) 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: -- I mean, on a list of 

12 things that are, in both your opinions, peripheral? 

13 Then you would focus on those areas where one of you 

14 thinks it's peripheral and one of you thinks it's not 

peripheral. And at that point, it might turn out to be 

16 far fewer than we're currently imagining, at which point 

17 we could hold an argument or figure out some way or 

18 somebody would hold an argument and try to -- try to get 

19 those done.

 Is that a pipe dream or is that a --

21  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I just don't think 

22 that's realistic. The Court would be doing it without 

23 the parties, the millions of parties --

6 the argument of -- of the heart? 

7  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Striking down the heart, 

9 do we want half a loaf or a shell?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think those are the 

12 two analogies that --

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And -- and I would 

14 like to discuss it again in terms of the text and 

structure of the Act. We have very important 

16 indications from the structure of this Act that the 

17 whole thing is not supposed to fall. 

18  The most basic one is the notion that 

19 Congress would have intended the whole Act to fall if 

there couldn't be a minimum coverage provision is 

21 refuted by the fact that there are many, many provisions 

22 of this Act already in effect without a minimum coverage 

23 provision. Two point -- 2 and a half million people 

24 under 26 have gotten insurance by one of the insurance 

requirements, $3.2 billion --

4 coverage provision comes into effect.

 MR. KNEEDLER: There's no reason to think
 

6 it's going to -- it's going to bankrupt anyone. The
 

7 costs will be set to cover those -- to cover those
 

8 amounts that are --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that the
 

26-year-olds were saying that they were healthy and 

11 didn't need insurance yesterday.

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, today they're going 

14 to bankrupt the --

MR. KNEEDLER: Two and a half million people 

16 would be -- would be thrown off the insurance rolls if 

17 the Court were to say that. Congress made many changes 

18 to Medicare rates that have gone into effect. For 

19 Congress -- for the courts to have to unwind millions of 

Medicare reimbursement rates -- Medicare has covered 32 

21 million insurance -- preventive care visits by patients 

22 as a result of this Act. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of that was 

24 based on the assumption that the mandate was 

constitutional. And if -- that certainly doesn't stop

Official 

1 us from reaching our own determination on that. 

2  MR. KNEEDLER: No, but what I'm saying is 

3 it's a question of legislative intent, and we have a 

4 very fundamental indication of legislative intent that 

it -- that Congress did not mean the whole Act to fall 

6 if -- without the minimum coverage provision, because we 

7 have many provisions that are operating now without 

8 that. 

9  But there's a further indication about why 

the line should be drawn where I've suggested, which is 

11 the package of these particular provisions. All of the 

12 other provisions of the Act would continue to advance 

13 Congress's goal, as the test that was articulated in 

14 Booker, but it's been said in Regan and other cases. 

You look to whether the other provisions can continue to 

16 advance the purposes of the Act. 

17  Here they unquestionably can. The public 

18 health -- the broad public health purposes of the Act 

19 that are unrelated to the minimum coverage provision but 

also the other provisions designed to enhance affordable 

21 -- access to affordable care: The employer 

22 responsibility provision, the credit for small 

23 businesses, which is already in effect, by the way, and 

24 affecting many small businesses. That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But many people might

1 not -- many of the people in Congress might not have 

2 voted for those provisions if the central part of this 

3 statute was not adopted. 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, you're --

6 to say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is 

7 just unrealistic. Once you've cut the guts out of it, 

8 who knows, who knows which of them were really desired 

9 by Congress on their own and which ones weren't?

 MR. KNEEDLER: The question for the Court 

11 is, Congress having passed the law by whatever majority 

12 there might be in one house or the other, Congress 

13 having passed the law, what at that point is -- is the 

14 legislative intent embodied in the law Congress has 

actually passed? 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right. 

17 But the problem is, straight from the title, we have two 

18 complementary purposes, patient protection and 

19 affordable care. And you can't look at something and 

say this promotes affordable care; therefore, it's 

21 consistent with Congress's intent. Because Congress had 

22 a balanced intent. You can't look at another provision 

23 and say this promotes patient protection without asking 

24 if it's affordable.

 So, it seems to me if you ask what is going

Official 

1 to promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry 

2 that you can't carry out. 

3  MR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- with respect, I 

4 disagree, because I think it's evident that Congress's 

purpose was to expand access to affordable care. It did 

6 it in discrete ways. It did it by the penalty on 

7 employers that don't -- that don't offer suitable care. 

8 It did it by offering tax credits to small employers. 

9 It did it by offering tax credits to purchasers. All of 

those are a variety of ways that continue to further 

11 Congress's goal. And most of all, Medicaid, which is --

12 which is unrelated to -- to the private insurance market 

13 altogether. 

14  And in adopting those other provisions 

governing employers and whatnot, Congress built on its 

16 prior experience of using the tax code, which it has --

17 for a long period of time, Congress has subsidized the 

18 provision of health care --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't quite understand 

about the employers. You're saying Congress mandated 

21 employers to buy something that Congress itself has not 

22 contemplated? I don't understand that. 

23  MR. KNEEDLER: No. Employer coverage -- 150 

24 million people in this country already get their 

insurance through -- through their employers. What 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 Congress did in seeking to augment that was to add a 

2 provision requiring employers to purchase insurance or 

3 pay a tax penalty. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Based on the assumption 

that the cost of those policies would be lowered 

6 by certain provisions which are, by hypothesis -- we're 

7 not sure -- by hypothesis, are in doubt. 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: No, I -- I think it's -- any 

9 cost assumptions -- there's no indication that Congress 

made any cost assumptions, but -- but there's no reason 

11 to think that the individual -- that the individual 

12 market, which is where the minimum coverage provision is 

13 directed, would affect that. 

14  I would like to say -- I have pointed out 

why the other things would advance Congress's goal. The 

16 point here is that the package of three things would be 

17 contrary -- would run contrary to Congress's goal if you 

18 took out the minimum coverage provision. 

19  And here's why -- and this is reflected in 

the findings. If you take out minimum coverage but 

21 leave in the guaranteed issue and community rating, you 

22 will make matters worse. Rates will go up, and people 

23 -- there will be less -- fewer people covered in the 

24 individual market.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that is true, what 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 is the difference between guaranteed-issue and 

2 community-rating provisions, on the one hand, and other 

3 provisions that increase costs substantially for 

4 insurance companies?

 For example, the tax on high cost health 

6 plans, which the economists' amicus brief said will cost 

7 $217 billion over 10 years? 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: Those are -- what Congress --

9 Congress did not think of those things as balancing 

insurance companies. Insurance companies are 

11 participants in the market for Medicaid and -- and other 

12 things. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're saying we have 

14 -- we have the expertise to make the inquiry you want us 

to make, i.e., the guaranteed issue, but not the 

16 expertise that Justice Alito's question suggests we must 

17 make. 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand 

your position. 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: -- that's because -- that's 

22 because I think this Court's function is to look at the 

23 text and structure and the legislative history of the 

24 law that Congress enacted, not the financial -- not a 

financial balance sheet, which doesn't appear anywhere

Official 

1 in the law. And just --

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're relying on
 

3 Congress's quite explicitly tying these three things
 

4 together.


 MR. KNEEDLER: We do. That's -- that's --

6 and it's not just the text of the Act, but the 

7 background of the Act, the experience in the States, the 

8 testimony of the National Association of Insurance 

9 Commissioners.

 That's the -- that's the problem Congress 

11 was addressing. There was a -- there was -- a shifting 

12 of present actuarial risks in that market that Congress 

13 wanted to correct. And if you took the minimum coverage 

14 provision out and left the other two provisions in, 

there would be laid on top of the existing shifting of 

16 present actuarial risks an additional one because the 

17 uninsured would know that they would have guaranteed 

18 access to insurance whenever they became sick. It would 

19 make the -- it would make the adverse selection in that 

market problem even worse. 

21  And so, what -- and Congress, trying to come 

22 up with a market-based solution to control rates in that 

23 market, has adopted something that would -- that would 

24 work to control costs by guaranteed issue and community 

rating, but if you -- if -- if you take out the minimum 

55
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 coverage, that won't work. That was Congress's 

2 assumption, again, shown by the text and legislative 

3 history of this provision. And that's why we think 

4 those things rise or fall in a package, because they cut 

against what Congress was trying to do. 

6  All of the other provisions would actually 

7 increase access to affordable care and would have 

8 advantageous effects on price. Again, Congress was 

9 invoking its traditional use of the tax code, which has 

long subsidized insurance through employers, has used 

11 that to impose a tax penalty on -- on employers, to give 

12 tax credits. This is traditional stuff that Congress 

13 has done. 

14  And the other thing Congress has done, those 

pre-existing laws had their own protections for 

16 guaranteed issue and community rating. Effectively, 

17 within the large employer plans, they can't discriminate 

18 among people. They can't charge different rates. What 

19 Congress was doing, was doing that in the other market. 

If it can't, that's all that should be struck from the 

21 Act.

25

Official 

1  AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE 

2  MR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3 please the Court: 

4  At the outset, I would just like to say I 

think that the Government's position in this case that 

6 the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions 

7 ought to be struck down is an example of the best 

8 driving out the good, because, even without the minimum 

9 coverage provision, those two provisions, guaranteed 

issue and community rating, will still open insurance 

11 markets to millions of people that were excluded under 

12 the prior system and for millions of people will lower 

13 prices, which were raised high under the old system 

14 because of their poor health.

 So, even though the system is not going to 

16 work precisely as Congress wanted, it would certainly 

17 serve central goals that Congress had of expanding 

18 coverage for people who were unable to get coverage or 

19 unable to get it at affordable prices.

 So, when the government --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the points that 

22 Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable 

23 because the -- he spoke of the adverse selection 

24 problem, that there would be so fewer people in there, 

the insurance companies are going to have to raise the 

57

5

25

Official 

1 premiums. 

2  So, it's nice that Congress made it possible 

3 for more people to be covered, but the reality is they 

4 won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.

 MR. FARR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me 

6 say two things about that. 

7  First of all, when we talk about premiums 

8 becoming less affordable, it's very important to keep in 

9 mind different groups of people, because it is not 

something that applies accurately to everybody. 

11  For people who were not able to get 

12 insurance before, obviously, their insurance beforehand 

13 was -- the price was essentially infinite. They were 

14 not able to get it at any price. They will now be able 

to get it at a price that they can afford. 

16  For people who are unhealthy and were able 

17 to get insurance, but perhaps not for the things that 

18 they were most concerned about, or only at very high

without the minimum coverage provision.

24 say -- I didn't follow that. Why?

 MR. FARR: Because --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would their rates be 

2 lower? 

3  MR. FARR: Their rates are going to be lower 

4 than they were under the prior system because they are 

going into a pool of people, rather than -- some of whom 

6 are healthy, rather than having their rates set 

7 according to their individual health characteristics. 

8 That's why their rates were so high. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: But the problem, Mr. Farr, 

isn't it, that they're going to a pool of people that 

11 will gradually get older and unhealthier. That's the 

12 way the thing works. Once you say that the insurance 

13 companies have to cover all of the sick people and all 

14 of the old people, the -- the rates climb. More and 

more young people and healthy people say why should we 

16 participate; we can just get it later when we get sick. 

17 So, they leave the market. The rates go up further. 

18 More people leave the market. And the whole system 

19 crashes and burns, becomes unsustainable.

 MR. FARR: Well, that's --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: And this is not --

22  MR. FARR: Sorry. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- like what I think. What 

24 do I know? It's just what -- what's reflected in 

Congress's findings, that it's -- it looks at some

1 States and says this system crashed and burned. It
 

2 looked at another State with the minimum coverage
 

3 provision and said this one seems to work; so, we'll
 

4 package the minimum coverage provision with the
 

nondiscrimination provisions.
 

6  MR. FARR: Well, in a moment, I'd like to
 

7 talk about the finding, but if I could just postpone
 

8 that for a second and talk about adverse selection
 

9 itself.


 I think one of the misconceptions here, 

11 Justice Kagan, is that Congress, having seen the 

12 experience of the States in the '90s with community 

13 rating and guaranteed issue, simply imposed the minimum 

14 coverage provision as a possible way of dealing with 

that, and if you don't have the minimum coverage 

16 provision, then, essentially, adverse selection runs 

17 rampant. But that's not what happened. 

18  Congress included at least half a dozen 

19 other provisions to deal with adverse selection caused 

by bringing in people who are less healthy into the Act. 

21  There are -- to begin with, the Act 

22 authorizes annual enrollment periods so people can't 

23 just show up at the hospital. If they don't show up and 

24 sign up at the right time, they at least have to wait to 

the -- to the time next year. That's authorized by the

25

Official 

1 Act.
 

2  There -- with respect to the subsidies,
 

3 there are three different things that make this
 

4 important. First of all, the subsidies are very
 

generous. For people below 200 percent of the Federal 

6 poverty line, the subsidy will cover 80 percent, on 

7 average, of the premium, which makes it attractive to 

8 them to join. 

9  The structure of the subsidies, because 

their income -- they create a floor for -- based on the 

11 income of the person getting the insurance, and then the 

12 government covers everything over that. And this is 

13 important in adverse selection because if you do have a 

14 change in the mix of people and average premiums start 

to rise, the government picks up the increase in the 

16 premium. The amount that the person who is getting 

17 insured contributes remains constant at a percentage of 

18 his or her income. 

19  And the third thing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is nothing about 

21 Federal support that is unsustainable, right? That is 

22 infinite. 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  MR. FARR: Well, I mean, that's a fair 

point, Justice Scalia, although one of the things that 

61
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 happens, if you take the mandate out, while it is true 

2 that the subsidies that the government provides to any 

3 individual will increase, and they will be less 

4 efficient -- I'm not disputing that point -- actually, 

the overall amount of the subsidies that the government 

6 will provide will decline, as the Government notes 

7 itself in its brief, because there will be fewer people 

8 getting them. Some people will opt out of the system 

9 even though they're getting subsidies.

 But I'd just like to go back for one more 

11 second to the point about how the subsidies are part of 

12 what Congress was using, because the other thing is that 

13 for people below 250 percent of the Federal poverty 

14 line, Congress also picks up and subsidizes the 

out-of-pocket costs, raising the actuarial value. 

16  So, you have all of that, and then you have 

17 Congress also, unlike the States, establishing -- or I 

18 should be precisely accurate -- unlike almost all the 

19 States, establishing an age differential of up to three 

to one. So, an insurance company, for example, that is 

21 selling a 25-year-old a policy for $4,000 can charge a 

22 60-year-old $12,000 for exactly the same coverage. 

23  The States typically in the '90s, when they 

24 were instituting these programs, they either had pure 

community rating, where everybody is charged the same 

62
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 premium -- everybody regardless of their age is charged 

2 the same premium. Some States had a variance of 1.5 

3 to 1. Massachusetts, for example, which did have good 

4 subsidies, but their age band was two to one.

 So, when Congress is enacting this Act, it's 

6 not simply looking at the States and thinking: Well, 

7 that didn't go very well. Why don't we put in a minimum 

8 coverage provision? That will solve the problem. 

9  Congress did a lot of different things to 

try to combat the adverse selection. 

11  Now, if I could turn to the finding, because 

12 I think this is the crux of the Government's position, 

13 and then the plaintiffs pick up on that and then move --

14 move from that to the rest of the Act. And it seems to 

me, quite honestly, it's an important part because that 

16 is textual. You know, in this whole sort of quest for 

17 what we're trying to figure out, the finding seems to 

18 stand out as something that the Court can rely on and 

19 say here's something Congress has actually told us.

 But I think the real problem with the 

21 finding is the -- the context in which Congress made it. 

22 It's quite clear. If the Court wants to look, the 

23 finding is on page 42 -- 43a, excuse me, of the 

24 Solicitor General's severability brief, in the appendix.

 But the finding is made specifically in the 

63
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 context of interstate commerce. That is why the 

2 findings are in the Act at all. Congress wanted to 

3 indicate to the Court, knowing that the minimum coverage 

4 provision was going to be challenged, wanted to indicate 

to the Court the basis on which it believed it had the 

6 power under the Commerce Clause to enact this law. 

7  Why does that make a difference with respect 

8 to Finding (I), which is the one that the Government is 

9 relying on, and in particular the last sentence, which 

says this requirement "is essential to creating 

11 effective health insurance markets" in which guaranteed 

12 issue and pre-existing illnesses can be covered. 

13  And the reason is because the word 

14 "essential" in the Commerce Clause context doesn't have 

the colloquial meaning. In the Commerce Clause context, 

16 "essential" effectively means useful. So that when one 

17 says -- in Lopez, when the Court says section 922(q) is 

18 not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme of 

19 economic activity, it goes on to say: In which the 

regulatory scheme would be undercut if we didn't have 

21 this provision. 

22  Well, if that's all Congress means, I agree 

23 with that. The system will be undercut somewhat if you 

24 don't have the minimum coverage provision. It's like 

the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause 

64

1 Clause. It doesn't mean, as the Court has said on 

2 numerous occasions, absolutely necessary. It means 

3 conducive to, useful, advancing the objectives, 

4 advancing the aims. And it's easy to see, I think, that 

that's what Congress did.
 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any dictionary
 

7 that gives that --

8  MR. FARR: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.
 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that definition of
 

"essential"? It's very imaginative. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Just give me one 

13 dictionary. 

14  MR. FARR: Well -- but I think my point, 

Justice Scalia, is that they're not using it in the true 

16 dictionary sense. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know that? When 

18 people speak, I assume they're speaking English. 

19  MR. FARR: Well --

(Laughter.) 

21  MR. FARR: I think that there are several 

22 reasons that I would suggest that we would know that 

23 from. The first is, as I say, the findings themselves. 

24 Congress says at the very beginning -- the head of it is 

Congress makes the following findings. And they're 

65
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 talking about the interstate -- you know, (B) is headed 

2 "Effects on the national economy and interstate 

3 commerce." So, we know the context that Congress is 

4 talking about. It is more or less quoting from the 

Court's Commerce Clause statement. 

6  But if one looks at the very preceding 

7 finding, which is Finding (H), which is on 42 over onto 

8 43, Congress at that point also uses the word 

9 "essential." In the second sentence, it says this 

requirement -- and again, we're talking about the 

11 minimum coverage provision -- "is an essential part of 

12 this larger regulation of economic activity," which is, 

13 by the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which "the 

14 absence of the requirement would undercut Federal 

regulation," also an exact quote from Lopez. 

16  But what it's referring to is essential --

17 an essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service 

18 Act, and the Affordable Care Act. It can't possibly be, 

19 even the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those acts 

would all fall in their entirety if you took out the 

21 minimum coverage provision. 

22  And as a second example of the same usage by 

23 Congress, the statute that was before the Court in 

24 Raich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the 

regulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic, 

66
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 was essential to the regulation of interstate drug 

2 activity. Again, it is simply not conceivable that 

3 Congress was saying one is so indispensable to the 

4 other, the way the United States uses the term here, so 

indispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate 

6 traffic, we don't want to regulate the interstate 

7 traffic, either. The whole law criminalizing drug 

8 traffic would fall. 

9  So, I think once you look at the finding for 

what I believe it says, which is we believe this is a 

11 useful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress 

12 would think in its own approach would be sufficient --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

14  MR. FARR: Yes, Justice.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem I have is 

16 that you're ignoring the congressional findings and all 

17 of the evidence Congress had before it that community 

18 ratings and guaranteed issuance would be a death 

19 spiral -- I think that was the word that was used --

without minimum coverage. Those are all of the 

21 materials that are part of the legislative record here. 

22  So, even if it might not be because of the 

23 structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence. Why 

24 should we be looking at that as opposed to what Congress 

had before it and use "essential" in its plain meaning:

1 You can't have minimum coverage without, what the SG is 

2 arguing, community ratings and guaranteed issue. You 

3 can't have those two without minimum coverage. 

4  MR. FARR: Well, I think that's a fair 

question. But the idea that -- that all the information 

6 before Congress only led to the idea that if -- that you 

7 would have death spirals seems to me to be contradicted 

8 a little bit at least by the CBO report in November of 

9 2009, which is about 4 months before the Act passed, 

where the CBO talks about adverse selection. 

11  Now, I want to be clear. This is at a time 

12 when the minimum coverage provision was in the statute. 

13 So, I'm not suggesting that this is a discussion without 

14 that in it. But, nonetheless, the CBO goes through and 

talks about adverse selection and -- and points out the 

16 different provisions in the Act, the ones I have 

17 mentioned plus one other, actually, where in the first 3 

18 years of the operation of the exchanges, those insurance 

19 companies that get sort of a worse selection of -- of 

consumers will be given essentially credits from 

21 insurance companies that get better selection. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, do you want us to 

23 write an opinion saying we have concluded that there is 

24 an insignificant risk of a substantial adverse effect on 

the insurance companies -- that's our economic 

68

1 conclusion -- and therefore not severable? That's what 

2 you want me to say? 

3  MR. FARR: It doesn't sound right the way 

4 you say it, Justice Kennedy. So --

(Laughter.) 

6  MR. FARR: No, I --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you don't want them 

8 to say, either, that there is a death spiral. Do you 

9 want -- you don't want us to make either of those two 

findings, I'm assuming. 

11  MR. FARR: That's correct. Now, I -- I 

12 agree that there's a risk and the significance of it 

13 people can debate. But what I think is -- is lost in 

14 that question -- and I didn't mean to be whimsical about 

it. I think what is lost in it a little bit is what's 

16 on the other side, which is the fact that if you follow 

17 the Government's suggestion, if the Court follows the 

18 Government's suggestion, what is going to be lost is 

19 something we know is a central part of the Act. I mean, 

indeed, if one sort of looks at the legislative history 

21 more broadly, I think much of it is directed toward the 

22 idea that guaranteed issue and community rating were the 

23 crown jewel of the Act. 

24  The minimum coverage provision wasn't 

something that everybody was bragging about. It was

1 something that was meant to be part of this package. I 

2 agree with that. 

3  But the -- but the point of it was to have 

4 guaranteed issue and minimum coverage. I mean -- excuse 

me -- guaranteed issue and community rating. And that's 

6 -- under the Government's proposal, those would 

7 disappear. We would go back to the old system. 

8  And under what I think is the proper 

9 severability analysis, the -- the real question the 

Court is asking, should be asking, is, would Congress 

11 rather go back to the old system than to take perhaps 

12 the risk that you're talking about, Justice Kennedy? 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you're 

14 referring to the Government's second position. Their 

first, of course, is that we shouldn't address this 

16 issue at all. 

17  MR. FARR: That's correct. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I asked Mr. Kneedler 

19 about what procedure or process would be anticipated for 

people who are affected by the change in -- in the law 

21 and the change in the economic consequences. Do you 

22 have a view on how that could be played out? It does 

23 seem to me that if we accept your position, something --

24 there have to -- there has to be a broad range of 

consequences, whether it's additional legislation,

1 additional litigation. 

2  Any thoughts on how that's going to play 

3 out? 

4  MR. FARR: Well, if the Court adopts the 

position that I'm advocating, Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

6 what would happen is that the Court would say that the 

7 minimum coverage provision, by hypothesis of course, is 

8 unconstitutional, and the fact of that being 

9 unconstitutional does not mean the invalidation of any 

other provision. 

11  So, under the position I'm advocating, there 

12 would no longer be challenges to the remaining part of 

13 the Act. The --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the challenge 

is what we're questioning today, whether -- if you're an 

16 insurance company and you don't believe that you can 

17 give the coverage in the way Congress mandated it 

18 without the individual mandate, what -- what type of 

19 action do you bring in court?

 MR. FARR: You -- if the Court follows the 

21 course that I'm advocating, you do not bring an action 

22 in court. You go to Congress and you seek a change from 

23 Congress to say the minimum coverage provision has been 

24 struck down by the Court: Here is our -- here -- here's 

the information that we have to show you what the risks 

71

25

Official 

1 are going to be. Here are the adjustments you need to 

2 make. 

3  One of the questions earlier pointed out 

4 that States have adjusted their systems as they've gone 

along, as they've seen things work or not work. 

6  You know, as I was talking earlier about the 

7 -- the different ratio for ages in insurance. The 

8 States have tended to change that because they found 

9 that having too narrow a band worked against the 

effectiveness of their programs. But they -- except for 

11 in Massachusetts, they didn't enact mandates. 

12  So, to answer -- I think to answer your 

13 question directly, Mr. Chief Justice, the position I'm 

14 advocating would simply have those -- those pleas go to 

Congress, not in court. 

16  Now, if one -- just to discuss the issue 

17 more generally, if that's helpful, I think that if there 

18 were situations where the Court deferred -- let's say 

19 for discretionary reasons, they just said -- the Court 

said we're not going to take up the question of 

21 severability and therefore not resolve it in these other 

22 situations, it certainly seems to me that in enforcement 

23 actions, for example, if the time comes in 2014 and 

24 somebody applies to an insurance company for a 

policy and the insurance company says, well, we're not

1 going to issue a policy, we don't think your risks are 

2 ones that we're willing to cover -- it seems to me that 

3 they could sue the insurance company and the insurance 

4 company could raise as a defense that this provision, 

the guaranteed-issue provision of the statute, is not 

6 enforceable because it was inseverable from the decision 

7 -- from the provision that the Court held 

8 unconstitutional in 2012. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, let's consider 

how -- how your approach, severing as little as 

11 possible, thereby increases the deference that we're 

12 showing to Congress. It seems to me it puts Congress in 

13 this position: This Act is still in full effect. There 

14 is going to be this deficit that used to be made up by 

the mandatory coverage provision. All that money has to 

16 come from somewhere. You can't repeal the rest of the 

17 Act because you're not going to get 60 votes in the 

18 Senate to repeal the rest. It's not a matter of 

19 enacting a new Act. You got to get 60 votes to repeal 

it. So, the rest of the Act is going to be the law. 

21  So, you're just put to the choice of, I 

22 guess, bankrupting insurance companies and the whole 

23 system comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal 

24 subsidy program to the insurance companies, which is 

what the insurance companies would like, I'm sure.

3 democratic process?
 

4  It seems to me it's a gross distortion of
 

it. 

6  MR. FARR: Well, Your Honor, the difficulty 

7 is that it seems to me the other possibility is for the 

8 Court to make choices particularly based on what it 

9 expects the difficulties of Congress altering the 

legislation after a Court ruling would be. I'm not 

11 aware of any severability decision that has ever looked 

12 anything like that. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I -- that wouldn't be 

14 my approach. My approach would say, if you take the 

heart out of the statute, the statute's gone. That 

16 enables Congress to do what it wants in the usual 

17 fashion. And it doesn't inject us into the process of 

18 saying: This is good, this is bad, this is good, this 

19 is bad.

 MR. FARR: Well --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it reduces 

22 our options the most and increases Congress's the most. 

23  MR. FARR: And I guess to some extent I have 

24 to quarrel with the premise, Justice Scalia, because at 

least the position that I'm advocating today, under 

74
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 which the Court would only take out the minimum coverage 

2 provision, I don't think would fit the description that 

3 you have given of taking out the heart of the statute. 

4  Now, I do think once you take out guaranteed 

issue and community rating, you're getting closer to the 

6 heart of the statute. And one of the -- one of the 

7 difficulties I think with the Government's position is 

8 that I think it's harder to cabin that, to draw that 

9 bright line around it. It's harder than the Government 

thinks it is. 

11  I mean, to begin with, even the Government 

12 seems to acknowledge, I think, that the exchanges are 

13 going to be relatively pale relatives of the exchanges 

14 as they're intended to be, where you're going to have 

standardized products, everybody can come and make 

16 comparisons based on products that look more or less the 

17 same. 

18  But the other thing that's going to happen 

19 is with the subsidy program. The way that the subsidy 

program is set up, the subsidy is calculated according 

21 to essentially a benchmark plan. And this -- if one --

22 if the Court wants to look at the provisions, they're --

23 they begin at page 64a of the private plaintiffs' brief. 

24 Again, in the appendix. The particular provision I'm 

talking about's at 68a. But there's a -- there's a 

75
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 question -- you -- you're looking essentially to
 

2 calculate the premium by looking at a -- at a
 

3 standardized silver plan.
 

4  First question, obviously, is: Is there
 

going to be any such plan if you don't have guaranteed 

6 issue and community rating, if the plans can basically 

7 be individualized? But the second problem is that, in 

8 the provision on 68a, the -- the provision that's used 

9 for calculating the subsidy, what -- what is anticipated 

in the provision under the Act, as it is now, is that 

11 you do have the floor of the income. You would -- you 

12 would take this benchmark plan, and the government would 

13 pay the difference. 

14  And as we talked about earlier, the 

benchmark plan can change for age, and -- and the 

16 provision says it can be adjusted only for age. So, if 

17 in fact you even have such a thing as a benchmark plan 

18 anymore, if the rates of people in poor health go up 

19 because of individual insurance underwriting, the 

government subsidy is not going to pay for that. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Farr, I understood that 

22 the answer that you gave to Justice Scalia was 

23 essentially that the minimum coverage provision was not 

24 the heart of the Act. Instead, the minimum coverage 

provision was a tool to make the nondiscrimination 

76
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 provisions -- community rating, guaranteed issue --

2 work. 

3  So, if you assume that, that all the minimum 

4 coverage is, is a tool to make those provisions work, 

then I guess I would refocus Justice Scalia's question 

6 and say, if we know that something is just a tool to 

7 make other provisions work, shouldn't that be the case 

8 in which those other provisions are severed along with 

9 the tool?

 MR. FARR: No, I don't think so, because 

11 there are -- there are many other tools to make the same 

12 things work. That's I think the point. 

13  And if one -- and the case that comes to 

14 mind is New York v. The United States, where the Court 

struck down the "take title" provision but left other --

16 two other incentives essentially in place. 

17  Even without the minimum coverage provision, 

18 there will be a lot of other incentives still to bring 

19 younger people into the market and to keep them in the 

market. And if -- if my reading of the finding is 

21 correct -- and that's all that Congress is saying, that 

22 this would be useful -- it doesn't mean that it's 

23 impossible to have --

1 to, against what Justice Scalia just said. Let's 

2 assume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's 

3 position is accepted by the majority of this Court. And 

4 so, we now are rid, quote, of the true "heart" of the 

bill. Now, still there are a lot of other provisions 

6 here like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the 

7 wellness program, that restaurants have to have a 

8 calorie count of major menus, et cetera. 

9  Now, some of them cost money, and some of 

them don't. And there are loads of them. Now, what is 

11 your argument that just because the heart of the bill is 

12 gone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these 

13 other provisions, both those that cost money or at least 

14 those that cost no money? Do you want to make an 

argument in that respect, that destroying the heart of 

16 the bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up 

17 the heart of a bill? And I'd just like to hear what you 

18 have to say about that. 

19  MR. FARR: Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

what I would say is, if one goes back to the -- what I 

21 think is the proper severability standard and say, would 

22 Congress rather have not -- no bill as opposed to the 

23 bill with whatever is severed from it, it seems to me 

24 when you're talking about provisions that don't have 

anything to do with the minimum coverage provision,

1 there's no reason to answer that question as any other 

2 way than yes, Congress would want these provisions. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the real Congress 

4 or a hypothetical Congress?

 (Laughter.) 

6  MR. FARR: An objective Congress, Your 

7 Honor, not the specific -- not with a vote count. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Have you come across --

9  MR. FARR: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why put -- why put Congress 

11 to that false choice? 

12  MR. FARR: Well --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: You know -- you only have 

14 two choices, Congress. You can have the whole bill or 

you can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no 

16 bill at all. Why that false choice? 

17  MR. FARR: I think the reason is because 

18 severability is by necessity a blunt tool. The Court 

19 doesn't have -- even if it had the inclination, doesn't 

essentially have the authority to retool the statute --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Oh, I know. So, you 

22 -- I would say stay out of politics. That's for 

23 Congress, not us. 

24  MR. FARR: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the question

Official 

1 here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have 

2 you ever found a severability case where the Court ever 

3 said: Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and, 

4 therefore, we strike down these other provisions that 

have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their 

6 feet independently and can be funded separately or don't 

7 require money at all. 

8  MR. FARR: I think the accurate answer would 

9 be I am not aware of a modern case that says that. I 

think there probably are cases in the '20s and '30s that 

11 would be more like that. 

12  If I could just take one second to address 

13 the economists' brief because Justice Alito raised it 

14 earlier. I just want to make one simple point. Leaving 

aside the whole balancing thing, if one looks at the 

16 economists' brief, I think it's very important to note 

17 that when they're talking about one side of the balance 

18 -- may I finish? 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.

 MR. FARR: When they're talking about the 

21 balance, they're not just talking about the minimum 

22 coverage provision. They very carefully word it to say 

23 the minimum coverage provision and the subsidy programs. 

24 And then, so when you're doing the mathematical 

balancing, the subsidy programs are extremely large.

7  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, could you 

respond to amici's point? He says that Congress didn't 

11 go into this Act to impose minimum coverage. They went 

12 into the Act to have a different purpose, i.e., to get 

13 people coverage when they needed it, to increase 

14 coverage for people, that this is only a tool. But 

other States -- going back to my original point, that 

16 there are other tools besides minimum coverage that 

17 Congress can achieve the same goals. So, if we strike 

18 just a tool, why should we strike the whole Act --

19  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when Congress has 

21 other tools available? 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I'll make 

23 four points in rebuttal, but I'll start with Justice 

24 Sotomayor's question, which is to simply say this isn't 

just a tool; it's the principal tool. Congress 

81

1 identified it as an essential tool. It's not just a 

2 tool to make it work. It's a tool to pay for it, to 

3 make it affordable. And, again, that's not my 

4 characterization; that's Congress's characterization in 

Sub-finding (I) on page 43a of the Government's brief. 

6  Now, that brings me to my first point in 

7 rebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says, quite correctly --

8 tells this Court don't look at the budgetary 

9 implications. Well, the problem with that, though, is 

once it's common ground that the individual mandate is 

11 in the statute at least in part to make community rating 

12 and guaranteed issue affordable, that really is all you 

13 have to identify. That establishes the essential link 

14 that it's there to pay for it.

 You don't have to figure out exactly how 

16 much that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a 

17 substantial part of it, because what they were trying to 

18 do was take healthy individuals and put them into the 

19 risk pool -- and this is quoting their finding -- which 

is in order -- they put people into the market, which 

21 will lower premiums. So, that's what their intent was. 

22  So, you don't have to get to the final 

23 number. You know that's what was going on here, and 

24 that's reason alone to sever it.

 Now, the Government -- Mr. Kneedler also

Official 

1 says there's an easy dividing line between what they
 

2 want to keep and what they want to dish out. The
 

3 problem with that is that, you know, you read their
 

4 brief and you might think, oh, there's a
 

guaranteed-issue and a community-rating provision 

6 subtitle in the bill. There's not. 

7  To figure out what they're talking about you 

8 have to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening 

9 severability brief, where they tell you what's in and 

what's out. And the easy dividing line they suggest is 

11 actually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on 

12 community rating, they don't -- they say that (a)(1) 

13 goes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay because 

14 that's the way that you'll have some sort of -- kind of 

Potemkin community rating for the exchanges. But if you 

16 actually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all 

17 these references to (a)(1). It just doesn't work. 

18  Now, in getting back to the -- an inquiry 

19 that I think this Court actually can approach is, to 

look at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no 

21 further than the title of this statute: Patient 

22 Protection and Affordable Care. I agree with Mr. Farr 

23 that community rating and guaranteed issue were the 

24 crown jewels of this Act. They were what was trying to 

provide patient protection. And what made it 

83

1 affordable? The individual mandate. If you strike down 

2 guaranteed issue, community rating, and the individual 

3 mandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act. 

4  And that takes me to my last point, which is 

simply this Court in Buckley created a halfway house, 

6 and it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the 

7 situation, when contrary to any time of their intent, 

8 they had to try to figure out what are we going to do 

9 when we're stuck with this ban on contributions, but we 

can't get at expenditures because the Court told us we 

11 couldn't. And for 40 years, they worked in that halfway 

12 house. 

13  Why make them do that in health care? The 

14 choice is to give Congress the task of fixing this 

statute, the residuum of this statute after some of it 

16 is struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing 

17 the problem on a clean slate. I don't think that's a 

18 close choice. If the individual mandate is 

19 unconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

21 Clement. 

22  Mr. Farr, you were invited by this Court to 

23 brief and argue in these cases in support of the 

24 decision below on severability. You have ably carried 

out that responsibility, for which we are grateful.
