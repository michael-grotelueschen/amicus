CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

next in Case 08-1196, Weyhrauch v. United States. 

Mr. Ayer. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. AYER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

When counsel for the United States defended 

the McNally prosecution before this Court in 1987, the 

first thing he did was to acknowledge that many of the 

existing intangible rights cases contained what he 

called “extravagant” language that, on its face, 

extended the doctrine far beyond the principle that one 

can be guilty of fraudulently denying others the 

performance of a clear legal duty that he owes. 

I know that because the government lawyer 

was me --

(Laughter.) 

MR. AYER: And that was the only thing I 

said that day that the 7-2 majority agreed with. But 22 

years later, and one 28-word statute later, the United 

States is now pressing to take that extravagant language 

of the pre-McNally cases to the bank.

It does that by contending that a public 

official commits honest services fraud simply by failing 

to disclose an arguable conflict of interest, even 

though he has no legal duty to disclose apart from the 

words of 1346. 

And it -- and it is possible to do that 

under the extravagant words of the earlier cases by 

relying on a supposed Federal common law fiduciary duty 

of loyalty that is owed by all public officials, 

including State officials, to their constituents. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the --

there were a State law that said you must disclose 

anything that could reasonably be viewed as a conflict 

of interest, then -- then you would lose? 

MR. AYER: Your Honor, you are now asking me 

the question about the outer perimeter of the statute. 

My argument is that a duty -- some duty clear in the law 

is absolutely necessary. 

What kind of a duty would be sufficient is a 

much more difficult question, and it's a difficult 

question for -- for, essentially, two reasons. 

One is, the duty must be clear and not 

vague. That's one point. 

The more complex point is a point relating 

to this Court's clear statement rule and related

concepts concerning particular duties. If a State 

creates a system of contractual duties, those duties 

have certain consequences. 

Generally speaking, contractual duties have 

a consequence of paying damages. People conduct 

themselves in certain ways in a contractual system. 

They don't expect to go to jail, usually, for breaching 

a contractual duty. Similarly --

JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, the mail fraud 

statute carries a very heavy penalty, and are you -- you 

are arguing that Congress intended to impose this 

penalty on individuals who breach some Federal or State 

disclosure requirement, even if that is viewed by the 

body that is responsible for the disclosure requirement 

as a very minor thing. 

MR. AYER: Oh, I'm -- I'm -- Your Honor, if 

I left that impression, let me completely reject it. 

That is not at all what I'm arguing. 

To the contrary, I am arguing that -- that 

ultimately, the task this Court may decide it must 

pursue -- which, I think, frankly, is quite separate 

from our case, because our case is a case where there is 

no duty, period, in the law, which I want to explain 

procedurally why that's true -- if you are going to 

decide that some duties are enough and other duties are

not, it is a very challenging thing to do, and a very –-

JUSTICE ALITO: But that's what you’re 

asking us to do. I understand you are saying that --

that there cannot be a conviction without the violation 

of some duty. 

But if we agree with that, then we are going 

down the road of deciding what sort of duty suffices, 

and does it have to be a duty that is backed up by a 

State criminal sanction? 

What if -- what if it's a 1-year felony? 

What if it's a misdemeanor? What if it's a -- simply a 

civil penalty? What if it's simply some sort of 

precatory code of ethics --

MR. AYER: Right. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- for legislators? 

MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I -- let me --

I want to repeat again that -- that in -- in my view, 

our case doesn't turn on my ability to satisfactorily 

draw this line which no court has driven -- drawn 

effectively in 50 years. 

But I would -- I would say this: There are 

two approaches that have been suggested that -- that 

have fewer problems than others. 

And one -- if you begin with the question of 

duty and say, what duties will suffice -- and I'm not --

I'm not endorsing this; I'm simply saying it -- it pares 

the covered duties back significantly to a point where 

this Court might find it preferable to some other 

approaches -- would be the one Your Honor mentioned, 

criminal law duties, duties as to which the conduct 

breached already is criminal. 

There’s a subsidiary question, I think: 

Whether, in fact, you might want to require felony 

duties, because there are different penalties with 

regard to different duties. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The real problem with 

your approach, which I take it is you have to find these 

duties in State law, is that some States will classify 

the same conduct as a felony that another will classify 

as a misdemeanor. So that line won't work. And then 

some States will make something criminal that other 

States won't. 

So you’re going to have, depending on 

geography, people potentially subject to a 20-year term 

because of the particularities of -- of a -- the State 

law. 

MR. AYER: I agree, Your Honor. That is --

that is a problem with it. And I am not -- I am not 

here to endorse that as a satisfactory alternative. I’m 

simply saying it’s preferable to some of the others.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are asking us to 

say State law is the reference. 

MR. AYER: No, Your Honor, I'm not. I'm 

asking the Court -- and that's a confusion in the 

question presented. This is a case in which the 

government very clearly, and the trial court found, made 

no attempt to produce anything other than 1346 as the 

source of any Federal disclosure duty. There was no 

Federal disclosure duty that they could point to 

specifically dealing with disclosure. 

The court -- the trial court ended up 

focusing -- in fact, I'd like, if I could, to take a 

couple of minutes on the procedure to establish sort of 

the posture of this case, because I think it may 

otherwise be confusing. 

Essentially, what we had here was an 

indictment that, when filed, in the vaguest of terms, it 

alleged as the purpose -- and this is at joint appendix 

page 35 -- the purpose of the scheme was for Company A 

to agree to provide things of value to the Petitioner to 

cause Petitioner to misuse his official authority for 

the benefit of Company A. A traditional, simple 

allegation of -- of bribery. 

And there has never been a question in this 

case that if the government thinks it can prove that

case, they are welcome to try. And -- and they can do 

that, and in the course of doing that, they have -- it's 

certainly open to them to show that the defendant didn't 

specifically stand up and make an announcement that he 

had submitted a job solicitation to Company A, as he had 

submitted solicitations to a half a dozen other 

employers, as is perfectly legal under Alaska law. So 

all of that is fair game. 

But a few days before trial, what ended up 

happening here -- and this is where this case comes 

from. A few days before trial, first in a trial brief 

and thereafter in a motion in limine dealing with 

submission of evidence, the government announced that it 

wanted to -- to pursue what it called -- what the trial 

court called its alternative theory; frankly, we think, 

because they couldn't prove their bribery case. 

And what they said their theory was, was 

that when a public official -- this is in the trial 

brief. There’s an almost exact quote, similar, at J.A. 

42 in the joint appendix. "When a public official fails 

to disclose the existence of a conflict of interest, 

whether required by law to do so or whether required by 

fiduciary duty to do so, the public official can be 

found guilty of honest services fraud, irrespective of 

whether the public official took any action thereafter,

much less a fraudulent or harmful act." 

In other words, Mr. Weyhrauch -- Mr. 

Weyhrauch sent a solicitation letter, and that's about 

the size of it. He sent a solicitation letter to a 

number of people. He is a part-time legislator in a 

State that has a citizen legislature that has made a 

decision specifically not to have its -- its disclosure 

rules be unduly burdensome. That's their own specific 

language: They don't want them to be unduly burdensome. 

They have required certain disclosures. They have not 

required others. 

The trial court here looked at the 

government's motion, which was to put in evidence about 

Alaska ethics rules in support of this alternative 

theory. And, indeed, the court said -- and the court of 

appeals, at 3a of the -- of the Pet. App. said that the 

evidence was exclusively to pursue this alternative 

theory that all you needed to do was fail to disclose in 

breach of a fiduciary duty, and, bingo, if you go on 

doing your job, you have committed honest services 

fraud. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have no objection 

to what they call the quid pro quo theory; that is, I --

I want you to hire me after I leave the legislature, and 

in return, I'm going to see what I can do to keep the

tax level low on the --

MR. AYER: Absolutely right, Your Honor. 

And, in fact, if there is any doubt about that, all you 

need to do is read at page 36a in the -- in the petition 

appendix, where the court says exactly where the case 

stands after his ruling. 

He says at the end of his order, "This 

leaves the United States to prove the honest services 

fraud charges in this case based on violations of the 

law other than a duty to disclose defendant's dealings 

with VECO." 

They can pursue any theory they want that --

that is a legitimate theory. They just can't come in 

and say: You breached a duty to disclose. Alaska law 

doesn't require that you disclose. There’s no Federal 

statute saying you have to disclose. It's just implicit 

in the concept of honest services that you needed to 

disclose this. Now, basically, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the statute 

says. 

MR. AYER: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the statute 

says. 

MR. AYER: Well, it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says "honest services."

MR. AYER: Well, what happened here is that 

the Ninth Circuit reversed the court of -- the court of 

appeals excluded the evidence, which was offered only in 

pursuit of that theory. Why? Because it said: I don't 

have a State law violation; I don't have a clear Federal 

law violation; the only way I can do this is by 

invocation of Federal common law. And then he said, for 

a variety of reasons, citing some cases: This is not 

something I'm going to do; I think it's inappropriate. 

The Ninth Circuit reversed, and the Ninth 

Circuit essentially said -- and it's very much like what 

I heard this morning from government's counsel -- that 

section 1346 reinstated the pre-McNally law, including 

all of its wonderful dicta and -- and wild phrases about 

duties that exist, that nondisclosure -- and I think 

this is even highly dubious; in fact, I think it’s 

flatly wrong -- that within that body of law, 

nondisclosure of material information -- and this is 

just standing alone. It's not nondisclosure in the 

context of, I'm defrauding you; I'm tricking you out of 

money, or I'm tricking you out of some duty that I 

really -- sorry, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand them to be 

saying nondisclosure of a conflict of interest, so they 

are a little bit more --

-- as the government articulated it here today and as I 

think they have articulated it in their brief, was 

whether it's reasonably likely to affect the decision of 

the relevant whoever, the relevant person. 

Now, as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, 

indicated, it's very easy to talk about materiality when 

you are talking about deception or concealment as a –-

as a method of doing someone out of another thing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- it's much easier 

in the public sector, I agree with you, to --

MR. AYER: But I'm -- but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to talk about it in 

the -- I'm sorry. In the private sector, it's easier to 

talk about. 

MR. AYER: But I'm talking -- I mean, 

I -- I can -- I can well understand the concept of 

bribery, say, where a public official has a duty to 

award contracts to the lowest competent bidder, and 

instead, he takes a bribe, and he awards the contract to 

someone else. He -- you know, I can accept the notion 

easily that he has defrauded -- in those terms, he has 

defrauded the public out of its right to have him do 

that job. 

The materiality of a nondisclosure in that 

setting is -- is coherent in the context of what he did

wrong. In other words, I hid the fact that I took a 

bribe. I took the money in cash. I -- I put it in the 

freezer. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I’m not sure that --

that whether he did it with disclosure or nondisclosure, 

what would make the nondisclosure more meaningful? 

Meaning, it's taking the bribe, whether he discloses it 

or not --

MR. AYER: Well, but there are also --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and if he gets up on 

the floor of -- of the legislature and says: You know, 

I am going to vote for this bill because somebody paid 

me money, he disclosed it. It doesn't make it any 

better. 

MR. AYER: Well, I don't know if it does or 

not. I mean, I guess there is a fraud requirement here. 

And if somebody actually does that openly, I don't know 

if you can argue that he didn't -- that he didn't commit 

fraud. But I don't want to push that, because that’s 

not something I have any interest in -- in promoting. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. AYER: But, in -- in any event, he 

certainly took a bribe. But the -- but the point I am 

making is that the nondisclosure, in the abstract --

and that's what the government is charging here -- is

impossible to evaluate the materiality of. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think they’re 

saying -- which I am getting gradually --

MR. AYER: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I think what he’s saying 

is: First, we know what bribery is; we can deal with 

that one. Second, we know what kickbacks are; we can 

deal with that one. 

And what he means by the honest services 

other than that is, imagine a list of 5 million bits of 

honest service that a workman has to perform for his 

employer. Now, on that list, there might be 35 

requirements to disclose something where the interest of 

the employer goes -- employee goes the other way. 

And he's saying it violates the statute not 

to do that in circumstances where the employee knows 

that the failure to disclose will, in fact, lead the 

employer, to whom he should have disclosed it, to make a 

significant decision; namely, that decision to avoid 

which was the reason he didn't disclose it. 

MR. AYER: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I think what he is 

saying is that’s rather precise. That fits with what 

was there before, and therefore, all the government is 

saying is: Now we have those three things. If you

didn't quite -- I didn't quite get that out of the 

brief, but that may be my fault. All right? So anyway, 

it was probably there; when I go back, I'll see it. And 

those are the three things. 

So he's saying: You see? It doesn't matter 

the source as long as there is a clear legal obligation, 

which could come from corporation law, for the employee 

to disclose the conflict in this situation. I think 

that's what it is. 

Well, and so what's your response to that? 

MR. AYER: Well, I think -- I mean, I could 

argue with that, but I don't need to, because our 

principal submission, Your Honor, is that -- that we win 

this case because there is no clear duty to disclose. 

And we win it because --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are saying, I take it, 

that there was no duty in Alaska criminal law, 

disclosure law, to disclose. I think you might find in 

a treatise on agency that there is a duty to disclose. 

MR. AYER: Well, there is no Alaska law --

it’s absolutely clear and it is not disputed here. The 

the trial court ruled there’s no duty in Alaska law to 

disclose whatever --

MR. AYER: Well, one of the things -- well, 

the government certainly didn't offer anything other 

than what it offered, and the court looked at it and the 

court said there’s no duty -- he went through several 

pages of saying there is no duty to disclose here, and 

the government did not appeal. The government didn't 

challenge that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask you --

MR. AYER: The government said: Well, it 

doesn't matter. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I’m learning something 

about the case that I didn't understand before. Are you 

agreeing that if there were a duty to disclose exactly 

what happened in this case, that then the statute would 

have been violated? 

MR. AYER: I'm not -- I'm not, Your Honor. 

What I would do is bump the -- bump the inquiry to the 

next level, which is where the Court was earlier today. 

You then have to go to the question about what kinds of

My point is quite simple, and I don't think 

it's evasive. You must have some duty --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were arguing 

that a duty to disclose could never qualify.

MR. AYER: Well, my position is that you 

must have some duty, and there’s no duty here other than 

1346. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you then -- but if 

you do have some duty, would the statute have been 

violated on these -- on these facts?

disclose the negotiations of this prospective employer

MR. AYER: Well, would you have -- you would 

have to ask -- you would have to ask a couple of 

questions, I think, further. You would have to ask: 

What kind of a duty is it? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's a duty to 

disclose those facts to the legislature. 

MR. AYER: With a criminal penalty attached? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your position is not 

that there’s no duty; it's that there is not a duty with 

sufficiently severe penalties? Is that what your 

position is? 

MR. AYER: No, the point I’m making is 

all about -- it's all about this Court's clear statement 

rule. It's all about, when are we going to take 

Congress, by using 28 very vague words, to have decided 

to mix up and confuse an existing system of rules. 

Let's say it's a State ethical process where 

there’s an administrative penalty. Maybe the maximum 

penalty is a $100 fine; maybe the maximum penalty is 

censure. I talked about contracts earlier. There’s 

all kinds of regimes of rules and duties that we create 

in society. Some of them are not even created by 

government. Some of them are created by professional 

associations, where if you are a member you owe a duty 

to the professional association. 

Which of these are we going to say are 

duties of sufficient moment -- and then there’s all of 

the -- the common law corporate fiduciary duties. There 

-- there’s a whole array of duties. And the question of 

which will suffice is not an easy question.

position is not that there be no duty to disclose; you 

are saying there is not a duty to disclose of sufficient 

moment to justify criminal penalties. 

MR. AYER: I -- I don't -- that's one way to 

say it, sufficient moment, or of a character that makes 

it appropriate. 

I would say this: I think if the Court were 

to go down the road and think in terms of, well, the 

duties need to be criminal, and if they are criminal, 

then they at least are duties that the entity that 

created them -- it's (a) a government entity, it's a 

government norm, it has criminal consequences, and that 

-- that government body thought this conduct was 

important enough to give criminal penalties to, maybe –-

I don't -- I can't judge this, but maybe the Court would 

look at that and say: Well, certainly, maybe we are 

comfortable with thinking that Congress, with these 

wonderful 28 words, actually meant to make the breach of 

that criminal duty punishable under this statute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of your arguments --

an important argument in your brief is the -- the 

Federal balance, apart from vagueness for a moment --

MR. ESTRADA: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which was the lurking 

problem here. You say it should be State law, because

then the Federal courts would at least tell States that 

they can't enforce their own law strictly enough. 

But if it's Federal law, then the Federal 

government tells the States: Well, regardless of your 

standards, we have our standards. I don't see much to 

choose from in this --

MR. AYER: Well, I’m not sure I understand 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in those -- those two 

alternatives.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You say if there’s a 

State law prohibition --

MR. AYER: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then this statute 

applies. But then -- then the Federal government is 

telling the States: Well, we don't like the way you 

enforce your laws; we're going to do it. 

MR. AYER: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me there's 

not much to choose between -- between the two arguments.

violations, in any way. 

The point is, there's got to be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then I don't

question presented is: Must the government prove the 

defendant violated a disclosure duty imposed by State 

law? 

What you've been arguing isn't in sync with 

what I thought the question presented was: Must you 

look for the duty to State law? 

MR. AYER: Your Honor, there’s a story 

there which I won't bore you with much of, but that's a 

question that the government rewrote and the Court 

adopted and I actually filed a motion. We filed a 

motion suggesting a small insert, and the small insert, 

which was not adopted, was the point that when there is 

no Federal statute requiring disclosure -- in other

internalize them, make that an accurate question 

presented, but it's only an accurate question because 

the government made no effort to come up with a Federal 

disclosure requirement. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are asking for a 

State law reference, and that brings up the problem of 

the variety of State law. And we do have in the mail 

fraud property area a decision, the Cleveland 

decision --

MR. AYER: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that says: Don't look 

to how the States define property. 

MR. AYER: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There should be a uniform 

Federal definition. Why -- if we have done that, the 

mail fraud statute in -- in connection with property, 

why shouldn't we do it also with honest services? 

MR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I 

think this is the situation -- it’s certainly true --

the government cites the Jerome case as well for the 

general proposition that you don't take a Federal 

statute and just leap off and start applying State law 

norms. 

But -- but when the inherent nature of the

about public officials; mostly we’re talking about 

State officials; we’re talking about rights, and 

therefore, we’re talking about duties -- most of the 

legal duties -- if you are going to be requiring legal 

duties, most of the legal duties that a State official 

owes are State law duties. He owes them on account of 

his role in the State government. 

Plus, we are talking about the Federal 

government, the Federal criminal statute, injecting 

itself into the relationship of State officials with 

their citizens and their government. And so the notion 

that you -- you know, there's the De Sylva case from 

1956, there's the Kamen case, the Brosnan case -- these 

are all cases where the Court has recognized a 

sensitivity about there are times when it makes sense 

to look to, or at least consider as one of the elements, 

State law norms. 

And that's really all we are saying here, is 

that State law rules, perhaps, could be sufficient. But 

I want to just emphasize, again, we are not here -- I’m 

-- I’m less helpful to you than perhaps I should be, but 

we have a case to argue. 

And our case should win on the simple ground 

that the government has cited no real direct, you 

know, disclosure obligation. All they have cited, and

all they want to rely on, are the words of 1346. 

Now, that violates this Court's clear 

statement rule, going in and messing around with 

Alaska's existing rules of when you have to disclose and 

when you don't. 

Can Congress really have thought about that 

and meant to do that? I'm sure not. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What if there's a statute 

that prohibits a legislator from engaging in certain 

conduct and attaches a significant penalty to it, but 

there is no statute that requires the disclosure of the 

conduct? 

MR. AYER: Well, there's -- there's an 

argument to be made that the -- that the government 

could pursue, and I don't want to say they could, but if 

it's a criminal statute, there’s an argument the 

government could pursue their case on that theory. 

It's not a disclosure theory. It's a theory 

about -- you know, it's like a bribe. It's like, the 

State said you can't do X; you did X, and you 

fraudulently did X --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me give you this 

example: Take the Judge Holzer case we all know about. 

Suppose, in 49 States, it always violates State law, but 

there’s some State that has a special rule that, unless

the bribery exceeds $1,000, there’s no violation. 

Would -- could he be prosecuted in the 49th State? 

MR. AYER: Well, I think -- the first thing 

I want to say is that I think that is counterfactual, 

and they were talking about bribery. Bribery is 

basically flatly illegal in every State. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if it's not illegal 

MR. AYER: If it's not illegal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the State I'm asking 

you about? 

MR. AYER: If it's not illegal, then I would 

say that there has to be -- the conduct he engaged in 

must be illegal under some law or it -- he didn't breach 

a duty. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It does not have to be 

Alaska law, then? 

MR. AYER: I'm sorry? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: In this case, it does not 

have to be Alaska law, then? 

MR. AYER: It wouldn't have to be Alaska 

law. It has got to be some law, and it can't be 1346. 

The other problem with it, I want to say 

quickly and then sit down, is -- is this is making 

Federal common law. This is courts coming in and 

saying: You must disclose this and this and this, in

these circumstances and not in those. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just trying -- if 

it's -- it’s illegal in 47 States, but not in the State 

in which the prosecution is brought, you say the Federal 

rule could not apply? 

MR. AYER: I would say that -- that -- yes, 

that is my answer. And my answer is that because what 

you have to find is that this person breached a duty. 

If what he did was perfectly legal under the State law 

where he was, just hypothetical -- hard to imagine -- if 

he's committing bribery. Hard to imagine. Not true in 

reality, but if that were true, he hasn't violated any 

duty there. 

Is there a Federal duty that that act of 

taking a bribe violates? Well, if there is, then you 

can prosecute it, and if there is not, then you can't. 

And what I'm saying is, you can't make up a duty out of 

28 words in 1346.

(Laughter.) 

MR. DREEBEN: The one thing that I think the 

parties, the cases, and this Court, in its description 

of section 1346 in Cleveland, agree on is that the 

purpose of the statute was to restore at least some part 

of the pre-McNally doctrine of intangible rights. 

It, therefore, makes sense to take a look at 

the theory of intangible rights violation that Mr. Ayer 

very ably argued for the government when he argued the 

McNally case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, I would like 

to ask you about this case particularly: One thing that 

the prosecutor did, one thing that the Ninth Circuit 

did. 

So before we get to your larger theory of 

anything, we have a particular case to deal with. We 

have an Assistant U.S. Attorney who came to the judge 

and said, we have alternate theories of this case. One 

is the quid pro quo theory; the other -- and I am

reading from 42 of the appendix -- is that "a public 

official can be found guilty of honest services fraud, 

irrespective of whether the public official took any act 

thereafter." Just the bare nondisclosure. 

That was what the Assistant U.S. Attorney 

was asking for. 

MR. DREEBEN: That's what the document that 

you are reading from said, Justice Ginsburg. One week 

later, the government filed a clarification of its -- of 

its position in response to Petitioner's briefing of the 

issue, and this appears at pages 68 and 69 of the joint 

appendix. 

And in that filing, the government made 

clear that its theory, consistent with the theory that I 

am arguing here today, is that when the legislator takes 

official action having an undisclosed conflict of 

interest, that's when he violates the honest services 

statute under the nondisclosure theory. 

We are not here to urge that there is a 

general duty of disclosure that is separate and apart 

from any official act that the official takes. We are 

not here to argue that there’s a free-standing Federal 

duty of disclosure that applies in all cases, regardless 

of the other elements of the mail fraud statute. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you must agree that

the Ninth Circuit was wrong, at least in this 

particular -- this -- I'm now reading from 19a. One is 

bribe, and that's -- everyone seems to agree that that 

could come within the statute. 

The second is (2) nondisclosure of 

material information. Period. That's got to be wrong. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that’s -- that’s a shorthand summary of the 

nondisclosure theory. The more accurate summary of the 

government's theory is on page 20a, on the first full 

paragraph that begins with the bracketed 9. 

And it says, "Here, Weyhrauch allegedly 

voted and took other official acts on legislation at the 

direction of VECO while engaged in undisclosed 

negotiations for future legal work from VECO." 

And then it goes on to say, "These 

allegations describe an undisclosed conflict of interest 

and could also support an inference of a quid pro quo.” 

Furthermore, Petitioner --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I have been 

trying to find out what you were referring to on pages 

68 to 69. 

MR. DREEBEN: On the bottom of page 68, 

Justice Scalia, there’s a italicized word, "first." 

And it describes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. DREEBEN: -- the more detailed theory 

that the government is elaborating, and then on page 69, 

it says, quote, "By introducing amendments to and voting 

on legislation that each defendant knew would affect 

Company A, an entity with whom each defendant either had 

or was negotiating for a financial relationship, each 

defendant knowingly breached that duty of disclosure." 

So I think the government tied up the 

nondisclosure to the official act and that the Ninth 

Circuit was not under an incorrect impression about 

that. And more fundamentally, Petitioner says -- I 

believe it's in footnote 6 of his opening brief -- that 

that's not the issue before the Court, how to instruct 

the jury on the duty of disclosure. 

That's an issue that will arise, and I think 

Petitioner's counsel said this to the district court --

it's in a page of the joint appendix that I don't have 

at my fingertips -- that's a matter for jury 

instructions. And we agree. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is an opinion 

that’s going to govern district judges in the Ninth 

Circuit. So I take it that your answer is that 

nondisclosure of material information certainly is not 

enough --

MR. DREEBEN: No, it's not enough, Justice 

Ginsburg, not standing alone. It's when the official 

takes action that furthers his undisclosed interest 

without telling the decision-making body to which he 

belongs that he becomes a fraud. 

It's just like O'Hagan, Justice Ginsburg. 

When O'Hagan, the lawyer, took the information from his 

firm, posed as a loyal employee, the partner who comes 

to work every day just doing his job, it became a fraud 

when he took that information and used it in his own 

securities trading. 

Here, too, this is not a pure nondisclosure 

theory. This is another form of corruption. It's the 

kind of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if he had voted 

against the legislation? 

MR. DREEBEN: If he did not further his 

undisclosed interests, then he does not breach the duty 

that the government alleges. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not merely the 

taking official action; it's taking official action that 

benefits him? 

MR. DREEBEN: Correct. And --

that have a -- an impact on their own financial 

interests or the financial interests of their family or 

associates. 

For example, suppose this -- the Petitioner 

was a practicing attorney. Suppose he’s voting on an 

overhaul of the rules of civil procedure, and some of 

them may benefit him and his practice. Or suppose he’s 

voting on a new tax code, and the provisions may benefit 

him or his family or his associates in a -- in a variety 

of ways. 

Don't you need some kind of a disclosure 

code to separate the things that have to be disclosed 

from the things that don't have to be disclosed, because 

they are just too common? 

MR. DREEBEN: You -- you could do it that 

way, Justice Alito, but the way that the mail fraud 

statute does it is it looks for the kind of personal 

conflicting financial interest that, in the universal 

view of the common law, raised a problem. 

Those are interests that are different from 

the public at large and that are not widely held by a 

large segment of the community.

something that the average citizen who works there just

MR. DREEBEN: I think that when we are 

talking about State legislative officers, when we are 

talking about public officials, they know that they are 

fiduciaries. They have a set of fiduciary obligations. 

But to answer most directly, Justice Breyer, your 

concern, which I believe goes to notice, and whether a 

State legislator can be held criminally liable for 

violating a standard stated as I have just stated it, 

the government must prove in a criminal case an intent 

to defraud. That means that the government must show 

that the defendant sought to deceive the body to which 

he belongs. 

JUSTICE BREYER: He intended not to disclose 

something, right. 

MR. DREEBEN: And that he knew he was 

breaching a duty. He does not need to know the legal 

source of the duty. That’s conventional law as in 

Bryan v. United States. You can know that you are 

acting illegally without knowing that it’s Federal law, 

State law, or local law --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. I see. 

MR. DREEBEN: -- but the government needs to 

show that. And that means that in the typical case, the 

government will point to some external standard, be it a 

State criminal law, a State civil law, and --

sentence because the disclosure obligations are 

confusing, but -- and then the Federal prosecutor comes 

along and says, well, you -- you are going away for 20 

years because this violates 1346. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, we would have to show, 

first of all, that he knew that he was breaching a legal 

duty. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, he knows that 

he should disclose this, and --

MR. DREEBEN: Okay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. DREEBEN: Then my answer is we live in 

a dual system in which citizens are governed by and 

accountable both by their States and by the Federal 

government. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you have no 

problem with the idea that the State law, the source of

the duty to disclose, imposes a penalty of 6 months, 

and the Federal law you say you can still go after him 

not only 20 years but an additional 20 years? 

MR. DREEBEN: But this is fundamental to the 

government's position here, Mr. Chief Justice. It's not 

imposing a criminal penalty for violation of the State 

law duty. There is an independent Federal duty. 

Congress was well aware that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please articulate it 

again for me. I -- I am -- I don't think I'm being 

thick. I’m trying to understand exactly what that duty 

is, because I think I just heard something that doesn't 

make sense to me. You are saying if there’s a State 

duty to disclose, a Federal duty to disclose, if they 

are legal duties, that would violate it, and now 

something else? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, what 

I am trying to say to this Court this morning is that 

what 1346 reinstated was the notion that if fiduciaries 

have a duty not to further their own personal 

conflicting financial interests by taking official 

action, it becomes a Federal crime only when there is 

both materiality and intent to defraud. 

And to prove the intent to defraud element 

that the individual intended to deprive the citizens of

their right of honest services, the government has to 

know -- show that he knew he was breaching a fiduciary 

duty. And the government can do that by offering 

evidence, for example, that State law precluded the 

action that he took -- the underlying action in this 

case by Mr. Weyhrauch was prohibited by State law. 

You are not permitted to vote on legislation 

when you were negotiating for employment. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you right at 

that point: Does the prohibited action, namely, voting 

-- does that vote have to be contrary to -- serve the 

interest of the other party? 

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, it does, Justice Stevens. 

He has to be furthering his undisclosed interest. And 

in this case he did it --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, now -- now think of 

that answer -- complete that answer, if you can. 

MR. DREEBEN: He did it in violation of a 

State substantive duty, and the government's burden 

will be to show he knew he was acting wrongfully. 

And often we will do that by pointing to State law and 

saying he violated State law or he violated an ethics 

code that attached to him as a fiduciary. If not, we 

are going to have to find some evidence of 

circumvention, structuring transactions, nominee

And I say, oh, my goodness, why did you pick these 

three? I mean, I can easily -- I make up comical 

examples because they illustrate the point.

JUSTICE BREYER: But I don’t mean them to be 

comical. Look, think of a person who is really angry at 

his employer and he changes all the direction signs 

around in the building to mislead him so that the 

employer will miss the key meeting and make the wrong 

decision.

this Court needs to worry about that as a type of honest 

services prosecution, because this was a defined

point. I don't believe the way you’ve interpreted the 

statute that you could or would -- could prosecute what 

I just made up as a funny example.

MR. DREEBEN: To say that we picked them

MR. DREEBEN: -- ignores the story of 

McNally. And I think that if I could take a minute to 

walk the Court through the legal history that brought us 

to this, I think it would be helpful. 

Before McNally, there was a body of case law 

that made very clear that there was a substratum 

fiduciary duty -- and I’ll limit this to the public 

official context for now, because that’s the most 

critical and important context. If you look at the 

common law in every State, public officials are 

fiduciaries. The core obligation of a fiduciary is the 

duty of loyalty, the duty not to advance your personal 

interests at the expense of the government who you 

serve. 

That core understanding of the duty of 

loyalty informed the honest services cases that arose in

the courts of appeals, and for the most part, they 

involved, as their core set of violations, bribes, in 

which somebody is selling his office, so he’s clearly 

not serving the public; kickbacks, where the individual 

is profiting at the expense of the government, 

oftentimes in his official capacity, and sometimes not 

profiting at the expense of the government, because the 

government couldn't be harmed in a pecuniary way by the 

kickback; and undisclosed conflicts of interest when the 

official takes action to further that interest. And 

that’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't Congress say 

that instead of -- instead of -- of setting up this mush 

of language that doesn't even mention McNally, does not 

use a phrase that any opinion pre-McNally used? That --

that phrase does not appear, as I understand, it in any 

of the cases. 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice -- Justice Scalia, the 

phrase "intangible rights" is at the center of the 

McNally majority opinion. The language "honest 

services" is in the McNally dissent and in many of the 

pre-McNally opinions. For those --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a citizen 

supposed to do? He’s supposed to go back and read all

attempted to do. But I think that Congress viewed it as

with the recognition that it was understood in its core 

aspects to cover what I have just described. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought there was a 

principle that a citizen is supposed to be able to 

understand the criminal law that was around even before

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the 

principle was that a citizen has to be able to 

understand the law, and if he can't, then the law is 

invalid. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the principle is 

that the Court has recognized -- and it has done so most 

prominently in the Sherman Act and in the civil rights 

statutes, 18 U.S.C., Section 241 and 242, that these are 

broad statutes with general language, and in order to be 

made susceptible of criminal punishment, you need two 

things. 

You need clarifying judicial decisions that 

articulate the rights, and you need a standard of 

scienter that will allow the government to convict only 

those people who are on fair notice and act with a --

the bad purpose --

statutes. I mean, this is an area unto itself, and, 

number two, the Sherman Act explicitly --

"explicitly" -- clearly confers upon courts a common 

law, a common law ability to define the crime. 

And that doesn't appear from this statute. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I wasn't citing the 

Sherman Act as an example of formulating a common law of 

crimes, but there is only one Due Process Clause, 

Justice Scalia, so if it is constitutional to prosecute 

under the civil rights statutes and under the Sherman 

Act, then it is constitutional for this Court to divine 

from the pre-McNally case law principles and to 

articulate them. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the Sherman Act 

criminalizes price fixing. You see, I can say that in 

two words, intentional price fixing. 

Do you think what we have been talking about 

this morning can be reduced to anything like those two 

words? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think I’ve got it down to 

around eight.

in the civil rights area, it may not answer your

know that, in the United States v. Kozminski, the Court 

recognized -- and I am going to quote here -- that, 

"Congress intended the statute to incorporate, by 

reference, a large body of potentially evolving federal 

law." 

And the Court recognized that that was a 

dilemma because you cannot have citizens criminally 

prosecuted for evolving law of which the citizens have 

no notice. And the Court's response was to say that, 

when the right has been made specific by a decision of 

this Court and there’s the requisite level of scienter, 

there is no due process problem in prosecuting --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There’s no such thing as a 

vague law, so long as this Court says, oh, what the 

law -- the law -- it’s absolutely unclear what the law 

means, so long as this Court says, oh, we think the law 

means -- what do you want to pick -- bribery, then --

then it's okay. Right? 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the system we have, 

that Congress can say, nobody shall do any bad things? 

MR. DREEBEN: That's not what this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it comes to this Court, 

and this Court says, bad things means bribery. And that

arguing for, that -- that a law that is, on 

its face, inherently vague can somehow be rendered 

valid to the citizens by a decision of this Court? 

MR. DREEBEN: But that’s common. This 

Court takes common law terms of art, such as fraud, and 

it reads into them elements that are not on their face 

on the basis of the common law. 

Take, for example, 18 U.S.C. 1111, which is 

the federal murder statute. It uses the phrase "malice 

aforethought." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that’s a 

familiar common law term. “Honest services” is not. 

MR. DREEBEN: But it is a term of art that 

had reference to a specific body of case law that could 

not have been given a higher degree of prominence than 

it was by this Court's decision in McNally, which 

acknowledged that body of law, rejected it because it 

said the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible 

rights. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not remembering.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say it was a body 

of law. It wasn't about a body of law. We said it was 

wrong. So Congress is not here referring to some 

established common law crimes at all. 

It's referring to a mistaken series of 

decisions by the courts of appeals. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I can't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's quite different 

from -- from harking back to a common law term, such as 

fraud. 

MR. DREEBEN: In McNally, this Court said 

that body of law was not a valid implementation of the 

mail fraud statute, and it invited Congress to come back 

and legislate if it wanted to protect intangible rights, 

and Congress did that in a way that doesn't have the 

commendable clarity of the statute that you just drafted 

for us, Justice Scalia, but it does refer -- and I 

think, for those members of the Court who read 

legislative history, legislative history was replete 

with references to the key cases on which we rely here, 

such as United States v. Mandel and United

States v. Margiotta. 

And it said this is a term of art. We know 

that this is a term of art. It's been shaped by the 

judiciary, but it doesn't just sit there as a 

pre-standing duty that had no antecedents in the law 

whatsoever. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is that --

that, even if the U.S. attorney got it right in the end, 

if the U.S. attorney could think that all that's 

involved is nondisclosure, even if no action is taken 

thereafter, the U.S. attorney could write that down 

twice, that suggests that this statute is open to a high 

degree of interpretation. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

don't think that the Court should decide whether 

Congress validly accepted this Court's invitation to 

reinstate an important public corruption principle by 

looking to what one United States attorney, one set of 

federal prosecutors said in a pleading that was filed on 

very short notice and that was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's -- it's not --

it's not just one. One of the briefs in one or the 

other of these cases describes the great variety of 

“pushing the envelope” prosecutions that the Justice 

Department has, indeed, pursued, and they are all over

the place. 

And if the Justice Department can't figure 

out what -- what is embraced by this statute, I don't 

know how you can expect the average citizen to figure it 

out. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, this body of law evolved 

post-McNally, without this Court's intervention and 

guidance to provide clarification. I think that the 

core understanding of what honest services is may have 

been strayed from in some of those cases, and some 

courts of appeals affirmed it. 

That doesn't mean that the statute is vague. 

This Court accepted review in Cleveland v. United States 

because the courts of appeals were divided on whether 

defrauding a government agency of a license constituted 

a deprivation of money or property. The U.S. attorneys 

on one side of the split were very aggressively pushing 

that theory. This Court held that it wasn't a valid 

interpretation. 

I think that it's the role of this Court and 

the -- within the proper disposition of this Court's 

authority to attempt to figure out what Congress did, 

and then to implement it in accordance with doctrines 

that are standard tools of the trade here -- rule of 

lenity, concerns about federalism -- and recognize that

there is a core that Congress was looking at in the pre-

McNally cases, and that that core can be implemented 

consistent with concerns about notice and clarity of 

definition, without either creating a statute that is 

totally freeform or without invalidating Congress's 

effort to respond to the Court's invitation in McNally. 

And, if I could turn to the question 

presented in this case, which is whether State law 

duties need to be violated, State law disclosure 

obligations need to be violated in order to sustain a 

valid mail fraud prosecution. 

The pre-McNally cases and McNally itself 

answers that because, in the McNally decision, this 

Court acknowledged that the government's theory of 

prosecution was that McNally and his cohorts were 

accepting kickbacks in the form of commissions on 

insurance contracts. 

And the courts recognized that the 

government's theory was they failed to disclose their 

interest to persons in State government who were in a 

position to take action with respect to that 

information. 

And the Court specifically said: We should 

assume that there was no violation of any State law 

obligations in holding those interests or no violation

of any State law duty to disclose. 

That was the theory of prosecution that the 

Court recognized the government was pursuing, and it was 

entirely consistent with the pre-McNally cases, Mandel 

and Margiotta, which were repeatedly cited in the 

legislative history. 

And I won't take the Court's time to read 

language -- we’ve cited it in our brief -- where those 

cases clearly said no State law duty was required to be 

breached in order to state a prosecution. 

There is still protection in this statute 

against prosecutions of citizens without notice because, 

as I said earlier, the government has to prove a 

violation of the duty to disclose by the officials 

taking action to further his undisclosed personal 

interest, and the citizen cannot be prosecuted and 

convicted without the government being able to show that 

he knew that he was violating a duty to disclose. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let me ask a quick 

question here. I notice, in the Skilling case, the 

first question is whether the statute requires the 

government to prove the defendant's conduct was intended 

to achieve private gain, et cetera, and if not, whether 

the statute is unconstitutionally vague. 

Now, does that first question give the

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, until 

Mr. Skilling files his brief and explains the kind of 

argument that he wants to make, I can't answer you that 

question. All I know is that in one of --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we could 

assume that, if you need time, at that time, you could 

ask for whatever you wanted to ask for? 

MR. DREEBEN: Certainly. And I don't –- the 

government is not shying away from the question of 

vagueness. The question of vagueness has been raised by 

members of this Court as a legitimate concern. 

I think it's a legitimate concern. That is 

why the government has offered to this Court a theory 

based on the prototypical and paradigm pre-McNally cases 

that explains what Congress said when it effectively 

pointed at that body of law and said those are the 

intangible rights that we want to protect. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I have one --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question? You -- you have described the issue in this 

case as not merely a nondisclosure, but as you spell it 

out, it seems to me it is actually a quid pro quo

not made an agreement with VECO that he was going to 

vote the way that VECO wanted him to, and the government 

does allege that, but even if he didn't do that, he knew 

that he had a personal financial interest in securing 

employment with VECO. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you say that in 

order for the violation to be complete, he must follow 

up by voting in the interest of the company rather than 

the polls? 

MR. DREEBEN: He has to take official 

action. That's where the breach of his duty and loyalty 

–-

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it has to be a 

specific kind of official action. 

MR. DREEBEN: Official action that furthers 

his undisclosed interest. And to criminally prosecute 

him, he has to know that’s what he is doing, and just 

to top it off, there are materiality ingredients both in 

the conflict of interest and in the implied 

misrepresentation of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say he violated 

State law? I -- I thought that the -- that the court 

found that he didn't. You say he violated State law

when he voted. 

MR. DREEBEN: Substantive State law 

prohibited him from taking official action with respect 

to a company whose interests would be benefited when he 

was negotiating employment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought they -- I thought 

it was accepted in this case that -- that there was no 

violation of Alaska law. 

MR. DREEBEN: It’s accepted Justice Scalia 

that there’s no duty to disclose under State law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I see. 

MR. DREEBEN: That is solely what Petitioner 

argues as being the deficiency in the government's case; 

there’s no State law duty to disclose. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. DREEBEN: My response is naturally 

there’s no duty under State law to disclose as a matter 

of express State law. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even --

MR. DREEBEN: State laws prohibit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even after he 

discloses he still couldn't vote that way, so he's 

supposed to vote against it even though he thinks it's a 

good thing for the State to do? 

MR. DREEBEN: He's supposed to abstain.

When he has a conflict of interest, he is supposed to 

note that conflict and he's supposed to abstain. And we 

argued --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if a 

public official -- you said in response to Justice 

Stevens that this actionable conduct has to benefit the 

defendant's interest. What if his interest is a 

particular policy contrary to that of his employer? In 

other words, he is a subordinate official. His employer 

says, I want you to do this and this to advance our 

policy. He doesn't like the policy, so he does 

something you can characterize as dishonest that 

undermines the policy or advanced a different policy 

that he agrees with. 

MR. DREEBEN: That's not the sort of theory 

of honest services that we're arguing for, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why? Because it 

doesn't involve tangible --

MR. DREEBEN: A personal, conflicting 

financial interest. It may involve --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Financial.

MR. DREEBEN: That's right. These -- the 

core of public corruption is about adverse pecuniary 

interests or benefits that an official is taking at the 

expense of the citizenry by virtue of his position. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, where does the 

right to honest services say “financial”? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think it says it, 

Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the body of case law 

that involved violations of the right of honest services 

and seeing that that's what the government was after, 

personal conflicting financial interests. 

And this is not a subtle or obscure 

principle of fiduciary law -- if I might finish my last 

sentence. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. DREEBEN: This is a bedrock principle of 

the common law that exists in all 50 States, and the 

mistake that the lower courts made in the pre-McNally 

era was in thinking that the mail fraud statute 

protected it, but there was no obscurity whatever that 

the fiduciaries owe an obligation of undivided loyalty 

to their principal. 

That's what this statute is about. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Now, Mr. Ayer, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor. I have 

four quick points I'd like to make. 

The first one is that McNally is a case --

there were issues about the jury instructions, but the 

basic fact pattern was clear. It was a kickback scheme. 

It was illegal under the Kentucky constitution. There’s 

no question that if it were charged properly, it 

could be convicted, and that's clear I think at page 11 

of our yellow brief. 

The second point I want to make is that this 

talk about whether or not Petitioner violated the 

statute about voting when he was in negotiations --

number one, the first answer to that is the government 

is perfectly free to prove that case if they want to; 

that's not before the Court. That's -- that's a 

different theory that they can pursue. It's not the 

disclosure theory. 

But just by the way, he didn't violate it, 

and the reason he didn't violate it, particularly in 

light of what Mr. Dreeben has said -- first of all we 

don't think he was in negotiations. He sent a letter. 

There was never an offer either way. There weren't 

negotiations, and that's been something that has been

talked about in the court. 

Secondly, he voted; when he voted he 

actually ended up voting twice on the bill in a form 

that -- that VECO didn't want. So he actually -- and I 

learned today -- and this is all, you know, shifting 

sands -- that he has to have voted for the -- the way 

that the conflicting interest would have had him vote. 

So there’s not, I think, a problem there. 

If they want to pursue that, go to it. They have every 

right to. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying that you’ll 

win on the facts, not the theory. 

MR. AYER: Yes. Yes, and they have the 

right --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that’s not what we 

have to decide. 

MR. AYER: -- to pursue it. 

And -- and the third point I want to make is 

-- is that there is absolutely no doubt about this 

question with regard to what -- what the issue was in 

the court below. And I would simply direct a few 

references to the -- and I’ll read them very quickly. 

But 23a -- these are all the district court opinion: 

23a, the district court says he is dealing with the more 

general proposition -- the government's more general

proposition -- that honest services fraud may be proved 

by showing a violation of the duty to disclose. Then on 

29a, the district court says “the proposition advanced 

by the United States, that honest services may be proved 

by establishing that a public official knowingly 

concealed a conflict of interest,” period. 

Then, on 36a, at the end the court says, you 

can bring any other theory you want other than the 

nondisclosure theory. Now, did the government object? 

Did the government at any time say, oh, no, that's not 

our theory? No. They didn't; they adopted that, and 

that's the theory they argued on appeal in the Ninth 

Circuit. And that's exactly the theory that the Ninth 

Circuit talked about when it has these two forms of core 

conduct, one of which is -- is the conduct about failing 

to disclose material information, period. Not in doing 

anything else, just failing to disclose material 

information re a conflict. 

Finally, the government in this Court has 

itself argued the case in a way that I think concedes 

the point. And -- and that is, essentially, if you look 

at the main heading in their brief on page 13, their 

point is -- they finally say this, and then I think they 

contradict themselves elsewhere, but they say in their 

heading a "State official's violation of the honest

services statute by taking official action while

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

We might then say the theory that they described there 

is inadequate. But would we then send the case back and 

say decide it on the theory that Mr. Dreeben has 

explained today? 

MR. AYER: No, I think they made their 

argument. They lost in the trial court. They are 

pursuing this extreme, overreaching theory that -- that 

they only can get to by the -- by the extravagant 

language in the -- in the pre-McNally cases. 

Thank you, Your Honor.

The case is submitted.
